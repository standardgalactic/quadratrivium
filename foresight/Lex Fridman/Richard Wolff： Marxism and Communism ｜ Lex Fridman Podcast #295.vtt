00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
slaves produces surplus which the master gets, serfs produces surplus which the lord gets,

00:06.880 --> 00:16.000
employees produces surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative

00:16.000 --> 00:26.240
class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another

00:26.240 --> 00:34.720
group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,

00:34.720 --> 00:41.280
resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.440
The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff. One of the top Marxist economists and

00:49.440 --> 00:57.360
philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic in general and for me personally given my family

00:57.360 --> 01:04.800
history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism,

01:04.800 --> 01:11.680
and Communism are used to attack and to divide much more than to understand and to learn.

01:11.920 --> 01:20.320
With this podcast I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx as well as

01:20.320 --> 01:27.120
their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries and in general we need to

01:27.120 --> 01:33.840
both steal man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize and to challenge the ideas we

01:33.920 --> 01:40.640
dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant and at times dangerous.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.600
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description

01:47.600 --> 01:55.040
and now dear friends, here's Richard Wolff. Let's start with a basic question but maybe not so basic

01:55.040 --> 02:02.320
after all. What is Marxism? What are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and

02:02.320 --> 02:08.240
political theory and ideology? Well the simplest way to begin the definition would be to say it's

02:08.240 --> 02:20.640
the tradition that takes its founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because these

02:20.640 --> 02:30.480
ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally it's

02:30.560 --> 02:41.440
140 years since Marx died and in that time his ideas have become major types of thinking

02:41.440 --> 02:47.680
in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,

02:49.280 --> 02:56.800
that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.

02:57.520 --> 03:03.120
And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity,

03:03.840 --> 03:11.520
is that the Marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories

03:12.160 --> 03:19.200
and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently

03:19.200 --> 03:26.320
in different places at different times and therefore Marxism as a kind of first flush

03:26.320 --> 03:36.160
definition is the totality of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For

03:36.160 --> 03:46.080
the first roughly 40-50 years Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism.

03:46.880 --> 03:51.040
Marx himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism,

03:51.040 --> 03:58.560
he never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary,

03:58.560 --> 04:03.840
dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism

04:04.560 --> 04:10.160
and that's what Marxism was more or less in its first 40 or 50 years.

04:10.240 --> 04:20.240
The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks.

04:21.120 --> 04:28.720
In 1871 there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to

04:28.720 --> 04:35.120
Bismarck's Germany and in the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working class of

04:35.120 --> 04:43.200
Paris rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian

04:43.200 --> 04:50.880
society and Marx's people, people influenced by Marx were very active in that commune and the

04:50.880 --> 04:56.880
leadership of the commune and Marx wasn't that far away. He was in London, these things were

04:56.880 --> 05:04.080
happening in Paris, you know, that's an easy transport even then and for a short time, very

05:04.080 --> 05:13.280
short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism, it became

05:14.240 --> 05:22.640
a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been implicit, now it became

05:22.640 --> 05:29.840
explicit what is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do and why and in what order,

05:29.840 --> 05:36.720
and in other words governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted a few weeks,

05:37.280 --> 05:43.520
the French army regrouped and under the leadership of people who were very opposed to Marx,

05:44.160 --> 05:51.120
they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the of the communards as they

05:51.200 --> 05:57.680
were called and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the

05:57.680 --> 06:06.240
time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists,

06:06.240 --> 06:16.320
Lenin Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again,

06:16.320 --> 06:25.200
a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation

06:25.200 --> 06:31.200
because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,

06:31.840 --> 06:38.480
Brest-Litovsky and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts. And in that

06:38.480 --> 06:49.600
situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, splits under

06:49.600 --> 06:57.120
the pressures of all of this into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin Trotsky and the

06:57.120 --> 07:03.520
others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short, he's in exile. His position,

07:03.520 --> 07:11.680
Lenin's position, gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be killing

07:11.680 --> 07:17.840
German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into colonies and

07:17.840 --> 07:24.720
Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you can expect,

07:25.360 --> 07:31.680
they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the comparable leader

07:31.680 --> 07:37.520
at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist Party at this point,

07:37.520 --> 07:44.160
that comes later, the head of the Socialist Party, a very important American figure named Eugene

07:44.160 --> 07:50.640
Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not fight in the war.

07:51.680 --> 07:57.200
He has nothing to do with Lenin. I don't even know if they knew of each other, but he does it

07:57.280 --> 08:02.560
on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the way, he runs for

08:02.560 --> 08:09.440
president from jail and does very well. Really, very well, remarkable. And he's the inspiration

08:09.440 --> 08:18.160
for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage politically than Bernie

08:18.160 --> 08:23.840
has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link maybe later. History rhymes.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.960
Yes, the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now

08:30.320 --> 08:38.320
this seizure of power by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx,

08:38.320 --> 08:43.920
developing what you might call a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians

08:43.920 --> 08:52.640
too, but a Russian interpretation, this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism

08:53.120 --> 09:00.960
into a plan at least. What are you going to do in the Soviet Union? A lot of this was then trial

09:00.960 --> 09:06.640
and error. Marx never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant

09:06.640 --> 09:14.000
if he had, because it was 50 years earlier in another country, etc. What begins to happen,

09:14.000 --> 09:20.400
and you can see how this happens then more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on,

09:20.960 --> 09:28.880
is that you have kind of a bifurcation. Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of

09:28.880 --> 09:36.160
capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set, and they differ from one to the other,

09:36.160 --> 09:43.440
a set of notions of what an alternative post-capitalist society ought to look like,

09:43.440 --> 09:49.520
how it ought to work, and there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion,

09:50.800 --> 09:54.720
and I would say that that's still where it is, that you have a tradition now

09:55.360 --> 10:01.840
that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,

10:01.840 --> 10:07.760
and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,

10:07.760 --> 10:14.800
that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society

10:15.680 --> 10:18.880
can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.760
And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.

10:23.760 --> 10:30.960
Fine. So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back,

10:30.960 --> 10:37.360
what do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas

10:37.360 --> 10:42.640
of Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?

10:45.360 --> 10:51.840
Would he shake his head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations?

10:51.840 --> 10:55.760
Like, how do you think he would analyze it? Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if

10:55.760 --> 11:01.040
you've had a chance to take a look at his writing, but he had an extraordinary sense of humor. So

11:01.040 --> 11:06.960
my guess is he would deploy his humor in answering this question, too. He would say some of them are

11:06.960 --> 11:12.080
inspiring, some of the interpretations of his work, and he's very pleased with those.

11:12.080 --> 11:19.200
Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could erase the connection between those things,

11:19.200 --> 11:26.560
and the lineage they claim from him, which he would, there's a German word, I don't know if

11:26.560 --> 11:31.360
he's like, if you speak the other languages, there's a wonderful German word called Verzichter,

11:32.080 --> 11:36.960
and it's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse something,

11:36.960 --> 11:45.520
but with real strong emphasis. Verzichter is a German way of saying, I don't want to do that.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.600
And he would talk then, you know, in philosophical terms, because remember,

11:49.600 --> 11:55.520
he was a student of philosophy. He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy

11:55.520 --> 12:02.560
and all the rest. He would wax philosophical and say, you know, that the ideas you put out are a

12:02.560 --> 12:08.720
little bit like having a child. You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own

12:08.720 --> 12:16.480
person and will find his or her own way. And these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way.

12:16.480 --> 12:21.040
And as you said, there's a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread

12:21.040 --> 12:27.680
throughout the world made it even less able to be sort of stabilized and connected back to the

12:27.680 --> 12:34.080
origins of where the idea came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians

12:34.080 --> 12:40.080
after the revolution, because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they

12:40.080 --> 12:45.600
occupied a position for a while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these

12:45.600 --> 12:51.280
people criticizing capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid-century.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.040
And these were the first guys who pulled it off. They made it. And so there was a kind of presumption

12:59.040 --> 13:07.360
around the world. Their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it.

13:07.360 --> 13:16.720
And so for a while, they could enunciate their interpretation, and it came to be widely grasped

13:17.360 --> 13:23.520
as something which, by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism. The very idea

13:23.520 --> 13:29.520
that you would put that adjective in front of Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian Marxism,

13:29.520 --> 13:36.000
there were these words that where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the

13:36.080 --> 13:41.520
cannon. You can depart from it, but this is the cannon. Before the Russian Revolution,

13:41.520 --> 13:50.400
there was no such thing. And by the 1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time,

13:51.280 --> 13:58.640
30, 40 years, it was a kind of, and the irony is, particularly here in the United States,

13:59.520 --> 14:06.320
where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World War II is so total in this country

14:07.040 --> 14:15.200
that I, for example, through most of my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time

14:16.000 --> 14:23.440
simply explaining to American audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical

14:24.400 --> 14:31.920
is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the cannon before 1917 and hasn't been

14:31.920 --> 14:38.080
since at least the 1960s, but they don't know. It's not that they're stupid and it's not that

14:38.080 --> 14:43.440
they're ignorant. It's that, well, the ignorance may be, but I mean, it's not a mental problem. It's

14:44.160 --> 14:51.600
the taboo, shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way, recaptures what went before

14:52.400 --> 14:59.200
and develops it in new direction, they just don't know. Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at

14:59.200 --> 15:07.200
making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians, the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century

15:07.200 --> 15:12.080
made a serious attempt at saying, okay, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually

15:12.080 --> 15:19.120
build a system like this? And so in that sense, not at a high level, but at a detailed level,

15:19.120 --> 15:24.880
it's interesting to look at those particular schools maybe. Right, because for example,

15:24.880 --> 15:30.080
let me just take your point one step further, you really cannot understand the Cuban revolution,

15:30.080 --> 15:38.080
the Chinese revolution, Vietnamese and the others, because each of them is a kind of

15:39.280 --> 15:46.000
response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets did it. Are you going to do it that way? Well,

15:46.080 --> 15:52.800
yes and no is the answer. This we will do that way, but that we're not going to do. And the

15:52.800 --> 15:58.480
differences are huge, but you could find a thread, I can do that for you if you want,

15:58.480 --> 16:07.520
in which all of them are, in a way, reacting to the originals. Yes, very much so. Like maybe most

16:07.520 --> 16:11.040
of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones. That's something like that.

16:11.680 --> 16:17.840
Well, can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism? So we

16:17.840 --> 16:27.360
got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let's expand out to Maoism. So maybe I could

16:27.360 --> 16:35.360
speak to sort of Leninism and then please tell me if I'm saying dumb things. There's a, I think

16:35.440 --> 16:43.120
for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small, so the Vanguard party, like a small

16:43.120 --> 16:49.680
controlling entity that's like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions. Then for

16:51.280 --> 16:56.400
Stalinism, one interesting, so Stalin's implementation of all of this, one interesting

16:56.400 --> 17:02.720
characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal Marxism to

17:03.040 --> 17:14.160
make it all about nationalism, the strength of nation. So Maoism is different in that it's

17:14.160 --> 17:24.240
focused on agriculture and rural. Then Trotskyism, I don't know except that it's anti-Stalin. I mean,

17:24.240 --> 17:29.200
I don't even know if there's unique philosophical elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those

17:29.200 --> 17:34.720
or something else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about

17:34.720 --> 17:42.240
implementation of Marxism in the real world? Probably the best way to get into this is to

17:42.240 --> 17:48.560
describe something that happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question.

17:50.960 --> 17:57.200
In the early days of Marxist writings, and you know, his life spans the 19th centuries,

17:57.200 --> 18:06.000
born in 1818, dies in 1883. So literally, he lives the 19th century. And you might, I mean,

18:06.000 --> 18:10.240
to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the first two-thirds of his life

18:10.960 --> 18:19.120
as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work. Marx was unusually

18:19.680 --> 18:24.960
scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job and partly because

18:24.960 --> 18:30.960
he was an exile in London, most of his adult life, he worked in the library. I mean, he had a lot of

18:30.960 --> 18:39.680
time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels whose family were manufacturers. And you might say the

18:39.680 --> 18:48.080
first half to two-thirds of his life are about the critique of capitalism. And that was what,

18:48.960 --> 18:55.600
in a broad sense, the audience for his work, Western Europe more or less, was interested in.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.960
That's what they wanted. And he gave that to them. He wasn't the only one, but he was very,

19:00.960 --> 19:12.960
very effective at it. By the last third of his life, he and the other producers of a

19:12.960 --> 19:18.400
anti-capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England, that's a whole other movement,

19:20.160 --> 19:28.480
the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia,

19:28.480 --> 19:34.800
and so on. You put all these together and there was a shift in what the audience,

19:35.360 --> 19:42.640
let's call it a mixture of militant working-class people, on the one hand,

19:43.280 --> 19:49.120
and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.

19:49.120 --> 19:56.640
They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would

19:56.640 --> 20:03.040
like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore,

20:03.040 --> 20:08.800
should we? Why should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point,

20:08.800 --> 20:15.520
the system has to be fundamentally changed. But they didn't go, you might imagine, they

20:15.520 --> 20:20.000
didn't go and say, well, what will that new system looks like? They didn't go that way. What they

20:20.000 --> 20:29.040
did was ask the question, how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have

20:29.040 --> 20:37.760
captured people's minds, people's daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became,

20:38.320 --> 20:45.040
this was already by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency,

20:45.040 --> 20:52.080
the mechanism whereby we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation

20:52.080 --> 20:59.920
focused on seizing the government. See, before that, it wasn't that the government was not a

20:59.920 --> 21:06.480
major interest. If you read Marx's capital, the great work of his maturity, three volumes,

21:06.480 --> 21:11.520
there's almost nothing in the state. I mean, he mentions it, but he's interested in the

21:11.520 --> 21:18.320
details of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by store, office. What's the

21:18.400 --> 21:23.520
structure? The government's secondary for him. But there's also humans within that capitalist

21:23.520 --> 21:31.360
system of there's the working class. That's what he's interested in. Think of it almost

21:31.360 --> 21:36.880
mechanically like the workplace. In the workplace, there are some people who do this and other people

21:36.880 --> 21:42.560
who do that. And they accept this division of authority. And they accept this division of

21:42.560 --> 21:49.040
what's going on here, particularly because he believed that the core economic objective of

21:49.040 --> 21:55.920
capitalism was to maximize something called profit, which his analysis located right there in the

21:56.480 --> 22:01.920
workings of the enterprise. And the government was not the key factor here.

22:01.920 --> 22:09.120
And he was looking at ideas of value. How much is the, how much value does the labor of the

22:09.120 --> 22:15.840
individual workers provide? And that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way?

22:15.840 --> 22:19.760
And so those are the questions of... Right, we'll get to that.

22:19.760 --> 22:23.280
But the government was not part of that picture.

22:23.280 --> 22:29.040
So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this

22:29.040 --> 22:38.400
begins, but it really gets going after he dies. Is this debate among Marxists about the role of

22:38.400 --> 22:45.280
the state? They all agree, nearly all of them agree that you have to get the state. The working

22:45.280 --> 22:54.640
class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism.

22:54.640 --> 23:01.600
When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of

23:01.600 --> 23:11.120
them. And so the government is, in a sense, this key institution captured in Marxist language

23:11.120 --> 23:18.240
by the bourgeoisie, by the by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of

23:18.240 --> 23:26.000
suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way

23:26.000 --> 23:32.720
capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution,

23:32.720 --> 23:41.120
is to create a place where elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage

23:41.920 --> 23:46.960
creates the notion, aha, here's how we're going to... We have to seize the state.

23:47.840 --> 23:54.560
And then that gets agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how to do it. One side says,

23:55.120 --> 24:02.480
you go with the election. You mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism.

24:03.040 --> 24:11.200
And the other side is revolution. Don't do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.320
You can't get there. They've long ago learned how to manipulate

24:17.200 --> 24:23.680
parliaments. They buy the politicians and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be

24:23.680 --> 24:30.640
the way to do it. Revolution gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way.

24:31.200 --> 24:36.800
They didn't do... I mean, they fought in the Duma in the in the parliament, but they didn't.

24:36.800 --> 24:45.040
And this focus on the state, I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time

24:46.000 --> 24:50.720
and if you're interested in the great names, there was a great theorist of the

24:51.680 --> 24:58.880
role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power in Germany named Edward Bernstein.

24:58.880 --> 25:07.520
Very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautzke and Rosa Luxemburg, two other huge

25:07.520 --> 25:13.680
figures in Marxism at the time. And they wrote the articles that everybody reads, but it was a much

25:13.680 --> 25:19.280
broader debate. And by the way, that debate still goes on. Reformism versus revolution.

25:20.080 --> 25:26.240
And in terms of not all that different, I mean, it's adjusted to history, but in terms of different.

25:26.240 --> 25:32.720
Can you comment on where you lean in terms of the mechanism of progress,

25:33.440 --> 25:39.200
reformation versus... I'd rather tell you the historical story. Over and over and over again,

25:39.200 --> 25:45.760
in most cases, the reformists have always won because revolution is frightening, is scary,

25:45.760 --> 25:52.720
is dangerous. And so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant

25:52.720 --> 26:00.160
discussion, not an abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.

26:00.160 --> 26:07.280
I mean, and I'll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the 1930s,

26:07.840 --> 26:14.320
you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States. The greatest shift to the left in

26:14.320 --> 26:23.440
the country's history before or since. Nothing like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing

26:24.000 --> 26:31.360
composed of the labor movement, which went crazy in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions

26:31.360 --> 26:38.320
in the 1930s than at any time before or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time,

26:38.320 --> 26:44.400
the explosion of two socialist parties and a communist party that became very powerful,

26:44.400 --> 26:51.200
and they all worked together, creating a very powerful leftist presence in this country.

26:51.840 --> 26:59.440
They debated in a strategically real way reform or revolution. The reformers were the union people,

26:59.440 --> 27:05.120
by and large, and the communists were the revolutionaries, by and large, because they were

27:05.120 --> 27:10.800
affiliated with the communist international, with Russia and all of that. And in between,

27:10.800 --> 27:17.120
you might say, the two socialist parties. One that was Trotskyist in inspiration, and the other one

27:17.120 --> 27:24.240
more moderate Western European kind of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended

27:24.240 --> 27:30.880
up, the reformists won that debate. There was no revolution in the 1930s here. But there was

27:31.760 --> 27:39.040
a reform that achieved unspeakably great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as

27:39.040 --> 27:45.600
strong as it does, because it achieved in a few years in the 1930s, starting around 1932-3,

27:46.320 --> 27:51.040
social security in this country. We had never had that before. That's the same one we have now.

27:51.680 --> 27:57.760
Unemployment insurance never existed before, that you have till today. Minimum wage for the

27:57.760 --> 28:04.080
first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment that hired 15 million people.

28:04.800 --> 28:09.440
I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.120
So that's the 30s and the 40s.

28:11.120 --> 28:18.160
30s, not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's the best part. It was paid for by

28:18.160 --> 28:24.160
taxes on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the government,

28:24.160 --> 28:32.160
the joke is, I have to teach American history to Americans because it has been erased from

28:32.160 --> 28:37.600
consciousness. We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of

28:37.600 --> 28:43.920
the 20th century with the Russians. Right, with the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.

28:44.720 --> 28:53.040
Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries. We

28:53.040 --> 29:01.120
seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state and socialism is when the working class

29:01.840 --> 29:09.120
captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses its power over the state to make

29:09.120 --> 29:16.880
the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward. And again, make a long

29:16.880 --> 29:23.680
story short in the interest of time. What happens, which is not unusual in human history, is that

29:23.680 --> 29:31.440
the means becomes the end. In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear before he doesn't live very

29:31.440 --> 29:38.800
long, he dies in 23. So he's only in power from 17 to 22. But at that time, he has his brain

29:38.800 --> 29:46.080
in trouble. 1923, by the way, not at age 23. 1923. Yeah, he's only there for four or five years.

29:46.880 --> 29:52.080
He's very clear. He even says, I've done work on that. I've published, so I know this stuff.

29:52.880 --> 29:58.400
He says in a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state,

29:59.120 --> 30:04.320
but we don't have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards that.

30:06.960 --> 30:12.800
With Stalin, Lenin dies and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky loses the

30:12.800 --> 30:19.120
fight. He's exiled. He goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power and does all the things he's

30:19.120 --> 30:29.200
famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a decision. I mean, not that he

30:29.200 --> 30:36.000
makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that they do the following. They declare that

30:36.000 --> 30:45.920
they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state, not when the

30:45.920 --> 30:54.400
state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other things. No, no. The state itself, once you have it,

30:55.040 --> 31:02.560
is socialism. So when a socialist captures the state, that's socialism. Exactly. That's exactly

31:02.560 --> 31:08.240
right. I feel like that's definitionally confusing. Well, it shouldn't be because I'll give you an

31:08.240 --> 31:14.800
example. Yeah. If you go to many parts of the United States today and you ask people, what's

31:14.800 --> 31:19.920
socialism? They'll tell you, they'll look you right in the face and they'll say, the post office.

31:21.200 --> 31:27.920
And you know, when I first heard this as a young man, you know what? The post office. It took me a

31:27.920 --> 31:35.840
while to understand the post office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States

31:35.840 --> 31:44.480
where the government runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government

31:44.480 --> 31:50.960
doesn't run it. If a private individual who's not a government official runs it, well,

31:50.960 --> 31:58.080
then it's capitalism. If the government takes it, then it's socialism. So what is wrong with that

31:58.640 --> 32:04.320
reasoning? So the idea, I think... There's nothing wrong with it. It's a way of looking at the world.

32:04.400 --> 32:09.680
It's just got nothing to do with Marx. Well, there's Marx, there's Marxism. Let's try to

32:09.680 --> 32:21.600
pull this apart. So what role does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned

32:22.560 --> 32:30.560
with this class struggle, with respecting the working class. What is the connection

32:31.120 --> 32:37.040
between that struggle and central planning that is often... Central planning is often associated

32:37.040 --> 32:46.320
with Marxism. So a centralized power doing allocation. So that has to do with a very specific

32:46.320 --> 32:51.840
set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union. Has nothing to do with Marx. How else can

32:51.840 --> 32:58.720
you do... I don't think you can find anywhere in Marxist writing anything about central planning

32:58.720 --> 33:09.280
or any other kind of planning. Again, fundamentally, then Marx's work has to do with factories,

33:09.280 --> 33:16.400
with workers, with the bourgeoisie, and the exploitation of the working class.

33:17.280 --> 33:23.520
You still have to take that leap. What is beyond capitalism? Right. So maybe we should

33:23.520 --> 33:30.880
turn to that. Focus on that. Okay. We've already looked historically at several attempts

33:30.880 --> 33:36.800
to go beyond capitalism. How else can we go beyond capitalism? Let me push it a little further.

33:37.360 --> 33:43.600
They didn't succeed in my judgment as a Marxist. And I'm now going to tell you why they didn't

33:43.600 --> 33:48.480
succeed because they didn't understand as well as they could have or should have

33:49.200 --> 33:54.160
what Marxist was trying to do. I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time

33:54.160 --> 33:59.600
under their circumstances. This is not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding

33:59.600 --> 34:06.400
what's going on. All right. So give you an example. Most of my adult life, I have taught

34:06.400 --> 34:14.240
Marxian economics. I'm a professor of economics. I've been that all my life. I'm a graduate of

34:14.240 --> 34:21.280
American universities. As it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its

34:21.280 --> 34:28.720
best universities. With another conversation, you and I can have. So I went to Harvard,

34:28.720 --> 34:34.320
then I went to Stanford, and I finished a Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education.

34:35.040 --> 34:42.000
They tried very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League, 20 semesters,

34:42.000 --> 34:50.320
one after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word

34:50.320 --> 34:58.160
about Marxism. That is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one

34:58.160 --> 35:04.560
professor in Stanford in the one semester I studied with him. He gave me plenty to read,

35:04.560 --> 35:09.280
but nobody else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past, and that's

35:09.280 --> 35:18.640
very true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually through

35:18.640 --> 35:26.160
this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it. Perhaps we can discuss historically

35:26.160 --> 35:32.880
why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case. So Marxian economics, did Karl Marx come up in

35:32.880 --> 35:40.400
conversation as a kind of dismissal? The best example, yeah, he came up only as an

35:40.400 --> 35:46.480
object of dismissal. For example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with,

35:46.480 --> 35:53.760
and that was for many years, the canonical book, isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a

35:53.760 --> 36:00.400
professor of economics at MIT named Paul Samuelson. And people kind of, you know, a whole generation

36:00.400 --> 36:07.120
or two were trained on his textbook. If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree,

36:08.080 --> 36:15.120
and the tree is Adam Smith and David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of

36:15.120 --> 36:21.040
it. He's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing developed. And it's a tree,

36:21.040 --> 36:26.800
and everybody on it is the bourgeois. And then there's this one little branch that goes off like

36:26.800 --> 36:32.560
this and sort of starts heading back down. That's Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it

36:32.560 --> 36:38.800
complete because he's not a complete faker. But beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book

36:38.800 --> 36:46.240
gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that's cold war. I mean, that's really,

36:46.800 --> 36:51.600
that's really neat to hear. That's the craziness. Yeah, that's the cold war in this country. My

36:51.600 --> 36:56.560
professors were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help.

36:57.760 --> 37:04.240
Marx was interested in the relationship of people in the process of production,

37:04.240 --> 37:09.680
that he's interested in the factory, the office, the store. What goes on, and by that he means,

37:09.680 --> 37:16.320
what are the relationships among the people that come together in a workplace?

37:16.880 --> 37:27.760
And what he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately

37:27.760 --> 37:36.560
understood and that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation.

37:36.560 --> 37:43.840
And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation, which he defines mathematically in the following

37:43.840 --> 37:52.640
way. Whenever in a society, any society, you organize people, adults, not the children,

37:52.640 --> 37:59.760
not the sick, but you know, healthy adults. In the following way, a big block of them,

37:59.760 --> 38:06.320
a clear majority, work. That is, they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature.

38:06.320 --> 38:13.280
A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater, whatever. In every human community,

38:13.280 --> 38:20.960
Marx argues, there are the people who do that work, but they always produce more chairs,

38:20.960 --> 38:26.720
more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume. Whatever their standard of

38:26.720 --> 38:32.160
living doesn't have to be low, it can be medium, it can be hard, but they always produce more

38:32.720 --> 38:39.600
than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he writes this, uses the German

38:39.600 --> 38:48.160
word mehr, M-E-H-R, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the more. That more got badly

38:48.160 --> 38:55.920
translated into the word surplus. Shouldn't it have been? But it was. By the way, by German

38:55.920 --> 39:00.320
and English people doing the translations. What's the difference between more and surplus?

39:00.320 --> 39:07.360
Is there a nuanced? Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary, it's sort of extra.

39:08.240 --> 39:12.560
He's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation.

39:12.560 --> 39:18.400
Yes, very simple. One minus the other. Yes. x minus y minus.

39:18.960 --> 39:25.920
x is the total output, y is the consumption by the producer, therefore x minus y equals s the

39:25.920 --> 39:35.760
surplus. Exactly. Now Marx argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following

39:35.840 --> 39:44.880
question. Who gets the surplus? Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by

39:44.880 --> 39:52.640
those who made it? And Marx's answer is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society.

39:52.640 --> 40:00.960
How is that organized? For example, who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it

40:01.520 --> 40:07.760
in exchange for getting it? What's their social role? For example, here we go now. If you get this

40:07.760 --> 40:15.760
and you get the core of it anyway. And I don't charge much. The workers themselves could get it.

40:15.760 --> 40:22.240
Western lawyers. That's right. The workers themselves could get it. That's the closest

40:22.240 --> 40:30.400
Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus

40:31.280 --> 40:38.720
together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets it, but more

40:38.720 --> 40:44.480
importantly, who gets to decide who gets it? Well, who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with

40:44.480 --> 40:52.000
it. Right. Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it. So the logic of the

40:52.000 --> 40:59.920
word sequence, it's produced, Marx uses the word appropriated, in other words, whose property,

41:00.480 --> 41:05.120
who gets to decide, if you like, what happens, all that property ever meant,

41:05.120 --> 41:10.080
is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of communism.

41:10.080 --> 41:14.960
Right. And that's it. By the way, it's not just clean. It's the only one.

41:14.960 --> 41:19.440
So what's, can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?

41:20.160 --> 41:27.760
Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced

41:27.760 --> 41:34.560
is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus

41:34.560 --> 41:42.080
which the master gets, serfs produce a surplus which the Lord gets, employees produce a surplus

41:42.080 --> 41:50.960
which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures,

41:50.960 --> 42:00.160
because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people,

42:00.880 --> 42:08.640
not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment,

42:08.640 --> 42:15.920
and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor,

42:15.920 --> 42:22.080
simple metaphorical story. You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park,

42:22.080 --> 42:27.520
a few blocks from here. It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those

42:27.520 --> 42:33.360
men with an ice cream truck comes by, ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling, your children see the ice cream,

42:33.360 --> 42:39.520
daddy, get me an ice cream. So you walk over, you take some money and you get two ice cream cones

42:39.520 --> 42:45.760
and you give them to one of the children. The other one begins to scream and yell and how,

42:46.560 --> 42:52.720
obviously, what's the issue? And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order

42:53.600 --> 42:58.000
the one you gave the two ice cream cones to, give one of those to your sister or your brother or

42:58.000 --> 43:05.600
whatever it is, and that's how you solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says,

43:06.400 --> 43:12.640
you know, you didn't fix it by what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place.

43:14.480 --> 43:20.880
My response, though you understand, all of the efforts to deal with inequality in

43:21.680 --> 43:28.320
economic, political, cultural, these are all giving the ice cream cone back to the kid you should,

43:28.320 --> 43:30.640
you should never do this in the first place.

43:30.640 --> 43:34.320
The reallocation of resources creates bitterness and populace.

43:34.320 --> 43:40.000
Look at our, we've, this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my

43:40.000 --> 43:45.840
life and I've lived here all my life and I've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself apart

43:45.840 --> 43:53.600
and it's tearing itself apart basically over the re-division, the redistribution of wealth,

43:53.600 --> 44:00.800
having so badly distributed in the first, but that's all in Marx. And notice as I explain to you

44:00.880 --> 44:07.120
what is going on in this tension-filled production scene in the office, the factory, the store.

44:07.120 --> 44:10.720
I don't have to say a word about the government. I'm not interested in the government.

44:10.720 --> 44:17.360
The government's really a very secondary matter to this core question and here comes the big point.

44:18.480 --> 44:27.280
If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter and substitute

44:27.280 --> 44:33.680
a government official without changing the relationship, you know, you can call yourself

44:33.680 --> 44:39.280
a Marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point of the Marxism. The point was not who

44:39.280 --> 44:45.680
the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se. You've got to change the organization of the

44:45.680 --> 44:52.160
workplace so there isn't a group that makes all the decisions and gets the surplus vis-a-vis

44:52.160 --> 44:58.880
another one that produces it. If you do that, you will destroy the whole project. You will,

44:58.880 --> 45:05.200
not only will you not achieve what you set out to get, but you'll so misunderstand it that you,

45:05.200 --> 45:11.440
the Germans again have a phrase, it's get chief. It goes crooked. It doesn't go right. The project

45:11.440 --> 45:18.560
gets off the rails because it can't understand either what its objective should have been and

45:18.560 --> 45:24.000
therefore it doesn't understand how and why it's missing its objective. It just knows that this

45:24.000 --> 45:29.520
is not what it had hoped for. I mean, there's a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is

45:32.400 --> 45:38.480
to what degree, so there's human nature, to what degree does Communism,

45:40.240 --> 45:46.320
a lack of exploitation of the working class naturally emerge if you leave two people together

45:46.400 --> 45:51.440
in a room and come back a year later? If you leave five people together in a room,

45:51.440 --> 45:57.120
if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people, it seems that humans form hierarchies

45:58.640 --> 46:06.080
naturally. So the clever, the charismatic, the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you

46:06.080 --> 46:16.080
define that, start becoming a leader and start to do maybe exploitation in a non-negative sense

46:16.080 --> 46:23.120
a more generic sense starts to become an employer, not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human.

46:23.120 --> 46:28.000
Here, you go do this and in exchange, I will give you this, just becomes the leadership role.

46:29.120 --> 46:35.760
So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice. The idea sort of of Communism would be nice to

46:37.120 --> 46:41.360
not steal from the world. It's nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because of human

46:41.360 --> 46:48.000
nature. Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human

46:48.000 --> 46:55.360
nature to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding in no particular order.

46:55.360 --> 47:03.840
Here's some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell, is a history in which

47:03.840 --> 47:18.720
a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise and as they do, they rule out some kinds

47:18.720 --> 47:23.760
of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially disruptive and unacceptable.

47:25.520 --> 47:31.840
The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct? Is there some human nature

47:31.840 --> 47:38.800
that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is, this has to be repressed or else we don't

47:38.800 --> 47:46.720
have a society. And Freud helps us to understand that that repression is going on all the time

47:46.720 --> 47:52.240
and it has consequences. It's not a finished project. You repress it. It's gone. It doesn't

47:52.240 --> 47:58.080
work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of people together at some point,

47:58.080 --> 48:05.360
they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to want the other person or persons

48:05.920 --> 48:13.040
to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to do that. We just don't.

48:14.960 --> 48:21.680
Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it

48:22.400 --> 48:30.000
on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every

48:30.000 --> 48:37.120
effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you

48:37.120 --> 48:44.240
endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological community that

48:44.240 --> 48:50.480
has ever been studied, slavery wherever it's existed. I can show you endless documents in

48:50.480 --> 48:56.880
which the defenders of those systems, not all of them of course, but many defenders used that

48:56.880 --> 49:04.160
argument to naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,

49:04.160 --> 49:11.520
to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.

49:12.320 --> 49:19.440
And therefore capitalism since it was born and since it's been developing, we all know what the

49:19.520 --> 49:26.720
next stage of capitalism is. Looking in fur. The burden is on the people who think it isn't going

49:26.720 --> 49:31.280
to die. Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,

49:31.920 --> 49:37.040
you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep using

49:37.040 --> 49:42.720
that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive systems.

49:43.360 --> 49:51.600
That said, well let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about the argument that

49:51.600 --> 50:01.920
sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk? So the versus the employee who's just there

50:01.920 --> 50:10.560
doing the labor, the capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not in sort of

50:10.560 --> 50:16.000
aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort hiring a lot of people? Aren't they

50:16.000 --> 50:22.560
taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure? So first of all, there's risk almost

50:22.560 --> 50:29.280
in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and ends in the future takes a risk

50:29.280 --> 50:33.680
that between now and that future something's going to happen that makes it not work out.

50:34.320 --> 50:41.840
I mean, I got into a cab before I came here today in order to do this with you. I took a risk. The

50:41.840 --> 50:46.400
cab could have been in an accident, the lightning could have hit us, a bear could have eaten my

50:46.400 --> 50:51.600
left foot. Who the hell knows? Should I reward you for the risk you took? No, hold it a second.

50:51.600 --> 50:57.840
Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always found it wonderful. You talk about

50:57.840 --> 51:03.600
risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk. Let's go with the worker

51:03.600 --> 51:12.400
and with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to take

51:12.400 --> 51:20.080
that job. He had, he made a decision to have children. They are teenagers. They're now in school

51:20.080 --> 51:25.040
at a time when their friendships are crucial to their development. You're going to yank them

51:25.040 --> 51:33.120
out of the school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk to do that job every day,

51:33.920 --> 51:40.000
to forestall all the other things he could have done. He was taking a risk that this job would

51:40.000 --> 51:47.520
be here tomorrow, next month, next year. He bought a house which Americans only do with mortgages,

51:47.520 --> 51:53.600
which means he's now stuck. He has to make a monthly payment. If you make a mistake,

51:54.240 --> 51:59.520
you capitalist. He's the one who's going to, you're a capitalist. You got a lot of money,

51:59.520 --> 52:06.640
otherwise you wouldn't be in that position. You've got a cushion. He doesn't. If you investigate,

52:06.640 --> 52:10.480
you'll see that in every business I've ever been in. I've been involved in a lot of them.

52:10.480 --> 52:14.400
So you think it's possible to actually measure risk or as your basic argument is there's risk

52:14.400 --> 52:19.760
involved in a lot of both the working class and the bourgeoisie, the capitalist, and it's very

52:20.640 --> 52:25.040
difficult. The worker would never come and say, because he's been taught right,

52:26.960 --> 52:35.680
I want this payment, a wage for the work I do, and I want this page, this payment,

52:35.680 --> 52:41.040
for the risk I take. Well, there's some level of communication like that. You have acknowledgement

52:41.040 --> 52:45.520
of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary, all those kinds of things.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.840
But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.

52:50.720 --> 52:57.200
You don't believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an

52:57.200 --> 53:04.000
army of workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's

53:04.000 --> 53:12.640
killing us. We get paid shit and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds

53:12.720 --> 53:18.960
of the defenders of capitalism between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on

53:18.960 --> 53:24.800
the one hand and the wage. Let me give you just a couple of examples, because this is my job.

53:24.800 --> 53:32.400
This is my life, what I do. The median income of a child care worker in the United States

53:32.400 --> 53:41.520
right now as we speak is $11.22 an hour median. So 50% make less, 50% make more.

53:42.320 --> 53:50.240
The median income for car park attendant is several dollars per hour higher than that.

53:50.880 --> 53:57.840
What does the car park attendant do? He stares at your car for many hours to make sure that nobody

53:57.840 --> 54:06.720
comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it and moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure

54:06.720 --> 54:13.600
that I know of that makes any rational sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four

54:13.600 --> 54:20.400
year olds who are at the key moment of mental formation the first five years, to give that a

54:20.400 --> 54:27.040
lower salary than you give the guy who watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it.

54:28.320 --> 54:34.720
Gender explains all kinds of issues. The car park people are males and the day the child care

54:34.720 --> 54:41.120
people are females and that in our culture is a very big marker of what, but the one who said

54:41.120 --> 54:48.160
only the economics professor, nobody else says this stuff because in economy, I don't know if

54:48.160 --> 54:53.920
you are familiar with our profession, but we have something which we call marginal product.

54:53.920 --> 55:01.360
This is a, this is a fantasy. I was a mathematician before I became an economist. I loved mathematics.

55:01.920 --> 55:08.400
I specialized in mathematics. So I know mathematics pretty well. What economists do is silly,

55:08.400 --> 55:18.960
is childish, but they think it's mathematics. But think for a minute what it means to suggest

55:18.960 --> 55:25.920
that you can identify the marginal product of a factor of production, like a worker.

55:26.800 --> 55:32.080
In the textbook, when it's taught, I've taught this stuff. I hold my nose, but I teach it.

55:32.080 --> 55:37.040
Then I explain to students what I've just taught you is horseshit, but first I teach it.

55:37.040 --> 55:39.440
What is the marginal product if it might be useful to say?

55:39.440 --> 55:45.440
The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the

55:45.440 --> 55:51.520
diminution of the output? That's the marginal product of that worker.

55:51.520 --> 55:55.920
Measured by- The amount of the output that diminishes-

55:56.880 --> 56:00.160
Output of the raw product, of the product.

56:00.160 --> 56:04.400
Usually in real terms, so physical, not the value. You could do a value,

56:04.400 --> 56:06.240
but it's really more the physical you're at.

56:06.240 --> 56:12.160
I mean, there is a transformation thing. I'd love to talk to you about value. It's so

56:12.160 --> 56:13.680
interesting. What is value?

56:13.680 --> 56:18.000
I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that, but I just want to get to the

56:18.560 --> 56:25.840
that Hegel, who is Marx's teacher, has a famous line. You can't step in this in the same river

56:25.840 --> 56:32.560
twice. The argument is you and the river have changed between the first and the second time.

56:32.560 --> 56:37.040
So it's a different you and it's a different river. You can choose not to pay attention to that.

56:37.040 --> 56:42.000
Just you can't claim you're not doing that. You can't claim that you can actually do that,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.960
because you can't. There is no way to do that.

56:44.960 --> 56:51.200
So the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation

56:51.200 --> 56:55.520
of the effect that it has on the output. That's right, because too many other things are going on,

56:55.520 --> 57:02.560
too many things are changing, and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome

57:02.560 --> 57:09.440
on the output side is uniquely determined by the change you made on the input side.

57:09.440 --> 57:10.240
Can't do that.

57:10.240 --> 57:14.080
Even in the average, it's not going to work out.

57:14.080 --> 57:20.720
You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,

57:20.720 --> 57:26.240
Keteris Paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did.

57:26.240 --> 57:30.160
You held everything. You know why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world.

57:30.160 --> 57:36.480
That's not possible. You better account for that. Otherwise, you're mistaking the abstraction

57:36.480 --> 57:40.960
from the messy reality you abstracted from to get the abstraction.

57:41.920 --> 57:47.600
As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment or an actual experiment

57:47.600 --> 57:52.160
of removing every single economist from the world, would we better off or worse off?

57:52.160 --> 57:52.960
Much better off.

57:52.960 --> 57:59.680
Okay. Economics, and I'm one. I'm talking about myself. See, economics-

57:59.680 --> 58:03.840
We're going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how the world works off.

58:03.840 --> 58:11.760
No, but the serious part of this is that economics, you know, it's really about capitalism.

58:11.760 --> 58:15.120
Economics as a discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing.

58:15.920 --> 58:19.200
When I teach, I teach courses at the university, for example, called

58:19.200 --> 58:24.480
History of Economic Thought, right? And I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.

58:25.520 --> 58:28.320
And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things,

58:28.880 --> 58:35.040
but they never called it economics. It made no sense to people to abstract

58:36.720 --> 58:43.280
something as central to daily life as economics broadly defined. It made no sense.

58:43.280 --> 58:48.480
That's a creation much, much later. That's capitalism that did that, created the feeling.

58:48.480 --> 58:53.360
So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them particular passages.

58:54.240 --> 59:00.640
By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it, Plato and Aristotle talked about markets

59:00.640 --> 59:06.720
because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were beginning to intrude

59:06.720 --> 59:14.480
upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena that we're not just producing

59:14.480 --> 59:19.280
goods and then distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid pro quo. You know, I'll give

59:19.280 --> 59:25.200
you three oranges. You give me two shirts, a market exchange. And both Aristotle and Plato

59:26.080 --> 59:33.680
hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason, they destroy social cohesion. They destroy

59:33.680 --> 59:39.520
community. They make some people rich and other people poor, and they set us against each other,

59:39.520 --> 59:44.880
and it's terrible. And that's what they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on. One of them

59:45.680 --> 59:52.240
said, okay, there can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says,

59:52.240 --> 59:58.640
no, no, no, no, no, no. Too late for that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid

59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.840
of this institution that has crawled in amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:14.160
But what we can do is control it, regulate it, get from the market what it does reasonably well,

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.880
and prevent it from doing the destructive things it does so badly.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.200
So the fundamentally, the destructive thing of a market is the engine of capitalism. So

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:34.160
it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an institution

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:40.880
that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:44.720
is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.880
Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.360
And this was that God said, if there's a person who needs to borrow from you,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.760
then that's a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do is to help him,

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:15.120
to demand an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is God hates you for that.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.480
That's a sin. Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:26.640
But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:35.520
intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able to create a system that involves

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:45.840
thousands, millions of humans. And there'd be some level of safe, self-regulating fairness.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:52.240
There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.920
I wonder what... I guess...

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.200
Suppose you were interested in having, suppose you took us your problem,

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.560
we have a set of funds that can be loaned out.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.920
People don't want to consume it. They're ready to lend it. Okay.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:13.520
To whom should they lend it? Well, we could say in our society,

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.400
we're going to run this the way professors in institutions like MIT work this.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.080
They write up a project. They send the project in to some government office

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.200
where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government decides we're

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:40.320
going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in our society. We're in

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.280
greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend money to

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.960
people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here because we're

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:58.240
going to... But instead, what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate? Whoa, what do you do?

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:05.760
What ethics would justify you do it? It's like a market in general. Something is in shortage.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.400
All markets are about how to handle shortage. That's one basic way to understand it.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.080
And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word shortage

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.680
means, has no other meaning. If the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you've got a

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:28.560
problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough supply. You have

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:34.000
a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who have a lot of

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.200
money to bid up the price of whatever's short. That solves your problem because as the price

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.440
goes up, the poor people can't... They drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.520
So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people with the most money. At this

01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:00.800
point, most human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.240
because it contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say,

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.920
what? You know what that means? It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.040
and give it to their cat while the poor person has no milk for their five children.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.320
There it is. Do you want to mark it? Why?

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:26.560
Over the fundamental thing that seems unfair, there's the resulting inequality now.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.280
Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality. Yes, it is.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.480
What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:44.800
to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:53.360
Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.760
but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life,

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:07.920
to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.440
that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:22.480
Not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.760
but just observing historically. Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:34.240
that seemed to have made life easier and better on average. What do you say to that?

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:42.960
I have several responses to that, but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:48.880
going on there. But let me give you the argument so that you can hear them and then you can evaluate

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:58.800
them as can anybody who's listening or watching. Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:05.840
central arguments was that everything that exists, exists, quote, in the contradiction.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.960
In simple English, there's a good and bad side if you like to everything,

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:17.360
and you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the good

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:21.200
things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the other side of the

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:29.760
good one, et cetera. The dialectic. Yes, exactly. Marx very attentive to that explicitly agrees

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:36.320
with this on many occasions and applies it, of course, to the central object of his research,

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:44.160
capitalism. This is not a simple-minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.600
as if there were nothing that this system achieved or accomplished. One of the things he

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:59.200
celebrates a lot is the technological dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound,

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:05.920
because he lived at the time when major breakthroughs in textile technology, in mining,

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:16.880
in chemistry, and so on were achieved. But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:22.400
for the improvement in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people,

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:31.520
Marx now comes back and says, oh, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:41.680
has been mostly represented by capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:50.560
with very few exceptions, some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the lives

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:58.480
of the mass of people. The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What that means is

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:04.880
replace a worker with a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap China,

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.040
bring in desperate immigrants from other parts of the world, because they will work for less

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.640
money than the folks that you have here at home. Every measure to help the standard of living

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:24.720
of American workers had to be fought for for decades over the opposition of capitalists

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.800
from the beginning to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was past 19,

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.960
middle of the 1930s, when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together,

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:44.720
they don't want, and today, just a factoid for you. The last time the minimum wage was raised

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.680
in the United States, federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty sum

01:08:51.680 --> 01:09:01.840
of $7.25 an hour, which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is,

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:08.720
not 11, 12, 13 years since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:15.360
every year, and in the last year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up,

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:23.600
the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom,

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:36.320
of growing inequality. This is the nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:41.920
credit for the improvement in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:49.440
generation. You know, it takes your breath away. It's an argument, whoa. But I take my hat off if

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:58.000
I had one, because that is one of the only ways to justify this system. Long ago, let me get the

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:07.360
heart of it, long ago, capitalism could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease,

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:14.240
could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now, but it didn't. And that's the worst

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:23.600
moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify that when you could, you didn't?

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.120
Look, let me get at it another way, because this may interest you anyway.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:37.280
The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic, it is. And along the way,

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.320
it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better, no question.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:50.960
But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:59.520
capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous, and I can give you a, because you

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:06.400
do math, you'll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which you have

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.200
$100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:20.080
and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers, and he puts them all together,

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:26.960
and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something at one of the prices,

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:35.120
and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:42.080
let's say the revenue is, it doesn't really matter, it's 120, for lack of a better word,

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:49.520
220, sorry. And he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.800
another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other 20 is his profit and he puts

01:11:54.800 --> 01:12:02.880
that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough, a machine, a new machine. And the

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:12.160
new machine is so effective, you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.800
So you don't need to spend 100 on workers, you only need to spend 50. You can do it with half

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.920
the workers. And so the capitalist goes to the workers, by the way this happens every day,

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.600
and he says to half of them, you're fired. Don't come back Monday morning, I don't need you.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:37.600
It's nothing personal, I got a machine. Why does he do that? Because the 50 he now no longer has

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.720
to spend on labor, because it doesn't need half of them, he keeps. Everything else is the same,

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:49.680
the machine, everything else is just to make their math easy. So he keeps as his own profit

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:57.280
the 50 that before he paid for those workers. Because when he sells it for 220, that 50 he

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.760
don't have to give to the next job until he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:11.280
leads, he's happy. He's become more profitable. He's got an extra 50, which is why he buys the

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:19.360
machine. The workers are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.720
husband and wife, tell them I don't have a job anymore. I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:30.720
nice enough to say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need them. So I'm completely screwed

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.840
here. I don't know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.680
education or whatever else he's got going for himself. All right, now, now the point. There was

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:47.200
of course an alternative path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers,

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.080
pay them exactly the same that you did before for half a day's work.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:59.200
You would have got the same output, same revenue, same profit as before.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:07.840
But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day of the lives

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:16.240
of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this technology,

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.920
but instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of more money.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:30.880
You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.520
So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation of

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:44.720
this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to ideas of what

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.920
the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative? So you just kind

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:57.120
of as a opposite by contrast showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work less,

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:05.760
get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other interests,

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:14.400
the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen and

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:21.920
embolden the basic humanity that's under all of us. Yes, but then what cost does that have

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:32.960
on the deadline fueled, competition fueled machine of technological innovation

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:39.200
that is the positive side of capitalism? It slows it down. It slows it down and the question is

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:46.960
which is more important for the flourishing of humanity? I agree with that and I'd love there

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:55.680
to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it, let's debate it and then let's decide what

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.960
mixture, because it's not either or, the math problem I gave you is either or we could mix it,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.080
you could have a third less of a working day instead of a half less and then the other part

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:11.600
would be extra profit for our employer, et cetera. So let's have a democratic discussion

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:19.200
of what is the mix between the positive and we have no such thing. All of this is decided by

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.720
one side in this debate, which not only we know what they do, they always choose the one that

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:29.440
maximizes their profit because that's what they were told to do in business school where I've

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:37.200
taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision, but it's lopsided to boot. So we don't have the

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:43.920
opportunity, but I would love for us to be good Hegelian Marxists and say let's take a look at

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.240
the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can. We'll make mistakes, but we'll all

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:57.200
make them together. It won't be one of us making a dictatorial decision. Marx developed the notion

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.800
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, not as a notion of how government is not, I'm sorry, not

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:08.160
Marx, Lenin did that, not as a notion of how the government works, but as a notion of what the

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:15.760
practical reality is. The dictatorship of these key decisions is not made by some sitting council,

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:21.840
it's made by each little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace,

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:27.760
which is why Marx focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.440
now so it doesn't lurk in the background what the alternative is. Let's go there. Okay. It goes

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:40.720
right back to what I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees together

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:49.280
appropriate their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it,

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:56.240
which includes the decision of whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:05.920
to use the machine and the savings it might allow to be handled by more leisure for themselves

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:16.800
or as a fund for new developments in technology or new products or whatever they want. And you

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:22.480
this is an old idea in human. Marx loved that. Toward the end of his life, he

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:29.760
started reading extensively in anthropology. And one of the reasons he did that toward the end of

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:35.360
his life was because he kept discovering that in this society and that, including here in the

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:44.000
United States, that there were examples of people who organized their production in precisely this

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:52.480
way as a collective democratic community in which everybody had an equal voice. So we all

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:58.960
together decide democratically what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and what to do

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:07.600
with the output we all help to produce. So let's do it in, you know, in this country where democracy

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:17.360
is a value nearly everybody subscribes to. Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:24.080
that there is a place in our society where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:31.840
workplace, in the workplace a tiny group of people, unaccountable to the rest of them, the

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:38.080
employer, whether that's an individual, a family, a partnership, or a corporate board of directors.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:46.400
Tiny group of people controls economically a vast mass of employees. Those employees don't elect

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:52.560
those people, have no, nothing, there is no accountability. It is the most undemocratic

01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:00.800
arrangement imaginable and this society insists on calling itself democratic

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:07.120
when it has organized the minor matter of producing everything in a way that is the direct,

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:15.600
it's autocratic. So to push back on a few things. So one is the idea of this society calling itself

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.520
democratic is that the government is elected democratically and the government is able to

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:27.760
pressure the workplace through the process of regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:33.840
how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things. That's the one idea. The other is there

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:41.200
is a natural force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies of competition being the

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:49.040
accountability. So if you're a shitty boss, the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.720
to move to another company work for a better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers and

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:02.080
the bosses. That's at least the idea that you there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:09.120
One is the law. So regulatory regulations by passed by the government, democratic. And the second

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:15.600
is because there's always alternatives in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:22.560
well because you can always leave. So I mean, that's kinds of accountability. But what you're

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:29.680
saying is that does not result in a significant enough accountability where the employer

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.080
that avoids exploitation of the worker. Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:44.560
in those mechanisms. And let me respond to that. And then I'll counter argument. First, competition.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:54.480
Here again, we have to be Hegelians just a little competition destroys itself. It doesn't

01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:00.160
need any out. The whole point of competition is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:06.960
product as the other guy, either a better quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.160
the customers will come to me because my price is lower or my quality is better. And they'll

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:16.640
leave the other guy, he'll go out of business. Now let's follow. When he goes out of business,

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.440
because I won the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:29.520
be able to serve a market. He can't serve anymore. So I'm going to buy the used equipment. I'm going

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:40.160
and thereby many become few. Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:47.040
It's the product. Well, let's see. That's where it comes from. There's another element to the

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:53.200
system where there's always a new guy that comes in. There isn't. Well, that's the dream. The

01:22:53.200 --> 01:23:00.640
entrepreneurial spirit of a free, of the United States, for example, of a capitalist system is

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:08.960
you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build up a business that takes on Google and

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:16.880
Facebook and Twitter and all the different car for GM, which is what you look at Tesla, for

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:23.680
example. That's the American dream. One of the many ideals of the American dream is you can

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:33.920
move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world. It can happen.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.080
It can happen, but you're against it. That's like you can win a lottery.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:44.240
No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here you can work your ass off if you have

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:50.240
a good idea. The odds are better in the lottery. That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.720
How many Teslas do you know? Tesla is a really bad example because the car company, the automotive

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:05.200
sector is so difficult. They operate as such a thin margin of profit. They're probably a good

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:11.840
example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of lack of innovation.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.640
That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain. They have their uniqueness as

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:26.000
you're quite right, but so does every other industry. The one thing that's common is that

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.720
many become few. What you can also have is when you have a few, they jack up the price. They make

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:39.920
an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism, Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:46.720
people to break into this industry because the few remaining are making a wild amount of profit

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.040
because they are a few and can jigger the market to make it work like that for them.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:00.480
The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market share, that's a polite way of

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:06.800
saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact, an oligopolist, one of a handful

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:12.240
of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for. To push back a little bit also,

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:20.080
because this is a question also, do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism?

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:30.320
It completely removes the basic decency of human beings. If you give me a choice to press a button

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:37.040
to get rid of the competition, but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering. There's a lot of

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:42.400
people at the heads of companies that won't press that button. It's not in the calculation,

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:48.240
it's not just money, it's human well-being too. You think?

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.680
Yes. You and I don't live in the same place then.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.640
You're saying that the forces of capitalism take over the minds of the people at the top,

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:02.960
and then they seize being human. No.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.360
The basic, okay. I wouldn't, I wouldn't.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.640
Depending on your model of humans, but they lose track of the better angels of their nature,

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.600
and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cop at the top.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.560
I would put it differently, that the system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural selection.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:26.560
The guys who may, I could say the women too, it doesn't matter. The people who make it up through

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:33.040
the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along the way

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.160
that becomes selective. If they can't stand it, because they have that human quality,

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.760
and there are people like, I've known them. They're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.440
They went there and they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.960
I'm going to make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm going to

01:26:54.960 --> 01:27:01.520
be enjoying the people that come by and be a decent human. Of course, of course, but the system

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:07.680
selects the firm. If you don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up,

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.880
you're toast there anyway. The rest of the people who vote for you are going to kick you out.

01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:17.600
You can tell them all day long what a lovely person you are. They're going to look at you and

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:21.760
wonder, what happened to you? How did you even get this far with the lovely person horses?

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:31.360
It's not necessarily just lovely person. Maybe, I'll just say my bias is the people I know are

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:40.800
and especially at the top of companies are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:47.760
part of it. I think a lot of the things we're talking about is when there's not much innovation

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:56.560
in the system. Innovation usually comes in the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.600
There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:08.160
want to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes and then there's

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:15.200
a flurry as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is and then you

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.400
have a period where you can get excited about that and the very rich people who come to the top

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.840
can talk endlessly as they always do about innovation.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:33.280
But again, you know, it really is, this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring kind

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:42.560
of issue. For me, how do I put this in a way that, you know, I don't mean to offend, so please,

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.120
please. No, no, no, I don't want to. But

01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:57.520
the problem with capitalism is, and maybe you'll like this, the problem with capitalism is

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:03.680
not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:10.640
would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite, that it is such a

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:19.120
contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite make it.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.960
There's always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking about,

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:32.320
who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top. By God knows

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:38.960
what hook or what crook that they did it, but most of them go, and you know why? Because

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:48.240
their humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do. I mean, the corporate

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:58.240
sector this year, just to give you an idea, CEOs are jacking up their wage package. They're already

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:05.280
out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now 300, 300 times what the average worker pays,

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:09.920
but they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's what's happening in their universe. That's

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:14.640
what they're all doing it, and they have to do. Each one of them justifies that I have to do that,

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.000
otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one, which of course is true, but is no comfort for the mass

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:27.920
of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument isn't very exciting. So they're doing that at a

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:35.040
time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone through the COVID disaster. They've gone

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:41.600
through the worst, second worst economic crash of capitalism in our history. After two years of this

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:48.480
one-two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch, and we are now predicting rising interest

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.920
rates and a recession at the end of the year or early next year. You can't do this to a working

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.760
class. When this was done to the German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:05.600
You keep doing that in this country. We're already watching it. You're going to get that too.

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.080
You're already getting bits and pieces. You can't keep doing this.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.000
So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.160
Taking out on it. That can turn to anger.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:21.120
Some little 18-year-old kid who has to go three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket.

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.080
What? And it happens every day in this country. Every day.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:33.120
So that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger, potentially.

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:40.400
By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality, and this goes to Elon Musk.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:50.000
If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.040
was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:03.600
They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous in our resources.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:12.800
There is a way to make transportation much more rational, and we've known it for decades.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:20.240
It's called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained crystal clear,

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:30.000
clean, frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:37.760
society. In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That's less than

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:44.000
we're sending to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it. A public transit system where?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country's overwhelmingly

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.760
metropolitan area. Well, it surely has to be more than $30 billion. Well, it was a few years ago.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:58.800
You're saying it's not a number that's insane. Right. It's not crazy stuff.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:03.600
It's a reasonable number. Let me just finish the point.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:08.480
Sure, yes. Okay. So I'm trying to be rationally here.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.680
If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:20.640
fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use of the fossil fuel,

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:25.920
particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass transit.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.400
We don't, we're doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.

01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:36.720
Well, there's, you know, on, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public

01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:43.600
transit because it's going to be reasonable vehicles. It will end in theory car ownership.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.640
So you just have a more kind of distributed public transit system.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.400
If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal and the major goal of

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:59.600
the other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share by smaller, so they have some,

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.120
four General Motors Toyota, all of them are making electric cars. So what they've done is

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.480
they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.200
That's fucking nuts. What are you doing? That's one of the things they're doing,

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:18.560
but automation is also another one. But on the Elon side, there's also

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:25.520
a hilariously named boring company, which is working on tunnels, which is actually expanding the

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:32.640
flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit. I think, listen,

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:38.560
I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know what a public

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:45.680
transit system is, period. There's F-150 pickup trucks. Well, there's, this is an interesting,

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:53.360
so the older, by the way, footnote, the older the city, the more likely it has public transportation.

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.480
So you're saying Boston is the best example? Yes.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:00.400
Have you been, you know? Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.120
Boston with the street railway. Boston is your case study of how to do this,

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.920
because they've been doing it all along. New York's pretty good too.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.960
There's a trade out. Yeah. New York, I would say, is better than Boston because

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:17.200
there's, you know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.560
It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point. But there is a,

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:32.000
the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America. And there is a practical nature to

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:39.920
the fact that in order to do public transit, in order to do some of these things that you're

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.880
talking about with the working class, there has to be a central planning component,

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:52.960
or there has to be a centralized component. And America is very much based on the idea of,

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.600
at least in recent times, I would say from the founding of individualism,

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:05.840
of respecting individual freedom. Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:14.480
Marxism to life, you would trample on individual freedoms? No. Can you respect both? Sure. For

01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:22.240
me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who have had

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:28.640
that freedom eroded under the capitalism. That's a motive for my Marxism. It was for Marx too.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:36.160
He loved the French Revolution. He loved the liberté, égalité, fraternité, the great three,

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.680
and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like. He believed in all of that. His critique

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:48.160
of capitalism was it promised it and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:57.520
it is because it didn't deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:08.560
a gender. But again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, so if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:18.240
it's set up in this society. Some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:24.960
pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's bad and what's dangerous

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:29.440
and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in and tell you what

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.320
to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem. There really is no

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:40.640
other way to explain the following in American politics. Large numbers of people lose their

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:48.640
homes in a downturn, like the so-called Great Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:54.240
Large numbers of people go unemployed. And what are the media all about? The government.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.360
If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kick the workers by throwing them out of their home,

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.800
and they don't get angry with me. They get angry with the government. I fire large numbers of people.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.680
I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a result of having no job and no income.

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:19.840
And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. This is a genius stroke.

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:24.560
In theory, but if you look at government, because you said accountability in the

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:28.640
capitalist system has no accountability. There's some pushback I give on the accountability. I

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:34.800
think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Galilean way. There's more accountability

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:42.000
for, I would say, that in theory, government is perfectly accountable. That's the whole point

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.560
of a democratic system, is you vote people in. In practice, there's a giant growing bureaucracy

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:53.120
that is accountable only on the surface. There's two parties

01:38:54.400 --> 01:39:02.960
that seem to be, are the same media somehow integrated into making the same two parties

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:09.280
that are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.040
and bitterly arguing and calling each other's names, nasty names and all those kinds of things.

01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:23.440
Okay, but that's government. So who exactly is worse here? Government or companies?

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:30.400
Well, why are we asking that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.600
Republicans and Democrats just now, with which I agree, I would say the same thing about corporations

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:40.320
and the government. This is the same people, literally. But let's go to Churchill. Which one

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:46.080
is the, which one is worse? Let's go to Churchill, like democracy is the worst formal government,

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:51.440
except all the other ones or whatever. So this kind of same idea, which one exactly is worse?

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:57.600
Because to me, it seems like, which one between what government and industry and companies?

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:07.200
It's because government is plagued by, I will call it corruption because the corruption of

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.840
bureaucratic paperwork and then because they're, but they're not accountable. There doesn't seem

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:19.040
to be a serious accountability. Again, we're not see, we're not living on the same planet.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:28.960
The greatest practitioners of central planning are corporations. Elon has an operation like

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:37.680
General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other mega-corps. They have to plan. They buy up companies

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:44.640
because they don't want to deal in the market. They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:51.920
having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control. They want the

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:58.160
professor to teach the genius of a market. They hate the market. And when they grow to be big,

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:03.360
they keep buying whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them,

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:10.720
which requires them then to plan the production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:18.960
them in the market. The model of the government is a private corporation. I have spent my life,

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:25.040
give you an example, in American universities, big ones, famous ones, not just as a student,

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.160
but as a professor. I teach now at the new school here. It's another one, right?

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:38.880
They will model themselves after businesses. You can attack the bureaucracy of universities,

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:48.240
good reason, it's a mess, but they're proudly modeling themselves on organizing their bureaucracy

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:56.080
in a business-like manner. So you're looking at a difference which isn't there. The government

01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:03.200
and the private sector are partners and both of them wouldn't have it any other way. The corporations

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:09.920
want that from the government and the government now knows that to please the corporations is the

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.360
number one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs and keep their system

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.640
going. And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:27.920
But there's important differences that I don't know if they're fundamental or just a consequence

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.880
of history, but if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than companies.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:39.040
Companies are accountable by, especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable by sort of

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:43.200
the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:53.200
The government is accountable by votes and it seems like government, unlike companies,

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:59.760
for most of companies, history is always too big to fail, meaning it can always just print

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:09.840
money. It can always save itself and that creates a bureaucracy. You rarely pay the cost of having

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:16.640
made bad decisions if you're in government. You distribute the blame and it's very unclear

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.440
who's responsible for bad decisions. So bad decisions in government accumulate. So you become

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:27.520
more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor in your decision making in terms of,

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:32.880
you said public transit, should we build a public transit system in this city or not?

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:38.000
That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting decision. I would say it's very often a very good

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:45.280
decision, but whoever makes that decision should be accountable for a good or bad decision and it

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:53.120
seems like companies are more accountable. They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more

01:43:53.120 --> 01:44:00.960
because they can go bankrupt. There's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering

01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:07.600
decisions. Government doesn't seem to be under the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:14.080
that? I disagree with that. Everything in my history pushes me. You may be living... I may be

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:22.320
living in a different... Who knows? A planet or taking a different sort of drug. I won't mention

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:29.360
the name but I personally had a lot to do with a very large company here in the United States,

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:40.400
here in the New York area and it involved two brothers and a family who built it up into a

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:51.360
huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo of the family and he was more responsible

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:57.040
than anybody else building it up. But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:05.200
brother so the one brother who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes became a vice

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:13.360
president, got an enormous salary, got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:24.000
where I'm sitting right now and that was the way that family handled that company and all of his

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:32.400
relatives that were somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever because in my experience

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.920
with this and because I went to the schools I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.720
corporate execs, full of those stories, you know, they made mistake after mistake which they would

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:55.600
tell you about, didn't undermine there. They were always able to blame somebody else, something else

01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:01.280
that scraped them through and had they not been able to they would have been replaced by another

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:08.640
person who did the same thing for as long as they could and they knew it. They would talk about it

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:16.080
at family events, that's how I know. I understand that you want the outside world to look at it

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:25.120
this way but it's not my experience. But again, that kind of thing at the risk of saying human

01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:34.080
nature again, I wonder what kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is the question

01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:40.400
of, I would call that, let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption, which system allows

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.800
for more corruption. But remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:52.240
government, it's more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when

01:46:52.240 --> 01:47:00.560
everybody has a vote, when you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:06.800
to a larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:12.320
that most companies are responsible to and now you've got a whole different universe. It's not

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:18.640
a small group of people, can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden, most of it on and on and on.

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:24.000
This is, you know, worker co-ops is what this is called in many parts of the world. So it's not

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.320
that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism I understand

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:39.520
is to pick from historical precedents the things that we think will work better. And I think if

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.040
all the people in an enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically decided, they would

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.880
never give two or three individuals $100 million while everybody else can't send their kid to

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:59.840
college. If they can do that. So just to return, just to address this point about the particular

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:07.040
implementation of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union, why did Stalinism,

01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.800
for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, in human suffering? Is there any elements

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:23.040
within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:29.040
that led to that bloodshed? I don't think so. I think there are many things that led to the

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:37.840
bloodshed and so all that Stalin's regimes did. And, you know, I spent 10 years in my life

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.240
with another economist writing a book about that to try to explain from a Marxist position

01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:52.720
the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. You might want to take a look at it sometime, but

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:58.000
there, I'm going to say a few things now, but all of those things are spelled out

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:07.440
in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc., in that work. Let me start with, you know,

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:18.320
playing a little bit with Hegel. The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union

01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.000
was really not so much what the Soviet Union did, but what the rest of the world did.

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:30.880
I mean, you had a really interesting move, and I'll give you a parallel from today.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:40.880
The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed. World War I just, it fell apart.

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:47.120
The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already been in trouble. There was a

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.520
revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. I mean, if you know Russian history,

01:49:53.520 --> 01:50:01.760
which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917.

01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:09.840
And in some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:17.440
the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. You know, earlier on with Karensky,

01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:24.000
the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people more

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:31.040
skeptical and would not have been called Marxists, probably, by history. They couldn't, they tried.

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:36.960
They couldn't. Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:46.160
The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:53.920
immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes,

01:50:54.560 --> 01:51:02.160
but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power and in a big country. And they freaked out.

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:09.760
If you know American history, this country, the leadership of this country, went completely berserk.

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:16.880
I mean, we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:27.840
were a time of palmerades in Boston, the Sakhal Vanzetti trials, really grim hostility. And you

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:34.000
had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution. The U.S.,

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:41.840
Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops. So what you had right away was

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:50.400
a notion in the West that this was, this was unthinkable. This was, there was a great professor

01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:58.400
at Princeton, Meyer, forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all American foreign

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:07.920
policy since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:14.480
Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven't figured out. That was a big

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:23.280
change back in 1989 and 90, you know, Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:27.680
they're not lending. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case.

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:38.720
So you had one factor was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global, I mean,

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:45.200
Rosa Luxemburg is, I mean, I assume you know the, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:51.840
of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenin's, by the way, but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into

01:52:51.840 --> 01:53:00.240
bits, killed. So you are attributing some, some of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:05.440
rest of the world turned away. Turned against. Turned against, sort of, you turn against is the

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:11.360
better way. Very, yeah, I mean, not in order of importance, but it's, it's a very important part

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:18.160
of the psychology of being, you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:23.440
as much evidence that indeed there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it.

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:30.960
Look, you could see the effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first,

01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:34.480
that you could have socialism in one country. That was thought to be

01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:42.080
ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism. Marx was, Marx was against capitalism everywhere.

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:48.400
It was, you know, workers of the world unite, not workers of Russia unite, workers of the,

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:55.680
he had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms with the fact that the

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:02.320
revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin, was tried in Munich, was tried in

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:10.160
Budapest, was tried in Seattle here, they all failed. They all failed, and he's left. So,

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:17.520
the French would say, tout ça, right, you know, all alone. That's one. The second thing is economic

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:24.960
isolation. Russia's a poor country and it needed what it got before the war, which were heavy

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:30.080
investments from the French and the Germans, particularly, but others too. Now this was all

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:37.040
cut off. And you can see the replay with the sanctions program. It's, we're gonna do it again,

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.680
we're gonna do it again. We have to do, we have, the world is different and the sanctions don't

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:49.360
work, but they're gonna try them. Because it's the history. But that culture was, today is

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.800
completely different. Russia's a different place today, but Russia has China and that changes

01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:00.160
everything. And they don't get that here yet, but they will. Yeah, there's a very complicated

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:08.960
dynamic with China, even with India. Yep. Or Turkey. Brazil. Sorry to say human nature may

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:15.120
change at a slower pace than the geopolitical. That has occurred to me as well. I get that point.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:21.520
So is there a, can you steel man the case or consider the case that there's something about

01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:28.400
the implementation of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:36.080
class and the workers unite, that naturally leads to formation of a dictatorial force,

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:46.240
a dictator that says, let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:52.560
of how to run the democracy of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose.

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.120
And then that naturally leads to a dictator and there's naturally inhuman nature,

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:05.040
power and absolute power as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:12.080
you focus on Marx's ideals, you're going to end up with a dictator and often when you give too

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:16.160
much power to anyone, human, a small number of people, you're going to get into a huge amount

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:22.480
of trouble. You've put things together there that I would, I think if you, if you give,

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:31.360
put as a word, yeah, as German, the, if you, I remember, I told you my mother was born in

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:37.920
Germany. And then your dad is French. Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know you're European.

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:45.600
It's a city on the border of France and Germany. If you come from, Alsatians, Alsace in Germany.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:51.440
So they're German speaking. Yeah, they're both. It's bilingual because it's been back and forth

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:57.040
so many times in medieval days already that it literally, you go from one store to another,

01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:02.400
the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German, but they all speak both languages

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:09.200
because you don't speak either of them. I speak Russian. Russian, but not German.

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:14.000
Ukrainian, no, it took French for four years in high school, but I've forgotten all of it.

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:19.120
I remember the romance and the spirit of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:29.280
remember. If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:38.880
period of time and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks

01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.760
and it stays and you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:51.040
and you will discover it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people

01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:59.520
don't. If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:04.400
and that it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was Zeus

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:10.880
and Diana and all the others and they were very human like, but instead we have one who is the

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:19.120
absolute beginning and what are you doing? You're teaching people an authority line

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:25.040
that comes from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings, if in your feudal manner

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:31.600
the Lord sits called to the landlord, he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:38.160
and you do this for thousands of years, you can make a Russian revolution in 1917,

01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:44.960
but if you imagine you've gotten away from all that people assume without ever thinking about it,

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:54.480
you're going to have trouble. Stalin is figured here as the originator of his situation. He

01:58:54.480 --> 01:59:01.040
wasn't. He never had that power. He may have thought that, but I don't. He's the product.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:07.120
Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn't that kind of guy. You know, he's a

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:15.600
baseball playing lawyer. That's what he was, but they made him into Tala. You're the product of

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:22.480
history. No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the literature. It was the structures and

01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:31.200
institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has its own rhythm and doesn't follow the

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:35.520
calendar of a political revolution. That's the fundamental question. Is there something about

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:44.400
communism that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:51.120
No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what

01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:56.720
they find familiar to what seems to make sense and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example

01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:02.720
from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:11.280
of private enterprise and minimum government. Income Trump runs for office in 2016, is elected.

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:19.680
Okay, what does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most massive

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:27.440
government intervention in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades. Nobody says anything.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:38.880
The Republicans cave and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on anything.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:44.160
He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:50.080
That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:55.040
course in economics, which everybody knows. Everybody who teaches these courses knows.

02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:02.000
It doesn't matter. He's still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:13.680
to a point where it can't solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:22.400
of the laissez-faire and all of the individualism. Suddenly the Republican Party is gone and now

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:27.520
they're going to make an abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with

02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:35.680
your uterus. What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power.

02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:43.280
They're hoping what? Do they like the government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro-government

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:51.440
and it wasn't in Russia. They were in a desperate fix. He took advantage.

02:01:52.640 --> 02:02:01.040
To which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:11.280
national socialism party of German workers, hence the Nazi party, the fascist party in the 30s

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:17.360
and the 40s at the head of whom was Hitler, which had just recently learned he was

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:23.680
employing number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:30.160
and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history of

02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:38.000
the 20th century? What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the national

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:51.600
socialist party of German workers, workers. National socialist German worker party.

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:58.880
Worker party. National socialist German worker party. Here's the history. Did he care about the

02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:04.880
workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message? The only thing that Marxism

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.920
did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power, but had nothing, no

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:15.840
other. He didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything about it, nor did the people around

02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.520
him. Here's the story of what happened there, which I know largely through my own family and

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:28.240
plus my own history of the work that I did. The most successful socialist party in Europe

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:35.440
was the German party. It started around 1870. Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were

02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:43.360
leaders, Ferdinand LaSalle and other his daughters. By the end of the century, it was the second most

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:51.040
important party in Germany. Nobody understood it. It was over. It was almost as big a shock to the

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:58.000
Europeans as was the Russian Revolution in 1917. Here was a political party that was now in

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:07.760
every German city, in every German town, powerful and enjoying its rise up. That's my family is

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:16.320
involved in this. I mean, I really do know the story. It meant that starting around 1968,

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:26.640
if you wanted to have any kind of presence in the German working class, you had to use the word

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:32.960
socialist. You had to. Otherwise, they wouldn't pay attention. The other parties called themselves

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:39.760
Catholic. Germany is divided. The northern two thirds is Protestant. The southern third is

02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:45.600
Catholic. Munich and Bavaria is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant.

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:52.640
You could be in the Catholic party. That was the south. Or you could be in various conservative

02:04:53.440 --> 02:05:00.000
Prussian. If you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing in Germany,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:06.640
a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time, Germany was the major

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:12.640
competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and

02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:22.080
US taking over from Britain's empire. The German working class was it. Anybody who wanted to approach

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:29.840
the working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:37.760
Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word socialist in their party,

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:43.680
but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't anything to do with the Soviet Union

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:49.920
or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first four letters

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.560
of national, national in German, and they ZI's how you spell national in the German

02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:01.520
national socialism, but definitely not communists. That's right. They killed communists. They fought

02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:08.960
communists in the street. They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each other's existence

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:15.040
and their life. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and Gypsies

02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.080
and all the other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were the number one

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:26.640
and socialist right behind them. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of 1933,

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:33.840
that's when Hitler takes power. The last elections, two of them in 1932, the socialist and communist

02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:41.760
to vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany. So he appealed to the German manufacturers,

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:46.480
the German capitalists, and he said, the communists and socialists are going to win.

02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:53.920
And you're just the capitalists. You have too few people. You need a mass space,

02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:56.160
and I'm the only one that can do that.

02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.600
So it was just the populist message that he used.

02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:07.360
That's right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:12.000
the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.880
you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have done it. He had

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:23.680
called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as a little

02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:29.760
funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German, for them that mattered.

02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:38.480
So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism, which he immediately does.

02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:46.800
Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word.

02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:52.240
You know, it's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,

02:07:52.560 --> 02:08:00.880
we are not a democracy. We are a republic, which is like saying, I'm not a banana. I'm a fruit.

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:07.840
You have to explain to these people a banana. So you have to explain to people, yes,

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:14.080
we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic,

02:08:14.080 --> 02:08:18.560
because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have to go through

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:24.000
that with people, so they kind of get it. And certain words have power beyond their actual

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:31.440
meaning that's used in communication, whether it's negative, like racist or positive, like freedom

02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:36.720
of speech or Democrat or Democrat with a D. Yeah. And then you use that to mean something.

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:43.760
Who knows? Or negative, what, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist or something, whatever that

02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:48.240
means that's not even used as any kind of philosophical or economic sense.

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.080
So let's fast forward to today. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:59.040
There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:04.080
socialism and maybe let's try to start to sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:14.400
mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's from these parts. So maybe if you can comment on

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:23.680
Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism? Are they representing those

02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:34.400
ideas well in both economic and the political sense? Okay. Where do I begin? The socialist

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:42.800
movement predates Marx was always larger than Marx and has gone on to develop separately after

02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:50.320
Marx's death. So can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:58.880
between Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to

02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:05.040
maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:16.560
Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics and as I said earlier,

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:29.120
devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism and that's its strength, how it does that,

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:36.720
how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works, that is really the

02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:44.880
forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism

02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:51.360
figures it's there so that people who aren't Marxist are nonetheless aware of Marxism,

02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:59.600
like it more or less, study it more or less, but it's a broader notion that I like to use

02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:07.600
this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:17.120
there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world

02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:24.080
think are adequate. We are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who thought they

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:28.560
could do better than slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.

02:11:29.760 --> 02:11:36.160
We've made progress. Fuedalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a progress over both of

02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:45.360
them and progress hasn't stopped and we are the people who in a variety of ways want the progress

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:54.640
to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best beyond which

02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:02.320
we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of the word, a reactionary way

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:09.200
of thinking and we're that large community. Many of us are not interested in economics all that

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:17.840
much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example, because we want to do

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:25.920
something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to kill itself physically

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:33.840
and we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that, etc. So that's for me

02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:42.160
a kind of difference. It's a little difficult to say because there's no other figure like Marx

02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:50.080
that has an equal impact, an equal place within the broad socialist tradition.

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:59.840
The only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition, but that's very specialized

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:06.240
and that's a whole other kind of conversation. Whatever you say, the influence of the great

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:16.080
anarchist thinkers, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorrell, and others still doesn't amount to the impact that

02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:27.360
Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but up to this point that's a way of

02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.600
understanding the relationship. Yeah, that's interesting that some of the ideas within

02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:38.880
anarchism, and of course it's one of the more varied disciplines, because there's such,

02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:45.280
maybe by definition, such variety in their thinkers, but they kind of stand for a

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:55.840
dismantling of a power center and that, if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas

02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:02.880
of socialism. Absolutely. So where you have the... There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:11.760
and in Marxist ideas that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation

02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:21.120
from Lenin. People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin and it was made by Lenin,

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:26.480
positive. In other words, Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for.

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:32.400
We want to create the conditions under which there is a... Because you remember, the

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.400
communists or whatever, they wouldn't call that at first in Russia before the revolution. They

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:43.680
were just socialists. They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right.

02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:49.280
They had no love for the government. The government was their literal everyday enemy and

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:56.160
being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the whole...

02:14:56.800 --> 02:15:02.400
Being a Marxist, you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:08.480
you're struggling against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:14.560
because if you understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.

02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:21.920
One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia and he goes back centuries.

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.880
It's a huge book, three or four inches thick and I'm one of the few people who've read it.

02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:36.000
He's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of feudalism,

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.920
including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe. The development of a powerful central

02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:49.440
state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on, which ought to be suggestive

02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:57.360
that maybe the turn to powerful governments here in the United States or in Europe is maybe also

02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:06.240
because this system is exhausted and can't go on and has to marshal every last bit of power it can

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:13.040
not to be lost in history. It would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:18.960
would look like if Lenin never died. A lot of people have asked that question over the years,

02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:24.160
a lot of people. The area is stalling, sliding in in the middle of the night,

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:30.240
erasing the withering away of the state part. Yes, exactly. So just to return briefly back

02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:35.440
to AOC and Bernie Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.920
some of these ideas and they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism? Right.

02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.680
The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC, and it's particularly true about Bernie,

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.840
because AOC is much younger and Bernie's an older man. Bernie, being roughly my age,

02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:02.960
has been around formatively as a student, as an activist, then coming up through the ranks in

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:10.320
Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all the rest. He lived through, for lack of a better term,

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:17.280
I would call Cold War America. And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945-6

02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:28.320
to the present, I mean really never stopped, was a Manichaean worldview. The United States is good,

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:33.760
it defines democracy, and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the opposite

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:44.160
of democracy should be called. Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks

02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:53.280
of academic individuals, it was impossible to talk, have a conversation. I mean,

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.920
I can't tell, just make it very personal. The number of times I would raise my hand in my classes

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:08.720
at Harvard or Stanford or Yale, and I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:14.240
because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me, except by people

02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:23.040
who trashed it, other than that, and I didn't want that. So I would ask a question, and I would see

02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:28.800
in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't much care for, and those who were good teachers

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:34.880
that I liked, fear. It was just fear. They didn't want to go there. They didn't want to answer my

02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:40.880
question. And after a while, I got to know some of them, and I found out why, because you don't

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:45.360
know how the rest of the class is going to understand this. Either they would have to say,

02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:50.160
I don't know, which would be the honest truth for many of them, but a professor does not want to

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:57.520
say in a classroom, I don't know, that it's not cool. Or if they knew, they'd have to say something

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:02.400
that indicated they didn't know really much, and they weren't even going to do that.

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:09.920
Or they would know something, and maybe that would be because they were interested. They did not want

02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:17.280
the rest of the students to begin to say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, he's interested.

02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:22.000
Mm-mm. This is not good for your career. You don't know how this is going to

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:27.760
play out. Who's going to say what to whom? And I could see in their faces what I later learned,

02:19:27.760 --> 02:19:33.440
because they told me, don't come to my office hours. We're in the office. We can talk about it.

02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:35.680
But that's how bad it was.

02:19:36.400 --> 02:19:38.240
Is it not still?

02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:44.720
Pretty much. In my field, the great so-called debate. I mean, I find it boring, but the great

02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:51.840
debate for my colleagues is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics.

02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:58.080
Neoclassical, the government should stay out of the economy, less a fair or liberalism.

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:03.840
And the Keynesian saying, no, you crazy neoclassical. If you do that, you'll have great depressions,

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:08.960
and the system will collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems,

02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:14.080
to fix the weaknesses. And they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs.

02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:19.600
One of the very few things they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out.

02:20:21.200 --> 02:20:27.760
That they can find common ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own.

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:37.360
Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means that all of the complicated developments

02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:44.880
within Marxism and within socialism of the post-World War II period,

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:52.640
the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to the average American person,

02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:58.240
but to the average American academic, to the average American who thinks of himself or herself

02:20:58.240 --> 02:21:05.760
as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:13.520
history to have no idea. Or saying, there's this man, Lukacs, a Hungarian Marxist. He really had

02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:20.880
interest in, or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the

02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:28.080
Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? Why, you like Gramsci

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:34.560
as a literary critic, but they didn't even know. They don't even know. It's been erased.

02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:41.120
It's a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the

02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:47.520
Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings,

02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:53.840
many of which are very interesting and complicated. Anyway, so what you're going to have in this

02:21:53.840 --> 02:22:02.240
country is a slow awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War.

02:22:03.040 --> 02:22:08.000
I never expected, to be very honest with you, that I would live to see. I knew it would come

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:14.720
because of these things always do, but I didn't expect to see it. So I have been surprised

02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:20.640
as have a lot of us that when it starts to happen, it happens fast.

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:30.320
So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from the Cold War to accept the ideas.

02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:35.040
Always a socialist. We all knew. And everybody who paid attention, he denied it.

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:44.320
But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous, to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont.

02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:50.080
Vermont is one of the smallest states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:56.160
that there are more cows than people in Vermont, etc. etc. So here from this little state,

02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:02.880
this elderly gentleman with a New York City accent runs for all and says, I'm a socialist.

02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:07.040
And when they attack him, he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist.

02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:14.400
Now he had been. It wasn't a secret that suddenly got out. But the great question, and I don't mind

02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:19.440
telling you because I went to the right schools, I know a lot of people, you know,

02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:25.680
Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official

02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:30.560
of the Democratic Party and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?

02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:39.120
Makes no difference. They get 1% of the vote. He was wrong. They had no idea what was coming.

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:45.040
But the truth is, I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it. I thought his 1% was probably

02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:50.800
right. So we were both wrong. Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president

02:23:50.800 --> 02:24:01.200
one day? Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one, it's fast. Number two,

02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:11.360
it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,

02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:19.680
calm, non-confrontational socialism you can imagine. So not AOC or Bernie.

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:23.360
No, no, they are not confrontational in my judgment.

02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:27.040
In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.

02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:34.400
They're feisty personally. But not ideologically. You know, she is, Bernie is also,

02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:40.640
you know, in honest moments, and they're both really are pretty honest folks,

02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:47.920
at least in my experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:55.760
as democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular

02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:03.440
government tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working

02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:10.400
class than you do now. That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means by socialism.

02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:16.560
When he talks about it, and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot. Okay,

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:23.680
that's consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism. And that's where we're going to

02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:29.280
start in a country coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon, it's already happening. There'll

02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:35.600
be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are

02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:42.800
comfortable with. You can already see the shoots of it now. You know, AOC voted together with

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:48.960
most of the others to support the money for Ukraine. Okay, that lot of people in the socialist

02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:53.520
movement do not support that. And that's going to have, you know, I don't know exactly how

02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:59.360
that's going to work out. But that should give people an idea. There are disagreements and they're

02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:06.720
going to fester and they're going to grow. People in the socialist sphere don't support money

02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:12.000
from the United States in the large amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because of,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.400
it's a fundamentally, the military industrial complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing?

02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:21.920
No, there are some people for whom that's the issue. Then there are people for whom

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:28.400
this is, you know, it's guns and butter and why are we, why are we over there when we have such

02:26:28.400 --> 02:26:34.560
needs at home that are being neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what we

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:40.800
talked about at the beginning, who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between

02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:48.880
Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine and what are we

02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:55.680
doing here? We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate

02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:59.840
a settlement, don't kill large numbers of Ukraine. I mean, everybody's willing to fight

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:05.200
to the last Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you doing? You're supposed to be in

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:11.040
favor of peace, you know, and for the United States, which just finished invading and occupying

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:15.840
Afghanistan and Iraq to be against another country invading. I mean, who in the world

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:21.600
is going to take this seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade, it's good and you invade,

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:29.600
it's terrible. What? You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? What's going on here?

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:33.440
All of these questions are being active, by the way, not just by socialists,

02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:39.360
by lots of other people too, inside the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party.

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:45.920
You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They

02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.640
don't want the money spent there, they don't want the weapons sent there, they don't like the whole

02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:58.080
policy and Trump wobble. So, Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:05.440
right and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:16.240
AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War

02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:24.640
isolation from the whole, you know, when I explained to people the contribution made,

02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:30.640
for example, to modern Marxism, I'll give you an example, by the French philosopher

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:36.880
Louis Althusser, I don't know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of

02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:43.920
the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there

02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:52.160
were a university that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT. It would be the university.

02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:59.120
Well, the École Normale in France in Paris is the. He was a tenured professor who became the

02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:04.560
rector. The rector is like the president of the university. An active member of the French

02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:10.400
Communist Party, most of his adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War.

02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:15.040
That was unthinkable in this country. You could not in a million years, right?

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:23.760
So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring a version of postmodernism

02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:32.240
into Marxism with enormous impact all over the world when he traveled, not just in Europe,

02:29:32.240 --> 02:29:36.000
all over, right? So if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for you.

02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:48.480
Althusser, Luis, Althusser. Look him up. You'll see tons of stuff.

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:53.840
By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works in English.

02:29:56.240 --> 02:29:59.600
By the way, the textbook I wrote in Economics, in case you're ever interested,

02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:05.520
was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories,

02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:11.920
Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That's an MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that's right.

02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:16.800
And by the way, when we think, I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between

02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:25.040
Marxian economics and Marxist. I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that.

02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:33.920
I only use it because Marxist uses a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian uses an adjective

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:39.840
to qualify, but I don't mean some great difference. There's a last point I would like to make about

02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:49.440
AOC and Bernie. That's also general. I'm a historian too. And I know that the transition

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:56.400
out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred

02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:03.680
in fits and starts. So for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate, serfs would run away,

02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:09.360
then run into a town. How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because they had

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:16.080
run away from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:23.760
what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the business of buying and

02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:29.520
then reselling stuff and living off the difference. But you know, I could make more money if I produced

02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:36.080
some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody else. So I'm going to make you a deal.

02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:40.960
I'm going to give you money once a week. I'll give you money what we would later call a wage.

02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:45.280
And you come here and under my supervision, you make this crap that I'm going to then sell.

02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:54.080
And this all works out. In other words, there were efforts unconscious, not self-aware,

02:31:54.880 --> 02:32:02.000
to go out of feudalism to a new system. Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart.

02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:11.680
Some of them lasted weeks or months or years, but it took a long time before the conditions were

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:19.680
ready for a kind of a general switch. And once that was done, it grew on itself and became the

02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:26.720
global capitalist system we have today. That's the only model we have. So for me, that's what

02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:35.120
I see when I look at socialism. I see the Paris commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a

02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:42.000
few weeks. I see Russia. That was an attempt lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you will fill in the

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:50.080
blank, I see these are all early experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things

02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:56.000
never to do again. The good, the bad. What do you build on? How do you learn?

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:01.120
And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition, when it's serious, that's what it does.

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:06.240
In your ideas, sort of capitalism was a significant improvement over the feudalism.

02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:13.920
And we are coming to an age and over slavery, and we're coming to an age where capitalism

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:21.120
will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is how fundamentally broken. It's better than

02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:25.840
the things that came before it, but there's going to be things yet better and they will be grounded

02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:35.440
in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just a linger briefly on the way Marxism is used

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:42.880
as a term on Twitter? There's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly, but

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:52.880
cultural Marxism or the criticisms of universities being infiltrated by cultural Marxists.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:01.680
I'm not exactly sure. I don't pay close enough attention, but it's woke. There's a kind of

02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:11.040
woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text? Who's the Karl Marx of

02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:21.040
wokeness? All I do know is that there's certain characteristics of woke ideology, which is

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:30.960
hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys. Basically, everyone is a bad guy,

02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:36.720
except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying that they're the good guy.

02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:48.560
That applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics, identity politics, all that kind of

02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:57.600
stuff. Is there any parallels between Marxian economics and Marxist ideology and whatever

02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:06.400
is being called Marxism on Twitter? No, not much. One of the consequences of the taboo

02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:13.200
after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words.

02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:20.000
It's like calling somebody, well, I won't use bad language, but using a four-letter word to

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.760
describe somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many

02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:32.640
circles, this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn't

02:35:32.640 --> 02:35:39.920
have a particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is

02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:50.320
somebody who is concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation and gender and all of those

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:58.720
things and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms and I don't like any of these people,

02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:06.080
so I slap the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism because it isn't Marxism about

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:12.880
getting more money or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists

02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:18.400
somehow are concerned about. So this is odd since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always

02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.240
been interested in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci,

02:36:24.240 --> 02:36:31.440
that's what they're famous for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture.

02:36:31.440 --> 02:36:38.640
Gramsci writes a great length about the Catholic Church about theater and painting in Italy and

02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.360
on and on. I mean, this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:51.040
know what the names are. It's a label that summarizes kind of a shorthand. I'm against all of this. I

02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:57.520
don't want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country and it always has been or sexism or

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:06.960
phobia against gay people or whatever it is that's agitating them, Marxism or socialism. I mean,

02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:14.720
it's just, it's like socialism is the post office. It is a mentality. Well, but I don't blame them.

02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:22.560
I mean, it's childish. It's mean-spirited, but it comes out of the fact no one ever sat them down

02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:28.640
and said, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of things that people kind of share and

02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:37.040
these big differences. Look, an intelligent society, which this country is, could have and should have

02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:43.760
done that. It was fear and a kind of terror that made them behave in the way they did and we're now

02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:52.000
seeing it. Having said that, there is such a thing as cultural Marxism. What that is is simply those

02:37:52.000 --> 02:38:04.720
Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing how it is that a particular culture is on the one hand

02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:11.040
shaped by capitalism and on the other hand, it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:19.680
and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the interaction between the class struggle on the job

02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:28.320
and attitude towards sexuality or movements in music or whatever else culture. And there are

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:36.240
Georg Lukacs, this Hungarian, great name in there, the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci,

02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:41.920
and a modern name just died a couple of years ago, a British intellectual named Stuart Hall,

02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:50.480
H-A-L-L. If I were teaching, which I have done, a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three

02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:58.720
major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you articles and books to read of their stuff,

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.120
because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many others.

02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:08.160
So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism creates

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:15.120
and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes. And Marxists are particularly those who like

02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:20.640
to look at that interaction. In other words, they're interested in how capitalism shapes culture

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:26.960
and how culture shapes capitalism. There's another name, I forgot. Stuart Hall is British,

02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:38.160
Gramsci is Italian, Lukacs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N.

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:44.880
He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that developed in

02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:51.120
Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in cultural questions.

02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:57.440
It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and

02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:03.680
politics. There were people who said, you're leaving out very important parts of modern society

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:10.160
that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that impetus to open

02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:16.800
Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand that this cult,

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:21.280
and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different meaning

02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:30.240
from this. This is just bad-mouthing. That's all. Let me ask a more personal question. So

02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:36.640
for most of the 20th century, no, not most, but a large many decades in the United States

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.320
as a consequence of the Cold War and before being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be.

02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:49.840
Have you had dark periods in your own life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind,

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:57.520
where it was difficult, like self-doubt, difficult to know, like, what the hell am I doing when

02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:03.280
you're surrounded by colleagues and people? You said prestigious universities, both personal

02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:10.800
interests of career, but also as a human being when everybody, you know, kind of looks at you

02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:17.360
funny because you're studying this thing. Did that ever get you real low?

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.880
No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:26.000
If I were you, I'd be asking me that question, too.

02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:28.800
And what's wrong with you?

02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:35.520
Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am.

02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:42.560
I really don't. But the truth is, no, I have, if my wife were sitting here, she'd tell you

02:41:43.120 --> 02:41:48.160
what she tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true.

02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:54.320
But then again, luck never is the only explanation for things that's part of it.

02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:02.880
What can I say? I didn't choose the time of my birth. I didn't choose

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.960
the communities in which I grew up or the schools I attended or anything else.

02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:11.680
No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on Marxian economics.

02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:17.040
But you know, again, I'm haggled. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.

02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:22.400
On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:29.040
when you do that is very different. I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook,

02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:35.200
taking notes of what the great professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam.

02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:45.360
I don't have an exam. I'm doing something slightly risqué, you know, kind of romantically different

02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:53.200
and oppositional. I was able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to

02:42:53.280 --> 02:43:00.160
outside of the classroom situation, other students who felt enough similar to me

02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:05.440
that we could get together and read these books and talk about them. I had a number of really

02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:13.200
fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me of their time and their effort to teach me

02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:19.280
along the way. And I've had the benefit that because I went to all these fancy schools,

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:26.400
I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture. And when I have been put in

02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:32.480
difficult positions, I often waive my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They're

02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:39.760
back away. They're back away. Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic

02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.440
prestige. But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken

02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:53.600
by this. You have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.

02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:58.080
Well, I would put it, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little differently.

02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:06.160
I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system.

02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:12.720
And nothing has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development

02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:26.240
just kept giving me more and more evidence. And I must say over the last 10 years,

02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:33.280
what's really changed the last 10 years. I mean, I can't describe to you how big that changes.

02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:35.760
And that may be more important than anything else we've discussed.

02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:45.600
Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or a radio thing or

02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.960
give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months, I'd be invited

02:44:52.960 --> 02:45:00.800
and I would do it. Like academics often do. I now do two to three to four interviews every day.

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:08.000
So does a hunger, wow, is there a hunger? It's fascinating.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.640
And I want to be honest with you. As I say at the end of some of my talks,

02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:17.360
I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause from the podium, you know,

02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:24.720
that I lean into the microphone and I say with as much smile as I can get, I'm having a time of my

02:45:24.720 --> 02:45:34.240
life. And that's the truth. I never expected, look, I'm used to teaching a classroom,

02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:40.560
a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students, or a regular undergraduate

02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:46.240
class with 30 or an occasional introductory course with a few hundred. I've done all of those

02:45:46.240 --> 02:45:55.520
things many times, but an audience, you know, that I can count in the hundreds of thousands

02:45:55.520 --> 02:46:04.560
on YouTube and all of that. No, that's new. Is there advice you can give given your bold and

02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:11.760
nonstandard career and life advice you can give to high school students, college students about

02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:17.440
how to have a career like that, or maybe how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?

02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:28.800
Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely

02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:37.440
better than they were when I had to do it. And I could do it. And I can, I'm happy I did it.

02:46:37.440 --> 02:46:42.160
Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made that I've never regretted.

02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:53.760
And I've never regretted being a critic of this society. Never. I find it edifying. I find it,

02:46:55.200 --> 02:47:00.560
I mean, the gratitude people expressed to me for helping them see kind of what's going on

02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:06.000
is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you? So that feels you,

02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:12.880
pointing out that the emperor has no clothes, it feels you, that's a life not just important.

02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:19.760
Because most of the people who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the

02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:26.240
vocabulary and some of them do, would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that

02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:33.120
outfit that I was wearing. I thought it and they did. And all they needed was a little extra,

02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:40.960
this information or that factoid or this logic. And they have that. And I remember having that too.

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:47.840
When I had a teacher who made something clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude.

02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:55.280
And now I get that gratitude, a good bit. And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm not

02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:04.720
sure I could get it any other way. And I have learned and I'm walking proof that being a

02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:12.480
critic of society and doing it systematically and sharing it with other people makes for a

02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:22.080
very good life, a very good life. Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature

02:48:22.160 --> 02:48:27.680
is that life comes to an end. Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?

02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:36.800
Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes. Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought, you know,

02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:45.680
death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead, you know. I worry more about my

02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:50.960
wife. I'm very attached to my wife. I might mention to you, I got married when I was 23

02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:59.680
years old and that's my wife to this day. So I'm lucky because if you get married to anybody

02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:09.200
at age 23, it's either luck or it isn't. What role has love played in your life? Enormous.

02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:16.560
Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mind

02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:24.320
who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:33.440
find another life income and job and the disruption goes real deep for any refugee. So

02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:40.240
my mother and father were both refugees. They met as refugees.

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:50.720
So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had to be, I was the first child of their,

02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:57.920
I have a younger sister, but I was the first child and, you know, there's a lot of psychological

02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:04.640
pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm, but you've got to do

02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:11.520
what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do. It's the closest

02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:18.080
they're going to get to what they had hoped and my parents were both university students.

02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:23.360
My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:32.640
So I had to perform, you know. I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get all

02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:37.440
A's. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to do all

02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:44.800
these because everything had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that way.

02:50:45.600 --> 02:50:49.200
But that's functional in this dysfunctional society.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:55.440
But on top of that, that's an achievement within the game of this particular society,

02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:00.640
but then love seems to be a thing that's greater than that game. Is that something

02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:06.320
that made you a better person? How was it made you a better Marxian and a better...

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:12.480
Everything because my wife, my wife by profession is a psychotherapist.

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:14.240
Excellent. I love it.

02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:16.160
And I needed it. Yeah.

02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:21.120
And so I married it. I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but I think,

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:25.920
as I look back on it, that was more than a little what was going on.

02:51:26.720 --> 02:51:32.080
And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life

02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:40.800
that my family never talked about, never dealt with, never, at least explicitly

02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:43.200
engaged in any of that.

02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:46.800
Because it was all about survival, the immigrant challenges, survival.

02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:53.040
Survive, survive. And you're so busy that you tell yourself you can't do that.

02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:58.240
Of course, you can. And there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those problems.

02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:05.520
But the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way. And my parents did that.

02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:11.760
One last question. What's the meaning of life, Richard Wolff? Why are we here?

02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:13.280
I will quote you, Mr. Marx.

02:52:14.880 --> 02:52:15.360
Let's go.

02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:25.760
Life is struggle. And for me, I have found that to be true, that the struggle,

02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:31.840
whether it is to build a relationship with your child, I have two children,

02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:39.280
whether it's to build one with your spouse, whether it's to understand a complicated argument

02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:46.800
and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this relationship

02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:53.040
to a student or to an audience. These are, it's a struggle to do all those things.

02:52:53.600 --> 02:53:03.760
But that network of struggles, that makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.

02:53:04.480 --> 02:53:06.640
And meaningful. And very meaningful.

02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:11.040
And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully. You're one of the great communicators

02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:16.240
and educators out there today. And it's a huge honor that you have sit with me for so many hours.

02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:21.200
Thank you. This is awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.

And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:34.080
The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:37.760
The point, however, is to change it.

02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:45.200
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
