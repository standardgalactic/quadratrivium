WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
This idea of disk, distributed idea suppression complex, is that what's bringing the elons

00:11.160 --> 00:13.040
of the world down?

00:13.040 --> 00:17.600
You know, it's so funny, like he's asking Joe Rogan, like, is that a joint?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.760
You know, it's like, well, what will happen if I smoke it?

00:19.760 --> 00:21.560
What will happen to the stock price?

00:21.560 --> 00:24.480
What will happen if I scratch myself in public?

00:24.480 --> 00:29.760
What will happen if I say what I think about Thailand, or COVID, or who knows what?

00:29.760 --> 00:31.920
And everybody's like, don't say that.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.920
Say this.

00:32.920 --> 00:33.920
Go do this.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.920
Go do that.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.320
Well, it's crazy making.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.200
It's absolutely crazy making.

00:38.200 --> 00:46.520
And if you think about what we put through, people through, we need to get people who

00:46.520 --> 00:52.920
can use FU money, the FU money they need to insulate themselves from all of the people

00:53.040 --> 00:54.040
who know better.

00:54.040 --> 00:59.320
Because my nightmare is that, why did we only get one elon?

00:59.320 --> 01:02.740
What if we were supposed to have thousands and thousands of elons?

01:02.740 --> 01:06.560
And the weird thing is, like, this is all that remains.

01:06.560 --> 01:10.520
You're looking at, like, Obi-Wan and Yoda.

01:10.520 --> 01:18.000
And it's like, this is the only, this is all that's left after Order 66 has been executed.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.320
And that's the thing that's really upsetting to me, is we used to have elons five deep.

01:22.320 --> 01:27.080
And then we could talk about elon in the context of his cohort.

01:27.080 --> 01:31.800
But this is like, if you were to see a giraffe in the Arctic with no trees around, you'd

01:31.800 --> 01:33.920
think, why the long neck?

01:33.920 --> 01:36.640
What a strange sight, you know?

01:36.640 --> 01:39.120
How do we get more elons?

01:39.120 --> 01:40.280
How do we change things?

01:40.280 --> 01:46.320
So I think they use, so we know MIT and Harvard.

01:46.320 --> 01:51.560
So maybe returning to our previous conversation, my sense is that the elons of the world are

01:51.560 --> 01:54.760
supposed to come from MIT and Harvard.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.520
And how do you change?

01:56.520 --> 02:00.720
Let's think of one that MIT sort of killed.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.360
Have any names in mind?

02:03.360 --> 02:06.120
Aaron Schwartz leaps to my mind.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.120
Yeah.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.120
Okay.

02:08.120 --> 02:17.120
Are we MIT supposed to shield the Aaron Schwartz's from, I don't know, journal publishers?

02:17.120 --> 02:21.840
Or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that we can throw 35-year sentences in

02:21.840 --> 02:24.880
his face or whatever it is that we did that depressed him?

02:24.880 --> 02:25.880
Okay.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.360
So here's my point.

02:27.360 --> 02:33.520
I want MIT to go back to being the home of Aaron Schwartz.

02:33.520 --> 02:40.840
And if you want to send Aaron Schwartz to a state where he's looking at 35 years in

02:40.840 --> 02:44.600
prison or something like that, you are my sworn enemy.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.000
You are not MIT.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:47.160 --> 02:58.560
You are the traitorous, irresponsible, middle-brow, pencil-pushing, green-eye-shade fool that

02:58.560 --> 03:02.240
needs to not be in the seat at the presidency of MIT.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
Period.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
The end.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.280
Get the fuck out of there and let one of our people sit in that chair.

03:07.280 --> 03:13.360
And the thing that you've articulated is that the people in those chairs are not the way

03:13.440 --> 03:20.000
they are because they're evil or somehow morally compromised is that it's just that's the distributed

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
nature.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.920
Is that there's some kind of aspect of the system that's just...

03:22.920 --> 03:26.720
These are people who wed themselves to the system.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.800
They adapt every instinct.

03:28.800 --> 03:35.280
And the fact is that they're not going to be on Joe Rogan smoking a blunt.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.360
Let me ask a silly question.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.320
Do you think institutions generally just tend to become that?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.080
No.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.880
We get some of the institutions.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.880
We get Caltech.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.640
Here's what we're supposed to have.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.000
We're supposed to have Caltech.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.040
We're supposed to have Reed.

03:50.040 --> 03:53.200
We're supposed to have Deep Springs.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.400
We're supposed to have MIT.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.680
We're supposed to have a part of Harvard.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.520
And when the sharp elbow crowd comes after the sharp mind crowd, we're supposed to break

04:02.520 --> 04:06.040
those sharp elbows and say, don't come around here again.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.920
So what are the weapons that the sharp minds are supposed to use in our modern day?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.560
To reclaim MIT.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.200
What is the future?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.760
Are you kidding me?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.720
First of all, assume that this is being seen at MIT.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.720
Hey, everybody.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.720
Definitely is.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.720
Okay.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.400
Hey, everybody.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.480
Try to remember who you are.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.080
You're the guys who put the police car on top of the great dump.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.280
You guys came up with the great breast of knowledge.

04:32.280 --> 04:35.600
You created a Tetris game in the green building.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.680
Now, what is your problem?

04:38.680 --> 04:40.600
They killed one of your own.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.160
You should make their life a living hell.

04:44.160 --> 04:49.880
You should be the ones who keep the memory of Aaron Schwartz alive and all of those hackers

04:49.880 --> 04:52.880
and all of those mutants.

04:52.880 --> 04:57.400
You know, it's like it's either our place or it isn't.

04:57.400 --> 05:05.400
And if we have to throw 12 more pianos off of the roof, right, if Harold Edgerton was

05:05.400 --> 05:14.880
taking those photographs, you know, with Slow Mo back in the 40s, if Noam Chomsky is on

05:14.880 --> 05:19.280
your faculty, what the hell is wrong with you kids?

05:19.280 --> 05:23.520
You are the most creative and insightful people and you can't figure out how to defend Aaron

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
Schwartz.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
That's on you guys.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.120
So, some of that is giving more power to the young, like you said, to the brave, to the

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
bold.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.640
No, taking power from the feeble and the middle brown.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.680
Yeah, but what is the mechanism?

05:35.680 --> 05:36.680
To me, I don't know.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.160
Do you have some nine-volt batteries?

05:38.160 --> 05:39.160
No.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.160
It's a copper wire?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.160
I tend to...

05:43.160 --> 05:44.760
Do you have a capacitor?

05:44.760 --> 05:51.240
I tend to believe you have to create an alternative and make the alternative so much better that

05:51.240 --> 05:55.920
it makes MIT obsolete unless they change.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.360
And that's what forces change, so as opposed to somehow...

05:59.360 --> 06:02.240
Okay, so use projection mapping.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.520
What's projection mapping?

06:03.520 --> 06:08.040
Where you take some complicated edifice and you map all of its planes and then you actually

06:08.040 --> 06:12.440
project some unbelievable graphics, reskinning a building, let's say, at night.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
That's right.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
Yeah.

06:14.440 --> 06:15.440
Okay, so you want to do some graffiti art with light?

06:15.440 --> 06:16.680
You basically want to hack the system.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.680
No, I'm saying...

06:17.680 --> 06:19.680
Look, listen to me, Len.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.880
We're smarter than they are.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.880
And they...

06:22.880 --> 06:23.880
You know what they say?

06:23.880 --> 06:27.320
They say things like, I think we need some geeks.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.240
Get me two PhDs.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.480
Right.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.240
You treat PhDs like that.

06:32.240 --> 06:39.320
That's a bad move, because PhDs are capable and we act like our job is to peel grapes

06:39.320 --> 06:40.320
for our betters.

06:40.320 --> 06:46.280
Yeah, that's a strange thing and you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat

06:46.280 --> 06:54.680
basically the greatest minds in the world, which is like at the prime, which is PhD students.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.960
We pay them nothing.

06:57.960 --> 06:58.960
I'm done with it.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.960
Yeah.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.960
Right?

07:00.960 --> 07:01.960
We got to take what's ours.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.680
Yeah.

07:03.680 --> 07:10.160
Take back MIT, become ungovernable, become ungovernable.

07:10.160 --> 07:15.680
And by the way, when you become ungovernable, don't do it by throwing food.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.160
Don't do it by pouring salt on the lawn like a jerk.

07:19.160 --> 07:24.680
Do it through brilliance, because what you Caltech and MIT can do, and maybe Rensselaer

07:24.680 --> 07:29.960
Polytechnic or Worcester Polytech, I don't know, Lehigh, God damn it, what's wrong with

07:29.960 --> 07:31.120
you technical people?

07:31.120 --> 07:34.200
You act like you're a servant class.

07:34.200 --> 07:39.320
It's unclear to me how you reclaim it, except with brilliance, like you said.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.320
But to me, that the way you reclaim it with brilliance is to go outside the system.

07:43.320 --> 07:48.960
Aaron Schwartz came from the Elon Musk class, what you guys are going to do about it, right?

07:48.960 --> 07:55.080
The super capable people need to flex, need to be individual, they need to stop giving

07:55.080 --> 08:00.120
away all their power to a zeitgeist or a community or this or that.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.000
You're not indoor cats, you're outdoor cats, go be outdoor cats.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Do you think we're going to see this kind of change happen?

08:05.000 --> 08:09.040
You were the one asking me before, like what about the World War II generation?

08:09.040 --> 08:13.480
What I'm trying to say is that there's a technical revolt coming.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.480
You want to talk about this?

08:14.480 --> 08:15.480
But I'm trying to lead it.

08:15.480 --> 08:16.480
Really?

08:16.480 --> 08:17.480
I'm trying to see.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.480
No, you're not trying to lead it.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.480
I'm trying to get a blueprint here.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.480
All right, Lex.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.480
Yeah.

08:21.480 --> 08:26.120
How angry are you about our country pretending that you and I can't actually do technical

08:26.120 --> 08:32.440
subjects so that they need an army of kids coming in from four countries in Asia?

08:32.440 --> 08:35.960
It's not about the four countries in Asia, it's not about those kids.

08:35.960 --> 08:40.240
It's about lying about us, that we don't care enough about science and technology, that

08:40.240 --> 08:47.280
we're incapable of it, as if we don't have Chinese and Russians and Koreans and Croatians.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.480
We've got everybody here.

08:49.480 --> 08:53.720
The only reason you're looking outside is that you want to hire cheap people from the

08:53.720 --> 08:57.720
family business because you don't want to pass the family business on.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.320
You know what?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.320
You didn't really build the family business.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.600
It's not yours to decide.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.860
You the boomers and you the silent generation, you did your bit, but you also fouled a lot

09:07.860 --> 09:11.680
of stuff up and you're custodians.

09:11.680 --> 09:12.880
You are caretakers.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.600
You were supposed to hand something.

09:14.600 --> 09:20.400
What you did instead was to gorge yourself on cheap foreign labor, which you then held

09:20.400 --> 09:24.960
up as being much more brilliant than your own children, which was never true.

09:24.960 --> 09:32.080
See, but I'm trying to understand how we create a better system without anger, without revolution.

09:32.080 --> 09:38.160
Not by kissing and hugs.

09:38.160 --> 09:43.040
I don't understand within MIT what the mechanism of building a better MIT is.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.720
We're not going to pay all severe.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.000
Aaron Schwartz was right.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.640
JSTOR is an abomination.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.040
Who within MIT, who within institutions is going to do that when, just like you said,

09:55.040 --> 09:57.560
the people who are running the show are more senior.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.560
I don't know.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.560
Did Frank Wilczek just speak out?

10:01.560 --> 10:04.420
So you're basically individuals that step up.

10:04.420 --> 10:10.080
One of the surprising things about Elon is that one person can inspire so much.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.400
He's got academic freedom.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.920
It just comes from money.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.920
I don't agree with that.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
You think money?

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
Okay.

10:18.920 --> 10:19.920
So, yes.

10:19.920 --> 10:20.920
Certainly.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.920
Sorry.

10:21.920 --> 10:22.920
And testicles.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.920
Yes.

10:23.920 --> 10:28.920
But I think that testicles is more important than money or guts.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.440
I do agree with you.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.300
You speak about this a lot that because the money in the academic institutions has been

10:34.300 --> 10:39.840
so constrained that people are misbehaving and horrible.

10:39.840 --> 10:44.520
But I don't think that if we reverse that and give a huge amount of money, people will

10:44.520 --> 10:45.600
all of a sudden behave well.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.840
I think it also takes guts.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.400
No, you need to give people security.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
Security, yes.

10:49.400 --> 10:55.960
Like, you need to know that you have a job on Monday when on Friday you say, I'm not

10:55.960 --> 10:59.320
so sure I really love diversity and inclusion.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.080
And somebody's like, wait, what?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.560
You didn't love diversity?

11:02.560 --> 11:05.240
We had a statement on diversity and you wouldn't sign?

11:05.240 --> 11:08.240
Are you against the inclusion part or are you against diversity?

11:08.240 --> 11:09.960
Do you just not like people like you?

11:09.960 --> 11:13.160
You're like, actually, that has nothing to do with anything.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.080
You're making this into something that it isn't.

11:15.080 --> 11:20.000
I don't want to sign your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.120
Get out of my lab.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.160
It all begins from the middle finger.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.600
Get out of my lab.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.800
The administrators need to find other work.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.800
Yeah.

11:29.800 --> 11:38.040
Listen, I agree with you and I hope to seek your advice and wisdom as we change this because

11:38.040 --> 11:39.040
I'd love to see.

11:39.040 --> 11:43.480
I will visit you in prison if that's what you're asking.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.120
I think prison is great.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.280
You get a lot of reading done and good working out.

11:49.280 --> 11:57.160
Well, let me ask something I brought up before is the Nietzsche quote of, beware that when

11:57.160 --> 12:01.440
fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster for when you gaze long into the

12:01.440 --> 12:05.360
abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

12:05.360 --> 12:09.240
Are you worried that your focus on the flaws in the system that we've just been talking

12:09.240 --> 12:15.320
about has damaged your mind or the part of the mind of your mind that's able to see the

12:15.320 --> 12:19.560
beauty in the world in the system?

12:19.560 --> 12:26.560
Because you have so sharply been able to see the flaws in the system, you can no longer

12:26.560 --> 12:28.480
step back and appreciate its beauty.

12:28.480 --> 12:34.600
Look, I'm the one who's trying to get the institutions to save themselves by getting

12:34.600 --> 12:40.360
rid of their inhabitants, but leaving the institution like a neutron bomb that removes

12:40.360 --> 12:45.560
the unworkable leadership class, but leaves the structures.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.320
So the leadership class is really the problem.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.320
The leadership class is the problem.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.960
But the individual like the professors, the individual scholars.

12:51.960 --> 12:58.200
The professors are going to have to go back into training to remember how to be professors.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.280
People are cowards at the moment because if they're not cowards, they're unemployed.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.880
Yeah, that's one of the disappointing things I've encountered is, to me, tenure.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.000
But nobody has tenure now.

13:14.040 --> 13:23.640
Whether they do or not, they certainly don't have the kind of character and fortitude that I was

13:23.640 --> 13:25.880
hoping to see.

13:25.880 --> 13:26.600
But they'd be gone.

13:26.840 --> 13:33.880
But you're dreaming about the people who used to live at MIT.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.320
You're dreaming about the previous inhabitants of your university.

13:40.120 --> 13:46.760
And if you looked at somebody like Isidore Singer is very old, I don't know what state he's in,

13:46.760 --> 13:49.400
but that guy was absolutely the real deal.

13:49.400 --> 13:53.560
And if you look at Noam Chomsky, tell me that Noam Chomsky has been muzzled.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.160
Right?

13:55.160 --> 13:55.400
Yeah.

13:56.040 --> 14:01.080
Now, what I'm trying to get at is you're talking about younger, energetic people.

14:01.080 --> 14:08.200
But those people, like when I say something like, I'm against, I'm for inclusion and I'm

14:08.200 --> 14:13.480
for diversity, but I'm against diversity and inclusion, TM, like the movement.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.320
Well, I couldn't say that if I was a professor.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.800
Oh my God, he's against our sacred document.

14:21.800 --> 14:26.840
Okay. Well, in that kind of a world, do you want to know how many things I don't agree with you

14:26.840 --> 14:27.480
on?

14:27.480 --> 14:31.640
Like we could go on for days and days and days, all of the nonsense that you've parroted

14:31.640 --> 14:32.920
inside of the institution.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.200
Any sane person has no need for it.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.200
They have no want or desire.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.640
Do you think you have to have some patience for nonsense

14:44.680 --> 14:47.240
when many people work together in a system?

14:47.240 --> 14:50.200
How long has string theory gone on for and how long have I been patient?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.240
Okay, so you're talking about, there's a limit to patience.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.880
You're talking about like 36 years of modern nonsense in string theory.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.760
So you can do like eight to 10 years, but not more.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.440
I can do 40 minutes.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.080
This is 36 years.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.840
Well, you've done that over two hours already.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.280
No, but I appreciate it.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.880
But it's been 36 years of nonsense since the anomaly cancellation in string theory.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.680
It's like, what are you talking about about patience?

15:16.680 --> 15:19.800
I mean, Lex, you're not even acting like yourself.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.480
Well, you're trying to stay in the system.

15:23.480 --> 15:32.600
I'm not trying to see if perhaps, so my hope is that the system just has a few assholes in it,

15:32.600 --> 15:38.520
which you highlight and the fundamentals of the system are broken.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.640
Because if the fundamentals of the systems are broken,

15:41.640 --> 15:44.680
then I just don't see a way for MIT to succeed.

15:45.640 --> 15:50.120
Like, I don't see how young people take over MIT.

15:50.120 --> 15:50.760
I don't see how...

15:52.760 --> 15:54.040
By inspiring us.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.560
You know, the great part about being at MIT,

15:58.280 --> 16:04.040
like when you saw the genius in these pranks, the heart, the irreverence.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.120
And we were talking about Tom Lehrer the last time.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.560
Tom Lehrer was as naughty as the day is long.

16:11.560 --> 16:12.280
Agreed?

16:12.280 --> 16:13.160
Agreed.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.600
Was he also a genius?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.640
Was he well-spoken?

16:15.640 --> 16:16.920
Was he highly cultured?

16:17.720 --> 16:22.680
He was so talented, so intellectual that he could just make fart jokes morning, noon, and night.

16:22.680 --> 16:23.320
Yeah.

16:23.320 --> 16:23.560
Okay.

16:24.280 --> 16:29.640
Well, in part, the right to make fart jokes, the right to, for example, put a functioning phone

16:29.640 --> 16:35.400
booth that was ringing on top of the great dome at MIT has to do with, we are such bad asses that

16:35.400 --> 16:36.760
we can actually do this stuff.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.640
Well, don't tell me about it anymore.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.600
Go break the law.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.040
Go break the law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute you.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.920
Break the law in a way that lets us know that you're calling us out on our bullshit,

16:50.920 --> 16:57.160
that you're filled with love, and that our technical talent has not gone to sleep.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.360
It's not incapable.

16:59.080 --> 17:03.400
You know, and if the idea is, is that you're going to dig a moat around the university and

17:03.400 --> 17:08.840
fill it with tiger sharks, that's awesome, because I don't know how you're going to do it.

17:08.840 --> 17:14.600
But if you actually manage to do that, I'm not going to prosecute you under a reckless endangerment.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.080
That's beautifully put.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.960
I hope those, first of all, they'll listen.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.960
I hope young people at MIT will take over in this kind of way.

17:25.000 --> 17:33.240
In the introduction to your podcast episode on Jeff Epstein, you give to me a really moving

17:33.240 --> 17:40.120
story, but unfortunately for me, too brief about your experience with a therapist and

17:40.120 --> 17:47.400
the lasting terror that permeated your mind. Can you, can you go there? Can you tell?

17:48.040 --> 17:52.440
No, thanks. I mean, I appreciate what you're saying. I said it obliquely. I said enough.

17:54.680 --> 18:01.960
There are bad people who cross our paths, and the current vogue is to say, oh, I'm a survivor.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.080
I'm a victim. I can do anything I want.

18:08.440 --> 18:13.400
This is a broken person, and I don't know why I was sent to a broken person as a kid.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.920
And to be honest with you, I also felt like in that story, I say that I was able to say no,

18:19.720 --> 18:22.440
you know, and this was like the entire weight of authority.

18:23.720 --> 18:29.480
And he was misusing his position, and I was also able to say no.

18:29.800 --> 18:35.080
No. What I couldn't say no to was having him re-inflicted in my life.

18:36.280 --> 18:41.080
Right, so you were sent back a second time. I tried to complain about what had happened,

18:41.080 --> 18:48.760
and I tried to do it in a way that did not immediately cause horrific consequences to

18:48.760 --> 18:57.640
both this person and myself, because we don't have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior.

18:58.200 --> 19:05.240
We have nuclear weapons. We don't have any way of saying this is probably not a good place

19:05.240 --> 19:11.640
or a role for you at this moment as an authority figure, and something needs to be worked on.

19:11.640 --> 19:19.000
So in general, when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that way, our immediate instinct

19:19.000 --> 19:27.240
is to treat the person as, you know, Satan. And we understand why we don't want our children

19:27.240 --> 19:36.120
to be at risk. Now, I personally believe that I fell down on the job and did not call out the

19:36.120 --> 19:41.000
Jeffrey Epstein thing early enough because I was terrified of what Jeffrey Epstein represents,

19:41.000 --> 19:47.320
and this recapitulated the old terror trying to tell the world this therapist is out of control.

19:48.040 --> 19:53.400
And when I said that, the world responded by saying, well, you have two appointments booked,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.920
and you have to go for the second one. So I got reinflicted into this

19:58.040 --> 20:02.120
office on this person who was now convinced that I was about to tear down his career and his

20:02.120 --> 20:05.080
reputation. It might have been on the verge of suicide for all I know. I don't know.

20:06.040 --> 20:11.400
But he was very, very angry, and he was furious with me that I had breached a sacred confidence

20:11.400 --> 20:17.960
of his office. What kind of ripple effects has that had to the rest of your life,

20:19.240 --> 20:24.360
the absurdity and the cruelty of that? I mean, there's no sense to it.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.560
Well, see, this is the thing people don't really grasp, I think.

20:29.560 --> 20:40.440
There's an academic who I got to know many years ago named Jennifer Fried, who has a theory of

20:41.400 --> 20:46.840
betrayal, which she calls institutional betrayal. And her gambit is that when you were betrayed by

20:46.840 --> 20:53.480
an institution that is sort of like a fiduciary or a parental obligation to take care of you,

20:54.440 --> 21:00.360
that you find yourself in a far different situation with respect to trauma than if you

21:00.360 --> 21:08.040
were betrayed by somebody who's a peer. And so I think that in my situation,

21:10.280 --> 21:19.720
I kind of repeat a particular dynamic with authority. I come in not following all the rules,

21:19.880 --> 21:26.120
trying to do some things, not trying to do others, blah, blah, blah. And then I get into a weird

21:26.120 --> 21:30.920
relationship with authority. And so I have more experience with what I would call institutional

21:30.920 --> 21:40.680
betrayal. Now, the funny part about it is that when you don't have masks or PPE in a influenza-like

21:40.680 --> 21:47.720
pandemic, and you're missing ICU beds and ventilators, that is ubiquitous institutional

21:48.520 --> 21:55.080
betrayal. So I believe that in a weird way, I was very early. The idea of, and this is like

21:55.640 --> 22:02.600
the really hard concept, pervasive or otherwise universal institutional betrayal,

22:02.600 --> 22:07.960
where all of the institutions, you can count on any hospital to not charge you properly for

22:07.960 --> 22:13.640
where their services are. You can count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that

22:13.640 --> 22:19.960
will be maximally beneficial to the people who take it. You know that your financial professionals

22:19.960 --> 22:25.640
are not simply working in your best interests. And that issue had to do with the way in which

22:25.640 --> 22:31.400
growth left our system. So I think that the weird thing is, is that this first institutional

22:31.400 --> 22:37.400
betrayal by a therapist left me very open to the idea of, okay, well, maybe the schools are bad,

22:37.400 --> 22:41.800
maybe the hospitals are bad, maybe the drug companies are bad, maybe our food is off,

22:41.800 --> 22:47.880
maybe our journalists are not serving journalistic ends. And that was what allowed me to sort of go

22:47.880 --> 22:54.280
all the distance and say, huh, I wonder if our problem is that something is causing all of our

22:54.280 --> 23:01.240
sense-making institutions to be off. That was the big insight. And tying that to a single etiology,

23:02.200 --> 23:07.240
what if it's just about growth? They were all built on growth, and now we've promoted people who

23:07.240 --> 23:13.320
are capable of keeping quiet that their institutions aren't working. So the privileged

23:14.280 --> 23:20.280
silent aristocracy, the people who can be counted upon not to mention a fire when a raging fire

23:20.280 --> 23:27.800
is tearing through a building. But nevertheless, how big of a psychological burden is that?

23:28.520 --> 23:34.520
It's huge. It's terrible. It's crushing. It's very comforting to be the parental,

23:35.080 --> 23:43.640
I mean, I don't know, I treasure, I mean, we were just talking about MIT. I can intellectualize

23:43.640 --> 23:48.440
and agree with everything you're saying, but there's a comfort, a warm blanket of being within the

23:48.440 --> 23:55.480
institution. And up until Aaron Schwartz, let's say. In other words, now, if I look at

23:56.040 --> 24:00.760
the provost and the president as mommy and daddy, you did what to my big brother?

24:01.080 --> 24:11.240
You did what to our family? You sold us out in which way? What secrets left for China?

24:11.800 --> 24:18.200
You hired which workforce? You did what to my wages? You took this portion of my grant for what

24:18.200 --> 24:24.120
purpose? You just stole my retirement through a fringe rate. What did you do? But can you still,

24:24.120 --> 24:31.320
I mean, the thing is about this view you have, is it often turns out to be sadly correct?

24:31.320 --> 24:36.360
Well, this is the thing. But let me just, in this silly, hopeful thing,

24:37.400 --> 24:42.040
do you still have hope in institutions? Can you within your, psychologically?

24:42.040 --> 24:47.480
Yes. I'm referring not intellectually, because you have to carry this burden. Can you still have

24:47.480 --> 24:55.080
a hope like within you? When you sit at home alone, and as opposed to seeing the darkness

24:55.080 --> 25:00.200
within these institutions, seeing a hope. Well, but this is the thing I want to confront,

25:01.640 --> 25:08.200
not for the purpose of a dust-up. I believe, for example, if you've heard episode 19,

25:08.200 --> 25:15.720
that the best outcome is for Carol Greider to come forward as we discussed in episode 19.

25:15.800 --> 25:17.240
Would your brother, Brett, want to start an episode?

25:17.240 --> 25:23.160
And say, you know what? I screwed up. He did call. He did suggest the experiment.

25:23.800 --> 25:29.160
I didn't understand that it was his theory that was producing it. Maybe I was slow to grasp it.

25:30.280 --> 25:39.880
But my bad, and I don't want to pay for this bad choice on my part, let's say,

25:40.200 --> 25:44.760
for the rest of my career. I want to own up, and I want to help make sure that

25:46.200 --> 25:48.120
we do what's right with what's left.

25:48.120 --> 25:51.720
And that's one little case within the institution that you would like to see made?

25:51.720 --> 25:57.560
I would like to see MIT very clearly come out and say, you know, Margot O'Toole was right when

25:57.560 --> 26:06.120
she said David Baltimore's lab here produced some stuff that was not reproducible with

26:06.200 --> 26:13.160
Teresa Minishikari's research. I want to see the courageous people. I would like to see the

26:13.160 --> 26:19.560
Aaron Schwartz wing of the computer science department. Yeah, let's think about it.

26:20.440 --> 26:25.240
Wouldn't that be great if we said, you know, an injustice was done, and we're going to write

26:25.240 --> 26:31.160
that wrong just as if this was Alan Turing? Which I don't think they've righted that wrong.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.840
Well, then let's have the Turing Schwartz wing. The Turing Schwartz, they're starting a new

26:36.840 --> 26:40.280
college of computing. It wouldn't be wonderful to call it the Turing Schwartz.

26:40.280 --> 26:45.000
I would like to have the Madame Wu wing of the physics department, and I'd love to have the

26:45.000 --> 26:50.120
Emmy Nerder statue in front of the math department. I mean, like, you want to get excited about

26:50.120 --> 26:54.760
actual diversity and inclusion? Yeah. Well, let's go with our absolute best people who

26:54.760 --> 27:00.840
never got theirs because there is structural bigotry, you know? But if we don't actually

27:00.840 --> 27:05.800
start celebrating the beautiful stuff that we're capable of when we're handed heroes and we fumble

27:05.800 --> 27:15.160
them into the trash, what the hell? I mean, Lex, this is such nonsense. We're just pulling our head

27:16.680 --> 27:24.120
out. You know, on everyone's seekum should be tattooed. If you can read this, you're too close.

27:24.760 --> 27:35.160
Beautifully put, and I'm a dreamer just like you. So I don't see as much of the darkness

27:36.360 --> 27:43.720
genetically or due to my life experience, but I do share the hope. For my tea,

27:43.720 --> 27:48.520
the institution that we care a lot about. You both do. Yeah. And Harvard institution,

27:48.520 --> 27:53.880
I don't give a damn about, but you do. I love Harvard. I'm just kidding. I love Harvard,

27:53.880 --> 27:57.640
but Harvard and I have a very difficult relationship. And part of what, you know,

27:57.640 --> 28:04.440
when you love a family that isn't working, I don't want to trash. I didn't bring up the name of the

28:04.440 --> 28:11.960
president of MIT during the Aaron Schwartz period. It's not vengeance. I want the rot cleared out.

28:11.960 --> 28:18.840
I don't need to go after human beings. Yeah. Just like you said, with the disc formulation,

28:19.400 --> 28:23.720
the individual human beings don't necessarily carry them.

28:25.800 --> 28:31.160
It's those chairs that are so powerful that in which they sit. It's the chairs, not the humans.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.440
It's not the humans.
