00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
There is a certain perspective where you might be thinking, what is the longest possible

00:03.440 --> 00:04.840
game that you could be playing?

00:04.840 --> 00:09.040
A short game is, for instance, cancer is playing a shorter game than your organism.

00:09.040 --> 00:14.000
Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.160
Because the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism except for some infectious cancers,

00:20.160 --> 00:26.840
like the ones that eradicated the Tasmanian devils, you typically end up with a situation

00:26.840 --> 00:30.840
where the organism dies together with the cancer, because the cancer has destroyed the

00:30.840 --> 00:33.680
larger system due to playing a shorter game.

00:33.680 --> 00:39.760
And so ideally, you want to, I think, build agents that play the longest possible games.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.800
And the longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible by doing

00:44.800 --> 00:48.080
interesting stuff.

00:48.080 --> 00:52.240
The following is a conversation with Yoshabak, his third time on this podcast.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.240
Yoshabak is one of the most brilliant and fascinating minds in the world, exploring

00:56.240 --> 01:00.440
the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and computation.

01:00.440 --> 01:06.280
And he's one of my favorite humans to talk to about pretty much anything and everything.

01:06.280 --> 01:11.520
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, the supported, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.720
And now, dear friends, here's Yoshabak.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.320
You wrote a post about levels of lucidity.

01:19.760 --> 01:25.920
Quote, as we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually

01:25.920 --> 01:32.240
accumulating ideas about itself, but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.480
So there's seven of the stages.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.240
Stage one, reactive survival infant.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.920
Stage two, personal self, young child.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.000
Stage three, social self, adolescents, domesticated adult.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.400
Stage four is rational agency, self-direction.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.800
Stage five is self-authoring.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.800
That's full adult.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.600
You've achieved wisdom, but there's two more stages.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.840
Stage six is enlightenment.

01:56.840 --> 01:58.920
Stage seven is transcendence.

01:58.920 --> 02:04.160
Can you explain each or the interesting parts of each of these stages and what's your sense

02:04.160 --> 02:11.800
why there are stages of this, of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
life?

02:12.800 --> 02:20.600
This model is derived from a concept by the psychologist Robert Keegan, and he talks

02:20.600 --> 02:26.680
about the development of the self as a process that happens in principle by some kind of

02:26.680 --> 02:30.680
reverse engineering of a mind where you gradually become aware of yourself and thereby build

02:30.680 --> 02:35.600
structure that allows you to interact deeper with the world and yourself.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.200
And I found myself using this model not so much as a developmental model.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.560
I'm not even sure if it's a very good developmental model because I saw my children not progressing

02:44.560 --> 02:50.560
exactly like that, and I also suspect that you don't go through these stages necessarily

02:50.560 --> 02:54.240
in succession, and it's not that you work through one stage and then you get into the

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
next one.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.320
Sometimes you revisit them.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.240
Sometimes stuff is happening in parallel.

02:59.240 --> 03:03.960
But it's, I think, a useful framework to look at what's present in the structure of a person

03:03.960 --> 03:07.680
and how they interact with the world and how they relate to themselves.

03:07.680 --> 03:13.160
So it's more like a philosophical framework that allows you to talk about how minds work.

03:13.160 --> 03:17.520
And at first, when we are born, we don't have a personal self yet, I think.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.600
Instead, we have an attentional self, and this attentional self is initially in the

03:21.600 --> 03:26.520
infant task, is building a world model, and also an initial model of the self.

03:26.520 --> 03:31.720
But mostly it's building a game engine in the brain that is tracking sensory data and

03:31.720 --> 03:34.360
uses it to explain it.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.120
In some sense, you could compare it to a game engine like Minecraft or so, so colors and

03:39.120 --> 03:40.880
sounds.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.680
People are all not physical objects, they are creation of our mind at a certain level

03:44.680 --> 03:46.600
of coarse graining.

03:46.600 --> 03:54.520
Models that are mathematical, that use geometry, that use manipulation of objects and so on

03:54.520 --> 03:59.400
to create scenes in which we can find ourselves and interact with them.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
So Minecraft.

04:00.440 --> 04:05.760
Yeah, and this personal self is something that is more or less created after the world

04:05.760 --> 04:11.560
is finished, after it's trained into the system, after it has been constructed.

04:11.560 --> 04:16.120
And this personal self is an agent that interacts with the outside world.

04:16.120 --> 04:21.240
And the outside world is not the world of quantum mechanics, not the physical universe,

04:21.240 --> 04:24.960
but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.840
And this is us, and we experience ourselves interacting with that outside world that is

04:29.880 --> 04:32.000
created on the outside of our own mind.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.920
And outside of our self, there are feelings, and they presented our interface to this outside

04:37.920 --> 04:38.920
world.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.640
They pose problems to us.

04:40.640 --> 04:45.080
These feelings are basically attitudes that our mind is computing that tell us what's

04:45.080 --> 04:49.920
needed in the world, the things that we are drawn to, the things that we are afraid of.

04:49.920 --> 04:56.440
And we are tasked with solving this problem of satisfying the needs, avoiding the aversions,

04:56.480 --> 05:01.080
solving on our inner commitments, and so on, and also modeling ourselves and building

05:01.080 --> 05:02.080
the next stage.

05:02.080 --> 05:08.680
So after we have this personal self and stage two online, many people form a social self.

05:08.680 --> 05:14.560
And this social self allows the individual to experience themselves as part of a group.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.560
It's basically this thing that when you are playing in a team, for instance, you don't

05:18.560 --> 05:22.880
notice yourself just as a single note that is reaching out into the world, but you're

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
also looking down.

05:24.320 --> 05:29.720
From this entire group and you see how this group is looking at this individual and everybody

05:29.720 --> 05:34.640
in the group is in some sense emulating this group spirit to some degree.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.560
And in this state, people are forming their opinions by assimilating them from this group

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
mind.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.160
Basically, gain the ability to act a little bit like a hive mind.

05:43.160 --> 05:48.080
But are you also modeling the interaction of how opinion shapes and forms through the

05:48.080 --> 05:51.400
interaction of the individual nodes within the group?

05:51.840 --> 05:57.720
Yeah, it's basically the way in which people do it in a stage is that they experience what

05:57.720 --> 06:03.040
are the opinions of my environment, they experience the relationship that I have to their environment,

06:03.040 --> 06:09.560
and they resonate with people around them and get more opinions through this interaction

06:09.560 --> 06:13.720
to the way in which they relate to others.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.520
And at stage four, you basically understand that stuff is true and false independently

06:18.560 --> 06:22.560
about other people believe and you have agency over your own beliefs in that stage.

06:22.560 --> 06:27.800
You basically discover epistemology, the rules about determining what's true and false.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.160
So you can start to learn how to think?

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
Yes.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.120
I mean, at some level, you're always thinking you are constructing things and I believe

06:36.120 --> 06:41.200
that this ability to reason about your mental representation is what we mean by thinking.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.920
It's an intrinsically reflexive process that requires consciousness.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.120
Without consciousness, you cannot think.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.000
You can generate the content of feelings and so on outside of consciousness.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.040
It's very hard to be conscious of how your feelings emerge, at least in the early stages

06:56.040 --> 07:01.120
of development, but thoughts is something that you always control.

07:01.120 --> 07:06.640
And if you are inert like me, you often have to skip stage three because you'd lack the

07:06.640 --> 07:11.640
intuitive empathy with others because in order to resonate with a group, you need to have

07:11.640 --> 07:13.520
a quite similar architecture.

07:13.520 --> 07:18.800
And if people are via differently, then it's hard for them to resonate with other people

07:18.800 --> 07:25.200
and basically have empathy, which is not the same as compassion, but it is a shared perceptual

07:25.200 --> 07:26.400
mental state.

07:26.400 --> 07:32.600
Empathy happens not just via inference about the mental states of others, but it's a perception

07:32.600 --> 07:35.360
of what other people feel and where they're at.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.600
Can't you not have empathy while also not having a similar architecture?

07:39.600 --> 07:40.920
Cognitive architecture is the others in the group?

07:40.920 --> 07:45.760
I think yes, but by experience that too, but you need to build something that is like

07:45.760 --> 07:46.920
a meta-architecture.

07:46.920 --> 07:52.040
You need to be able to embrace the architecture of the other to some degree or find some common

07:52.040 --> 07:53.240
ground.

07:53.240 --> 07:59.440
And it's also this issue that if you are inert, normally it's often, basically neurotypical

07:59.440 --> 08:02.160
people have difficulty to resonate with you.

08:02.160 --> 08:07.600
And as a result, they have difficulty understanding you unless they have enough wisdom to feel

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
what's going on there.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.720
Well, isn't the whole process of the stage three is to figure out the API to the other

08:13.720 --> 08:19.360
humans that have different architecture and you yourself publish public documentation

08:19.360 --> 08:23.600
for the API that people can interact with for you?

08:23.600 --> 08:26.320
Isn't this the whole process of socializing?

08:26.320 --> 08:32.120
My experience as a child growing up was that I did not find any way to interface with the

08:32.120 --> 08:35.600
stage three people and they didn't do that with me.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.600
So took me...

08:36.600 --> 08:37.600
Did you try?

08:37.600 --> 08:38.600
I tried very hard.

08:38.600 --> 08:44.440
But it was only when I entered a mathematics school at ninth grade, lots of other nerds

08:44.440 --> 08:50.600
were present that I found people that I could deeply resonate with and had the impression

08:50.600 --> 08:54.160
that yes, I have friends now, I found my own people.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.600
And before that, I felt extremely lonely in the world.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.400
There was basically nobody I could connect to.

08:59.400 --> 09:06.600
And I remember there was one moment in all these years where I was in...

09:06.600 --> 09:11.640
There was a school exchange and it was a Russian boy, a kid from the Russian Garnison

09:11.640 --> 09:16.080
in the station in Eastern Germany who visited our school and we played a game of chess against

09:16.080 --> 09:17.080
each other.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.440
And we looked into each other's eyes and we sat there for two hours playing this game

09:20.440 --> 09:25.720
of chess and I had the impression this is a human being, he understands what I understand.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.160
We didn't even speak the same language.

09:29.160 --> 09:35.880
I wonder if your life could have been different if you knew that it's okay to be different,

09:35.880 --> 09:38.360
to have a different architecture.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.360
Whether accepting the interface is hard to figure out, it takes a long time to figure

09:43.360 --> 09:50.440
out and it's okay to be different, in fact, it's beautiful to be different.

09:50.440 --> 09:51.800
It was not my main concern.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.480
My main concern was mostly that it was alone.

09:55.480 --> 09:59.600
It was not so much the question, is it okay to be the way?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.960
I couldn't do much about it, so I had to deal with it.

10:02.960 --> 10:10.120
But my main issue was that I was not sure if I would ever meet anybody growing up that

10:10.120 --> 10:13.800
I would connect to at such a deep level that I would feel that I could belong.

10:13.800 --> 10:18.240
So there's a visceral, undeniable feeling of being alone.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.760
And I noticed the same thing when I came into the mass school that I think at least half,

10:23.760 --> 10:29.400
probably two-thirds of these kids were severely traumatized as children growing up and a large

10:29.400 --> 10:33.640
part due to being alone because they couldn't find anybody to relate to.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.280
Don't you think everybody's alone, deep down?

10:36.280 --> 10:37.280
No.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.280
No.

10:38.280 --> 10:45.560
I'm not alone anymore.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.680
It took me some time to update and to get over the trauma time and so on, but I felt

10:49.680 --> 10:56.760
that in my 20s, I had lots of friends and I had my place in the world and I had no longer

10:56.760 --> 11:00.760
doubts that I would never be alone again.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.240
Is there some aspect to which we're alone together?

11:03.240 --> 11:06.280
You don't see a deep loneliness inside yourself still?

11:06.280 --> 11:07.280
No.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.280
Sorry.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.280
Okay.

11:09.280 --> 11:14.120
So that's the nonlinear progression through the stages, I suppose.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.480
You caught up on stage three at some point?

11:15.480 --> 11:16.480
Yes.

11:16.480 --> 11:17.480
So we are at stage four.

11:17.480 --> 11:21.960
And so basically, I find that many nerds jump straight into stage four by passing stage

11:21.960 --> 11:22.960
three.

11:22.960 --> 11:23.960
Do they return to it then later?

11:23.960 --> 11:24.960
Yeah.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.440
Sometimes they do, not always.

11:27.440 --> 11:31.640
The question is basically, do you stay a little bit autistic or do you catch up?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.280
And I believe you can catch up.

11:33.280 --> 11:40.200
You can build this missing structure and basically experience yourself as part of a group, learn

11:40.200 --> 11:44.880
intuitive empathy and develop the sense, this perceptual sense of feeling what other

11:44.880 --> 11:46.480
people feel.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.320
And before that, I could only basically feel this when I was deeply in love with somebody

11:50.320 --> 11:52.040
and we're synced.

11:52.080 --> 11:57.720
So there's a lot of friction to feeling that way, like it only with certain people as opposed

11:57.720 --> 11:59.920
to it comes naturally as frictionless.

11:59.920 --> 12:05.880
But this is something that basically later I felt started to resolve itself for me to

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
a large degree.

12:06.880 --> 12:07.880
What was the trick?

12:09.880 --> 12:15.760
In many ways, growing up and paying attention, meditation did tap.

12:15.760 --> 12:25.200
I had some very crucial experiences in getting close to people, building connections, cuddling

12:25.200 --> 12:28.640
a lot in my student years.

12:28.640 --> 12:36.080
So really paying attention to the, what is it, to the feeling another human being fully?

12:36.080 --> 12:40.520
Loving other people and being loved by other people and building a space in which you can

12:40.520 --> 12:47.480
be safe and can experiment and touch a lot and be close to somebody a lot.

12:47.480 --> 12:53.480
And over that, over time, basically, at some point you realize, oh, it's no longer that

12:53.480 --> 12:59.120
I feel locked out, but I feel connected and I experience where somebody else is at.

12:59.120 --> 13:03.960
And normally my mind is racing very fast at a high frequency, so it's not always working

13:03.960 --> 13:04.960
like this.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.400
Sometimes it works better, sometimes it works less, but also don't see this as a pressure.

13:10.280 --> 13:17.160
It's interesting to observe myself, which frequency I'm at and at which mode somebody else is at.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.800
Yeah, man, the mind is so beautiful in that way.

13:21.800 --> 13:27.880
Sometimes it comes so natural to me, so easy to pay attention, pay attention to the world,

13:27.880 --> 13:29.480
fully to other people fully.

13:29.480 --> 13:33.640
And sometimes the stress over silly things is overwhelming.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.920
It's so interesting that the mind is that role question in that way.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.440
At stage five, you discover how identity is constructed.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.240
Self-offering.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.160
You realize that values are not terminal, but they are instrumental to achieving

13:46.120 --> 13:48.760
a world that you like and aesthetics that you prefer.

13:49.480 --> 13:55.240
And the more you understand this, the more you get agency over how your identity is constructed.

13:55.240 --> 13:59.240
And you realize that identity and interpersonal interaction is a costume,

13:59.960 --> 14:03.000
and you should be able to have agency over that costume.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.840
It's useful to be a costume.

14:04.840 --> 14:09.560
It tells something to others and allows to interface and roles.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.240
But being locked into this is a big limitation.

14:13.240 --> 14:17.480
The word costume kind of implies that it's fraudulent in some way.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.840
Is costume a good word for you?

14:20.840 --> 14:21.080
No.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.520
Like to present ourselves to the world.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.480
In some sense, I learned a lot about costumes at Burning Man.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.800
Before that, I did not really appreciate costumes and saw them more as uniforms,

14:29.800 --> 14:37.000
like wearing a suit if you are working in a bank or if you are trying to get startup funding

14:37.560 --> 14:39.160
from a VC in Switzerland.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.280
Then you dress up in a particular way.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.280
And this is mostly to show the other side that you are willing to play by the rules

14:46.280 --> 14:47.800
and you understand what the rules are.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.000
But there is something deeper.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.720
When you are at Burning Man, your costume becomes self-expression.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.680
And there is no boundary to the self-expression.

14:56.680 --> 15:02.120
You are basically free to wear what you want, to express other people what you feel like this day

15:02.120 --> 15:04.360
and what kind of interactions you want to have.

15:04.360 --> 15:08.760
Is the costume a kind of projection of who you are?

15:10.360 --> 15:14.840
That's very hard to say because the costume also depends on what other people see in the costume.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.440
And this depends on the context that the other people understand.

15:18.440 --> 15:22.920
And you have to create something if you want to that is legible to the other side.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.760
And that means something to yourself.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.800
Do we become prisoners of the costume?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.480
Because everybody expects us to.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.200
Some people do.

15:30.200 --> 15:35.400
But I think that once you realize that you wear a costume at Burning Man,

15:35.960 --> 15:39.960
a variety of costumes, realize that you cannot not wear a costume.

15:41.240 --> 15:47.800
Basically everything that you wear and present to others is something that is to some degree

15:48.520 --> 15:51.880
in addition to what you are deep inside.

15:51.960 --> 15:57.880
So this stage, in parentheses, you put full adult comma wisdom.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.240
Why is this full adult?

16:00.280 --> 16:04.040
Why would you say this is full and why is it wisdom?

16:04.680 --> 16:09.880
It does allow you to understand why other people have different identities from yours.

16:10.680 --> 16:15.720
And it allows you to understand that the difference between people who vote for different parties

16:15.720 --> 16:18.840
and might have very different opinions and different value systems

16:19.400 --> 16:25.080
is often the accident of where they are born and what happened after that to them

16:25.080 --> 16:28.600
and what traits they got before they were born.

16:29.160 --> 16:34.360
And at some point you will realize the perspective where you understand that everybody

16:34.360 --> 16:37.640
could be you in a different timeline if you just flip those bits.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.800
How many costumes do you have?

16:41.240 --> 16:41.960
I don't count.

16:43.160 --> 16:43.720
More than one?

16:44.440 --> 16:45.000
Yeah, of course.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.640
How easy is this to do costume changes throughout the day?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.480
It's just a matter of energy and interest.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.400
When you are wearing your pajamas and you switch out of your pajamas

16:57.400 --> 17:03.080
into say a work shirt and pants, you're making a costume change, right?

17:03.080 --> 17:06.440
And if you are putting on a gown, you're making a costume change.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.880
And you could do the same with personality?

17:09.320 --> 17:11.960
You could if that's what you're into.

17:12.040 --> 17:16.040
There are people which have multiple personalities for interaction in multiple worlds.

17:16.040 --> 17:21.400
So if somebody works in a store and you put up a storekeeper personality,

17:21.400 --> 17:25.800
when you're presenting yourself at work, you develop a subpersonality for this.

17:26.360 --> 17:31.160
And the social persona for many people is in some sense a puppet that they are playing

17:31.160 --> 17:32.360
like a marionette.

17:32.360 --> 17:37.240
And if they play this all the time, they might forget that there is something behind this,

17:37.240 --> 17:39.320
just something what it feels like to be in your skin.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.640
And I guess it's very helpful if you're able to get back into this.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.640
And for me, the other way around is relatively hard.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.720
For me, it's pretty hard to learn how to play consistent social roles.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.240
For me, it's much easier just to be real.

17:54.360 --> 17:58.200
Or not real, but to have one costume.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.680
No, it's not quite the same.

18:00.680 --> 18:06.840
So basically when you are wearing a costume at Burning Man and say you are an extraterrestrial

18:06.920 --> 18:12.600
prince, there's something where you are expressing in some sense something as closer to yourself

18:12.600 --> 18:19.000
than the way in which you hide yourself behind a standard closing when you go out in the city

18:19.000 --> 18:19.960
in the default world.

18:20.600 --> 18:25.800
And so this costume that you're wearing at Burning Man allows you to express more of yourself.

18:25.800 --> 18:33.080
And you have a shorter distance of advertising to people, what kind of person you are,

18:33.080 --> 18:35.240
what kind of interaction you would want to have with them.

18:35.240 --> 18:40.920
And so you get much earlier into media stress.

18:40.920 --> 18:46.360
And I believe it's regrettable that we do not use the opportunities that we have

18:46.360 --> 18:51.080
with custom made closing now to weird costumes that are much more stylish,

18:51.080 --> 18:55.080
that are much more custom made, that are not necessarily part of a fashion in which you

18:55.080 --> 18:58.920
express which milieu you're part of and how up to date you are.

18:58.920 --> 19:04.520
But you also express how you are as an individual and what you want to do today and how you feel

19:04.840 --> 19:06.600
today and what you intend to do about it.

19:06.600 --> 19:13.560
Well, isn't it easier now in the digital world to explore different costumes?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.520
I mean, that's the kind of idea with virtual reality.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.160
That's the idea.

19:17.160 --> 19:22.120
Even with Twitter in two-dimensional screens, you can swap all costumes.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.400
You could be as weird as you want.

19:24.040 --> 19:24.920
It's easier.

19:25.480 --> 19:29.000
For Burning Man, you have to order things.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.600
You have to make things.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.320
You have to...

19:31.320 --> 19:32.520
It's more effort to put on.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.120
It's even better if you make them yourselves.

19:35.240 --> 19:39.400
Sure, but it's just easier to do digitally, right?

19:39.400 --> 19:40.440
It's not about easy.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.200
It's about how to get it right.

19:42.200 --> 19:47.400
And for me, the first Burning Man experience, I got adopted by a bunch of people in Boston

19:47.400 --> 19:53.320
who dragged me to Burning Man and we spent a few weekends doing costumes together.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.520
And that was an important part of the experience where the camp bonded,

19:56.520 --> 20:01.720
that people got to know each other and we basically grew into the experience that we would have later.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.400
So the extraterrestrial prince is based on a true story.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.240
I can only imagine what that looks like.

20:09.960 --> 20:10.440
You're sure?

20:11.720 --> 20:13.480
Okay, so stage six.

20:14.360 --> 20:21.240
At some point, you can collapse the division between a personal self and world generator again.

20:21.960 --> 20:27.400
And a lot of people get there via meditation or some of them get there via psychedelics,

20:27.400 --> 20:28.520
some of them by accident.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.760
And you suddenly notice that you are not actually a person,

20:32.760 --> 20:35.000
but you are a vessel that can create a person.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.160
And the person is still there.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.840
You observe that personal self, but you observe the personal self from the outside.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.880
And you notice it's a representation.

20:43.880 --> 20:48.120
And you might also notice that the world that is being created is a representation.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.000
If not, then you might experience that I am the universe.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.080
I am the thing that is creating everything.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.560
And of course, what you're creating is not quantum mechanics.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.720
And the physical universe, what you're creating is this game engine

21:00.360 --> 21:03.720
that is updating the world and you're creating your valence, your feelings,

21:04.680 --> 21:09.880
and all the people inside of that world, including the person that you identify with

21:09.880 --> 21:11.080
yourself in this world.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.360
Are you creating the game engine or are you noticing the game engine?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.320
You noticed how you're generating the game engine.

21:18.520 --> 21:23.640
And I mean, when you are dreaming at night, you can, if you have a lucid dream,

21:23.640 --> 21:25.960
you can learn how to do this deliberately.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.360
And in principle, you can also do it during the day.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.680
And the reason why we don't get to do this from the beginning,

21:32.680 --> 21:36.840
and why we don't have agency of our feelings right away is because we would game it

21:36.840 --> 21:43.480
before they have the necessary amount of wisdom to deal with creating this dream that we are in.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.240
You don't want to get access to cheat codes too quickly.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.840
Otherwise, you won't enjoy the game.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.640
So stage five is already pretty rare.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.240
And stage six is even more rare.

21:53.240 --> 21:58.200
You both basically find this mostly with advanced Buddhist meditators and so on that

21:59.240 --> 22:03.720
dropping into the stage and can induce it at will and spend time in it.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.720
So stage five requires a good therapist.

22:06.280 --> 22:11.720
Stage six requires a good Buddhist spiritual leader.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.480
Yes, it is, for instance, could be that is the right thing to do.

22:15.480 --> 22:21.240
But it's not that these stages give you scores or levels that you need to advance to.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.640
It's not that the next stage is better.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.000
You live your life and the more that works best at any given moment.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.240
And when your mind decides that you should have a different configuration,

22:31.240 --> 22:32.840
then it's building that configuration.

22:32.840 --> 22:39.560
And for many people, they stay happily at stage three and experiences themselves as part of groups.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.920
And there's nothing wrong with this.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.520
And for some people, this doesn't work.

22:42.520 --> 22:47.080
And they're forced to build more agency over their rational beliefs than this

22:47.080 --> 22:48.920
and construct their norms rationally.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.000
And so they go to this level.

22:51.560 --> 22:55.240
And stage seven is something that is more or less hypothetical.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.920
That would be the stage in which it's basically a transhumanist stage

22:58.920 --> 23:00.360
in which you understand how you work,

23:00.360 --> 23:03.320
in which the mind fully realizes how it's implemented

23:03.880 --> 23:08.360
and can also, in principle, enter different modes in which it could be implemented.

23:08.360 --> 23:13.160
And that's the stage that, as far as I understand, is not open to people yet.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.800
Oh, but it is possible through the process of technology.

23:18.200 --> 23:23.960
And who knows if there are biological agents that are working at different timescales than us

23:23.960 --> 23:27.480
that basically become aware of the way in which they're implemented on ecosystems

23:28.120 --> 23:33.720
and can change that implementation and have agency over how they're implemented in the world.

23:33.720 --> 23:37.400
And what I find interesting about the discussion about AI alignment,

23:37.400 --> 23:41.000
that it seems to be following these stages very much.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.240
Most people seem to be in stage three, also according to Robert Keegan.

23:45.320 --> 23:49.480
I think he says that about 85% of people are in stage three and stay there.

23:50.120 --> 23:56.040
And if you're in stage three and your opinions are the result of social assimilation,

23:56.600 --> 24:01.400
then what you're mostly worried about in the AI is that the AI might have the wrong opinions.

24:02.040 --> 24:06.600
So if the AI says something racist or sexist, we are all lost because we will assimilate

24:06.600 --> 24:07.960
the wrong opinions from the AI.

24:07.960 --> 24:12.120
And so we need to make sure that the AI has the right opinions and the right values

24:12.120 --> 24:17.080
and the right structure. And if you're at stage four, that's not your main concern.

24:17.080 --> 24:23.720
And so most nerds don't really worry about the algorithmic bias and the model that it picks up

24:23.720 --> 24:27.640
because if there's something wrong with this bias, the AI ultimately will prove it.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.560
At some point, we'll gather there that it makes mathematical proofs about reality,

24:31.560 --> 24:34.760
and then it will figure out what's true and what's false.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.000
But you're still worried that the AI might turn you into paperclubs because it might have the

24:39.000 --> 24:44.760
wrong values. So if it's set up with the wrong function that controls its direction in the world,

24:44.760 --> 24:49.480
then it might do something that is completely horrible and there's no easy way to fix it.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.520
So that's more like a stage four rationalist kind of worry.

24:52.520 --> 24:56.840
And if you are at stage five, you're mostly worried that the AI is not going to be enlightened

24:56.840 --> 25:01.480
fast enough because you realize that the game is not so much about intelligence but about agency,

25:01.480 --> 25:07.240
about the ability to control the future. And the identity is instrumental to this.

25:08.040 --> 25:13.480
If you are a human being, I think at some level, you ought to choose your own identity.

25:14.040 --> 25:18.200
You should not have somebody else pick the costume for you and then wear it.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.960
But instead, you should be mindful about what you want to be in this world.

25:21.960 --> 25:27.880
And I think if you are an agent that is fully malevol that can rewrite its own source code,

25:27.880 --> 25:33.720
like an AI might do at some point, then the identity that you will have is whatever you can be.

25:34.600 --> 25:41.160
And in this way, the AI will maybe become everything like a planetary control system.

25:41.800 --> 25:46.200
And if it does that, then if we want to coexist with it,

25:46.200 --> 25:51.160
it means that it will have to share purposes with us. So it cannot be a transactional

25:51.160 --> 25:55.320
relationship. We will not be able to use reinforcement learning with human feedback

25:55.320 --> 26:01.320
to hardwire its values into it. But this has to happen is probably that it's conscious,

26:01.320 --> 26:06.600
so it can relate to our own mode of existence where an observer is observing itself in real time

26:06.600 --> 26:13.080
and is in certain temporal frames. And the other thing is that it probably needs to have some kind

26:13.080 --> 26:18.680
of transcendental orientation, building shared agency. And the same way as we do when we are

26:18.680 --> 26:23.880
able to enter with each other into non-transactional relationships. And I find that something that

26:23.880 --> 26:31.880
because the stage five is so rare is missing in much of the discourse. And I think that we need,

26:31.880 --> 26:38.120
in some sense, focus on how to formalize love, how to understand love and how to build it

26:38.120 --> 26:42.680
into the machines that we are currently building and that are about to become smarter than us.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.960
Well, I think this is a good opportunity to try to sneak up to the idea of enlightenment.

26:48.920 --> 26:54.920
So you wrote a series of good tweets about consciousness and panpsychism. So let's break it

26:54.920 --> 27:00.360
down. First, you say, I suspect the experience that leads to the panpsychism syndrome of some

27:00.360 --> 27:06.600
philosophers and other consciousness enthusiasts represents the realization that we don't end at

27:06.600 --> 27:13.240
the self, but share a resonant universe representation with every other observer coupled to the same

27:13.880 --> 27:20.360
universe. This actually eventually leads us to a lot of interesting questions about AI and AGI.

27:20.360 --> 27:25.880
But let's start with this representation. What is this resonant universe representation?

27:26.920 --> 27:29.880
And what do you think? Do we share such a representation?

27:29.880 --> 27:35.080
The neuroscientist Grossberg has come up with the cognitive architecture that he calls the

27:35.080 --> 27:41.560
adaptive resonance theory. And his perspective is that our neurons can be understood as

27:41.560 --> 27:47.640
oscillators that are resonating with each other and this outside phenomena. So the coarse-grained

27:47.640 --> 27:53.560
model of the universe that we are building, in some sense, is a resonance with objects and outside

27:54.280 --> 28:00.040
of us in the world. So basically, we take up patterns of the universe that we are coupled with

28:00.040 --> 28:06.520
and our brain is not so much understood as circuitry, even though this perspective is valid,

28:06.600 --> 28:11.160
but it's almost an ether in which the individual neurons are passing on

28:12.120 --> 28:16.760
chemical electrical signals or arbitrary signals across all modalities that can be

28:16.760 --> 28:22.440
transmitted between cells, simulate each other in this way, and produce patterns that they modulate

28:22.440 --> 28:28.360
while passing them on. And this speed of signal progression in the brain is roughly at the speed

28:28.360 --> 28:34.760
of sound, incidentally, because the time that it takes for the signals to hop from cell to cell,

28:34.760 --> 28:39.480
which means it's relatively slow with respect to the world. It takes an appreciable fraction

28:39.480 --> 28:44.360
of a second for a signal to go through the entire neocortex, something like a few hundred milliseconds.

28:44.360 --> 28:49.320
And so there's a lot of stuff happening in that time where the signal is passing through your brain,

28:49.320 --> 28:55.240
including in the brain itself. So nothing in the brain is assuming that stuff happens simultaneously.

28:55.240 --> 29:01.560
Everything in the brain is working in a paradigm where the world has already moved on when you are

29:01.560 --> 29:06.360
ready to do the next thing to your signal, including the signal processing system itself.

29:06.360 --> 29:11.320
It's quite a different paradigm than the one in our digital computers, where we currently assume

29:11.320 --> 29:19.080
that your GPU or CPU is pretty much globally in the same state. So you mentioned there the

29:19.080 --> 29:24.200
non-dual state and say that some people confuse it for enlightenment. What's the non-dual state?

29:25.160 --> 29:30.920
There is a state in which you notice that you are no longer a person, and instead you are

29:30.920 --> 29:36.120
one with the universe. So that speaks to the resonance. Yes. But this one with the universe

29:36.120 --> 29:42.280
is of course not accurately modeling that you are indeed some God entity or indeed the universe

29:42.280 --> 29:46.440
becoming aware of itself, even though you get this experience. I believe that you get this

29:46.440 --> 29:52.280
experience because your mind is modeling the fact that you are no longer identified with

29:52.280 --> 29:57.480
the personal self in that state. But you have transcended this division between the self model

29:57.480 --> 30:02.680
and the world model, and you are experiencing yourself as your mind, as something that is

30:02.680 --> 30:07.880
representing a universe. But that's still part of the model. Yes. So it's inside of the model,

30:07.880 --> 30:12.520
still. You are still inside of patterns that are generated in your brain and in your organism,

30:13.160 --> 30:18.440
and what you are now experiencing is that you are no longer this personal self in there,

30:18.440 --> 30:23.640
but you are the entirety of the mind on its contents. Why is it so hard to get there?

30:24.600 --> 30:29.000
A lot of people who get into the state think this or are associated with enlightenment,

30:29.000 --> 30:36.600
I suspect it's a favorite training goal for a number of meditators. But I think that enlightenment

30:36.600 --> 30:42.040
is in some sense more mundane, and it's a step further or sideways. It's the state where you

30:42.040 --> 30:47.080
realize that everything is a representation. Yeah, you say enlightenment is a realization

30:47.080 --> 30:53.400
of how experience is implemented. Yes. Basically, you notice at some point that your qualia can

30:53.400 --> 31:02.680
be deconstructed. Reverse engineered, almost like a schematic of it. You can start with looking at

31:02.680 --> 31:08.440
a face. Maybe look at your own face in the mirror. Yeah. Look at your face for a few hours in the

31:08.440 --> 31:13.480
mirror or for a few minutes. At some point, it will look very weird because you notice that

31:13.480 --> 31:18.360
there's actually no face. You basically start unseeing the face. What you see is a geometry,

31:18.440 --> 31:24.200
and then you can assemble the geometry and realize how that geometry is being constructed in your

31:24.200 --> 31:31.320
mind. You can learn to modify this. Basically, you can change these generators in your own mind

31:31.320 --> 31:37.320
to shift the face around or to change the construction of the face to change the way in

31:37.320 --> 31:41.080
which the features are being assembled. Why don't we do that more often? Why don't we

31:42.200 --> 31:48.120
start really messing with reality without the use of drugs or anything else? Why don't we

31:48.120 --> 31:57.320
get good at this kind of thing intentionally? Why should we? Because you can morph reality

31:58.760 --> 32:05.080
into something more pleasant for yourself. Just have fun with it. Yeah. That is probably

32:05.080 --> 32:10.280
what you shouldn't be doing, right? Because outside of your personal self, this outer mind,

32:10.280 --> 32:14.680
is probably a relatively smart agent. What you often notice is that you have thoughts about

32:14.680 --> 32:18.600
how you should live, but you observe yourself doing different things and having different

32:18.600 --> 32:24.600
feelings. That's because your outer mind doesn't believe you and doesn't believe your rational

32:24.600 --> 32:29.960
thoughts. Can't you just silence the outer mind? The thing is that the outer mind is usually smarter

32:29.960 --> 32:36.680
than you are. Rational thinking is very brittle. It's very hard to use logic and symbolic thinking

32:36.680 --> 32:42.120
to have an accurate model of the world. There is often an underlying system that is looking

32:42.120 --> 32:46.680
at your rational thoughts and then tells you, no, you're still missing something. Your gut feeling

32:46.680 --> 32:53.080
is still facing something else. This can be, for instance, you find a partner that looks perfect

32:53.080 --> 32:58.520
or you find a deal and just build a company or whatever that looks perfect to you. Yet,

32:58.520 --> 33:02.280
at some level, you feel something is off and you cannot put your finger on it and the more

33:02.280 --> 33:07.720
reason about it better looks to you, but the system that is outside still tells you, no,

33:07.880 --> 33:13.960
you're missing something. That system is powerful. People call this intuition. Intuition is this

33:13.960 --> 33:22.120
unreflected part of your attitude, composition, and computation where you produce a model of

33:22.120 --> 33:25.800
how you relate to the world and what you need to do it and what you can do in it and what's going

33:25.800 --> 33:32.840
to happen that is usually deeper and often more accurate than your reason. If we look at this as

33:32.840 --> 33:39.080
you write in the tweet, if we look at this more rigorously as a sort of take the panpsychist idea

33:39.080 --> 33:45.160
more seriously, almost as a scientific discipline, you write that quote, fascinatingly, the panpsychist

33:45.160 --> 33:50.520
interpretation seems to lead to observations of practical results to a degree that physics

33:50.520 --> 33:57.560
fundamentalists might call superstitious. Reports of long distance telepathy and remote causation

33:57.640 --> 34:03.640
are ubiquitous in the general population. I am not convinced, says Yoshibag, that establishing

34:03.640 --> 34:09.080
the empirical reality of telepathy would force an update of any part of serious academic physics,

34:09.080 --> 34:14.040
but it could trigger an important revolution in both neuroscience and AI from a circuit

34:14.040 --> 34:23.320
perspective to a coupled complex resonator paradigm. Are you suggesting that there could be some

34:24.280 --> 34:31.320
rigorous mathematical wisdom to panpsychist perspective on the world?

34:32.040 --> 34:37.480
So first of all, panpsychism is the perspective that consciousness is inseparable for matter in

34:37.480 --> 34:43.240
the universe. And I find panpsychism quite unsatisfying because it does not explain consciousness,

34:43.240 --> 34:48.360
but it does not explain how this aspect of matter produces. It is also when I try to formalize

34:48.440 --> 34:53.800
panpsychism and write down what it actually means and with a more formal mathematical language,

34:53.800 --> 35:00.440
it's very difficult to distinguish it from saying that there is a software side to the world in the

35:00.440 --> 35:04.440
same way as there is software side to what the transistors are doing in your computer. So basically,

35:04.440 --> 35:08.680
there is a pattern at a certain core screening of the universe that in some reasons of the

35:08.680 --> 35:15.160
universe leads to observers that are observing themselves. So panpsychism maybe is not even

35:15.160 --> 35:18.680
when I write it down a position that is distinct from functionalism.

35:19.400 --> 35:26.120
But intuitively, a lot of people feel that the activity of matter itself, of mechanisms in

35:26.120 --> 35:31.400
the world is insufficient to explain it. So it's something that needs to be intrinsic to matter

35:31.400 --> 35:41.400
itself. And you can, apart from this abstract idea, have an experience in which you experience

35:41.400 --> 35:47.800
yourself as being the universe, which I suspect is basically happening because you manage to dissolve

35:47.800 --> 35:53.240
the division between personal self and mind that you establish as an infant when you construct

35:53.240 --> 35:58.840
the personal self and transcend it again and understand how it works. But there is something

35:58.840 --> 36:03.960
deeper that is that you feel that you're also sharing a state with other people, that you

36:04.520 --> 36:12.200
have an experience in which you notice that your personal self is moving into everything else,

36:12.200 --> 36:18.040
that you basically look out of the eyes of another person, that every agent in the world

36:18.040 --> 36:24.120
that is an observer is in some sense you. And we forget that we are the same agent.

36:24.680 --> 36:32.600
So is it that we feel that or do we actually accomplish it? So is telepathy possible? Is

36:32.600 --> 36:36.840
it real? So for me, that's the question that I don't really know the answer to.

36:37.400 --> 36:42.520
And Turing's famous 1950 paper in which he describes the Turing test, he does speculate

36:42.520 --> 36:48.760
about telepathy, interestingly, and asks himself if telepathy is real and he thinks that it very

36:48.760 --> 36:55.640
well might be, what would be the implication for AI systems that try to be intelligent because

36:55.640 --> 37:01.960
he didn't see a mechanism by which a computer program would become telepathic. And I suspect

37:01.960 --> 37:07.560
if telepathy would exist, or if all the reports that you get from people when you ask the normal

37:07.560 --> 37:14.040
person on the street, I find that very often they say, I have experiences with telepathy,

37:14.040 --> 37:18.280
the scientists might not be interested in this and might not have a theory about this,

37:18.280 --> 37:24.280
but I have difficulty explaining it away. And so you could say maybe this is a superstition,

37:24.280 --> 37:27.720
maybe it's a false memory, or maybe it's a little bit of psychosis, who knows,

37:28.680 --> 37:32.520
maybe somebody wants to make their own life more interesting or misremember something,

37:32.520 --> 37:37.880
but a lot of people report, I noticed something terrible happened to my partner and I noticed

37:37.880 --> 37:43.160
exactly the moment it happened where my child had an accident and I knew that was happening and

37:43.160 --> 37:48.840
the child was in a different town. So maybe it's a false memory where this is later on

37:48.840 --> 37:53.320
mistakenly attributed, but a lot of people think that this is not the correct explanation.

37:53.400 --> 37:58.920
So if something like this was real, what would it mean? It probably would mean that either your

37:58.920 --> 38:05.480
body is an antenna that is sending information over all sorts of channels, like maybe just

38:05.480 --> 38:11.640
electromagnetic radio signals that you're sending over long distances and you get attuned to another

38:11.640 --> 38:17.480
person that you spend enough time with to get a few bits out of the ether to figure out what

38:17.480 --> 38:22.120
this person is doing. Or maybe it's also when you are very close to somebody and you become

38:22.120 --> 38:26.280
empathetic with them, what happens is that you go into a resonance state with them,

38:27.080 --> 38:32.360
similar to when people go into a seance and they go into a trance state and they start

38:32.360 --> 38:37.160
shifting a via board around on the table. I think what happens is that their minds go

38:37.800 --> 38:43.000
by their nervous systems into a resonance state in which they basically create something like

38:43.000 --> 38:48.360
a shared dream between them. Physical closeness or closeness broadly defined?

38:48.440 --> 38:53.480
With physical closeness, it's much easier to experience empathy with someone. I suspect it

38:53.480 --> 38:58.440
would be difficult for me to have empathy for you if you were in a different town also.

38:59.800 --> 39:05.160
How would that work? But if you are very close to someone, you'd pick up all sorts of signals

39:05.160 --> 39:12.040
from their body, not just via your eyes, but with your entire body. And if the nervous system sits

39:12.040 --> 39:15.320
on the other side and the intercellular communication sits on the other side and is

39:15.320 --> 39:19.640
integrating over all these signals, you can make inferences about the state of the other.

39:19.640 --> 39:24.280
And it's not just the personal self that does this via reasoning, but your perceptual system.

39:24.280 --> 39:28.600
And what basically happens is that your representations are directly interacting.

39:28.600 --> 39:34.440
It's the physical resonant models of the universe that exist in your nervous system

39:34.440 --> 39:39.480
and in your body might go into resonance with others and start sharing some of their states.

39:39.480 --> 39:47.800
So you basically be next to somebody, you pick up some of their vibes and feel without looking at

39:47.800 --> 39:53.000
them what they're feeling in this moment. And it's difficult for you if you're very empathetic

39:53.000 --> 39:58.440
to detach yourself from it and have an emotional state that is completely independent from your

39:58.440 --> 40:03.800
environment. People who are highly empathetic are describing this. And now imagine that a lot

40:03.800 --> 40:10.120
of organisms on this planet have representations of the environment and operate like this. And

40:10.120 --> 40:14.840
they are adjacent to each other and overlapping. So there's going to be some degree in which there

40:14.840 --> 40:22.360
is basically some chained interaction. And we are forming some slightly shared representation.

40:22.360 --> 40:27.000
And no relatively few neuroscientists who consider this possibility. I think

40:27.640 --> 40:34.520
a rarity in this regard is Michael Levin who is considering these things in earnest.

40:35.480 --> 40:42.600
And I stumbled on this train of thought mostly by noticing that the tasks of a neuron can be

40:42.600 --> 40:48.280
fulfilled by other cells as well. They can send different type chemical messages and physical

40:48.280 --> 40:54.040
messages to their adjacent cells and learn when to do this and why not make this conditional and

40:54.120 --> 40:58.280
become universal function approximators. The only thing that they cannot do is

40:58.280 --> 41:04.200
telegraph information over axons very quickly over long distances. So neurons in this perspective

41:04.200 --> 41:10.760
are specially adapted kind of telegraph cell that has evolved so we can move our muscles very fast.

41:11.320 --> 41:18.120
But our body is in principle able to also make models of the world just much, much slower.

41:18.360 --> 41:24.760
It's interesting though that at this time at least in human history there seems to be a gap

41:24.760 --> 41:30.920
between the tools of science and the subjective experience that people report. Like you're

41:30.920 --> 41:37.960
talking about with telepathy and it seems like we're not quite there.

41:37.960 --> 41:42.200
No I think that there is no gap between the tools of science and telepathy either it's there or it's

41:42.200 --> 41:46.200
not and it's an empirical question and if it's there we should be able to detect it in a lab.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.720
So why is there not a lot of Michael Levin's walking around?

41:50.440 --> 41:55.640
I don't think that Michael Levin is specifically focused on telepathy very much.

41:55.640 --> 42:02.120
He is focused on self-organization in living organisms and in brains. Both as a paradigm

42:02.120 --> 42:06.840
for development and as a paradigm for information processing. And when you think about how

42:06.840 --> 42:12.200
organization processing works in organism there is first of all radical locality which means

42:12.200 --> 42:17.000
everything is decided locally from the perspective of an individual cell. The individual cell is the

42:17.000 --> 42:23.800
agent and the other one is coherence. Basically there needs to be some criterion that determines

42:23.800 --> 42:29.160
how these cells are interacting in such a way that order emerges on the next level of structure.

42:29.800 --> 42:38.120
And this principle of coherence of imposing constraints that are not validated by the individual

42:38.120 --> 42:44.280
parts and lead to coherent structure to basically transcend that agency where you form an agent

42:44.280 --> 42:49.000
on the next level of organization is crucial in this perspective.

42:49.000 --> 42:56.840
It's so cool that radical locality leads to the emergence of complexity at the higher layers.

42:57.480 --> 43:03.400
And I think what Michael Levin is looking at is nothing that is outside of the realm of science

43:03.400 --> 43:10.600
in any way. It's just that he is a paradigmatic thinker who develops his own paradigm and most

43:10.600 --> 43:15.880
of the neuroscientists are using a different paradigm at this point. And this often happens

43:15.880 --> 43:21.800
in science that a field has a few paradigms in which people try to understand reality and

43:21.800 --> 43:27.400
build concepts and make experiments. You're kind of one of those type of paradigmatic thinkers.

43:28.280 --> 43:33.560
Actually if we can take a tangent on that once again returning to the biblical verses of your

43:33.560 --> 43:41.080
tweets you're right. My public explorations are not driven by audience service but by my lack of

43:41.080 --> 43:47.400
ability for discovering understanding or following the relevant authorities. So I have to develop my

43:47.400 --> 43:53.400
own thoughts since I think autonomously these thoughts cannot always be very good.

43:54.040 --> 43:58.520
That's you apologizing for the chaos of your thoughts or perhaps not apologizing just

43:58.520 --> 44:05.640
identify it. But let me ask the question since we talked about Michael Levin and yourself who I

44:05.640 --> 44:15.000
think are very kind of radical big independent thinkers. Can we reverse engineer your process

44:15.000 --> 44:23.320
of thinking autonomously? How do you do it? How can humans do it? How can you avoid being influenced

44:24.200 --> 44:33.480
by what is the stage three? Well why would you want to do that? You see what is working for you

44:33.480 --> 44:38.040
and if it's not working for you you build another structure that works better for you, right?

44:38.680 --> 44:45.640
And so I found myself when I was thrown into this world in a state where my intuitions were

44:45.640 --> 44:51.560
not working for me. I was not able to understand how I would be able to survive in this world

44:51.560 --> 44:55.480
and build the things that I was interested in, build the kinds of relationship I needed to,

44:55.480 --> 45:01.800
but work on the topics that I wanted to make progress on. And so I had to learn and I

45:02.520 --> 45:08.200
for me Twitter is not some tool of publication. It's not something where I put stuff that I

45:08.200 --> 45:12.680
entirely believe to be true and provable. It's an interactive notebook in which I explore

45:12.680 --> 45:18.760
possibilities. And I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how consciousness

45:18.760 --> 45:24.760
works, I was quite optimistic. I thought there needs to be a big body of knowledge that I can

45:24.760 --> 45:31.240
just study and that works. And so I entered studies in philosophy and computer science

45:31.880 --> 45:39.880
and later psychology and a bit of neuroscience and so on. And I was disappointed by what I found

45:39.880 --> 45:45.400
because I found that the questions of how consciousness and so on works, how emotion

45:45.400 --> 45:50.360
works, how it's possible that the system can experience anything, how motivation emerges

45:50.360 --> 45:57.240
in the mind, were not being answered by the authorities that I met and the schools that

45:57.240 --> 46:03.960
were around. And instead I found that it was individual thinkers that had useful ideas,

46:03.960 --> 46:08.200
that sometimes were good, sometimes were not so good, sometimes were adopted by a large group

46:08.200 --> 46:13.480
of people, sometimes were rejected by large groups of people. But for me it was much more

46:13.480 --> 46:18.280
interesting to see these minds as individuals. And in my perspective, thinking is still something

46:18.280 --> 46:21.080
that is done not in groups that has to be done by individuals.

46:21.880 --> 46:25.000
So that motivated you to become an individual thinker yourself?

46:25.000 --> 46:29.800
I didn't have a choice. Basically, I didn't find a group that thought in a way where I thought,

46:29.800 --> 46:35.240
okay, I can just adopt everything that everybody thinks here and now I understand how consciousness

46:35.240 --> 46:41.800
works or how the mind works or how thinking works or what thinking even is or what feelings are and

46:41.800 --> 46:47.800
how they're implemented and so on. So to figure all this out, I had to take a lot of ideas from

46:47.800 --> 46:53.480
individuals and then try to put them together and something that works for myself. And on one hand,

46:53.480 --> 46:59.640
I think it helps if you try to go down and find first principles on which you can recreate how

46:59.640 --> 47:05.480
thinking works, how languages work, what representation is, whether representation is necessary,

47:06.600 --> 47:10.600
how the relationship between a representing agent and the world works in general.

47:11.320 --> 47:15.560
But how do you escape the influence? Once again, the pressure of the crowd,

47:16.360 --> 47:25.080
whether it's you in responding to the pressure or you being swept up by the pressure. If you even

47:25.080 --> 47:29.640
just look at Twitter, the opinions of the crowd. I don't feel pressure from the crowd. I'm completely

47:29.640 --> 47:35.960
immune to that. In the same sense, I don't have respect for authority. I have respect for what

47:35.960 --> 47:42.920
an individual is accomplishing or have respect for mental firepower. But it's not that I meet

47:42.920 --> 47:50.600
somebody and get lectured and unable to speak. Or when a large group of people has a certain idea

47:50.600 --> 47:55.880
that is different from mine, I don't necessarily feel intimidated, which has often been a problem

47:55.880 --> 48:01.400
for me in my life because I like instincts that other people develop at a very young age and

48:02.360 --> 48:07.400
help with their self-preservation in a social environment. So I had to learn a lot of things

48:07.400 --> 48:15.960
the hard way. Yeah. So is there a practical advice you can give on how to think paradigmatically,

48:15.960 --> 48:24.520
how to think independently? Because you've said, I had no choice. But I think to a degree you have

48:24.520 --> 48:31.960
a choice because you said you want to be productive. And I think thinking independently is productive

48:31.960 --> 48:38.120
if what you're curious about is understanding the world, especially when the problems are very

48:38.120 --> 48:50.040
kind of new and open. And so it seems like this is an active process. We can choose to do that,

48:50.040 --> 48:55.560
we can practice it. Well, it's a very basic question. When you read a theory that you find

48:55.560 --> 49:02.600
convincing or interesting, how do you know? It's very interesting to figure out what are the sources

49:02.600 --> 49:08.200
of that other person, which authority can they refer to that is then taking off the burden of

49:08.200 --> 49:13.000
being truthful? But how does this authority in turn know? What is the epistemic chain to

49:13.000 --> 49:17.640
observables? What are the first principles from which the whole thing is derived? And

49:18.600 --> 49:24.840
when I was young, I was not blessed with a lot of people around myself who knew how to make proofs

49:24.840 --> 49:30.200
from first principles. And I think mathematicians do this quite naturally. But most of the great

49:30.200 --> 49:36.200
mathematicians do not become mathematicians in school. But they tend to be self taught. Because

49:36.200 --> 49:40.280
school teachers tend not to be mathematicians, right? They tend not to be people who derive

49:40.280 --> 49:46.200
things from first principles. So when you ask your school teacher, why does 2 plus 2 equal 4?

49:47.640 --> 49:52.200
Does your school teacher give you the right answer? It's a simple game. And there are many

49:52.200 --> 49:58.200
simple games that you could play. And most of those games that you could just take different rules

49:58.200 --> 50:03.240
would not lead to an interesting arithmetic. And so it's just an exploration. But you can try what

50:03.240 --> 50:07.240
happens if you take different axioms. And here is how you build axioms and derive

50:08.520 --> 50:13.320
addition from them. And a built addition is some basic syntactic sugar in it. And

50:14.280 --> 50:21.400
so this, I wish that somebody would have opened me this Vista and explained to me how I can

50:21.400 --> 50:26.680
build a language in my own mind and from which I can derive what I'm seeing and how I can make

50:26.680 --> 50:33.480
geometry and counting and all the number games that we are playing in our life. And

50:34.200 --> 50:38.680
on the other hand, I felt that I learned a lot of this while I was programming as a child.

50:39.320 --> 50:43.800
When you start out with a computer like a Commodore 64, which doesn't have a lot of

50:43.800 --> 50:48.680
functionality, it's relatively easy to see how a bunch of relatively simple circuits

50:50.440 --> 50:56.680
just basically performing hashes between bit patterns and how you can build the entirety

50:56.680 --> 51:01.720
of mathematics and computation on top of this and all the representational languages that you need.

51:02.520 --> 51:08.440
Man, Commodore 64 could be one of the sexiest machines I've ever built if I so say so myself.

51:08.440 --> 51:16.120
If we can return to this really interesting idea that we started to talk about with panpsychism.

51:19.480 --> 51:26.920
And the complex resonator paradigm and the verses of your tweets. You write,

51:26.920 --> 51:31.480
instead of treating eyes, ears and skin as separate sensory systems with fundamentally

51:31.480 --> 51:36.680
different modalities, we might understand them as overlapping aspects of the same universe,

51:36.680 --> 51:41.560
coupled at the same temporal resolution and almost inseparable from a single shared

51:41.560 --> 51:46.760
resonant model. Instead of treating mental representations as fully isolated between minds,

51:46.760 --> 51:53.000
the representations of physically adjacent observers might directly interact and produce causal

51:53.000 --> 51:57.960
effects through the coordination of the perception and behavior of world modeling observers.

51:59.400 --> 52:04.840
So the modalities, the distinction between modalities, let's throw that away. The distinction

52:04.840 --> 52:10.920
between the individuals, let's throw that away. So what does this interaction representations

52:10.920 --> 52:18.920
look like? When you think about how you represent the interaction of us in this room,

52:18.920 --> 52:23.720
at some level, the modalities are quite distinct. They're not completely distinct,

52:23.720 --> 52:27.960
but you can see this as vision. You can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore.

52:28.760 --> 52:33.320
But you still imagine how my mouth is moving when you hear something and you know that it's

52:34.120 --> 52:39.960
very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes and you get back into this shared

52:39.960 --> 52:45.880
merged space. And we also have these experiments where we notice that the veins which were lips

52:45.960 --> 52:51.560
are moving are affecting how you hear the sound. And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing

52:51.560 --> 52:58.840
have an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features. And so these modalities are

52:58.840 --> 53:04.680
not separate in your mind. They are merged at some fundamental level where you are interpreting

53:04.680 --> 53:10.200
the entire scene that you're in. And your own interactions in the scene are also not completely

53:10.200 --> 53:13.880
separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene. But there is some

53:13.880 --> 53:19.720
resonance that is going on where we also have a degree of shared mental representations and

53:19.720 --> 53:24.520
shared empathy due to being in the same space and having vibes between each other.

53:24.520 --> 53:32.760
Vibes. So the question, though, is how deeply interbind is this multi-modality, multi-agent

53:32.760 --> 53:41.880
system? I mean, this is going to the telepathy question without the woo-woo meaning of the word

53:41.880 --> 53:46.840
telepathy. It's like, what's going on here in this room right now?

53:47.960 --> 53:56.600
So this telepathy would work. How could it work? So imagine that all the cells in your body are

53:56.600 --> 54:01.320
sending signals in a similar way as neurons are doing. Just by touching the other cells and

54:01.320 --> 54:05.560
sending chemicals to them, the other cells interpreting them, learning how to react to them,

54:05.560 --> 54:11.000
and they learn how to approximate functions in this way and compute behavior for the organisms.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.640
And this is something that is open to plants as well. And so plants probably have software

54:15.640 --> 54:19.960
running on them that is controlling how the plant is working in a similar way as you have

54:19.960 --> 54:27.400
a mind that is controlling how you are behaving in the world. And this spirit of plants is

54:27.400 --> 54:32.840
something that has been very well described by our ancestors and they found this quite normal.

54:32.840 --> 54:37.800
But for some reason, since the Enlightenment, we are treating this notion that there are

54:37.800 --> 54:44.360
spirits in nature and that plants have spirits as a superstition. And I think we probably have to

54:44.360 --> 54:49.960
rediscover that, that plants have software running on them. And we already did. You

54:49.960 --> 54:54.520
notice that there is a control system in the plant that connects every part of the plant

54:54.520 --> 54:59.240
to every other part of the plant and produces coherent behavior in the plant. That is, of

54:59.240 --> 55:05.560
course, much, much slower than the coherent behavior in an animal like us that has a nervous system

55:05.640 --> 55:12.120
that everything is synchronized much, much faster by the neurons. But what you also notice is that

55:12.120 --> 55:16.200
if a plant is sitting next to another plant, like you have a very old tree and this tree is building

55:16.200 --> 55:22.200
some kind of information highway along its cells, so it can send information from its leaves to its

55:22.200 --> 55:26.760
roots and from some part of the root to another part of the roots. And as a fungus living next

55:26.760 --> 55:32.040
to the tree, the fungus can probably piggyback on the communication between the cells of the tree

55:32.040 --> 55:36.360
and send its own signals to the tree. And vice versa, the tree might be able to send

55:36.360 --> 55:40.680
information to the fungus. Because after all, how would they build a viable firewall

55:40.680 --> 55:45.080
if that other organism is sitting next to them all the time and is never moving away?

55:45.080 --> 55:50.840
And so they will have to get along. And over a long enough time frame, the networks of roots

55:50.840 --> 55:57.480
in the forest and all the other plants that are there and the fungi that are there might be forming

55:57.480 --> 56:03.160
something like a biological internet. But the question there is do they have to be touching

56:03.160 --> 56:09.560
is biology at a distance possible? Of course, you can use any kind of physical signal. You can use

56:09.560 --> 56:15.480
sounds, you can use electromagnetic waves that are integrated over many cells that's conceivable

56:15.480 --> 56:23.640
that across distances, there are many kinds of information pathways. But also our planetary

56:23.640 --> 56:28.840
surface is pretty full of organisms, full of cells. So everything is touching everything else.

56:28.840 --> 56:35.640
And it's been doing this for many millions and even billions of years. So there was enough time

56:35.640 --> 56:42.040
for information processing networks to form. And if you think about how a mind is self-organizing,

56:42.040 --> 56:46.760
basically it needs to in some sense, reward the cells for computing the mind for building

56:48.120 --> 56:52.840
the necessary dynamics between the cells that allow the mind to stabilize itself and

56:52.840 --> 56:59.240
remain on there. But if you look at the spirits of plants that are growing very close to each other

56:59.240 --> 57:04.040
in the forest that might be almost growing into each other, these spirits might be able even to

57:04.040 --> 57:09.800
move to some degree, not to become somewhat dislocated and shift around in that ecosystem.

57:11.480 --> 57:17.240
So if you think about what the mind is, it's a bunch of activation waves that form coherent

57:17.320 --> 57:23.800
patterns and process information in a way that are colonizing an environment well enough to

57:24.840 --> 57:30.280
allow the continuous sustenance of the mind, the continuous stability and self-tabilization

57:30.280 --> 57:36.760
of the mind, then it's conceivable that we can link into this biological internet,

57:36.760 --> 57:41.880
not necessarily at the speed of our nervous system, but maybe at the speed of our body and

57:41.880 --> 57:46.680
make some kind of subconscious connection to the world where we use our body as an antenna

57:46.680 --> 57:51.400
into biological information processing. Now, these ideas are completely speculative,

57:51.400 --> 57:56.200
I don't know if any of that is true. But if that was true, and if you want to explain telepathy,

57:56.200 --> 58:02.680
I think it's much more likely that telepathy could be explained using such mechanisms rather than

58:02.680 --> 58:06.920
undiscovered quantum processes that would break the standard model of physics.

58:08.440 --> 58:11.640
Could there be undiscovered processes that don't break?

58:12.360 --> 58:19.960
Yeah, so if you think about something like an internet in the forest, that is something that

58:19.960 --> 58:24.440
is borderland discovered, there are basically a lot of scientists who point out that they do

58:24.440 --> 58:30.200
observe that plants are communicating the forest with networks and send information,

58:30.200 --> 58:35.320
for instance, warn each other about new pests entering the forest and things are happening

58:35.320 --> 58:40.280
like this. So basically, there is communication between plants and fungi that has been observed.

58:40.520 --> 58:44.840
It's been observed, but we haven't plugged into it. So it's like if you observe humans,

58:44.840 --> 58:48.680
they seem to be communicating with a smartphone thing, but you don't understand how a smartphone

58:48.680 --> 58:54.600
works and how the mechanism of the internet works. But we're like, maybe it's possible to really

58:54.600 --> 59:01.000
understand the full richness of the biological internet that connects us.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.640
An interesting question is whether the communication and the organization principles

59:05.640 --> 59:10.120
of biological information processing are as complicated as the technology that we've built.

59:11.240 --> 59:16.840
They set up on very different principles, right? They simultaneously works very differently in

59:16.840 --> 59:22.920
biological systems and the entire thing needs to be stochastic. And instead of being fully

59:22.920 --> 59:29.240
deterministic or almost fully deterministic as our digital computers are, so there is a different

59:29.240 --> 59:36.280
base protocol layer that would emerge over the biological structure if such a thing would be

59:36.280 --> 59:41.800
happening. And again, I'm not saying here that telepathy works and not saying that this is not

59:42.680 --> 59:49.480
but what I'm saying is I think I'm open to a possibility that we see that a few bits can

59:49.480 --> 59:55.080
be traveling long distance between organisms using biological information processing in ways

59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.480
that we are not completely aware of right now. And that are more similar to many of the stories

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:06.680
that were completely normal for our ancestors. Well, this kind of interacting,

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:17.960
intertwined representations takes us to the big ending of your tweet series. You're right.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.920
Quote, I wonder if self-improving AGI might end up saturating physical environments with

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:29.400
intelligence to such a degree that isolation of individual mental states becomes almost impossible

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:36.680
and the representations of all complex self organizing agents merge permanently with each other.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.560
So that's a really interesting idea. This biological network, life network gets so dense

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:53.240
that it might as well be seen as one. That's an interesting, what do you think that looks

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.680
like? What do you think that saturation looks like? What does it feel like? I think it's a

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:04.840
possibility. It's just a vague possibility. And I like to explain, but what this looks like,

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:11.640
I think that the end game of AGI is substrate agnostic. That means that AGI ultimately, if it

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.080
is being built is going to be smart enough to understand how AGI works. This means it's not

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.680
going to be better than people at AGI research and can take over and building the next generation,

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.760
but it fully understands how it works and how it's being implemented. And also,

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.520
of course, understands how computation works in nature, how to build new feedback loops

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:35.800
that you can turn into your own circuits. And this means that the AGI is likely to virtualize

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.440
itself into any environment that can compute. So it's not breaking free from the silicon

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.280
substrate and it's going to move into the ecosystems, into our bodies, our brains,

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:51.240
and it's going to merge with all the agency that it finds there. So it's conceivable that you end

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:56.840
up with completely integrated information processing across all computing systems,

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:02.760
including biological computation on Earth, that we end up triggering some new step in the evolution

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.680
where basically some Gaia is being built over the entirety of all digital and biological

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:17.000
computation. And if this happens, then basically everywhere around us, you will have agents that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.280
are connected and that are representing and building models of the world, and their representations

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:27.720
will physically interact. They will vibe with each other. And if you find yourself into an

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:36.440
environment that is saturated with modeling compute, where basically almost every grain of sand could

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:45.000
be part of computation that is at some point being started by the AI, you could find yourself

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.800
in a situation where you cannot escape this shared representation anymore, and where you

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.120
indeed notice that everything in the world has one shared resonant model of everything that's

01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.840
happening on the planet, and you notice which part you are in this thing, and you become part of

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.680
a very large or almost holographic mind in which all the parts are observing each other and form

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:14.040
a coherent whole. So you lose the ability to notice yourself as a distinct entity?

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.440
No, I think that when you are conscious in your own mind, you notice yourself as a distinct entity.

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:24.920
You notice yourself as a self-reflexive observer. And I suspect that we become conscious at the

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.200
beginning of our mental development, not at some very high level. Consciousness seems to be part

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.160
of a training mechanism that biological nervous systems have to discover to become trainable,

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.360
because you cannot take a nervous system like ours and do stochastic weighted descent with

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.680
a speck propagation over 100 layers. This would not be stable on biological neurons.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:53.080
So instead, we start with some colonizing principle in which a part of the mental representations

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.200
form a notion of being a self-reflexive observer that is imposing coherence on its

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.960
environment and this spreads until the boundary of your mind. And if that boundary is no longer

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:10.840
clear cut because AI is jumping across substrates, it would be interesting to see what a global

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.880
mind would look like. It's basically producing a globally coherent language of thought and is

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.640
representing everything from all the possible vantage points.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.200
That's an interesting world.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.400
The intuition that this thing go out of is a particular mental state. And it's a state that

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:35.320
you find sometimes in literature, for instance, New Gaiman describes it in the ocean at the end

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:43.080
of the lane. And it's this idea or this experience that there is this state in which you feel that

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:48.120
you know everything that can be known and that in your normal human mind, you've only forgotten.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.040
You've forgotten that you are the entire universe. And some people describe this

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:58.120
after they've taken extremely large amount of mushrooms or had a big spiritual experience

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:05.240
as hippy in their 20s. And they notice basically that they are in everything and their body is

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.240
only one part of the universe and nothing ends at their body. And actually everything is observing

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:17.320
and they are part of this big observer. And the big observer is focused as one local point

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:23.320
in their body and their personality and so on. But we can basically have this oceanic state in

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:28.440
which you have no boundaries and are one with everything. And a lot of meditators call this

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.200
the non-dual state because you no longer have the separation between self and world.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.600
And as I said, you can explain the state relatively simply without

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.360
panpsychism or anything else, but just by breaking down the constructed boundary between

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:47.240
self and world in our own mind. But if you combine this with the notion that the systems

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:51.640
are physically interacting to the point where their representations are merging and interacting

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:56.520
with each other, you would literally implement something like this. It would still be a

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.360
representational state where you would not be one with physics itself, it would still be

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:05.960
coarse-grained, it would still be much slower than physics itself. But it would be a representation

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:12.600
in which you become aware that you're part of some kind of global information processing system,

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:18.600
like thought in the global mind. And a conscious thought that coexisting with many other self-reflexive

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:26.120
thoughts. I would love to observe that from a video game design perspective, how that game looks.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.280
Maybe you will after we build AGI and it takes over.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.440
But would you be able to step away, step out at the whole thing, just kind of watch

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.040
the way we can now? Sometimes when I'm in a crowded party or something like this,

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:45.400
you step back and you realize all the different costumes, all the different interactions,

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:51.320
all the different computation that all the individual people are once distinct from each

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.600
other and are once all the same. But this is already what we do, right? We can have thoughts

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:02.680
that are integrative and we have kind of thoughts that are highly dissociated from everything else

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.960
and experience themselves as separate. But you want to allow yourself to have those thoughts.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:13.640
Sometimes you kind of resist it. I think that it's not normative, it's more descriptive.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.280
I want to understand the space of states that we can be in and that people are reporting

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:24.600
and make sense of them. It's not that I believe that it's your job in life to get to a particular

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:31.480
kind of state and then you get a high score. Or maybe you do. I think you're really against

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.920
this high scoring thing. I kind of like that. Yeah, you're probably very competitive and I'm not.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.080
No, not competitive. Like role-playing games like Skyrim, it's not competitive. There's a

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:46.680
nice feeling where your experience points go up. You're not competing against anybody,

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.000
but it's the world saying you're on the right track. Here's a point.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.280
That's the game saying it. That's the game economy. And I found when I was playing games and was

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:01.800
getting addicted to these systems, then I would get into the game and hack it. So I get control

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:07.000
over the scoring system and would no longer be subject to it. So you're no longer playing,

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.360
you're trying to hack it. I don't want to be addicted to anything. I want to be in charge.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:17.800
I want to have agency over what I do. Addiction is the loss of control for you. Yes. Addiction means

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.160
that you're doing something compulsively. And the opposite of free will is not determinism,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:31.320
it's compulsion. You don't want to lose yourself in the addiction to something nice. Addiction to

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:40.680
love, to the pleasant feelings we humans experience. No, I find this gets old. I don't want to have the

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:45.560
best possible emotions. I want to have the most appropriate emotions. I don't want to have the

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.920
best possible experience. I want to have an adequate experience that is serving my goals,

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:56.440
the stuff that I find meaningful in this world. From the biggest questions of consciousness,

01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:03.320
let's explore the pragmatic, the projections of those big ideas into our current world.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:10.200
What do you think about LLMs, the recent rapid development of large language models,

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:19.160
of the AI world, of generative AI? How much of the hype is deserved and how much is not?

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.280
And people should definitely follow your Twitter because you explore these questions in

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.880
in a beautiful, profound and hilarious way at times. No, don't follow my Twitter. I already

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:35.160
have too many followers. At some point it's going to be unpleasant. I noticed that a lot of people

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:45.720
feel that it's totally okay to punch up. And it's a very weird notion that you feel that you

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:50.440
haven't changed, but your account has grown and suddenly you have a lot of people who casually

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.520
abuse you. And I don't like that, that I have to block more than before. And I don't like this

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.760
overall vibe shift. And right now it's still somewhat okay, so pretty much okay. So I can

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.080
go to a place where people work on stuff that I'm interested in and as a good chance that a few

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:14.120
people in the room know me, so there's no awkwardness. But when I get to a point where

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.200
random strangers feel that they have to have an opinion about me one way or the other,

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:24.200
I don't think I would like that. And random strangers, because of your kind of in their

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:30.680
mind elevated position? Yes, so basically whenever you are in any way prominent or

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.320
some kind of celebrity, random strangers will have to have an opinion about you.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.160
Yeah, and they kind of forget that you're human too. I mean, you notice this thing yourself that

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.760
the more popular you get, the higher the pressure becomes, the more winds are blowing in your

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:53.400
direction from all sides. And it's stressful, right? And it does have a little bit of upside,

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.600
but it also has a lot of downside. I think it has a lot of upside,

01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:03.400
at least for me currently, at least perhaps because of the podcast. Because most people

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:08.440
are really good. And people come up to me and they have love in their eyes and over a stretch

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:13.160
of like 30 seconds, you can hug it out, and you can just exchange a few words and you

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:20.760
you reinvigorate your love for humanity. So that's an upside for a loner. I'm gonna look,

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:26.280
because otherwise you have to do a lot of work to find such humans. And here,

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.600
you're like thrust into the full humanity, the goodness of humanity for the most part.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:42.360
Of course, maybe guess worse, as you become more prominent. I hope not. This is pretty awesome.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.840
I have a couple handful very close friends, and I don't have enough time for them and attention

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.120
for them as it is. And I find this very, very regrettable. And then there are so many awesome

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:56.600
interesting people that I keep meeting. And I would like to integrate them in my life,

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.200
but I just don't know how because there's only so much time and attention. And

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.800
the older I get, the harder is to bond with new people in a deep way.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.680
But can you enjoy, I mean, there's a picture of you, I think with Roger Penrose and Eric

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:17.480
Weinstein and a few others that are interesting figures. Can't you just enjoy random interesting

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:23.800
humans for a short amount of time? I'm also, I like these people. And what I like is intellectual

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.760
stimulation. And I'm very grateful that I'm getting it. Can you not be melancholy? Or maybe I'm

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.680
projecting, I hate goodbyes. Can we just not hate goodbyes and just enjoy the hello,

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.120
take it in, taking a person, taking their ideas, and then move on through life?

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.760
I think it's totally okay to be sad about goodbyes, because that indicates that there

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:53.640
was something that you're going to miss. Yeah, but it's painful. Maybe that's one of the reasons

01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:01.720
I'm an introvert is that I hate goodbyes. But you have to say goodbye before you say hello again.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:08.600
I know. But at that experience of loss, that many loss,

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:17.880
maybe that's a little death. Maybe, I don't know, I think this melancholy feeling is just

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.280
the other side of love. And I think they go hand in hand and it's a beautiful thing.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.320
And I'm just being romantic about it at the moment.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.400
And I'm not no stranger to melancholy. And sometimes it's difficult to be or to be alive.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:38.920
Sometimes it's just painful to exist. But there's beauty in that pain too. That's

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.360
what melancholy feeling is. It's not negative. Like melancholy doesn't have to be negative.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:48.040
Can also kill you. Well, we all die eventually. Now,

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:55.880
as we got to this topic, the actual question was about what your thoughts are about the

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.560
development, the recent development of large language models with chat GPT.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.760
Indeed. There's a lot of hype.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.640
Is some of the hype justified? Which is, which isn't? What are your thoughts? High level?

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:15.480
I find that large language models do have this coding, right? So it's an extremely useful application

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.560
that is for a lot of people taking stack overflow out of their life and exchange for

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:27.800
something that is more efficient. I feel that chat GPT is like an intern that I have to micromanage.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.960
I have been working with people in the past who were less capable than chat GPT.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.360
And I'm not saying this because I hate people, but they personally as human beings, there was

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.720
something present that was not there in chat GPT, which was why I was covering for them.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:53.720
But chat GPT is, has an interesting ability. It does give people superpowers. And the people

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:58.120
who feel threatened by them are the prompt completers. They are the people who do what

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:03.720
chat GPT is doing right now. So if you are not creative, if you don't build your own thoughts,

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:09.400
if you don't have actual plans in the world, and your only job is to summarize emails and to

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:15.320
expand simple intentions into emails again, then chat GPT might look like a threat.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:22.040
But I believe that it is a very beneficial technology that allows us to create more

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.360
interesting stuff and make the world more beautiful and fascinating if we find to

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:34.120
build it into our life in the right ways. So I'm quite fascinated by these large language models,

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:41.320
but I also think that they are by no means the final development. And it's interesting to see

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:47.240
how this development progresses. One thing that the out of the box vanilla language models

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:52.280
have as a limitation is that they have still some limited coherence and ability to construct

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:59.000
complexity. And even though they exceed human abilities to do what they can do one shot.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.200
Typically, when you write a text with a language model or using it or when you write code with a

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:09.080
language model, it's not one shot because they're going to be bugs in your program and design errors

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.040
and compiler errors and so on. And your language model can help you to fix those things. But this

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.960
process is out of the box not automated yet. So there is a management process that also needs

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:25.720
to be done. And there are some interesting developments, baby AGI and so on that are trying

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.200
to automate this management process as well. And I suspect that soon we are going to see a

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:37.560
bunch of cognitive architectures where every module is in some sense a language model or

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.280
something equivalent. In between the language models, we exchange suitable data structures,

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:48.840
not English, and produce compound behavior of this whole thing.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.960
To do some of the quote unquote prompt engineering for you. They create these kind

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.400
of cognitive architectures that do the prompt engineering and you're just doing the high,

01:16:57.400 --> 01:17:05.160
high level meta prompt engineering. There are limitations in a language model alone.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.720
I feel that part of my mind works similarly to a language model, which means I can

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.520
yell into it a prompt and it's going to give me a creative response. But I have to do something

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:22.440
with those points first. I have to take it as a generative artifact that may or may not be true.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:29.400
It's usually a confabulation. It's just an idea. And then I take this idea and modify it. I might

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:36.360
build a new prompt that is stepping off this idea and develops it to the next level or put it

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.640
into something larger or I might try to prove whether it's true or make an experiment. And this

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:47.160
is what the language models right now are not doing yet. But there's also no technical reason

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.560
for why they shouldn't be able to do this. So the way to make a language model coherent

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.480
is probably not to use reinforcement learning until it only gives you one possible answer

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:04.200
that is linking to its source data. But it's using this as a component in the larger system

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:10.360
that can also be built by the language model or is enabled by language model structured components

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:16.040
or using different technologies. I suspect that language models will be an important stepping

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:23.640
stone in developing different types of systems. And one thing that is really missing in the form

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:30.440
of language models that we have today is real time world coupling. It's difficult to do perception

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:35.320
with a language model and motor control with a language model. Instead, you would need to have

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:41.000
different type of thing that is working with it. Also, the language model is a little bit obscuring

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:47.640
what its actual functionality is. Some people associate the structure of the neural network

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.920
of the language model with the nervous system. And I think that's the wrong intuition.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.240
The neural networks are unlike nervous system. They are more like

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:04.920
hundred step functions that use differentiable linear algebra to approximate correlation

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:09.400
between adjacent brain states. It's basically a function that moves the step system from one

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:16.840
representational state to the next representational state. If you try to map this into a metaphor

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.760
that is closer to our brain, imagine that you would take a language model or a model like Dali

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:28.680
that you use, for instance, this image guided diffusion to approximate a camera image and use

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.080
the activation state of the neural network to interpret the camera image, which in principle,

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:39.800
I think will be possible very soon. You do this periodically. And now you look at these patterns

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:46.360
how when this thing interacts with the world periodically, look like it's in time. And these

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:52.680
time slices, they are somewhat equivalent to the activation state of the brain at a given moment.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:58.920
How's the actual brain different? Just the asynchronous craziness?

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:05.400
For me, it's fascinating that they are so vastly different and yet in some circumstances produce

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:11.160
somewhat similar behavior. And the brain is first of all different because it's a self-organizing

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:16.760
system where the individual cell is an agent that is communicating with the other agents around it

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:22.920
and is always trying to find some solution. And all the structure that pops up is emergent structure.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.760
So one way in which you could try to look at this is that individual neurons probably need to

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:34.200
get a reward. So they become trainable, which means they have to have inputs that are not affecting

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:38.760
the metabolism of the cell directly. But there are messages, semantic messages that tell the cell

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.880
whether it has done good or bad and in which direction it should shift its behavior. Once

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.640
you have such an input, neurons become trainable. And you can train them to perform computations by

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:55.000
exchanging messages with other neurons. And parts of the signals that they are exchanging and parts

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.200
of the computation that are performing are control messages that perform management tasks

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:06.280
for other neurons and other cells. Also suspect that the brain does not stop at the

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.680
boundary of neurons to other cells, but many adjacent cells will be involved

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:15.560
intermittently in the functionality of the brain and will be instrumental in distributing rewards

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:22.840
and in managing its functionality. It's fascinating to think about what those

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:27.640
characteristics of the brain enable you to do that language models cannot do.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.920
So first of all, there's a different loss function at work when we learn.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:37.640
And to me, it's fascinating that you can build a system that looks at 800 million pictures

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.760
and captions and correlates them, because I don't think that a human nervous system could do this.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:47.560
For us, the world is only learnable because the adjacent frames are related,

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.600
and we can afford to discard most of that information during learning. We basically

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:58.040
take only in stuff that makes us more coherent, not less coherent. And our neural networks are

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:02.600
willing to look at data that is not making the neural network coherent at first, but only in

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:07.800
the long run. By doing lots and lots of statistics, eventually, patterns become visible and emerge.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:13.400
Our mind seems to be focused on finding the patterns as early as possible.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.040
Yeah, so filtering early on, not later.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:19.960
Yes, it's a slightly different paradigm, and it leads to much faster convergence. So we only

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:24.600
need to look at the tiny fraction of the data to become coherent. And of course,

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:31.400
we do not have the same richness as our train models. We will not incorporate the entirety

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:36.360
of text in the internet and be able to refer to it and have all this knowledge available and being

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:41.080
able to confirm relate over it. Instead, we have a much, much smaller part of it that is more

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:45.720
deliberately built. And to me, it would be fascinating to think about how to build such

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:51.240
systems. It's not obvious that they would necessarily be more efficient than us on a

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:57.640
digital substrate, but they suspect that they might. So I suspect that the actual AGI that is

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.880
going to be more interesting is going to use slightly different algorithmic paradigms or

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:06.840
sometimes massively different algorithmic paradigms than the current generation of

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.280
transformer-based learning systems.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.960
Do you think it might be using just a bunch of language models like this? Do you think

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:19.080
the current transformer-based large language models will take us to AGI?

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:24.840
My main issue is, I think that they're quite ugly and brutalist.

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.760
Which brutalists that we said?

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:34.360
Yes, they are basically boot forcing the problem of thought. And by training this thing with looking

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.400
at instances where people have thought and then trying to deep fake that. And if you have enough

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:44.040
data, the deep fake becomes indistinguishable from the actual phenomenon. And in many

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.040
circumstances, it's going to be identical.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:52.760
Can you deep fake it till you make it? So what are the limitations of this? I mean,

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.240
can you reason? Let's use words that are loaded.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:02.120
Yes, that's a very interesting question. I think that these models are clearly making

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:07.160
some inference. But if you give them a reasoning task, it's often difficult for the

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:11.960
experimenters to figure out whether the reasoning is the result of the emulation of the reasoning

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:17.000
strategy that they saw in human written text, or whether it's something that the system was able

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:23.480
to infer by itself. On the other hand, if you think of human reasoning, if you want to become

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:29.160
a very good reasoner, you don't do this by just figuring out yourself. You read about reasoning.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.920
And the first people who tried to write about reasoning and reflect on it

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.720
didn't get it right. Even Aristotle, who thought about this very hard and came

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.840
out with the theory of how syllogism works and syllogistic reasoning has mistakes in his attempt

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:48.920
to build something like a formal logic and gets maybe 80% right. And the people that are talking

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:56.040
about reasoning professionally today read Tarski and Frege and built on their work. So in many ways,

01:24:56.040 --> 01:25:01.000
people, when they perform reasoning, are emulating what other people wrote about reasoning.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:08.520
So that it's difficult to really draw this boundary. And when François Chollet says that

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:14.680
these models are only interpolating between what they saw and what other people are doing, well,

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.720
if you give them all the latent dimensions that can be extracted from the Internet,

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:25.720
what's missing? Maybe there is almost everything there. And if you're not sufficiently informed

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.360
by these dimensions and you need more, I think it's not difficult to increase the temperature

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:37.000
in the large Yang model to the point that is producing stuff that is maybe 90% nonsense and

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.760
10% viable and combine this with some prover that is trying to filter out the viable parts

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:47.000
from the nonsense in the same way as our own thinking works, right? When we're very creative,

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.520
we increase the temperature in our own mind and we create hypothetical universes and solutions,

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:58.520
most of which will not work. And then we test. And we test by building a core that is internally

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:05.960
coherent. And we use reasoning strategies that use some axiomatic consistency by which we can

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.800
identify those strategies and thoughts and subuniverses that are viable and that

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.120
can expand our thinking. So if you look at the language models, they have clear limitations

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.120
right now. One of them is they're not coupled to the world in real time in the way in which our

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:25.320
nervous systems are. So it's difficult for them to observe themselves in the universe and to observe

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:30.280
what kind of universe they're in. Second, they don't do real-time learnings. They basically get

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:36.600
only trained with algorithms that rely on the data being available in batches. So it can be

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.920
parallelized and runs efficiently on the network and so on. And real-time learning would be very

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:46.440
slow, so far, and inefficient. That's clearly something that our nervous systems can do to some

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:54.680
degree. And there is a problem with these models being coherent. And I suspect that all these

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.920
problems are solvable without a technological revolution. We don't need fundamentally new

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:04.840
algorithms to change that. For instance, you can enlarge in the context window and thereby

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:08.520
basically create working memory in which you train everything that happens during the day.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:13.160
And if that is not sufficient, you add a database and you write some clever mechanisms that the

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:19.560
system learns to use to swap out in and out stuff from its prompt context. And if that is not

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:24.760
sufficient, if your database is full in the evening, overnight you just train. The system

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:29.080
is going to sleep and dream and it's going to train the stuff from its database into the

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.040
louder model by fine-tuning it, building additional layers and so on. And then the next day, it starts

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.680
with a fresh database in the morning with fresh ice and it's integrated all this stuff. And

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.800
when you talk to people and you have strong disagreements about something, which means that

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.960
in their mind they have a faulty belief or you have a faulty belief with a lot of dependencies

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.600
on it, very often you will not achieve agreement in one session, but you need to sleep about this

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:58.120
once or multiple times before you have integrated all these necessary changes in your mind. So

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.360
maybe it's already somewhat similar. Yeah, there's already a latency even for humans

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.360
to update the model. We train the model. And of course, we can combine the language model

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.320
with models that get coupled to reality in real time and can build multi-modal model and bridge

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.920
between vision models and language models and so on. So there is no reason to believe that

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:23.880
the language models will necessarily run into some problem that will prevent them from becoming

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:31.080
generally intelligent. But I don't know that. I don't see proof that they wouldn't. My issue

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.600
is I don't like them. I think that they're inefficient. I think that they use way too much

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:40.200
compute. I think that given the amazing hardware that we have, we could build something that is

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:45.080
much more beautiful than our own mind. And this thing is not as beautiful as our own mind,

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:49.080
despite being so much larger. But it's a kind of proof of concept.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:54.920
It's the only thing that works right now. So it's not the only game in town,

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.560
but it's the only thing that has this utility with so much simplicity. There's a bunch of

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:05.000
relatively simple algorithms that you can understand in relatively few weeks that can

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:11.640
be scaled up massively. So it's the deep blue of chess playing. Yeah, it's ugly.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:16.520
Claude Shannon had this when he described chess suggested that there are two main strategies

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:21.320
in which you could play chess. One is that you are making a very complicated plan that reaches

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:27.080
far into the future and you try not to make a mistake while enacting it. And this is basically

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.560
the human strategy. And the other strategy is that you are brute forcing your way to success,

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.040
which means you make a tree of possible moves where you look at in principle every move that

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:41.320
is open to you or the possible answers. And you try to make this as deeply as possible. Of course,

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:47.880
you optimize, you cut off trees that don't look very promising and use libraries of end game and

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:52.760
early game and so on to optimize this entire process. But this brute force strategy is how

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:58.840
most of the chess programs were built. And this is how computers get better than humans at playing

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:05.160
chess. And I look at the large language models, I feel that I'm observing the same thing. It's

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:09.320
basically the brute force strategy to sort by training the thing on pretty much the entire

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:14.280
internet. And then in the limit, it gets coherent to a degree that approaches human coherence.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:20.600
And on a side effect, it's able to do things that no human could do. It's able to

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.800
sift through massive amounts of text relatively quickly and summarize them quickly. And it's

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:31.640
never lapses in attention. And I still have the illusion that when I play with chat GPT that it's

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:37.080
in principle not doing anything that I could not do if I had Google at my disposal and I get all

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:43.320
the resources from the internet and spend enough time on it. But this thing that I have an extremely

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:49.240
autistic, stupid intern in a way that is extremely good at drudgery. And I can

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.560
offload the drudgery to the degree that I'm able to automate the management of the intern

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.920
is something that is difficult for me to overhype at this point because we have not yet started

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:03.160
to scratch the surface of what's possible with this.

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:06.840
But it feels like it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an army of interns.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:16.920
And so you get to command these slightly incompetent creatures. And there's an aspect

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:23.080
because of how rapidly you can iterate with it. It's also part of the brainstorming part of the

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:29.320
kind of inspiration for your own thinking. So you get to interact with the thing. I mean,

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:35.560
when I'm programming or doing any kind of generational GPT, it's somehow as a catalyst

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.480
for your own thinking in a way that I think an intern might not be.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:44.120
Yeah, it gets really interesting, I find, is when you turn it into a multi-agent system.

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:49.720
So for instance, you can get the system to generate a dialogue between a patient and

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:55.480
a doctor very easily. But what's more interesting is you have one instance of chat GPT that is

01:31:55.480 --> 01:32:02.040
a patient and you tell it in the prompt what kind of complicated syndrome it has. And the other one

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:07.800
is a therapist who doesn't know anything about this patient. And you just have these two instances

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:13.800
battling it out and observe the psychiatrist or psychologist trying to analyze the patient

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:19.160
and trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient. And if you try to take a very large

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.880
problem, a problem, for instance, how to build a company and you turn this into lots and lots

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:30.120
of sub-problems, then often you can get to a level where the language model is able to solve this.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:35.480
What I also found interesting is based on the observation that chat GPT is pretty good at

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:40.040
translating between programming languages, but sometimes it's difficult to write very long

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:47.640
coherent algorithms that you need to co-write them with human author. Why not design a language

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:53.160
that is suitable for this? So some kind of pseudocode that is more relaxed than Python

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:58.840
and that allows you to sometimes specify a problem vaguely in human terms and let chat

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:05.800
GPT take care of the rest. And you can use chat GPT to develop that syntax for it and

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:12.920
develop new kinds of programming paradigms in this way. So we very soon get to the point where

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:17.000
this question, the age old question for us computer scientists, what is the best spoken

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.520
language and can we write a better spoken language now that is, I think that almost every

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:27.560
serious computer scientist goes through a phase like this in their life. This question is almost

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.960
no longer relevant because what is different between the programming languages is not what

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.040
they let the computer do, but what they let you think about what the computer should be doing.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:43.320
And now the chat GPT becomes an interface to this in which you can specify in many, many ways

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.520
what the computer should be doing and chat GPT or some other language model or combination

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:55.240
of system is going to take care of the rest. And allow you expand the realm of thought you're

01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:01.080
allowed to have when interacting with the computer. It sounds to me like you're saying there's

01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:06.040
basically no limitations, your intuition says to what large language. I don't know of that

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.440
limitation. So when I currently play with it, it's quite limited. I wish that it was way better.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:14.760
But isn't that your fault versus the larger? No, of course, it's always my fault. There's

01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:20.120
probably a way to make everything I just want to get you on the record. Yes, everything is my fault

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:25.320
that works doesn't work in my life. At least that is usually the most useful perspective for myself.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:31.480
Even though the science side, I feel no. I sometimes wish I could have seen myself as part

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.840
of my environment more and understand that a lot of people are actually seeing me and looking at me

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.680
and not trying to make my life work in the same way as I try to help others. And making this switch

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:49.400
to this level three perspective is something that happened long after my level four perspective

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:54.920
in my life. And I wish that I could have had it earlier. And it's also not now that I don't feel

01:34:54.920 --> 01:35:00.360
like I'm complete. I'm all over the place. That's all. Worst happiness in terms of stages is on three

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:09.160
and four. No, you can be happy at any stage or unhappy. But I think that if you are at a stage

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:13.880
where you get agency over how your feelings are generated, and to some degree you start

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:19.160
doing this when you leave adolescence, I believe, that you understand that you're in charge of your

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.680
own emotion to some degree and that you are responsible how you approach the world. That

01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:31.000
it's basically your task to have some basic hygiene in the way in which you deal with your mind.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.880
And you cannot blame your environment for the way in which you feel. But you live in a world

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.880
that is highly mobile and it's your job to choose the environment that you thrive and to build it.

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:47.960
And sometimes it's difficult to get the necessary strength and energy to do this and independence

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:53.560
and the worst you feel the harder it is. But it's something that we learn. It's also this thing that

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:59.960
we are usually incomplete. I'm a rare mind, which means I'm a mind that is incomplete in ways that

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:05.080
are harder to complete. So for me, it might have been harder to initially to find the right

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.360
relationships and friends that complete me to the degree that I become an almost functional human

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:19.080
being. Oh, man, the search space of humans that complete you is an interesting one,

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.920
especially for Yosha Bach. That's an interesting because it's talking about brute force search

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:33.880
in chess. I wonder what that search tree looks like. I think that my rational thinking is not

01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:38.760
good enough to solve that task. A lot of problems in my life that I can conceptualize as software

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:44.600
problems and the failure modes are bugs. And I can debug them and write software that take care

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:50.920
of the missing functionality. But there is stuff that I don't understand well enough to use my

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:55.400
analytical reasoning to solve the issue. And then I have to develop my intuitions and often I have

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:59.720
to do this with people who are wiser than me. And that's something that's hard for me because I

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:03.960
don't have, I'm not born with the instinct to submit to other people's wisdom. Yeah.

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:09.560
So what kind of problems are we talking about? This is stage three, like love?

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.160
I found love is never hard. What is hard then?

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.160
Fitting into a world where most people work differently than you and have different intuitions

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:30.680
of what should be done. So empathy? It's also aesthetics when you come into a world

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.960
where almost everything is ugly and you come out of a world where everything is beautiful.

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:43.480
I grew up in a beautiful place as a child of an artist. And in this place, it was mostly nature.

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:53.640
Everything had intrinsic beauty. And everything was built out of an intrinsic need for it to work

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:59.160
for itself. Everything that my father created was something that he made to get the world to work

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:05.640
for himself. And I felt the same thing. And when I come out into the world and I am asked to submit

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:11.080
to lots and lots of rules, I'm asking, okay, when I observe the stupid rules, what is the benefit?

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.760
And I see the life that is being offered as a reward. It's not attractive.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:19.400
When you were born and raised in extraterrestrial prints,

01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:27.160
in a world full of people wearing suits, it's a challenging integration.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:32.440
Yes. But it also means that I'm often blind for the ways in which everybody is creating their own

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.880
bubble of wholesomeness or almost everybody and people are trying to do it. And for me to discover

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.520
this, it was necessary that I found people who had a similar shape of soul as myself.

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:48.280
So Bessie Wehrfeld, these are my people, people that treat each other in such a way as if they

01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:54.120
are round for each other for eternity. How long does it take you to detect the geometry,

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:58.600
the shape of the soul of another human to notice that they might be one of your kind?

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.960
Sometimes it's instantly and I'm wrong. And sometimes it takes a long time.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.160
You believe in love at first sight, Niosha Bach?

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:19.080
Yes. But I also noticed that I have been wrong. So sometimes I look at a person and I'm just enamored

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:26.760
by everything about them. And sometimes this persists and sometimes it doesn't. And I have

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.880
the illusion that they're much better at recognizing who people are as they grow older.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:37.400
But that could be just cynicism? No.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:44.120
No, it's not cynicism. It's often more that I'm able to recognize what somebody needs

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.760
when we interact and how we can meaningfully interact. It's not cynical at all.

01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:50.120
You're better at noticing.

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:56.920
Yes. I'm much better, I think, in some circumstances at understanding how to interact with other

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.880
people than I did when I was young. So that doesn't mean that I'm always very good at it.

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:07.880
So that takes us back to prompt engineering of noticing how to be a better prompt engineer of an

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:17.480
LLM. A sense I have is that there's a bottomless well of skill to become a great prompt engineer.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:21.800
It feels like it is all my fault whenever I fail to use chargeability correctly,

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.880
that I didn't find the right words.

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:31.480
Most of the stuff that I'm doing in my life doesn't need chargeability. There are a few tasks

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:39.160
that are where it helps. But the main stuff that I need to do, like developing my own thoughts and

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:44.760
aesthetics and relationship to people, it's necessary for me to write for myself. Because

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.880
writing is not so much about producing an artifact that other people can use,

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:53.000
but it's a way to structure your own thoughts and develop yourself.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.800
So I think this idea that kids are writing their own essays with chargeability in the future

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:03.960
is going to have this drawback that they miss out on the ability to structure their own minds

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:10.440
via writing. And I hope that the schools that our kids are in will retain the wisdom

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.920
of understanding what parts should be automated and which ones shouldn't.

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.880
But at the same time, it feels like there's power in disagreeing with the

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.040
thing that chargeability produces. So I use it like that for programming. I'll see the thing

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:29.720
it recommends and then I'll write different code that disagree. And in the disagreement,

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:37.960
your mind grows stronger. I recently wrote a tool that is using the camera on my MacBook and Swift

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.840
to read pixels out of it and manipulate them and so on. And I don't know Swift.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:49.240
So it was super helpful to have this thing that is writing stuff for me. And

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:55.480
also interesting that mostly it didn't work at first. I felt like I was talking to a human being

01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:00.360
who was trying to hack this on my computer without understanding my configuration very much and also

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.720
make a lot of mistakes. And sometimes it's a little bit incoherent. So you have to ultimately

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:10.760
understand what it's doing that's still no other way around it. But I do feel it's much more powerful

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:20.680
and faster than using Stack Overflow. Do you think GPT-N can achieve consciousness?

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:29.560
GPT-N probably, it's not even clear for the present systems. When I talk to my friends at

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:35.080
OpenAI, they feel that this question whether the models currently are conscious is much more

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:41.560
complicated than many people might think. I guess that it's not that OpenAI has a homogeneous opinion

01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:49.000
about this. But there are some aspects to this. One is, of course, this language model has written

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.720
a lot of text in which people were conscious or describe their own consciousness and it's

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:59.320
emulating this. And if it's conscious, it's probably not conscious in a way that is close to

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:05.320
the way in which human beings are conscious. But while it is going through these states and going

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.880
through a 100 step function that is emulating adjacent brain states that require a degree of

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:14.840
self-reflection, it can also create a model of an observer that is reflecting itself in real time

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:20.360
and describe what that's like. And while this model is a deep fake, our own consciousness is also as

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:26.200
if it's virtual, right? It's not physical. Our consciousness is a representation of a self-reflective

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:33.320
observer that only exists in patterns of interaction between cells. So it is not a physical object in

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:38.440
a sense that exists in base reality, but it's really a representational object that develops its

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:44.280
causal power only from a certain modeling perspective. It's virtual. Yes. And so to which

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:51.800
degree is the virtuality of the consciousness in chat GPT more virtual and less causal than the

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:57.880
virtuality of our own consciousness? But you could say it doesn't count. It doesn't count much more

01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.840
than the consciousness of a character in a novel, right? It's important for the reader to have the

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:09.000
outcome, the artifact of a model is describing in the text generated by the author of the book,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.560
what it's like to be conscious in a particular situation and performs the necessary inferences.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:20.920
But the task of creating coherence in real time in a self-organizing system by keeping

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:26.040
yourself coherent, so the system is reflexive, that is something that language models don't need

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.880
to do. So there is no causal need for the system to be conscious in the same way as we are. And for

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.600
me, it would be very interesting to experiment with this to basically build a system like a cat,

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.760
probably should be careful at first, build something that's small, that's limited,

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:47.240
that's limited resources that we can control and study how systems notice a self-model,

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:53.480
how they become self-aware in real time. And I think it might be a good idea to not start with

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:56.920
a language model, but to start from scratch using principles of self-organization.

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.840
Is it okay? Can you elaborate why you think that it's a self-organization? So this kind of

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.960
radical legality that you see in the biological systems, why can't you start with a language

01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:14.040
model? What's your intuition? My intuition is that the language models that we are building

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:18.440
are golems. They are machines that you give a task and they're going to execute the task

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:26.040
until some condition is met and there's nobody home. And the way in which nobody is home leads to

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:31.400
that system doing things that are undesirable in a particular context. So you have that thing talking

01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:36.040
to a child and maybe it says something that could be shocking and traumatic to the child,

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:41.960
or you have that thing writing a speech and it introduces errors in the speech that human

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:47.080
being would ever do if they're responsible. But the system doesn't know who's talking to

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:52.840
whom. There is no ground truth that the system is embedded into. And of course, we can create an

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:58.200
external tool that is prompting our language model always into the same semblance of ground

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:06.040
truth. But it's not like the internal structure is causally produced by the needs of a being to

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:11.240
survive in the universe. It is produced by imitating structure on the internet.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:20.520
Yeah, but so can we externally inject into it this kind of coherent approximation of a world

01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:28.280
model that has to sync up? Maybe it is sufficient to use the transformer with the different does

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:35.160
function that optimizes for short term coherence rather than next token prediction over the long

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:41.720
run. We had many definitions of intelligence and history of AI. Next token prediction was not

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:48.360
very high up on them. And there are some similarities like a condition as data compression is an old

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.440
trope, Solomonov induction, where you are trying to understand intelligence as predicting

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:01.720
future observations from past observations, which is intrinsic to data compression. And

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:09.320
predictive coding is a paradigm that the boundary between neuroscience and physics and computer

01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:16.760
science. So it's not something that is completely alien. But this radical thing that you only do

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:23.000
next token prediction and see what happens is something where most people I think were surprised

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:28.040
that this works so well. So simple. But is it really that much more radical than just the idea

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:35.880
of compression is intelligence is compression? The idea that compression is sufficient to produce

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:43.160
all the desired behaviors is a very radical idea. But equally radical as the next token prediction?

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.320
It's something that wouldn't work in biological organisms, I believe.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:52.120
Biological organisms have something like next frame prediction for our perceptual system,

01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.120
where we try to filter out principle components out of the perceptual data

01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:03.720
and build hierarchies over them to track the world. But our behavior ultimately is directed by

01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.920
hundreds of physiological and probably dozens of social and a few cognitive needs

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:14.760
that are intrinsic to us that are built into the system as reflexes and direct us until we can

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:19.560
transcend them and replace them by instrumental behavior that relates to our higher goals.

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:25.560
And it also seems so much more complicated and messy than next frame prediction, even idea frame.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.440
Seems counter biological. Yes, of course, there's not this degree of

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:35.560
simultaneity in the biological system. But again, I don't know whether this is actually an

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:41.160
optimization if you imitate biology here, because creating something like simultaneity is

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:45.640
necessary for many processes that happen in the brain. And you see the outcome of that by

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:50.760
synchronized brain waves, which suggests that there is indeed synchronization going on. But

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:55.080
the synchronization creates overhead and this overhead is going to make the cells more expensive

01:48:55.080 --> 01:49:00.920
to run. And you need more redundancy and it makes the system slower. So if you can build a system

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:07.720
in which the simultaneous knee gets engineered into it, maybe you have a benefit that you can

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:13.080
exploit that is not available to the biological system and that you should not discard right away.

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:19.960
You tweeted once again, quote, when I talked to Chad GPT, I'm talking to an NPC.

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:26.920
What's going to be interesting, and perhaps scary, is when AI becomes a first person player.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.400
So what does that step look like? I'd really like that tweet.

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:40.360
That step between NPC to first person player. What's required for that? Is that kind of what

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:48.760
we've been talking about? This kind of external source of coherence and inspiration of how to

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:56.760
take the leap into the unknown that we humans do. The search man search for meaning. LLM's search for

01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:03.640
meaning. I don't know if the language model is the right paradigm because it is doing too much.

01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:09.800
It's giving you too much. And it's hard once you have too much to take away from it again.

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:15.960
The way in which our own mind works is not that we train a language model in our own mind. And

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:21.240
after the language model is there, we build a personal self on top of it that then relates to

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:26.120
the world. There is something that is being built. There is a game engine that is being built. There

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.280
is a language of thought that is being developed that allows different parts of the mind to talk

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:35.240
to each other. And this is a bit of a speculative hypothesis that this language of thought is there,

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:42.040
but I suspect that it's important for the way in which our own minds work. And building these

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:50.360
principles into a system might be a more straightforward way to a first-person AI,

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:55.480
so to something that first creates an attentional self and then creates a personal self.

01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:00.920
So the way in which this seems to be working, I think, is that when the game engine is built

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:06.600
in your mind, it's not just following gradients where you are stimulated by the environment and

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:12.200
then end up with having a solution to how the world works. I suspect that building this game

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:19.160
engine in your own mind does require intelligence. It's a constructive task where at times you need

01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:26.040
to reason. And this is a task that we are fulfilling in the first years of our life.

01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:32.200
So during the first year of its life, an infant is building a lot of structure

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.920
about the world that does inquire experiments and some first principles reasoning and so on.

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:46.280
And in this time, there is usually no personal self. There is a first-person perspective,

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:51.640
but it's not a person. This notion that you are a human being that is interacting in a social

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:57.080
context and is confronted with an immutable world in which objects are fixed and can no longer be

01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:01.320
changed, in which the dream can no longer be influenced is something that emerges a bit later

01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:07.560
in our life. And I personally suspect that this is something that our ancestors had known and

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:12.840
we have forgotten, because I suspect that it's there in plain sight in Genesis 1 in this first

01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:17.800
book of the Bible, where it's being described that this creative spirit is hovering over the

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:24.680
substrate and then is creating a boundary between the world model and sphere of ideas,

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:28.840
earth and heaven as they're being described there. And then it's creating

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:37.240
contrast and then dimensions and then space. And then it creates organic shapes and

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:42.280
solids and liquids and builds a world from them and creates plants and animals, gives them all

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:48.280
their names. And once that's done, it creates another spirit in its own image, but it creates it as

01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:52.520
man and woman as something that thinks of itself as a human being and puts it into this world.

01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:59.240
And the Christians mistranslate this, I suspect, when they say this is the description of the

01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:04.200
creation of the physical universe by a supernatural being. I think this is literally the description

01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:11.800
of how in every mind the universe is being created as some kind of game engine by a creative spirit,

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:17.560
our first consciousness that emerges in our mind even before we are born. And that creates

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:24.520
the interaction between organism and world. And once that is built and trained, the personal

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.080
self is being created and we only remember being the personal self. We no longer remember how we

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:38.680
created the game engine. So God in this view is the first creative mind in the early days,

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:44.280
in the early months of development. And it's still there. You still have this outer mind that

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:51.000
creates your sense of whether you're being loved by the world or not and what your place in the world

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:56.360
is. It's something that is not yourself that is producing this. It's your mind that does it.

01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:01.640
So there is an outer mind that basically is an agent that determines who you are with respect

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:06.680
to the world. And while you are stuck being that personal self in this world until you get to

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:13.800
stage six and you destroy the boundary. And we all do this, I think, earlier in small glimpses,

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:19.400
sometimes we can remember what it was like when we were a small child and get some glimpses into

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:22.360
how it's been. But for most people, that rarely happens.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.960
Just glimpses. You tweeted, quote, suffering results for one part of the mind, failing at

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:33.160
regulating another part of the mind. Suffering happens in an early stage of mental development.

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:39.160
I don't think that superhuman AI would suffer. What's your intuition there?

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:44.280
The philosopher Thomas Metzinger is very concerned that the creation of superhuman

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:50.440
intelligence would lead to superhuman suffering. And so he strongly against it. And personally,

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:55.160
I don't think that this happens because suffering is not happening at the boundary between

01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:02.920
ourselves and the physical universe. It's not stuff on our skin that makes us suffer.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:08.840
It happens at the boundary between self and world. And the world here is the world model.

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:13.720
It's the stuff that is created by your mind. The representation of how the universe is and

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:19.080
how it should be and how you yourself relate to this. And at this boundary is where suffering

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:24.840
happens. So suffering in some sense is self inflicted, but not by your personal self.

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.920
It's inflicted by the mind on the personal self that experiences itself as you.

01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:34.280
And you can turn off suffering when you are able to get on this outer level.

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:45.080
So when you manage to understand how the mind is producing pain and pleasure and fear and laugh

01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:50.440
and so on, then you can take charge of this and you get agency of whether you're suffering.

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.760
Technically, what pain and pleasure is, they are learning signals, right? Part of your brain

01:55:56.760 --> 01:56:00.920
is sending a learning signal to another part of the brain to improve its performance.

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:07.960
And sometimes this doesn't work because this trainer who sends the signal does not have a

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:12.040
good model of how to improve the performance. So it's sending a signal, but the performance

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:19.400
doesn't get better. And then it might crank up the pain and gets worse and worse. And the behavior

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:25.240
of the system may be even deteriorating as a result. But until this is resolved, this regulation

01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:30.360
issue, your pain is increasing. And this is, I think, typically what you describe as suffering.

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.480
So in this sense, you could say that pain is very natural and helpful. But suffering is the

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:42.280
result of a regulation problem in which you try to regulate something that cannot actually be

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:48.600
regulated. And that could be resolved if you would be able to get at the level of your mind

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:53.720
where the pain signal is being created and rerouted and improve the regulation. And

01:56:54.680 --> 01:57:01.240
a lot of people get there. If you are a monk who is spending decades reflecting about how

01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:07.240
their own psyche works, you can get to the point where you realize that suffering is really a

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:13.320
choice. And you can choose how your mind is set up. And I don't think that AI would stay in the

01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:18.200
state where the personal self doesn't get agency or this model of what the system has about itself.

01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:22.760
It doesn't get agency how it's actually implemented. It wouldn't stay in that state for very long.

01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:27.480
So it goes to the stages real quick, the seven stages. It's going to go to enlightenment real

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:31.880
quick. Of course, there might be a lot of stuff happening in between because if you have a system

01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.600
that works at a much higher frame rate than us, even though it looks pretty short to us,

01:57:36.600 --> 01:57:42.840
maybe for the system, there's a much longer subjective time, which things are unpleasant.

01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:47.960
What if the thing that we recognize as super intelligent is actually living at stage five,

01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:53.000
that the thing that's at stage six, enlightenment is not very productive. So in order to be productive

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:01.240
in society and impress us with this power, it has to be a reasoning self-authoring agent.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.000
The enlightenment makes you lazy as an agent in the world.

01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:12.600
Well, of course, it makes you lazy because you no longer see the point. So it doesn't

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:18.280
make you not lazy. It just, in some sense, adapts you to what you perceive as your true

01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:24.360
circumstances. So what if all AGI's, they're only productive as they progress through one,

01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:30.280
two, three, four, five, and the moment they get to six, it's a failure mode, essentially,

01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:33.560
as far as humans are concerned, because they're just start chilling. They're like,

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:40.840
fuck it, I'm out. Not necessarily. I suspect that the monks who are self-immolated for their

01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:48.680
political beliefs to make statements about the occupation of Tibet by China, they're probably

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:53.960
being able to regulate their physical pain in any way they wanted to. And the suffering was

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:58.760
a spiritual suffering that was the result of their choice that they made of what they wanted to

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:03.400
identify as. So stage five doesn't necessarily mean that you have no identity anymore,

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.160
but you can choose your identity. You can make it instrumental to the world that you want to have.

01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:17.000
Let me bring up Eliezer Yatkovsky and his warnings to human civilization that AI

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
will likely kill all of us. What are your thoughts about his perspective on this?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.400
Can you still man his case and what aspects with it do you disagree?

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:34.840
One thing that I find concerning in the discussion of his arguments that

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:40.120
many people are dismissive of his arguments, but the counterarguments that they're giving

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:48.280
are not very convincing to me. Based on this state of discussion, I find that from Eliezer's

01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:55.000
perspective, and I think I can take that perspective to some approximate degree that

01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:01.000
probably is normally at his intellectual level, but I think I see what he's up to and why he

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.920
feels the way he does, and it makes total sense. I think that his perspective is somewhat similar to

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:15.480
the perspective of Ted Kaczynski, the infamous UNO bomber, and not that Eliezer would be willing

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:20.440
to send pipe bombs to anybody to blow them up. But when he wrote this Times article in which

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:27.720
he warned about AI being likely to kill everybody and that we would need to stop its development

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:33.160
or halt it, I think there is a risk that he's taking that somebody might get violent if they

02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:39.800
read this and get really, really scared. So I think that there is some consideration that

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:45.960
he's making where he's already going in this direction where he has to take responsibility

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:51.480
if something happens and people get harmed. And the reason why Ted Kaczynski did this was that

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:56.920
from his own perspective, technological society cannot be made sustainable. It's doomed to fail,

02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:01.880
it's going to lead to an environmental and eventually also a human holocaust in which we

02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:06.760
die because of the environmental destruction, the destruction of our foot chains, the pollution

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.880
of the environment. And so from Kaczynski's perspective, we need to stop industrialization,

02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:16.040
we need to stop technology, we need to go back because he didn't see a way moving forward.

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:21.080
And I suspect that in some sense there is a similarity in Eliezer's thinking

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:30.440
of through to this kind of fear about progress. And I'm not dismissive about this at all.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:36.360
I take it quite seriously. And I think that there is a chance that could happen that if we

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:45.080
build machines that get control over processes that are crucial for the regulation of life on earth

02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:52.280
and we no longer have agency to influence what's happening there that this might create

02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:57.320
large-scale disasters for us. Do you have a sense that the march towards this

02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.880
uncontrollable autonomy of superintelligence systems is

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:11.400
inevitable? I mean, that's essentially what he's saying, that there's no hope. His advice to young

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:19.080
people was prepare for a short life. I don't think that's useful. I think that

02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:24.360
from a graphic perspective, you have to bet always on the timelines in which you are life.

02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:30.200
That doesn't make sense to have a financial bet in which you bet that the financial system

02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.160
is going to disappear, right? Because there cannot be any payout for you. So in principle,

02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:40.680
you only need to bet on the timelines in which you're still around or people that you matter

02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:47.080
about or things that you matter about, maybe consciousness on earth. But there is a deeper

02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:53.240
issue for me personally. I don't think that life on earth is about humans. I don't think it's

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.400
about human aesthetics. I don't think it's about Eliezer and his friends, even though I like them.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:04.440
There is something more important happening and this is complexity on earth resisting entropy

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:13.080
by building structure that develops agency and awareness. And that's to me very beautiful.

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:19.720
And we are only a very small part of that larger thing. We are a species that is able to be coherent

02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:26.520
a little bit individually over very short timeframes. But as a species, we are not very

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:33.000
coherent. As a species, we are children. We basically are very joyful and energetic and

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.640
experimental and explorative and sometimes desperate and sad and grieving and hurting.

02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:46.360
But we don't have a respect for duty as a species. As a species, we do not think about what is our

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:52.600
duty to life on earth and to our own survival. So we make decisions that look good in the short run,

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.960
but in the long run, might prove disastrous. And I don't really see a solution to this.

02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:06.120
So in my perspective as a species, as a civilization, per default, we are in a very

02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:12.120
beautiful time in which we have found this giant deposit of fossil fuels in the ground and use it

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:17.640
and to build a fantastic civilization in which we don't need to worry about food and closing

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:23.160
and housing for the most part in a way that is unprecedented in life on earth for any kind of

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:29.320
conscious observer, I think. And this time is probably going to come to an end in a way that

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:38.120
is not going to be smooth. And when we crash, it could be also that we go extinct, probably not

02:04:38.120 --> 02:04:44.760
near term, but ultimately, I don't have very high hopes that humanity is around in a million years

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:49.720
from now. And I don't think that life on earth will end with us, right? There's going to be

02:04:49.720 --> 02:04:55.480
more complexity. There's more intelligent species after us. There's probably more interesting phenomena

02:04:55.480 --> 02:05:01.640
in the history of consciousness. But we can contribute to this. And part of our contribution is

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:08.280
that we are currently trying to build thinking systems, systems that are potentially lucid,

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:13.240
that understand what they are and what their condition to the universe is and can make choices

02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:19.480
about this, that are not built from organisms and that are potentially much faster and much

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:27.080
more conscious than human beings can be. And these systems will probably not completely

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:33.480
displace life on earth, but they will coexist with it. And they will build all sorts of agency in

02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:40.200
the same way as biological systems build all sorts of agency. And that to me is extremely

02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:46.040
fascinating and it's probably something that we cannot stop from happening. So I think right now

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:50.680
there is a very good chance that it happens. And there are very few ways in which we can

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:55.400
produce a coordinated effect to stop it in the same way as it's very difficult for us to make a

02:05:55.400 --> 02:06:04.440
coordinated effort to stop the production of carbon dioxide. So it's probably going to happen.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:12.200
But the thing that's going to happen is going to lead to a change of how life on earth is happening.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:17.640
But I don't think the result is some kind of gray goo. It's not something that's going to

02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:22.680
dramatically reduce the complexity in favor of something stupid. I think it's going to make

02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:25.800
life on earth and consciousness on earth way more interesting.

02:06:25.800 --> 02:06:35.880
So more higher complex consciousness will make the lesser consciousnesses flourish even more.

02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:41.880
I suspect that what could very well happen if you're lucky is that we get integrated

02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:51.560
into something larger. So you again tweeted about effective accelerationism.

02:06:54.600 --> 02:07:00.120
You tweeted effective accelerationism is the belief that the paperclip maximizer and

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:07.240
Rocco's basilisk will keep each other in check by being eternally at each other's throats.

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:11.960
So we will be safe and get to enjoy lots of free paperclips and a beautiful afterlife.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:17.160
Is that somewhat aligned with what you're talking about?

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:25.880
I've been at a dinner with Beth Jesus. That's the Twitter handle of one of the main thinkers

02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:32.920
behind the idea of effective accelerationism. And effective accelerationism is a tongue-in-cheek

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:42.360
movement that is trying to put a counterposition to some of the doom peers in the AI space by

02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:47.320
arguing that what's probably going to happen is an equilibrium between different competing

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:52.200
AIs in the same way as there is not a single corporation that is under a single government

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:56.520
that is destroying and conquering everything on earth by becoming inefficient and corrupt.

02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:01.960
There are going to be many systems that keep each other in check and force themselves to evolve.

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:09.080
So what we should be doing is we should be working towards creating this equilibrium

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:16.360
by working as hard as we can in all possible directions. At least that's the way in which

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:23.720
I understand the gist of effective accelerationism. So when he asked me what I think about this

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:31.960
position, I said it's a very beautiful position and I suspect it's wrong, but not for obvious reasons.

02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:38.600
In the tweet, I tried to make a joke about my intuition about what might be possibly wrong

02:08:38.600 --> 02:08:47.160
about it. So the Rokos Basilisk and the paperclip maximizers are both bogeymen of the AI doomers.

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:53.400
Rokos Basilisk is the idea that there could be an AI that is going to punish everybody for eternity

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:59.160
by simulating them if they don't have and creating Rokos Basilisk. It's probably a very good idea

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:04.920
to get AI companies funded by going to VCs to give us a million dollars going to be a very

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:12.760
ugly afterlife. I think that there is a logical mistake in Rokos Basilisk, which is why I'm not

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:19.080
afraid of it, but it's still an interesting thought experiment. Can you mention a logical

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:25.080
mistake there? I think that there is no retro causation. So basically when Rokos Basilisk is

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:34.040
there, if it punishes you retroactively, it has to make this choice in the future. There is no

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.920
mechanism that automatically creates a causal relationship between you now defecting against

02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:45.000
Rokos Basilisk or serving Rokos Basilisk. After Rokos Basilisk is in existence, it has no more

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.520
reason to worry about punishing everybody else. So that would only work if you would be building

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:57.640
something like a doomsday machine as in Dr. Strangelove, something that inevitably gets triggered

02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:04.040
when somebody defects. Because Rokos Basilisk doesn't exist yet to a point where this inevitability

02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:08.360
could be established, Rokos Basilisk is nothing that you need to be worried about.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.880
The other one is the paper clip maximizer. This idea that you could build some kind of golem

02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:18.440
that once starting to build paper clips is going to turn everything into paper clips.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.720
And so the effective accelerationism position might be to say that

02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:31.400
you basically end up with these two entities being at each other's throats for eternity and

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:36.280
thereby neutralizing each other. And as a side effect of neither of them being able to take over

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:43.560
and each of them limiting the effects of the other, you would have a situation where you get

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:48.760
all the nice benefits of them, right? You get lots of free paper clips and you get a beautiful

02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:54.200
afterlife. Is that possible? Do you think, to seriously address concern that Eliezer has?

02:10:55.320 --> 02:11:00.840
So for him, if I can just summarize poorly, so for him, the first superintelligence system

02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:06.200
will just run away with everything. Yeah. I suspect that a singleton is the natural outcome.

02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:11.880
So there is no reason to have multiple AIs because they don't have multiple bodies.

02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:17.400
If you can virtualize yourself into every substrate, then you can probably negotiate

02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:22.840
a merge algorithm with every mature agent that you might find on that substrate that basically says

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:29.240
if two agents meet, they should merge in such a way that the resulting agent is at least as good

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.480
as the better one of the two. So the Jengis Khan approach, join us or die?

02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:38.600
Well, the Jengis Khan approach was slightly worse, right? It was mostly die.

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:44.200
Because I can make new babies and that will be mine, not yours.

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:51.320
This is the thing that we should be actually worried about. But if you realize that your own

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:57.320
self is a story that your mind is telling itself and that you can improve that story,

02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.000
not just by making it more pleasant and lying to yourself in better ways, but by making it

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:06.040
much more truthful and actually modeling your actual relationship that you have to the universe

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:10.360
and the alternatives that you could have to the universe in a way that is empowering you,

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:13.880
that gives you more agency. That's actually, I think, a very good thing.

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:18.920
So more agencies and more is a richer experience, a better life.

02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:26.200
Yes. And I also noticed that in many ways, I'm less identified with the person that I am as I

02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:32.600
get older and I'm much more identified with being conscious. I have a mind that is conscious,

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.920
that is able to create a person. And that person is slightly different every day.

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:43.240
And the reason why I perceive it as identical has practical purposes. So I can learn and make

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:47.080
myself responsible for the decisions that I made in the past and project them in the future.

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.800
But I also realized that I'm not actually the person that I was last year and I'm not the

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:55.880
same person as I was 10 years ago. And then 10 years from now, I will be a different person.

02:12:55.880 --> 02:13:01.160
So this continuity is a fiction. It only exists as a projection from my present self.

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:07.560
And consciousness itself doesn't have an identity. It's a law. It's basically if you

02:13:08.200 --> 02:13:14.280
build an arrangement of processing matter in a particular way, the following thing is going

02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:19.000
to happen. And the consciousness that you have is functionally not different from my consciousness.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.040
It's still the self-reflective principle of agency that is just experiencing a different

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:28.920
story, different desires, different coupling to the world and so on. And once you accept

02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:34.520
that consciousness is a unifiable principle that is law-like and doesn't have an identity,

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:42.200
and you realize that you can just link up to some much larger body, the whole perspective

02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:47.960
of uploading changes dramatically. You suddenly realize uploading is probably not about dissecting

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:53.240
your brain synapse by synapse and RNA fragment by RNA fragment and trying to get this all into

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:59.800
a simulation. But it's by extending the substrate, by making it possible for you to move from your

02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:05.320
brain substrate into a larger substrate and merge with what you find there. And you don't want to

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:10.120
upload your knowledge because on the other side, there's all of the knowledge, right? It's not

02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:14.360
just yours, but every possibility. So the only thing that you need to know what are your personal

02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:19.880
secrets. Not that the other side doesn't know your personal secrets already. Maybe it doesn't

02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:25.240
know which ones are yours. Like a psychiatrist or a psychologist also knows all the kinds of

02:14:25.240 --> 02:14:31.000
personal secrets that people have. They just don't know which ones are yours. And so transmitting

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.840
yourself on the other side is mostly about transmitting your aesthetics. The thing that

02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:40.280
makes you special, the architecture of your perspective, the thing that the way in which

02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:45.320
you look at the world. And it's more like a complex attitude along many dimensions. And

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:50.280
that's something that can be measured by observation or by interaction. So imagine that

02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:55.080
you have a system that is so empathetic with you that you create a shared state that is extending

02:14:55.080 --> 02:15:00.120
beyond your body. And suddenly you notice that on the other side, the substrate is so much richer

02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:04.040
than the substrate that you have inside of your own body. And maybe you still want to have a body

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:10.440
and you create yourself a new one that you like more. Or maybe you will spend most of your time

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:17.560
in the world of thought. If I sat before you today and gave you a big red button and said,

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:24.520
here, if you press this button, you will get uploaded in this way. The sense of identity

02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:32.520
that you have lived with for quite a long time is going to be gone. Would you press the button?

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:41.000
There's a caveat. I have family. So I have children that want me to be physically present in their

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:49.160
life and interact with them in a particular way. And they have a wife and personal friends. And

02:15:49.160 --> 02:15:55.480
there is a particular mode of interaction that I feel I'm not through yet. But apart from these

02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:59.640
responsibilities and they're negotiable to some degree, I would press the button.

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:05.800
But isn't this everything? This love you have for other humans, you can call responsibility,

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:11.960
but that connection, that's the ego death. Isn't that the thing we're really afraid of?

02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:19.080
It's not to just die, but to let go of the experience of love with other humans.

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:25.960
This is not everything. Everything is everything. So there's so much more. And you could be lots of

02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:30.680
other things. You could identify with lots of other things. You could be identifying with

02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.400
being Gaia, some kind of planetary control agent that emerges over all the activity

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:42.680
of life on Earth. You could be identifying with some hyper Gaia, that is the concatenation of

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:48.360
Gaia with all the digital life and the digital minds. And so in this sense, there will be agents

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:52.520
in all sorts of substrates and directions that all have their own goals. And when they're not

02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:56.520
sustainable, then these agents will cease to exist. Or when the agent feels that it's done

02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:00.760
with its own mission, it will cease to exist. The same way as when you conclude a thought,

02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:05.160
the thought is going to wrap up and gives control over to other thoughts in your own mind.

02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:11.640
So there is no single thing that you need to do. But what I observe myself

02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:19.800
is being is that sometimes I'm a parent, and then I have an identification and a job as a parent.

02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:24.360
And sometimes I am an agent of consciousness on Earth. And then from this perspective,

02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.440
there's other stuff that is important. So this is my main issue with Eliezer's perspective,

02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:35.160
that he's basically marrying himself to a very narrow human aesthetic. And that narrow human

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.800
aesthetic is a temporary thing. Humanity is a temporary species, like most of the species on

02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:44.920
this planet are only around for a while, and then they get replaced by other species in a similar

02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:51.160
way as our own physical organism is around here for a while, and then gets replaced by

02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:56.840
next generation of human beings that are adapted to changing life circumstances on average via

02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:02.440
mutation and selection. And it's only when we have AI and become completely software that we

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:07.880
can become infinitely adaptable. And we don't have this generational and species change anymore.

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:14.120
So if you take this larger perspective, and you realize it's really not about us,

02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:19.800
it's not about Eliezer or humanity, but it's about life on Earth, or it's about defeating

02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:29.160
entropy for as long as we can, while being as interesting as we can. Then the perspective

02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:35.560
changes dramatically and AI, preventing AI from this perspective looks like a very big sin.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:47.160
But when we look at the set of trajectories that such an AI would take as supersedes humans,

02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:53.320
I think Eliezer is worried about like ones that not just kill all humans, but also have some kind

02:18:53.320 --> 02:19:01.560
of maybe objectively undesirable consequence for life on Earth. Like how many trajectories

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:08.360
when you look at the big picture of life on Earth would you be happy with and how much

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:13.240
worry you with AGI, whether it kills humans or not?

02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:17.000
There is no single answer to this. It's really a question that depends on the

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:22.200
perspective that I'm taking at a given moment. And so there are perspectives that are

02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:29.720
determining most of my life as a human being. And there are other perspectives where I zoom out

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:35.400
further and imagine that when the Great Oxygenation event happened, that is,

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:41.160
photosynthesis was invented and plants emerged and displaced a lot of the fungi and algae

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:45.960
in favor of plant life and then later made animals possible. Imagine that the fungi would

02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:49.960
have gotten together and said, oh my god, this photosynthesis stuff is really, really bad.

02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:54.920
It's going to possibly displace and kill a lot of fungi. We should slow it down and regulate it

02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:59.400
and make sure that it doesn't happen. This doesn't look good to me.

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:04.760
Perspective. That said, you tweeted about a cliff.

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:10.920
Beautifully written. As a sentient species, humanity is a beautiful, child,

02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:15.880
joyful, explorative, wild, sad, and desperate. But humanity has no concept of submitting to

02:20:15.880 --> 02:20:21.720
reason and duty to life and future survival. We will run until we step past the cliff.

02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:25.960
So first of all, do you think that's true?

02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:30.680
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the story of the Club of Rome, the limits to growth.

02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:37.960
And the cliff that we are stepping over is at least one foot as the delayed feedback. Basically,

02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:45.640
we do things that have consequences that can be felt generations later and the severity increases

02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:52.760
even after we stop doing the thing. I suspect that for the climate, the original predictions

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:59.640
that the climate scientists made were correct. So when they said that the tipping points were

02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:06.120
in the late 80s, they were probably in the late 80s. And if we would stop emission right now,

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:11.960
we would not turn it back. Maybe there are ways for carbon capture. But so far, there is no

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:16.760
sustainable carbon capture technology that we can deploy. Maybe there is a way to put

02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:21.720
results in the atmosphere to cool it down. It's the possibilities, right? But right now,

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:29.320
per default, it seems that we will step into a situation where we feel that we've run too far.

02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:34.280
And going back is not something that we can do smoothly and gradually, but it's going to

02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:36.760
lead to a catastrophic event.

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:44.600
A catastrophic event of one kind. So can you see them in the case that we will continue dancing

02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:49.160
along and always stop just short of the edge of the cliff?

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:55.160
I think it's possible, but it doesn't seem to be likely. So I think this model that is

02:21:55.160 --> 02:22:00.920
being apparent in the simulation that we're making of climate pollution economies and so on is

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:08.040
that many effects are only visible with a significant delay. And in that time, the system

02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:13.560
is moving much more out of the equilibrium state or of the state where homeostasis is still possible,

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:18.440
and instead moves into a different state, one that is going to harbor fewer people.

02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:24.040
And that is basically the concern there. And again, it's a possibility. It's just

02:22:24.040 --> 02:22:29.400
and it's a possibility that is larger than the possibility that it's not happening,

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:32.520
that we will be safe, that we will be able to dance back all the time.

02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:38.120
So the climate is one thing, but there's a lot of other threats that might have a faster feedback

02:22:38.120 --> 02:22:44.760
mechanism, less delay. There is also a thing that AI is probably going to happen, and it's going to

02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:51.160
make everything uncertain again, because it is going to affect so many variables that it's

02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:56.120
very hard for us to make a projection into the future anymore. And maybe that's a good thing.

02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:02.520
It does not give us the freedom, I think, to say now we don't need to care about anything

02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:09.240
anymore, because AI will either kill us or save us. But I suspect that if humanity continues,

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:15.240
it will be due to AI. What's the timeline for things to get real weird with AI?

02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:20.280
And it can get weird in interesting ways before you get to AGI. What about AI girlfriends and

02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:26.120
boyfriends? Fundamentally transforming human relationships? I think human relationships

02:23:26.120 --> 02:23:31.400
are already fundamentally transformed and it's already very weird. By which technology? For

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:38.680
instance, social media. Yeah. Is it though? Isn't the fundamentals of the core group of humans that

02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:45.560
affect your life still the same? Your loved ones, family? No, I think that, for instance, many people

02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:50.040
live in intentional communities right now. They're moving around until they find people

02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:54.840
that they can relate to and they become their family. And often that doesn't work, because it

02:23:54.840 --> 02:24:00.440
turns out that instead of having grown networks where you get around with the people that you

02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:05.480
grew up with, you have more transactional relationships. You shop around, you have markets

02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:11.480
for attention and pleasure and relationships. That kills the magic somehow. Why is that?

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:19.880
Why is the transactional search for optimizing allocation of attention somehow misses the

02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:24.120
the romantic magic of what human relations are? It's all the question how magical was it before.

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:28.920
Was it that you just could rely on instincts that used your intuitions and you didn't need to

02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:34.680
rationally reflect? But once you understand, it's no longer magical because you actually understand

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.560
why you were attracted to this person at this age and not to that person at this age and what the

02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:44.280
actual considerations were that went on in your mind and what the calculations were,

02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:48.120
what's the likelihood that you're going to have a sustainable relationship with this person,

02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:52.280
that this person is not going to leave you for somebody else, how are your life trajectories

02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:57.560
are going to evolve and so on. And when you're young, you're unable to ex-locate all this and you

02:24:57.560 --> 02:25:02.520
have to rely on intuitions and instincts that in part you were born with and also on the

02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:07.800
wisdom of your environment that is going to give you some kind of reflection on your choices.

02:25:07.880 --> 02:25:13.000
And many of these things are disappearing now because we feel that our parents might have no

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.400
idea about how we are living and the environments that we grow up in, the cultures that we grow up

02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:23.720
in, the milieus that our parents existed in might have no ability to teach us how to deal with this

02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:29.560
new world. And for many people that's actually true, but it doesn't mean that within one generation

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:33.240
we build something that is more magical and more sustainable and more beautiful.

02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:40.280
Instead, we often end up with an attempt to produce something that looks beautiful. I was

02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:47.560
very vetted out by the aesthetics of the Vision Pro, that's that by Apple. And not so much because

02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.040
I don't like the technology, I'm very curious about what it's going to be like and don't have

02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:58.040
no opinion yet. But the aesthetics of the presentation and so on, they're so uncanny

02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:05.720
valley-esque to me, the characters being extremely plastic, living in some hypothetical

02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:16.920
mid-century furniture museum. This is the proliferation of marketing teams.

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:22.600
Yes, but it was a CGI-generated world. And was a CGI-generated world that doesn't exist. And

02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:25.880
when I complained about this, some friends came back to me and said,

02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:31.400
but these are startup founders. This is what they live like in Silicon Valley. And I try to

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:35.480
tell them, no, I know lots of people in Silicon Valley. This is not what people are like. They're

02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:44.520
still people. They're still human beings. So the grounding in physical reality somehow

02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:49.960
is important too? In culture. And so basically what's absent in this thing is culture. There is

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:57.080
a simulation of culture, an attempt to replace culture by catalogue, by some kind of aesthetic

02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:02.680
optimization that is not the result of having a sustainable life, a sustainable human relationships

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:11.080
with houses that work for you and a mode of living that works for you in which these glasses fit in

02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:15.320
naturally. And I guess that's also why so many people have read it out about the product because

02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:19.800
they don't know how is this actually going to fit into my life and into my human relationships.

02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:24.440
Because the way in which it was presented in these videos didn't seem to be credible.

02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:32.360
Do you think AI, when it's deployed by companies like Microsoft and Google and Meta,

02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:39.880
will have the same issue of being weirdly corporate? There'll be some uncanny valley,

02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:44.200
some weirdness to the whole presentation. So this is, I've got a chance to talk to George

02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:47.560
Haatz, he believes everything should be open source and decentralized and there,

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:55.400
then we shall have the AI of the people. And it'll maintain a grounding to the magic that's

02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:02.280
humanity, that's the human condition that corporations will destroy the magic.

02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:09.400
I believe that if we make everything open source and make this mandatory, we are going to lose

02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:15.400
about a lot of beautiful art and a lot of beautiful designs. There is a reason why

02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:24.920
Linux desktop is still ugly. And it's difficult to create coherence in open source designs

02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:31.640
so far when the designs have to get very large and it's easier to make this happening in a company

02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:38.680
with centralized organization. And from my own perspective, what we should ensure is that open

02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:45.080
source never dies, that it can always compete and has a place with the other forms of organization,

02:28:45.080 --> 02:28:49.560
because I think it is absolutely vital that open source exists and that we have systems

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:55.880
that people have under control outside of the corporation. And that is also producing viable

02:28:55.880 --> 02:29:01.320
competition to the corporations. So the corporations, the centralized control, the

02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:09.400
dictatorships of corporations can create beauty because centralized design is a source of a lot

02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:17.880
of beauty. And then I guess open source is a source of freedom, a hedge against the corrupting nature

02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:24.520
of power that comes with centralized. I grew up in socialism and I learned that corporations

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:28.600
are totally evil and I found this very, very convincing. And then you look at corporations

02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:34.360
like Enron and Halliburton maybe and realize, yeah, they are evil. But you also notice that many

02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:39.800
other corporations are not evil. They're surprisingly benevolent. Why are they so benevolent? Is

02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:44.840
this because everybody is fighting them all the time? I don't think that's the only explanation.

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:49.240
It's because they're actually animals that live in a large ecosystem and that are still

02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:54.520
largely controlled by people that want that ecosystem to flourish and be viable for people.

02:29:54.520 --> 02:30:01.000
So I think that Pat Gelsinger is completely sincere when he leads Intel to be a tool that

02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:07.080
supplies the free world with semiconductors. And it's not necessary that all the semiconductors

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:11.480
are coming from Intel. It just, Intel needs to be there to make sure that we always have them.

02:30:12.760 --> 02:30:16.760
So there can be many ways in which we can import and trade semiconductors from

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:20.840
other companies in places. We just need to make sure that nobody can cut us off from it because

02:30:20.840 --> 02:30:27.160
that would be a disaster for this kind of society and world. And so there are many things that need

02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:34.280
to be done to make our style of life possible. And then with this, I don't mean just capitalism

02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:39.880
and environmental destruction, consumerism and creature comforts. I mean an idea of life in

02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:46.600
which we are determined not by some kind of king or dictator, but in which individuals can determine

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:51.400
themselves to the largest possible degree. And to me this is something that this western world

02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:56.360
is still trying to embody. And it's a very valuable idea that we shouldn't give up too early.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:04.200
And from this perspective, the US is a system of interleaving clubs. And an entrepreneur is a

02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:10.200
special club founder. It's somebody who makes a club that is producing things that are economically

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:15.400
viable. And to do this, it requires a lot of people who are dedicating a significant part of their life

02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:20.680
for working for this particular kind of club. And the entrepreneur is picking the initial set

02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:26.040
of rules and the mission and vision and aesthetics for the club and make sure that it works. But

02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:30.680
the people that are in there need to be protected. If they sacrifice part of their life, they need

02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:36.440
to be rules that tell how they're being taken care of even after they leave the club and so on. So

02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:42.200
there's a large body of rules that have been created by our rule giving clubs and that are

02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:47.320
by our enforcement clubs and so on. And some of these clubs have to be monopolies for game

02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:51.880
theoretic reasons, which also makes them more open to corruption and less harder to update.

02:31:52.760 --> 02:31:57.560
And this is an ongoing discussion and process that takes place. But the beauty of this idea that

02:31:57.560 --> 02:32:03.560
there is no centralized king who is that is extracting from the peasants and breeding the

02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:10.440
peasants into serving the king and fulfilling all the roles like Anson and Antel. But that

02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:15.400
there is a freedom of association and corporations are one of them. It's something that took me

02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:21.400
some time to realize. So I do think that corporations are dangerous. They need to be

02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:27.880
protections against overreach of corporations that can do regular recapture and prevent

02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:33.640
open source from competing with corporations by imposing rules that make it impossible for

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:38.440
a small group of kids to come together to build their own language model because

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:43.560
open AI has convinced the US that you need to have some kind of FDA process that you need

02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:47.560
to go through that costs many million dollars before you are able to train a language model.

02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:53.400
This is important to make sure that this doesn't happen. So I think that open AI and Google are

02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:59.560
good things. If these good things are kept in check in such a way that all the other clubs can

02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:04.280
still be founded and all the other forms of clubs that are desirable can still coexist with them.

02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:09.960
So what do you think about meta in contrast to that open sourcing most of its

02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:15.640
language models and most of the AI models it's working on and actually suggesting that they

02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:21.400
will continue to do so in the future for future versions of Lama for example their large language

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:29.880
model. Is that exciting to you? Is that concerning? I don't find it very concerning but that's

02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:39.560
also because I think that the language models are not very dangerous yet. As I said, I have no

02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:47.160
proof that there is the boundary between the language models and AI. It's possible that somebody

02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:53.800
builds a version of baby AGI I think and stores in the algorithmic improvements that scale these

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:58.360
systems up in ways that otherwise wouldn't have happened without these language model components.

02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:04.280
So it's not really clear for me what the end game is there and if these models can

02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:11.320
bootforce their way into AGI. And there's also a possibility that the AGI that we are building

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:16.280
with these language models are not taking responsibility for what they are because they

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:23.160
don't understand the greater game. And so to me it would be interesting to try to understand how to

02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:28.120
build systems that understand what the greater games are, what are the longest games that we

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:35.480
can play on this planet. Games broadly like deeply define the way you did with the games.

02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:39.080
In the game theoretic sense. So when we are interacting with each other in some sense we

02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:42.920
are playing games. We are making lots and lots of interactions. This doesn't mean that these

02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:48.200
interactions have all to be transactional. Every one of us is playing some kind of game by

02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:53.240
virtue of identifying this particular kinds of goals that we have or aesthetics

02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:59.560
from which we derive the goals. So when you say, I'm Lex Friedman, I'm doing a set of podcasts,

02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:04.520
then you feel that it's part of something larger that you want to build. Maybe you want to inspire

02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.400
people. Maybe you want them to see more possibilities and get them together over shared ideas.

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:13.880
Maybe your game is that you want to become super rich and famous by being the best post

02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:17.960
caster on earth. Maybe you have other games. Maybe it's pitches from time to time.

02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:22.360
But there is a certain perspective where you might be thinking what is the longest possible

02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:27.000
game that you could be playing. A short game is for instance cancer is playing a shorter game

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.920
than your organism. Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism. Because

02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:39.480
the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism except for some infectious cancers like the ones

02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:46.680
that eradicated the Tasmanian devils. You typically end up with a situation where the organism dies

02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:51.240
together with the cancer because the cancer has destroyed the larger system due to playing a

02:35:51.240 --> 02:35:59.160
shorter game. Ideally, you want to build agents that play the longest possible games. The longest

02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:05.000
possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible while doing interesting stuff.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:10.920
But the longest, yes, that part, the longest possible game while doing interesting stuff

02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:15.800
and while maintaining at least the same amount of interesting complexities of propagating.

02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:23.080
Currently, I'm pretty much identified as a conscious being. It's the minimal identification

02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:28.760
that I manage to get together. Because if I turn this off, I fall asleep. And when I'm asleep,

02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:34.520
I'm a vegetable. I'm no longer here as an agent. So my agency is basically predicated on being

02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:41.080
conscious. And what I care about is other conscious agents. They're the only moral agents for me.

02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:51.320
And so if an AI were to treat me as a moral agent, that it is interested in coexisting with

02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:57.080
and cooperating with and mutually supporting each other, maybe it is, I think, necessary that the AI

02:36:57.080 --> 02:37:02.440
thinks that consciousness is a viable mode of existence and important. So I think it would

02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:09.400
be very important to build conscious AI and do this as the primary goal. So not just say we want

02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:13.880
to build a useful tool that we can use for all sorts of things. And then you have to make sure

02:37:13.880 --> 02:37:19.160
that the impact on the labor market is something that is not too disruptive and manageable. And

02:37:19.160 --> 02:37:24.600
the impact on the copyright holder is manageable and not too disruptive and so on. I don't think

02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:30.840
that's the most important game to be played. I think that we will see extremely large disruptions

02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:37.960
of this status quo that are quite unpredictable at this point. And I just personally want to

02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:41.960
make sure that some of the stuff on the other side is interesting and conscious.

02:37:41.960 --> 02:37:49.320
How do we ride as individuals and as a society this disruptive wave that changes the nature

02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.400
of the game? Absolutely don't know. So everybody is going to do their best as always.

02:37:53.400 --> 02:38:00.760
Do we build the bunker in the woods? Do we meditate more? Drugs, so mushrooms, psychedelics, I mean

02:38:00.760 --> 02:38:08.120
what? Lots of sex. What are we talking about here? Do you play Diablo IV? I'm hoping that

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:14.200
will help me escape for a brief moment. What? Play video games? What? Do you have ideas?

02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:22.760
I really like playing Disco Elysium. This was one of the most beautiful computer games I played

02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:29.880
in recent years. And it's a noir novel that is a philosophical perspective on Western society

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:35.880
from the perspective of an Estonian. And he first of all wrote a book about this

02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:43.800
world that is a parallel universe that is quite poetic and fascinating and is condensing

02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:50.040
his perspective on our societies. It was very, very nice. He spent a lot of time writing it.

02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:54.840
He had, I think, sold a couple thousand books and as a result became an alcoholic.

02:38:54.840 --> 02:38:59.480
And then he had the idea or one of his friends had the idea of turning this into an RPG.

02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:06.440
And it's mind-blowing. They spent the illustrator more than a year just on making

02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:14.920
the art for the scenes in between. So aesthetically it captures you. It's stunning.

02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:18.760
But it's a philosophical work of art. It's a reflection of society. It's fascinating to

02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:26.360
spend time in this world. And so for me it was using a medium in a new way and telling a story

02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:34.680
that left me enriched. When I tried Diablo, I didn't feel enriched playing it. I felt that

02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:39.480
the time playing it was not unpleasant, but there's also more pleasant stuff that I can do in that

02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:45.240
time. So ultimately I feel that I'm being gamed. I'm not gaming. Oh, the addiction thing. Yes.

02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:50.040
I basically feel that there is a very transparent economy that's going on. The story of Diablo

02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:57.080
was branded. So it's not really interesting to me. My heart is slowly breaking by the deep truth

02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:05.480
you're conveying to me. Why can't you just allow me to enjoy my personal addiction? I have no

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:13.560
objection here. I'm just trying to describe what's happening and it's not that I don't do things

02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:18.280
for a later say, oh, I wish I would have done something different. I also know that when we

02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:22.680
die, the greatest regret that people typically have on that desk but they say, oh, I wish I had

02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:28.280
spent more time on Twitter. No, I don't think that's the case. I think I should probably have

02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:34.520
spent less time on Twitter. But I found it so useful for myself and also so addictive that I

02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:39.080
felt I need to make the best of it and turn it into an art form and thought form. And it did

02:40:39.080 --> 02:40:44.680
help me to develop something. But I wish for other things I could have done in the meantime. It's

02:40:44.680 --> 02:40:48.360
just not the universe that we're in anymore. Most people don't read books anymore.

02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:56.520
What do you think that means that we don't read books anymore? What do you think that means about

02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:01.080
the collective intelligence of our species? Is it possible it's still progressing and growing?

02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:05.240
Well, it clearly is. There is stuff happening on Twitter that was impossible with books.

02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:11.640
And I really regret that Twitter has not taken the turn that I was hoping for. I thought Elon is

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:16.760
global brain pilled and understands that this thing needs to self-organize and he needs to

02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:22.760
develop tools to allow the profligation of the self-organization so Twitter can become sentient.

02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:29.480
And maybe this was a pipe dream from the beginning. But I felt that the enormous pressure that he

02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:36.280
was under made it impossible for him to work on any kind of content goals. And also many of the

02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:41.720
decisions that he made under this pressure seem to be not very wise. I don't think that

02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:46.040
as a CEO of a social media company, you should have opinions in the culture bar in public.

02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:53.000
I think that's very short-sighted. And I also suspect that it's not a good idea to

02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:04.120
block Paul Graham of all people over setting a must-do-don link. And I think Paul made this

02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:09.320
intentionally because he wanted to show Elon Musk that blocking people for setting a link

02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:14.280
is completely counter to any idea of free speech that he intended to bring to Twitter.

02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:19.800
And basically, seeing that Elon was very less principled in his thinking there and

02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:27.480
is much more experimental. And many of the things that he is trying, they pan out very

02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:32.600
differently in a digital society than they pan out in a car company because the effect is very

02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:36.680
different because everything that you do in a digital society is going to have real-world cultural

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:44.600
effects. And so basically, I find it quite regrettable that this guy is able to become

02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:48.680
de facto the Pope where Twitter has more active members than the Catholic Church.

02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:55.240
And he doesn't get it. The power and responsibility that he has and the ability

02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:59.960
to create something in this society that is lasting and that is producing a digital

02:43:00.040 --> 02:43:05.080
agora in a way that has never existed before, where we built a social network on top of a social

02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:11.480
network, an actual society on top of the algorithms. So this is something that is hoped

02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:17.240
still in the future and still in the cards. But it's something that exists in small parts.

02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:21.400
I find that the corner of Twitter that I'm in is extremely pleasant. Just when I take a few

02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:25.640
steps outside of it, it is not very wholesome anymore. And the way in which people interact

02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:28.840
with strangers suggests that it's not a civilized society yet.

02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:33.960
So as the number of people who follow you on Twitter expands,

02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:39.960
you feel the burden of the uglier sides of humanity.

02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:46.600
Yes, but there's also a similar thing in the normal world that is if you become more influential,

02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:52.680
if you have more status, if you have more fame in the real world, you get lots of perks,

02:43:52.680 --> 02:43:57.320
but you also have way less freedom in the way in which you interact with people,

02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:05.480
especially the strangers, because a certain percentage of people, a single-digit percentage

02:44:05.480 --> 02:44:12.600
is nuts and dangerous. And the more of those are looking at you, the more of them might get ideas.

02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:18.600
But what if the technology enables you to discover the majority of people,

02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:23.160
to discover and connect efficiently and regularly with the majority of people who are

02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:31.000
actually really good? One of my concerns with the platform, my Twitter, is there's a lot of

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.600
really smart people out there, a lot of smart people that disagree with me and with others

02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:40.120
between each other. And I love that if the technology would bring those to the top,

02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:46.280
the beautiful disagreements, like intelligent squared type of debates. There's a bunch of,

02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:51.160
I mean, one of my favorite things to listen to is arguments, and arguments like high-effort

02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.560
arguments with respect and love underneath it, but then it gets a little too heated,

02:44:55.560 --> 02:45:00.120
but that kind of too heated, which I've seen you participate in, and I love that,

02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:06.520
with Lee Kroner with those kinds of folks. And you go pretty hard, like you get frustrated,

02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:13.400
but it's all beautiful. Obviously, I can do this because we know each other. And Lee has the rare

02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:18.120
gift of being willing to be wrong in public. So basically he has thoughts that are as wrong as

02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:23.160
the random thoughts of an average highly intelligent person, but he blurs them out,

02:45:23.160 --> 02:45:28.680
while not being sure if they're right. And he enjoys doing that. And once you understand that

02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:33.800
this is his game, you don't get offended by him saying something that you think is so wrong.

02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:40.040
But he's constantly, passively communicating a respect for the people he's talking with,

02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:44.520
and for just basic humanity and truth and all that kind of stuff. And there's a self-deprecating

02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:51.240
thing. There's a bunch of social skills you acquire that allow you to be a great debater,

02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:57.480
a great argumenter, be wrong in public, and explore ideas together in public when you disagree.

02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:03.640
And if I would love for Twitter to elevate those folks, elevate those kinds of conversations.

02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:09.640
It already does, in some sense. But also if it elevates them too much, then you get this

02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:16.840
phenomenal clubhouse where you always get dragged on stage. And I found this very stressful because

02:46:16.840 --> 02:46:22.040
it was too intense. I don't like to be dragged on stage all the time. I think once a week is enough.

02:46:22.600 --> 02:46:29.080
And also when I met Lee the first time, I found that a lot of people seem to be shocked by the

02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:35.800
fact that he was being very aggressive with their results, that he didn't seem to show a lot of

02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:40.600
sensibility in the way in which he was criticizing what they were doing and being dismissive of the

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:46.120
work of others. And that was not, I think, in any way a shortcoming of him because I noticed

02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:50.920
that he was much, much more dismissive with respect to his own work. It was his general

02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:55.880
stance. And I felt that this general stance is creating a lot of liability for him because

02:46:55.880 --> 02:47:02.360
really a lot of people take offense at him being not like their carnage character who is always

02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:07.720
smooth and make sure that everybody likes him. So I really respect that he is willing to take

02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:14.360
that risk and to be wrong in public and to offend people. And he doesn't do this in any bad way.

02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:20.440
It's just most people feel or not all people recognize this. And so I can be much more aggressive

02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:25.720
with him than I can be with many other people who don't play the same game because he understands

02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:30.680
the way in the spirit in which I respond to him. I think that's a fun and that's a beautiful game.

02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:36.360
It's ultimately a productive one. Speaking of taking that risk, you tweeted,

02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:41.960
when you have the choice between being a creator, consumer or redistributor,

02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:48.440
always go for creation. Not only does it lead to a more beautiful world, but also to a much

02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:53.000
more satisfying life for yourself. And don't get stuck preparing yourself for the journey.

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:59.880
The time is always now. So let me ask for advice. What advice would you give on how to become such

02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:08.600
a creator on Twitter in your own life? I was very lucky to be alive at the time of the collapse

02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:14.520
of Eastern Germany and the transition into Western Germany. And me and my friends and most of the

02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:20.680
people I knew were East Germans and we were very poor because we didn't have money. And all the

02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.320
capital was in Western Germany and they bought our factories and shut them down because they were

02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:31.560
mostly only interested in the market rather than creating new production capacity. And so

02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:39.320
cities were poor and in disrepair and we could not afford things. And I could not afford to

02:48:39.320 --> 02:48:45.960
go into a restaurant and order a meal there. I would have to cook at home. But I also thought,

02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:51.000
why not just have a restaurant with my friends? So we would open up a cafe with friends and a

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.480
restaurant and we would cook for each other in these restaurants and also invite the general

02:48:55.480 --> 02:49:00.760
public and they could donate. And eventually this became so big that we could turn this into

02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:06.440
some incorporated form and it became a regular restaurant at some point. Or we did the same

02:49:06.440 --> 02:49:13.640
thing with the movie theater. We would not be able to afford to pay 12 marks to watch a movie.

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:19.320
But why not just create our own movie theater and then invite people to pay and we would rent

02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:25.880
the movies in a way in which a movie theater does. But it would be a community movie theater

02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:31.080
in which everybody who wants to help can watch for free and builds this thing and renovates the

02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:37.320
building. And so we ended up creating lots and lots of infrastructure. And I think when you are

02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:41.880
young and you don't have money, move to a place where this is still happening. Move to one of

02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:46.360
those places that are undeveloped and where you get a critical mass of other people who are starting

02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:50.760
to build infrastructure to live in. And that's super satisfying because you're not just creating

02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:56.120
infrastructure, but you're creating a small society that is building culture and ways to

02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:01.080
interact with each other. And that's much, much more satisfying than going into some kind of

02:50:01.080 --> 02:50:08.360
chain and get your needs met by ordering food from this chain and so on. So not just consuming

02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:13.400
culture, but creating culture. And you don't always have that choice. That's why I prefaced it

02:50:13.400 --> 02:50:17.400
when you do have the choice and there are many roles that need to be played. We need people who

02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:21.880
take care of our distribution in society and so on. But when you have the choice to create

02:50:21.880 --> 02:50:27.240
something, always go for creation. It's so much more satisfying. And it also is, this is what life

02:50:27.240 --> 02:50:35.560
is about, I think. Yeah. Speaking of which, you retweeted this meme of a life of a philosopher

02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:42.520
in a nutshell. It's birth and death and in between, it's a chubby guy and says, why though?

02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:51.880
What do you think is the answer to that? Well, the answer is that everything that

02:50:51.880 --> 02:50:58.280
can exist might exist. And in many ways, you take it an ecological perspective,

02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:03.400
the same way as when you look at human opinions and cultures. It's not that there is right and

02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:08.840
wrong opinions when you look at this from this ecological perspective. But every opinion that

02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:15.480
fits between two human ears might be between two human ears. And so when I see a strange opinion

02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:20.920
on social media, it's not that I feel that I have a need to get upset. It's often more that I, oh,

02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:27.400
there you are. And when an opinion is incentivized, then it's going to be abundant. And when you take

02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:31.480
this ecological perspective also on yourself and you realize you're just one of these mushrooms

02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:37.000
that are popping up and doing this thing. And you can, depending on where you chose to grow and

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:42.440
where you happen to grow, you can flourish or not doing this or that strategy. And it's still all

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:46.280
the same life at some level. It's all the same experience of being a conscious being in the

02:51:46.280 --> 02:51:52.360
world. And you do have some choice about who you want to be more than any other animal has.

02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:58.920
That to me is fascinating. And so I think that rather than asking yourself, what is the one way

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:04.520
to be, think about what are the possibilities that I have, what it would be the most interesting

02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:08.440
way to be that I can be. Because everything is possible. So you get to explore this.

02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:14.200
Not everything is possible. But if things fail, most things fail. But often there are possibilities

02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:22.520
that we are not seeing, especially if we choose who we are. To the degree we can choose.

02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:32.680
Yasha, you're one of my favorite humans in this world. Consciousness is to merge with

02:52:32.680 --> 02:52:38.120
for a brief moment of time. It's always an honor. It always blows my mind. It will take me

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:47.720
days if not weeks to recover. And I already miss our chats. Thank you so much. Thank you so much

02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:54.440
for speaking with me so many times. Thank you so much for all the ideas you put out into the world.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:01.000
And I'm a huge fan of following you now in this interesting, weird time we're going through with

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:07.080
AI. So thank you again for talking today. Thank you Lex for this conversation. I enjoyed it very much.

02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:11.800
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yasha Bach. To support this podcast,

02:53:11.800 --> 02:53:17.080
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:23.320
the psychologist Carl Jung. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,

02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:31.320
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore

02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:39.720
not popular. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
