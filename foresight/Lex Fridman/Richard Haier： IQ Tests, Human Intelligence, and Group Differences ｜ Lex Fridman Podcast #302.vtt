00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
Let me ask you to this question.

00:02.200 --> 00:06.160
Well, there's bell curve or any research on race differences.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.080
Can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world?

00:13.520 --> 00:16.520
Can that be used to increase the amount of hate in the world?

00:16.920 --> 00:26.200
My sense is there is such enormous reservoirs of hate and racism

00:26.840 --> 00:30.600
that have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data

00:31.480 --> 00:37.960
that speak against that, that no, I don't I don't want to give

00:37.960 --> 00:41.840
racist groups of veto power over what scientists study.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.800
The following is a conversation with Richard Hire on the science of human intelligence.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.920
This is a highly controversial topic, but a critically important one

00:52.920 --> 00:54.920
for understanding the human mind.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.640
I hope you will join me in not shying away from difficult topics like this.

00:59.960 --> 01:05.720
And instead, let us try to navigate it with empathy, rigor and grace.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.120
If you're watching this on video now, I should mention that I'm recording

01:10.120 --> 01:14.160
this introduction in an undisclosed location somewhere in the world.

01:14.560 --> 01:17.160
I'm safe and happy and life is beautiful.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.080
This is Alex Friedman podcast to support it.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.320
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:23.560 --> 01:26.680
And now, dear friends, here's Richard Hire.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.760
What are the measures of human intelligence and how do we measure it?

01:31.560 --> 01:35.000
Everybody has an idea of what they mean by intelligence.

01:35.800 --> 01:41.320
In the vernacular, what I mean by intelligence is just being smart.

01:41.320 --> 01:44.520
How well you reason, how well you figure things out,

01:45.080 --> 01:47.640
what you do when you don't know what to do.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.880
Those are just kind of everyday common sense definitions

01:53.880 --> 01:56.520
of how people use the word intelligence.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.920
If you want to do research on intelligence,

01:59.640 --> 02:04.680
measuring something that you can study scientifically is a little trickier.

02:05.880 --> 02:10.920
And what almost all researchers who study intelligence use

02:11.640 --> 02:16.360
is the concept called the G factor, general intelligence.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.480
And that is what is common.

02:19.480 --> 02:26.360
That is a mental ability that is common to virtually all tests of mental abilities.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.680
What's the origin of the term G factor, by the way?

02:28.680 --> 02:32.040
It's such a funny word for such a fundamental human thing.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.320
The general factor, I really started with Charles Spearman.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.520
And he noticed, this is like more than 100 years ago,

02:41.480 --> 02:46.680
he'd noticed that when you tested people with different tests,

02:47.720 --> 02:51.640
all the tests were correlated positively.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.680
And so he was looking at student exams and things.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.760
And he invented the correlation coefficient, essentially.

03:01.560 --> 03:07.960
And when he used it to look at student performance on various topics,

03:08.040 --> 03:11.880
he found all the scores were correlated with each other,

03:11.880 --> 03:14.360
and they were all positive correlations.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.240
So he inferred from this that there must be some common factor

03:19.240 --> 03:23.240
that was irrespective of the content of the test.

03:23.240 --> 03:28.280
And positive correlation means if you do well on the first test,

03:28.280 --> 03:30.840
you're likely to do well on the second test.

03:30.840 --> 03:35.800
And presumably that holds for tests across even disciplines,

03:35.800 --> 03:39.240
so not within subject, but across subjects.

03:39.240 --> 03:44.840
So that's where the general comes in, something about general intelligence.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.840
So when you were talking about measuring intelligence

03:46.840 --> 03:50.840
and trying to figure out something difficult about this world

03:50.840 --> 03:54.680
and how to solve the puzzles of this world, that means generally speaking,

03:54.680 --> 03:58.120
not some specific test, but across all tests.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.240
Absolutely right.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.240
And people get hung up on this because they say,

04:03.320 --> 04:08.840
well, what about the ability to do X isn't that independent?

04:08.840 --> 04:11.880
And they said, I know somebody who's very good at this,

04:11.880 --> 04:14.680
but not so good at this, this other thing.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.880
And so there are a lot of examples like that, but it's a general tendency.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.920
So exceptions really don't disprove.

04:24.120 --> 04:30.600
Your everyday experience is not the same as what the data actually show.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.440
And your everyday experience, when you say, oh, I know someone who's good at X,

04:34.440 --> 04:39.160
but not so good at Y, that doesn't contradict the statement of about it.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.680
He's not so good, but he's not the opposite.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.720
He's not, it's not a negative correlation.

04:46.440 --> 04:54.760
Okay, so we're not, our anecdotal data, I know a guy is really good at solving some kind of visual

04:54.760 --> 05:01.320
thing that's not sufficient for us to understand actually the depths of that person's intelligence.

05:01.320 --> 05:10.280
So how this idea of G factor, how much evidence is there, how strong,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.680
you know, given across the decades that this idea has been around,

05:14.680 --> 05:22.360
how much has it been held up that there is a universal sort of horsepower of intelligence

05:22.440 --> 05:27.080
that's underneath all of it, all the different tests we do to try to get to this thing

05:28.760 --> 05:30.280
in the depths of the human mind.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.120
That's a universal stable measure of a person's intelligence.

05:34.760 --> 05:37.480
You used a couple of words in there, stable.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.520
We have to be precise with words.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.680
I was hoping we can get away with being poetic.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.480
We can.

05:43.480 --> 05:48.760
There's a lot about research in general, not just intelligence research that is poetic.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.720
Science has a kinetic aspect to it and good scientists are very intuitive.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.160
They're not just, hey, hey, these are the numbers.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.040
You have to kind of step back and see the big picture.

06:02.040 --> 06:09.320
When it comes to intelligence research, you asked how well has this general concept held up?

06:09.880 --> 06:15.480
And I think I can say, without fear of being empirically contradicted,

06:16.120 --> 06:20.280
that it is the most replicated finding in all of psychology.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.920
Now, some cynics may say, well, big deal, psychology, we all know there's a replication

06:24.920 --> 06:28.360
crisis in psychology and a lot of this stuff doesn't replicate.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.560
That's all true.

06:29.560 --> 06:36.600
There is no replication crisis when it comes to studying the existence of this general factor.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.360
Let me tell you some things about it.

06:39.560 --> 06:44.040
It looks like it's universal that you find it in all cultures.

06:44.600 --> 06:51.000
The way you find it, step back one step, the way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.720
What battery you choose?

06:53.720 --> 07:00.280
Take a battery of any mental test you want, give it to a large number of diverse people,

07:01.480 --> 07:08.920
and you will be able to extract statistically the commonality among all those tests.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.480
It's done by a technique called factor analysis.

07:12.440 --> 07:18.280
People think that this may be a statistical artifact of some kind.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.600
It is not a statistical artifact.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.600
What is factor analysis?

07:22.600 --> 07:27.960
Factor analysis is a way of looking at a big set of data and look at the correlation among

07:27.960 --> 07:34.680
the different test scores and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.240
And there are different factors.

07:37.240 --> 07:41.000
So if you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.240
There may be a numerical factor.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.800
There may be a visual spatial factor.

07:45.800 --> 07:51.640
But those factors have variants in common with each other and that is the common.

07:53.080 --> 07:58.040
That's what's common among all the tests and that's what gets labeled the G factor.

07:58.040 --> 08:04.680
So if you give a diverse battery of mental tests and you extract a G factor from it,

08:04.680 --> 08:08.200
that factor usually accounts for around half of the variants.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.120
It's the single biggest factor, but it's not the only factor.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.000
But it is the most reliable.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.360
It is the most stable.

08:17.160 --> 08:23.720
And it seems to be very much influenced by genetics.

08:23.720 --> 08:32.840
It's very hard to change the G factor with training or drugs or anything else.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.920
You don't know how to increase the G factor.

08:34.920 --> 08:36.920
Okay. You said a lot of really interesting things there.

08:36.920 --> 08:43.240
So first, I mean, just to get people used to it in case they're not familiar with this idea.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.800
G factor is what we mean.

08:45.800 --> 08:53.960
So often there's this term used IQ, which is the way IQ is used.

08:53.960 --> 08:57.240
They really mean G factor in regular conversation.

08:58.360 --> 09:02.600
The way, because what we mean by IQ, we mean intelligence.

09:02.600 --> 09:07.240
And what we mean by intelligence, we mean general intelligence and general intelligence

09:07.240 --> 09:12.280
in the human mind from a psychology, from a serious rigorous scientific perspective

09:12.280 --> 09:13.800
actually means G factor.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.440
So G factor equals intelligence just in this conversation to define terms.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.200
Okay. So there's this stable thing called G factor.

09:22.200 --> 09:32.840
You said, now, factor, you said factor many times means a measure that's potentially could

09:32.840 --> 09:36.280
be reduced to a single number across the different factors you mentioned.

09:37.160 --> 09:46.600
And what you said it accounts for half, half-ish, accounts for half-ish of what?

09:47.560 --> 09:52.760
Of variance across the different set of tests.

09:53.640 --> 10:00.840
So if you do for some reason well on some set of tests, what does that mean?

10:00.840 --> 10:05.800
So that means there's some unique capabilities outside of the G factor that might account for that.

10:05.800 --> 10:06.680
And what are those?

10:07.320 --> 10:13.400
What else is there besides the raw horsepower of the engine inside your mind that generates intelligence?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.240
There are test-taking skills.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.720
There are specific abilities.

10:20.840 --> 10:30.120
Someone might be particularly good at mathematical things, mathematical concepts,

10:30.120 --> 10:32.040
even simple arithmetic people.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.200
Some people are much better than others.

10:34.200 --> 10:41.240
You might know people who can memorize and short-term memory is another component of this.

10:42.200 --> 10:49.960
A short-term memory is one of the cognitive processes that's most highly correlated with the G factor.

10:53.800 --> 11:01.000
So all those things like memory, test-taking skills account for variability across the test

11:01.000 --> 11:01.720
performances.

11:03.560 --> 11:08.440
You can run, but you can't hide from the thing that God gave you.

11:08.520 --> 11:15.080
The genetics, so that G factor, science says that G factor is there.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.240
Each one of us has a G factor.

11:19.240 --> 11:19.880
Oh boy.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.240
Some have more than others.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.760
I'm getting uncomfortable already.

11:22.760 --> 11:32.280
Well IQ is a score, and an IQ score is a very good estimate of the G factor.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.280
You can't measure G directly.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.960
There's no direct measure.

11:36.040 --> 11:39.080
You estimate it from these statistical techniques.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.200
But an IQ score is a good estimate.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.000
Why?

11:43.000 --> 11:48.600
Because a standard IQ test is a battery of different mental abilities.

11:48.600 --> 11:55.640
You combine it into one score, and that score is highly correlated with the G factor,

11:55.640 --> 12:00.040
even if you get better scores on some subtests than others.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.200
Because again, it's what's common to all these mental abilities.

12:04.200 --> 12:11.720
So a good IQ test, and I'll ask you about that, but a good IQ test tries to compress down

12:12.600 --> 12:13.720
that battery of tests.

12:13.720 --> 12:20.520
Like tries to get a nice selection of variable tests into one test.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.120
And so in that way, it sneaks up to the G factor.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.080
And that's another interesting thing about G factor.

12:28.040 --> 12:34.040
Now you give, first of all, you have a great book on the neuroscience of intelligence.

12:34.040 --> 12:39.000
You have a great course, which is when I first learned, you're a great teacher.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.720
Let me just say.

12:39.720 --> 12:39.880
Thank you.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.720
Your course at the teaching company, I hope I'm saying that correctly.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.000
The intelligent brain.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.040
The intelligent brain is when I first heard about this G factor.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.680
This mysterious thing that lurks in the darkness that we cannot quite shine a light on.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.960
We're trying to sneak up on.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.480
So the fact that there's this measure, stable measure of intelligence, we can't measure directly.

13:05.160 --> 13:10.520
But we can come up with a battery test or one test that includes a battery of

13:12.440 --> 13:21.560
variable type of questions that can reliably or attempt to estimate in a stable way that G factor.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.160
That's a fascinating idea.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.720
So for me as an AI person, it's fascinating.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.160
It's fascinating that there's something stable like that about the human mind,

13:29.160 --> 13:31.240
especially if it's grounded in genetics.

13:31.960 --> 13:43.160
It's both fascinating that as a researcher of the human mind and all the human psychological,

13:43.160 --> 13:48.120
sociological, ethical questions that started rising, it makes me uncomfortable.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.800
But truth can be uncomfortable.

13:50.760 --> 13:55.480
You know, I get that a lot about being uncomfortable talking about this.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.480
Let me go back and just say one more empirical thing.

14:01.960 --> 14:07.400
It doesn't matter which battery of tests you use.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.600
So there are countless tests.

14:10.600 --> 14:18.040
You can take any 12 of them at random, extract a G factor and another 12 at random and extract a G

14:18.040 --> 14:23.080
factor and those G factors will be highly correlated like over 0.9 with each other.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.040
So it is a ubiquitous.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.480
It doesn't depend on the content of the test is what I'm trying to say.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.040
It is general among all those tests of mental ability.

14:34.040 --> 14:40.280
And tests of mental abilities include things like G's plain poker.

14:41.400 --> 14:45.560
Your skill at poker is not unrelated to G.

14:46.200 --> 14:53.480
Your skill at anything that requires reasoning and thinking, anything from spelling, arithmetic,

14:54.280 --> 14:55.720
more complex things.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.440
This concept is ubiquitous.

15:00.440 --> 15:04.840
And when you do batteries of tests in different cultures, you get the same thing.

15:05.720 --> 15:10.440
So this says something interesting about the human mind that as a computer is designed to be

15:11.000 --> 15:11.560
general.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.240
So it's not easily made specialized.

15:20.360 --> 15:27.560
Meaning if you're going to be good at one thing, Miyamoto Masashi has this quote.

15:27.560 --> 15:32.840
He's an ancient warrior famous for the book of five rings in the martial arts world.

15:33.400 --> 15:38.120
And the quote goes, if you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.

15:38.840 --> 15:46.200
Meaning if you do one thing is going to generalize to everything.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.240
And that's an interesting thing about the human mind.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.560
So that's what the G factor reveals.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.240
Okay.

15:55.240 --> 16:00.840
So what's the difference if you can elaborate a little bit further between IQ and G factor?

16:00.840 --> 16:03.480
Just because it's a source of confusion for people.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.640
And IQ is a score.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.200
People use the word IQ to mean intelligence.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.760
But IQ has a more technical meaning for people who work in the field.

16:12.760 --> 16:18.680
And it's an IQ score, a score on a test that estimates the G factor.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.120
And the G factor is what's common among all these tests of mental ability.

16:24.120 --> 16:30.520
So if you think about, it's not a Venn diagram, but I guess you could make a Venn diagram out of it.

16:30.520 --> 16:36.920
But the G factor would be really at the core, what's common to everything.

16:37.480 --> 16:43.800
And what IQ scores do is they allow a rank order of people on the score.

16:44.440 --> 16:46.840
And this is what makes people uncomfortable.

16:46.840 --> 16:51.480
This is where there's a lot of controversy about whether IQ tests are biased

16:51.480 --> 16:53.720
toward any one group or another.

16:54.360 --> 16:59.000
And a lot of the answers to these questions are very clear,

16:59.000 --> 17:04.120
but they also have a technical aspect of it that's not so easy to explain.

17:04.120 --> 17:08.040
Well, we'll talk about the fascinating and the difficult things about all of this.

17:08.040 --> 17:13.720
But so by the way, when you say rank order, that means you get a number.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.840
And that means one person you can now compare.

17:17.560 --> 17:22.120
Like you could say that this other person is more intelligent than me.

17:22.920 --> 17:27.960
Well, what you can say is IQ scores are interpreted really as percentiles.

17:29.240 --> 17:34.920
So that if you have an IQ of 140 and somebody else has 70,

17:35.480 --> 17:41.640
the metric is such that you cannot say the person with an IQ of 140 is twice as smart

17:42.840 --> 17:45.080
as a person with an IQ of 70.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.800
That would require a ratio scale with an absolute zero.

17:49.800 --> 17:53.000
Now, you may think you know people with zero intelligence,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.880
but in fact, there is no absolute zero on an IQ scale.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.720
It's relative to other people.

18:01.080 --> 18:07.320
So relative to other people, somebody with an IQ score of 140 is in the upper

18:07.320 --> 18:08.600
less than 1 percent.

18:09.320 --> 18:15.400
Whereas somebody with an IQ of 70 is two standard deviations below the mean.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.520
That's a different percentile.

18:18.520 --> 18:25.880
So it's similar to like in chess, you have an ELO rating that's designed to rank order people.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.080
So you can't say it's twice.

18:29.640 --> 18:35.240
One person, if your ELO rating is twice another person, I don't think you're twice as good at chess.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.840
It's not stable in that way, but because it's very difficult to do these kinds of comparisons.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.560
But so what can we say about the number itself?

18:46.840 --> 18:49.800
Is that stable across tests and so on and so on?

18:50.520 --> 18:53.880
There are a number of statistical properties of any test.

18:53.880 --> 18:56.360
They're called psychometric properties.

18:56.360 --> 19:00.040
You have validity, you have reliability, reliability.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.680
There are many different kinds of reliability.

19:02.680 --> 19:09.720
They all essentially measure stability and IQ tests are stable within an individual.

19:09.720 --> 19:15.800
There are some longitudinal studies where children were measured at age 11.

19:15.800 --> 19:22.040
And again, when they were 70 years old and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.080
This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.

19:26.280 --> 19:33.320
In the 1930s, some researchers decided to get an IQ test on every single child,

19:33.320 --> 19:36.840
age 11 in the whole country, and they did.

19:37.640 --> 19:45.560
And those records were discovered in an old store room at the University of Edinburgh.

19:46.360 --> 19:51.720
By a friend of mine, Ian Deary, who found the records, digitized them,

19:52.360 --> 19:58.760
and has done a lot of research on the people who are still alive today from that original study,

19:58.760 --> 20:01.080
including brain imaging research, by the way.

20:01.080 --> 20:06.120
Really, it's a fascinating group of people who are studied.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.480
Not to get ahead of the story, but one of the most interesting things they found

20:12.440 --> 20:19.560
is a very strong relationship between IQ measured at age 11 and mortality,

20:21.720 --> 20:30.840
so that 70 years later, they looked at the survival rates,

20:30.840 --> 20:33.160
and they could get death records from everybody.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.440
And Scotland has universal health care for everybody.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.080
And it turned out, if you divide the people by their age 11 IQ score into quartiles,

20:43.880 --> 20:48.360
and then look at how many people are alive 70 years later,

20:51.160 --> 20:53.720
I know this is in the book, I have the graph in the book,

20:54.600 --> 20:59.640
but there are essentially twice as many people alive in the highest IQ quartile

20:59.640 --> 21:03.320
than in the lowest IQ quartile, true in men and women.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.880
Interesting.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.040
So it makes a big difference.

21:08.040 --> 21:15.000
Now, why this is the case is not so clear since everyone had access to health care.

21:15.480 --> 21:21.080
Well, there's a lot, and we'll talk about it, just the sentences you used now

21:22.040 --> 21:25.720
could be explained by nature or nurture.

21:25.720 --> 21:26.920
We don't know.

21:26.920 --> 21:31.560
Now, there's a lot of science that starts to then dig in and investigate that question.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.720
But let me linger on the IQ test.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.320
How are the test design, IQ test design, how do they work?

21:37.320 --> 21:39.960
Maybe some examples for people who are not aware.

21:39.960 --> 21:48.040
What makes a good IQ test question that sneaks up on this g-factor measure?

21:48.040 --> 21:54.280
Well, your question is interesting because you want me to give examples of items that make good

21:54.280 --> 21:58.760
items, and what makes a good item is not so much its content,

21:59.320 --> 22:06.920
but its empirical relationship to the total score that turns out to be valid by other means.

22:07.720 --> 22:14.040
So for example, let me give you an odd example from personality testing.

22:15.560 --> 22:21.560
So there's a personality test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory,

22:21.560 --> 22:23.960
MMPI, been around for decades.

22:23.960 --> 22:29.080
I've heard about this test recently because of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial.

22:29.080 --> 22:35.720
I don't know if you've been paying attention to that, but they had psychologist understand,

22:35.720 --> 22:38.600
and they were talking, apparently those psychologists did,

22:39.960 --> 22:45.560
again, I'm learning so much from this trial, they did different battery of tests

22:46.920 --> 22:50.360
to diagnose personality disorders.

22:50.360 --> 22:53.240
Apparently, there's that systematic way of doing so.

22:53.240 --> 22:58.920
And the Minnesota one is one of the ones that there's the most science on.

22:58.920 --> 23:03.720
There's a lot of great papers which were all continuously cited on the stand,

23:03.720 --> 23:05.000
which is fascinating to watch.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.360
Sorry, a little bit of attention.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.120
It's okay. I mean, this is interesting because you're right.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.480
It's been around for decades.

23:09.480 --> 23:14.840
There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test,

23:14.840 --> 23:21.640
including what it predicts with respect to different categories of personality disorder.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.200
But what I want to mention is the content of the items on that test.

23:26.840 --> 23:31.800
All of the items are essentially true, false items.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.560
True or false, I prefer a shower to a bath.

23:36.840 --> 23:42.040
True or false, I think Lincoln was a better president than Washington.

23:42.600 --> 23:49.320
What have all these, what does that have to do with, and the point is the content of these

23:49.320 --> 23:57.160
items, nobody knows why these items in aggregate predict anything, but empirically they do.

23:57.800 --> 24:04.520
It's a technique of choosing items for a test that is called dust bowl empiricism.

24:05.720 --> 24:11.080
That the content doesn't matter, but for some reason, when you get a criterion group of people

24:11.080 --> 24:16.760
with this disorder and you compare them to people without that disorder, these are the

24:16.760 --> 24:22.600
items that distinguish. Irrespective of content, it's a hard concept to grasp.

24:22.600 --> 24:31.880
Well, first of all, it's fascinating, but I consider myself part psychologist

24:32.840 --> 24:36.520
because I love human-robot interaction, and that's a problem.

24:36.520 --> 24:40.440
Half of that problem is a psychology problem because there's a human.

24:41.880 --> 24:46.200
Designing these tests to get at the questions is the fascinating part.

24:50.040 --> 24:56.600
What does dust bowl empiricism refer to? Does it refer to the final result?

24:57.320 --> 25:04.840
Yeah, so the test is dust bowl empiricism, but how do you arrive at the battery of questions?

25:04.840 --> 25:10.840
I presume one of the things, now again, I'm going to the excellent testimony in that trial,

25:11.880 --> 25:19.000
because they also explain the tests, that a bunch of the questions that kind of

25:20.520 --> 25:27.560
make you forget that you're taking a test, it makes it very difficult for you to somehow figure

25:27.560 --> 25:33.960
out what you're supposed to answer. Yes, it's called social desirability,

25:33.960 --> 25:38.040
but we're getting a little far afield because I only wanted to give that example of dust bowl

25:38.040 --> 25:48.040
empiricism. When we talk about the items on an IQ test, many of those items in the dust bowl

25:48.040 --> 25:55.880
empiricism method have no face validity. In other words, they don't look like they measure anything.

25:57.560 --> 26:02.920
Whereas most intelligence tests, the items actually look like they're measuring some mental

26:02.920 --> 26:08.280
ability. So here's one of the... So you were bringing that up as an example as what it is not?

26:08.280 --> 26:12.760
Yes. Got it. Okay, so I don't want to go too far afield on it.

26:12.760 --> 26:19.000
Too far afield is actually one of the names of this podcast. So I should mention that.

26:19.000 --> 26:27.480
Far afield. Yeah, so anyway, sorry. So they feel the questions look like they pass the face validity

26:27.480 --> 26:31.960
test and some more than others. So for example, let me give you a couple of things here.

26:32.600 --> 26:39.240
If I... One of the subtests on a standard IQ test is general information.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.200
Let me just think a little bit because I don't want to give you the actual item.

26:44.200 --> 26:51.000
But if I said how far is it between Washington DC and Miami, Florida,

26:51.960 --> 26:59.000
within 500 miles plus or minus? Well, it's not a fact most people memorize,

26:59.880 --> 27:06.200
but you know something about geography. You say, well, I flew there once. I know planes fly 500

27:06.200 --> 27:13.400
miles. You can kind of make an estimate. But it also seems like it would be very cultural.

27:14.120 --> 27:23.560
So there's that kind of general information. Then there's vocabulary test. What does

27:26.200 --> 27:33.320
regatta mean? And I choose that word because that word was removed from the IQ test because

27:33.320 --> 27:40.040
people complained that disadvantaged people would not know that word just from their everyday

27:40.920 --> 27:48.200
life. Okay. Here's another example from a different kind of subtest. What's regatta,

27:48.200 --> 27:56.840
by the way? A regatta is a sailing competition, a competition with boats. Not necessarily sailing,

27:56.840 --> 28:02.840
but the competition with boats. Yep. Yep. I'm probably disadvantaged in that way. Okay. Excellent.

28:02.840 --> 28:08.760
So that was removed. Anyway, what you were saying. Okay. So here's another subtest. I'm going to repeat

28:08.760 --> 28:14.760
a string of numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready? Okay. Seven,

28:15.640 --> 28:25.000
four, two, eight, one, six. That's way too many. Seven, four, two, eight, one, six.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.720
Okay. You get the idea. Now, the actual test starts with a smaller number,

28:30.440 --> 28:34.920
you know, like two numbers. And then it is people get it right. You keep going,

28:34.920 --> 28:39.960
adding to the string of numbers until they can't do it anymore. Okay. But now try this.

28:40.600 --> 28:45.800
I'm going to say some numbers. And when I'm done, I want you to repeat them to me backwards.

28:46.520 --> 28:54.120
I quit. Okay. Now, so I gave you some examples of the kind of items on an IQ test. Yes. General

28:54.120 --> 29:03.640
information. I can't remember all. General information, vocabulary, digit span, forward

29:03.640 --> 29:10.120
and digit span backward. Well, you said I can't even remember them. That's a good question for me.

29:11.560 --> 29:15.080
What does memory have to do with your culture? Okay. Well, let's hold on.

29:15.080 --> 29:24.600
Okay. All right. Let's just talk about these examples. Now, some of those items seem very

29:24.600 --> 29:34.760
cultural and others seem less cultural. Which ones do you think scores on which

29:34.760 --> 29:42.360
subtest are most highly correlated with the G factor? Well, the G2 advanced is less cultural.

29:43.560 --> 29:52.920
Well, it turns out vocabulary is highly correlated. And it turns out that digit span

29:52.920 --> 30:02.120
backwards is highly correlated. How do you figure? Now you have decades of research

30:02.120 --> 30:08.520
to answer the question, how do you figure? Right. So now there's like good research that

30:08.520 --> 30:17.000
gives you intuition about what kind of questions get at it. Just like there's something I've done,

30:17.960 --> 30:23.320
I've actually used for research, just send me a autonomous vehicle, like whether humans are

30:23.320 --> 30:29.400
paying attention, there's a body of literature that does like end back tests. For example, we have to

30:33.400 --> 30:39.160
put workload on the brain to do recall, memory recall. And that helps you kind of

30:40.200 --> 30:45.080
put some work onto the brain while the person is doing some other task. And this does some

30:45.080 --> 30:50.360
interesting research with that. But that's loading the memory. So there's like research around

30:51.000 --> 30:56.760
stably what that means about the human mind. And here you're saying recall backwards

30:58.360 --> 31:03.720
is a good predictor. It's a transformation. Yeah. So you have to do some,

31:05.640 --> 31:11.160
like you have to load that into your brain and not just remember it, but do something with it.

31:11.160 --> 31:16.520
Right. Now here's another example of a different kind of test called the Hick paradigm. And it's

31:16.520 --> 31:25.080
not verbal at all. It's a little box. And there are a series of lights arranged in a semi circle

31:25.080 --> 31:32.840
at the top of the box. And then there's a home button that you press. And when one of the lights

31:32.840 --> 31:39.800
goes on, there's a button next to each of those lights, you take your finger off the home button

31:39.880 --> 31:45.880
and you just press the button next to the light that goes on. And so it's a very simple reaction

31:45.880 --> 31:50.440
time. Like goes on as quick as you can. You press the button and you get a reaction time

31:50.440 --> 31:57.080
from the moment you lift your finger off the button that when you press the button with where the

31:57.080 --> 32:05.080
light is, that reaction time doesn't really correlate with IQ very much. But if you change

32:05.880 --> 32:13.640
the instructions and you say three lights are going to come on simultaneously, I want you to

32:13.640 --> 32:20.760
press the button next to the light that's furthest from the other two. So maybe lights one and two

32:20.760 --> 32:26.520
go on and light six goes on simultaneously. You take your finger off and you would press the

32:26.520 --> 32:35.560
button by light six. That's that reaction time to a more complex task. It's not really hard.

32:36.280 --> 32:42.600
Almost everybody gets it all right. But your reaction time to that is highly correlated with

32:42.600 --> 32:49.320
the g-factor. This is fascinating. So reaction time. So it's a temporal aspect to this. So what

32:49.320 --> 32:54.360
rolled this time? Speed of processing. It's the speed of processing. Is this also true for ones

32:54.360 --> 33:01.880
that take longer like five, 10, 30 seconds? Is time part of the measure with some of these ideas?

33:01.880 --> 33:09.880
And that is why some of the best IQ tests have a time limit. Because if you have no time limit,

33:10.520 --> 33:18.200
people can do better. But it doesn't distinguish among people that well. So that

33:19.000 --> 33:26.040
adding the time element is important. So speed of information processing and reaction time is

33:26.040 --> 33:31.800
a measure of speed of information processing turns out to be related to the g-factor.

33:31.800 --> 33:37.960
But the g-factor only accounts for maybe half or some amount on the test performance. For example,

33:37.960 --> 33:50.520
I get pretty bad test anxiety. I just don't enjoy tests. I enjoy going back into my cave

33:50.520 --> 33:56.920
and working it. I've always enjoyed homework way more than tests. No matter how hard the

33:56.920 --> 34:01.080
homework is. Because I can go back to the cave and hide away and think deeply. There's something

34:01.080 --> 34:07.000
about being watched and having a time limit that really makes me anxious. And I could just see the

34:07.000 --> 34:13.080
mind not operating optimally at all. But you're saying underneath there, there's still a g-factor.

34:17.080 --> 34:21.560
And if you get anxious taking a test, many people say, oh, I didn't do well because I'm anxious.

34:23.480 --> 34:27.560
I hear that a lot. They say, well, fine. If you're really anxious during the test,

34:28.360 --> 34:33.800
the score will be a bad estimate of your g-factor. It doesn't mean the g-factor isn't there.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.680
That's right. And by the way, standardized tests like the SAT,

34:40.440 --> 34:46.920
they're essentially intelligence tests. They are highly G-loaded. Now, the people who make the

34:46.920 --> 34:54.200
SAT don't want to mention that. They have enough trouble justifying standardized testing. But to

34:54.200 --> 35:00.600
call it an intelligence test is really beyond the pale. But in fact, it's so highly correlated

35:00.680 --> 35:06.040
because it's a reasoning test. The SAT is a reasoning test, a verbal reasoning,

35:06.040 --> 35:14.760
mathematical reasoning. And if it's a reasoning test, it has to be related to G. But if people

35:15.640 --> 35:20.120
go in and take a standardized test, whether it's an IQ test or the SAT,

35:20.120 --> 35:27.720
and they happen to be sick that day with 102 fever, the score is not going to be a good

35:27.720 --> 35:34.840
estimate of their g. If they retake the test when they're not anxious or less anxious or don't have

35:34.840 --> 35:42.360
a fever, the score will go up and that will be a better estimate. But you can't say their g-factor

35:42.360 --> 35:48.840
increased between the two tests. Well, it's interesting. So the question is, how wide of a

35:48.840 --> 35:54.680
battery of tests is required to estimate the g-factor? Well, because I'll give you as my personal

35:54.760 --> 36:01.800
example, I took the SAT and I think it was called the ACT, where I was to also, I took SAT many

36:01.800 --> 36:09.160
times. Every single time, I got a perfect math. And verbal, the time limit on the verbal made me

36:09.160 --> 36:15.320
very anxious. I did not, I mean, part of it, I didn't speak English very well. But honestly,

36:15.320 --> 36:19.800
it was like, you're supposed to remember stuff. And like, I was so anxious. And like, as I'm reading,

36:19.800 --> 36:27.080
I'm sweating. I can't, you know, that like, that feeling you have when you're reading a book and

36:27.080 --> 36:32.520
you, you just read a page and you know nothing about what you've read because you zoned out,

36:32.520 --> 36:39.560
that's the same feeling of like, I can't, I have to, you're like, no, read and understand. And

36:39.560 --> 36:47.000
that anxiety is like, and you start seeing like the typography versus the content of the words.

36:47.080 --> 36:55.720
Like that was, I don't, it's interesting because I know that what they're measuring,

36:55.720 --> 37:02.600
I could see being correlated with something. But that anxiety or some aspect of the performance,

37:04.760 --> 37:10.520
sure plays a, plays a factor. And I wonder how you sneak up in a stable way. I mean,

37:10.520 --> 37:15.880
this is a broader discussion, but that's like standardized testing, how you sneak up,

37:16.520 --> 37:22.360
how you get at the fact that I'm super anxious and still nevertheless measure some aspect of my

37:22.360 --> 37:27.000
intelligence. I wonder, I don't, I don't know, I don't know if you can say it to that, that time

37:27.000 --> 37:34.040
limit sure is a pain. Well, let me say this, there are two ways to approach the very real problem

37:34.040 --> 37:40.920
that you say that some people just get anxious or not good test takers. By the way, part of,

37:42.280 --> 37:48.040
part of testing is you know the answer, you can figure out the answer, or you can't.

37:49.880 --> 37:54.840
If you don't know the answer, there are many reasons you don't know the answer at that particular

37:54.840 --> 38:00.440
moment. You may have learned it once and forgotten it. You may, it may be on the tip of your tongue,

38:00.440 --> 38:05.080
and you just can't get it because you're anxious about the time limit. You may never have learned

38:05.080 --> 38:10.520
it. You may never, you may have been exposed to it, but it was too complicated and you couldn't

38:10.520 --> 38:17.480
learn it. I mean, there are all kinds of reasons here. But for an individual to interpret your

38:17.480 --> 38:26.120
scores as an individual, whoever is interpreting the score has to take into account various things

38:26.120 --> 38:32.040
that would affect your individual score. And that's why decisions about college admission

38:32.600 --> 38:42.200
or anything else where tests are used are hardly ever the only criterion to make a decision.

38:42.200 --> 38:46.680
And I think people are, college admission is letting go of that very much.

38:46.680 --> 38:54.280
Oh, yes, there, yeah. But what does that even mean? Because is it possible to design standardized

38:54.280 --> 38:58.280
tests that do get, that are useful to college admissions?

38:58.280 --> 39:05.160
Well, they already exist. The SAT is highly correlated with many aspects of success at college.

39:05.160 --> 39:11.640
Here's the problem. So maybe you could speak to this, the correlation across a population versus

39:11.640 --> 39:20.920
individuals. So, you know, our criminal justice system is designed to make sure,

39:23.320 --> 39:30.760
well, it's still, there's tragic cases where innocent people go to jail, but you try to avoid

39:30.760 --> 39:37.960
that. In the same way with testing, it just, it would suck for an SAT to miss genius.

39:38.680 --> 39:45.400
Yes, and it's possible, but it's statistically unlikely. So it really comes down to

39:46.920 --> 39:58.840
do which piece of information maximizes your decision making ability. So,

40:00.680 --> 40:07.800
if you just use high school grades, it's okay. But you will miss some people who just

40:07.800 --> 40:13.000
don't do well in high school, but who are actually pretty smart, smart enough to be bored silly in

40:13.000 --> 40:18.520
high school, and they don't care, and they, their high school GPA isn't that good. So you will miss

40:18.520 --> 40:26.440
them in the same sense that somebody who could be very able and ready for college just doesn't

40:26.440 --> 40:35.960
do well on their SAT. This is why you make decisions with taking in a variety of information.

40:35.960 --> 40:43.240
The other thing I wanted to say, I talked about when you make a decision for an individual,

40:43.800 --> 40:51.400
statistically for groups, there are many people who have a disparity between their math score

40:51.400 --> 40:57.800
and their verbal score. That disparity, or the other way around, that disparity is called tilt.

40:58.520 --> 41:05.560
The score is tilted one way or the other, and that tilt has been studied empirically to see what

41:05.560 --> 41:14.760
that predicts. And in fact, you can't make predictions about college success based on tilt.

41:14.760 --> 41:20.200
And mathematics is a good example. There are many people, especially non-native speakers of

41:20.200 --> 41:25.800
English who come to this country, take the SATs, do very well on the math and not so well on the

41:25.800 --> 41:33.160
verbal. Well, if they're applying to a math program, the professors there who are making the

41:33.160 --> 41:40.440
decision or the admissions officers don't wait so much the score on verbal, especially if it's

41:40.440 --> 41:46.200
a non-native speaker. Well, so yeah, you have to try to, in the admission process, bring in the

41:46.200 --> 41:52.600
context. But non-native isn't really the problem. I mean, that was part of the problem for me.

41:53.560 --> 41:58.600
But it's the anxiety was, which it's interesting. It's interesting.

42:03.240 --> 42:08.760
Boy, reducing yourself down to numbers. But it's still true. It's still the truth.

42:09.800 --> 42:19.800
It's a painful truth. That same anxiety that led me to struggle with the SAT verbal tests,

42:20.520 --> 42:27.720
it's still within me in all ways of life. So maybe that's not anxiety. Maybe that's something,

42:28.680 --> 42:31.720
you know, like personality is also pretty stable.

42:32.280 --> 42:39.560
Personality is stable. Personality does impact the way you navigate life.

42:40.920 --> 42:41.880
There's no question.

42:42.440 --> 42:47.000
Yeah. And we should say that the G factor in intelligence is not just about some kind of

42:47.640 --> 42:58.280
number on a paper. It's also has to do with how you navigate life, how easy life is for you

42:58.840 --> 43:05.720
in this very complicated world. So personality is all tied into that in some deep fundamental way.

43:05.720 --> 43:12.040
But now you've hit the key point about why we even want to study intelligence and personality,

43:12.040 --> 43:17.800
I think to a lesser extent, but that's my interest is more on intelligence. I went to

43:17.800 --> 43:23.240
graduate school and wanted to study personality, but that's kind of another story how I got kind

43:23.240 --> 43:29.000
of shifted from personality research over to intelligence research. Because it's not just

43:29.000 --> 43:36.200
a number. Intelligence is not just an IQ score. It's not just an SAT score. It's what those numbers

43:36.200 --> 43:47.000
reflect about your ability to navigate everyday life. It has been said that life is one long

43:47.000 --> 43:58.520
intelligence test. And who can't relate to that? And if you doubt, see, another problem here is a

43:58.520 --> 44:04.760
lot of critics of intelligence research, intelligence testing tend to be academics who by

44:04.760 --> 44:12.040
and large are pretty smart people. And pretty smart people by and large have enormous difficulty

44:12.040 --> 44:20.680
understanding what the world is like for people with IQs of 80 or 75. It is a completely different

44:20.680 --> 44:30.680
everyday experience. Even IQ scores of 85, 90, you know, there's a popular television program,

44:30.680 --> 44:38.280
Judge Judy. Judge Judy deals with everyday people with everyday problems, and you can see the full

44:38.280 --> 44:45.160
range of problem-solving ability demonstrated there. And sometimes she does it for laughs,

44:45.160 --> 44:54.840
but it really isn't funny because people who are, there are people who are very limited in their

44:54.840 --> 45:05.400
life navigation, let alone success, by having, by not having good reasoning skills, which cannot

45:05.400 --> 45:10.600
be taught. We know this, by the way, because there are many efforts, you know, the United States

45:10.600 --> 45:16.440
military, which excels at training people. I mean, I don't know that there's a better organization

45:16.440 --> 45:23.000
in the world for training diverse people. And they won't take people with IQs under, I think,

45:23.000 --> 45:32.840
83 is the cutoff because they have found you, they are unable to train people with lower IQs to do

45:32.840 --> 45:38.600
jobs in the military. So one of the things that G-Factor has to do with is learning? Absolutely.

45:38.600 --> 45:46.360
Some people learn faster than others. Some people learn more than others. Now, faster, by the way,

45:46.360 --> 45:51.720
is not necessarily better, as long as you get to the same place eventually.

45:53.640 --> 45:59.640
But, you know, there are professional schools that want students who can learn the fastest

45:59.640 --> 46:08.360
because they can learn more, or learn deeper, or all kinds of ideas about why you select people

46:08.360 --> 46:15.000
with the highest scores. And there's nothing funnier, by the way, to listen to a bunch of academics

46:15.080 --> 46:20.920
complain about the concept of intelligence and intelligence testing. And then you go to a faculty

46:20.920 --> 46:25.960
meeting where they're discussing who to hire among the applicants. And all they talk about is how

46:25.960 --> 46:31.400
smart the person is. We'll get to that. We'll sneak up to that in different ways. But there's

46:31.400 --> 46:36.760
something about reducing a person to a number that in part is grounded to the person's genetics

46:36.760 --> 46:42.760
that makes people very uncomfortable. But nobody does that. Nobody in the field actually does that.

46:43.720 --> 46:51.160
That is a worry that is a worry like...

46:53.960 --> 46:57.640
Well, I don't want to call it a conspiracy theory. I mean, it's a legitimate worry,

46:58.200 --> 47:05.560
but it just doesn't happen. Now, I had a professor in graduate school who was the only person I ever

47:05.560 --> 47:15.000
knew who considered the students only by their test scores. And later in his life, he kind of

47:15.000 --> 47:22.840
backed off that. Let me ask you this. So we'll jump around. I'll come back to a book.

47:25.400 --> 47:33.240
I tend to... I've had political discussions with people. And actually, my friend Michael

47:33.240 --> 47:42.280
Malis, he's an anarchist. I disagree with him on basically everything except the fact that

47:43.000 --> 47:50.520
love is a beautiful thing in this world. And he says this test about left versus right,

47:50.520 --> 47:55.880
whatever. It doesn't matter what the test is, but he believes... The question is, do you believe that

47:55.880 --> 48:05.000
some people are better than others? The question is ambiguous. Do you believe some people are better

48:05.000 --> 48:13.560
than others? And to me, sort of the immediate answer is no. It's a poetic question. It's ambiguous

48:13.560 --> 48:20.680
question, right? Like, you know, people want to... Maybe the temptation to ask better at what?

48:20.680 --> 48:29.160
Better like sports and so on. No. To me, I stand with the sort of the fauny documents of this country,

48:29.800 --> 48:36.120
which is all men are created equal. There's a basic humanity. And there's something about

48:37.320 --> 48:44.280
tests of intelligence. Just knowing that some people are different, like the science of

48:44.280 --> 48:51.400
intelligence that shows that some people are genetically, in some stable way across a lifetime,

48:52.280 --> 49:00.360
have a greater intelligence than others. Makes people feel like some people are better than

49:00.360 --> 49:07.480
others. And that makes them very uncomfortable. And I... Maybe you can speak to that. The fact that

49:07.480 --> 49:17.400
some people are more intelligent than others in a way that cannot be compensated through education,

49:18.600 --> 49:25.560
through anything you do in life. What do we do with that? Okay, there's a lot there.

49:26.760 --> 49:34.040
We haven't really talked about the genetics of it yet, but you are correct in that it is

49:34.120 --> 49:40.760
my interpretation of the data that genetics has a very important influence on the g-factor.

49:41.560 --> 49:47.640
This is controversial. We can talk about it. But if you think that genetics, that genes are

49:47.640 --> 49:53.720
deterministic, are always deterministic, that leads to kind of the worry that you expressed.

49:55.160 --> 50:02.200
But we know now in the 21st century that many genes are not deterministic, that are probabilistic.

50:02.680 --> 50:11.640
Meaning their gene expression can be influenced. Now, whether they're influenced only by other

50:11.640 --> 50:19.000
biological variables or other genetic variables or environmental or cultural variables,

50:19.000 --> 50:27.000
that's where the controversy comes in. And we can discuss that in more detail if you like.

50:27.080 --> 50:36.120
But to go to the question about better, people better, there's zero evidence that smart people

50:36.840 --> 50:46.680
are better with respect to important aspects of life, like honesty, even likability.

50:47.880 --> 50:53.320
I'm sure you know many very intelligent people who are not terribly likable or terribly kind

50:53.320 --> 50:59.720
or terribly honest. Is there something to be said? So one of the things I've recently reread

50:59.720 --> 51:07.880
for the second time, I guess that's what the word reread means, the rise and fall of the third

51:07.880 --> 51:16.440
Reich, which is I think the best telling of the rise and fall of Hitler. And one of the interesting

51:16.440 --> 51:32.280
things about the people that, how should I say it, justified or maybe propped up the ideas

51:32.280 --> 51:39.160
that Hitler put forward is the fact that they were extremely intelligent. They were in the

51:39.160 --> 51:49.400
intellectual class. It was obvious that they thought very deeply and rationally about the world.

51:49.400 --> 51:55.960
So what I would like to say is one of the things that shows to me is some of the worst atrocities

51:55.960 --> 52:03.640
in the history of humanity have been committed by very intelligent people. So that means that

52:03.720 --> 52:12.680
intelligence doesn't make you a good person. I wonder if there's a g-factor for intelligence.

52:12.680 --> 52:19.640
I wonder if there's a g-factor for goodness. The Nietzschean good and evil, of course that's

52:19.640 --> 52:24.200
probably harder to measure because it's such a subjective thing, what it means to be good.

52:25.240 --> 52:30.280
And even the idea of evil is a deeply uncomfortable thing because how do we know?

52:31.160 --> 52:37.000
But it's independent, whatever it is, it's independent of intelligence. So I agree with you

52:37.000 --> 52:45.800
about that. But let me say this, I have also asserted my belief that more intelligence is

52:45.800 --> 52:55.320
better than less. It doesn't mean more intelligent people are better people, but all things being

52:55.320 --> 53:01.160
equal, would you like to be smarter or less smart? So if I had a pill, I have two pills,

53:01.160 --> 53:05.480
I said, this one will make you smarter, this one will make you dumber. Which one would you like?

53:06.360 --> 53:10.760
Are there any circumstances under which you would choose to be dumber? Well, let me ask you this.

53:11.480 --> 53:17.800
That's a very nuanced and interesting question. You know, there's been books written about this,

53:17.800 --> 53:23.720
right? Now we'll return to the hard questions, the interesting questions, but let me ask about

53:23.720 --> 53:34.200
human happiness. Does intelligence lead to happiness? No. So, okay, so back to the pill then.

53:34.920 --> 53:45.720
So why, when would you take the pill? So you said IQ 80, 90, 100, 110, you start going through the

53:45.800 --> 53:56.200
quartiles and is it obvious, isn't there diminishing returns and then it starts becoming negative?

53:57.240 --> 54:07.400
This is an empirical question. And so that I have advocated in many forums more research

54:08.200 --> 54:15.320
on enhancing the g-factor. Right now there's, there have been many claims about enhancing

54:15.320 --> 54:21.320
intelligence with, you mentioned the NVAC training, it was a big deal a few years ago,

54:21.320 --> 54:27.800
it doesn't work. Data is very clear, it does not work. Or doing like memory tests, like training

54:27.800 --> 54:35.160
and so on. Yeah, it may give you a better memory in the short run, but it doesn't impact your g-factor.

54:38.120 --> 54:43.880
It was very popular a couple of decades ago that the idea that listening to Mozart

54:44.520 --> 54:49.080
could make you more intelligent. There was a paper published on this with somebody I knew

54:49.080 --> 54:55.800
published this paper, intelligence researchers never believed it for a second, been hundreds of

54:55.800 --> 55:01.480
studies, all the meta-analyses, all the summaries and so on, show it, there's nothing to it,

55:02.200 --> 55:11.480
nothing to it at all. But wouldn't it be something, wouldn't it be world-shaking

55:12.680 --> 55:16.840
if you could take the normal distribution of intelligence, which we haven't really talked

55:16.840 --> 55:22.360
about yet, but IQ scores and the g-factor is thought to be a normal distribution,

55:22.680 --> 55:32.360
and shift it to the right so that everybody is smarter. Even a half a standard deviation would

55:32.360 --> 55:41.400
be world-shaking, because there are many social problems, many, many social problems that are

55:41.400 --> 55:50.280
exacerbated by people with lower ability to reason stuff out and navigate everyday life.

55:51.240 --> 55:58.520
I wonder if there's a threshold. So maybe I would push back and say universal shifting

55:59.320 --> 56:06.280
of the normal distribution may not be the optimal way of shifting. Maybe it's better to

56:07.160 --> 56:13.880
whatever the asymmetric kind of distributions is like really pushing the lower up versus

56:14.760 --> 56:20.920
trying to make the people at the average more intelligent. So you're saying that if in fact

56:20.920 --> 56:26.920
there was some way to increase g, let's just call it metaphorically a pill, an IQ pill,

56:27.640 --> 56:35.160
we should only give it to people at the lower end. No, it's just intuitively I can see that

56:35.160 --> 56:42.040
life becomes easier at the lower end if it's increased. It becomes less and less, it is

56:42.040 --> 56:48.280
a empirical scientific question, but it becomes less and less obvious to me that more intelligence

56:49.240 --> 56:57.320
is better. At the high end, not because it would make life easier, but it would make

56:57.880 --> 57:05.320
whatever problems you're working on more solvable. And if you are working on artificial

57:05.320 --> 57:13.160
intelligence, there's a tremendous potential for that to improve society.

57:13.160 --> 57:19.880
I understand. So at whatever problems you're working on, yes, but there's also the problem

57:19.880 --> 57:27.720
of the human condition. There's love, there's fear and all of those beautiful things that sometimes

57:27.720 --> 57:31.480
if you're good at solving problems, you're going to create more problems for yourself.

57:32.040 --> 57:38.280
It's, I'm not exactly sure. So ignorance is bliss is a thing. So there might be a place,

57:38.280 --> 57:43.640
there might be a sweet spot of intelligence, given your environment, given your personality,

57:43.640 --> 57:48.680
all of those kinds of things. And that becomes less beautifully complicated, the more and more

57:48.680 --> 57:54.600
intelligent you become. But that's a question for literature and not for science perhaps.

57:54.600 --> 58:00.600
Well, imagine this, imagine there was an IQ pill and it was developed by a private company.

58:01.560 --> 58:08.760
And they are willing to sell it to you. And whatever price they put on it, you are willing

58:08.760 --> 58:13.640
to pay it because you would like to be smarter. Yes. But just before they give you a pill,

58:14.200 --> 58:24.120
they give you a disclaimer form to sign. Yes. Don't hold us, you understand that this pill

58:24.120 --> 58:28.440
has no guarantee that your life is going to be better. And in fact, it could be worse.

58:29.240 --> 58:34.360
Well, yes, that's how lawyers work. But I would love for science to answer the question,

58:35.080 --> 58:37.800
to try to predict if your life is going to be better or worse,

58:38.520 --> 58:43.160
when you become more, more or less intelligent. It's a, it's a fascinating question

58:43.160 --> 58:45.560
about what is the sweet spot for the human condition.

58:47.480 --> 58:53.240
Some of the things we see as bugs might be actually features may be crucial to our

58:54.200 --> 58:59.960
overall happiness. Our limitations might lead to more happiness than less. But again,

58:59.960 --> 59:06.360
more intelligence is better at the lower end. That's more, that's something that's less arguable

59:06.360 --> 59:11.560
and, and, and, and fascinating if possible to increase. But you know, there's virtually no

59:11.560 --> 59:19.000
research that's based on a neuroscience approach to solving that problem. All the solutions that

59:19.000 --> 59:26.760
have been proposed to solve that problem or to ameliorate that problem are essentially based

59:26.760 --> 59:33.960
on the blank slate assumption that, you know, enriching the environment, removing barriers,

59:34.600 --> 59:39.560
all good things, by the way, I'm not against any of those things. But there's no empirical evidence

59:39.560 --> 59:47.160
that they're going to improve the general reasoning ability or make people more employable.

59:47.720 --> 59:50.280
Have you read Flowers of Algernon? Yes.

59:51.720 --> 59:54.280
That's to the question of intelligence and happiness.

59:56.040 --> 01:00:01.480
There are many profound aspects of that story. It was a film that was very good.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:07.160
The film was called Charlie for the younger people who are listening to this.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:14.920
You might be able to stream it on Netflix or something, but it was a story about

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:22.440
a person with very low IQ who underwent a surgical procedure in the brain and he slowly

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:32.680
became a genius. And the tragedy of the story is the effect was temporary. It's a fascinating story,

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.280
really. That goes in contrast to the basic human experience that each of us individually have,

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.240
but it raises the question of the full range of people you might be able to be,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.560
given different levels of intelligence. You've mentioned the normal distribution.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:01:00.040
So let's talk about it. There's a book called The Bell Curve written in 1994, written by psychologist

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:06.920
Richard Hearnstein and political scientist Charles Murray. Why was this book so controversial?

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:15.240
This is a fascinating book. I know Charles Murray. I've had many conversations with him.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:23.800
Yeah, what is the book about? The book is about the importance of intelligence in everyday life.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:32.840
That's what the book is about. It's an empirical book. It has statistical analyses of very large

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:41.560
databases that show that essentially IQ scores or their equivalent are correlated to all kinds of

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:51.960
social problems and social benefits. And that in itself is not where the controversy about

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:59.240
that book came. The controversy was about one chapter in that book. And that is a chapter about

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:05.880
the average difference in mean scores between black Americans and white Americans.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:11.960
And these are the terms that were used in the book at the time and are still used to some extent.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:26.840
And historically, or really for decades, it has been observed that disadvantaged groups

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:38.200
score on average lower than Caucasians on academic tests, tests of mental ability,

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:44.200
and especially on IQ tests. And the difference is about a standard deviation, which is about 15

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:53.560
points, which is a substantial difference. In the book, Hearnstein and Murray in this one chapter

01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:04.920
assert clearly and unambiguously that whether this average difference is due to genetics or not,

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:12.360
they are agnostic. They don't know. Moreover, they assert they don't care because you wouldn't

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.440
treat anybody differently knowing that if there was a genetic component or not, because that's a

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:25.000
group average finding. Every individual has to be treated as an individual. You can't make any

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.360
assumption about what that person's intellectual ability might be from the fact of an average

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:42.200
group difference. They're very clear about this. Nonetheless, people took away, I'm going to choose

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:48.200
my words carefully because I have a feeling that many critics didn't actually read the book,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.880
they took away that Hearnstein and Murray were saying that blacks are genetically inferior.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:04:00.280
That was the take home message. And if they weren't saying it, they were implying it because they had

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:09.560
a chapter that discussed this empirical observation of a difference. And isn't this horrible?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:22.680
And so the reaction to that book was incendiary. What do we know about from that book and the

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:32.360
research beyond about race differences and intelligence? It's still the most incendiary

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:40.280
topic in psychology. Nothing has changed that. Anybody who even discusses it is easily called

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:47.400
a racist just for discussing it. It's become fashionable to find racism in any discussion

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:58.840
like this. It's unfortunate. The short answer to your question is there's been very little

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:10.440
actual research on this topic since the Belcher, even before. This really became incendiary in

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:17.960
1969 with an article published by an educational psychologist named Arthur Jensen. Let's just

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:24.200
take a minute and go back to that to see the bell curve in a little bit more historical perspective.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:34.280
Arthur Jensen was an educational psychologist at UC Berkeley. I knew him as well. And in 1969

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:43.000
or 1968, the Harvard Educational Review asked him to do a review article on the

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:53.320
early childhood education programs that were designed to raise the IQs of minority students.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:01.160
This was before the federally funded Head Start program. Head Start had not really gotten underway

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:07.400
at the time Jensen undertook his review of what were a number of demonstration programs.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:15.640
And these demonstration programs were for young children around kindergarten age,

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:22.360
and they were specially designed to be cognitively stimulating, to provide lunches,

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:31.720
do all the things that people thought would minimize this average gap of intelligence tests.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:39.160
There was a strong belief among virtually all psychologists that the cause of the gap was

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:46.440
unequal opportunity due to racism, due to all negative things in the society. And if you could

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:54.680
compensate for this, the gap would go away. So early childhood education back then was called

01:06:54.680 --> 01:07:02.280
literally compensatory education. Jensen looked at these programs. He was an empirical guy. He

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:12.040
understood psychometrics. And he wrote a, it was over 100 page article detailing these programs

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:18.120
and the flaws in their research design. Some of the programs reported IQ gains of

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:25.400
on average five points, but a few reported 10, 20, and even 30 point gains. One was called the

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:33.560
miracle in Milwaukee. That investigator went to jail ultimately for fabricating data. But the

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:39.400
point is that Jensen wrote an article that said, look, the opening sentence of this article is

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.120
classic. The opening sentence is, I may not quote it exactly right, but it's,

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:51.240
we have tried compensatory education and it has failed. And he showed that these games

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:59.720
were essentially nothing. You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all from these

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:08.120
really earnest efforts to increase IQ. But he went a step further, a fateful step further.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:15.880
He said, not only have these efforts failed, but because they have had essentially no impact,

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:22.040
we have to re-examine our assumption that these differences are caused by environmental things

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:29.160
that we can address with education. We need to consider a genetic influence, whether there's

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.960
a genetic influence on this group difference. So you said that this is one of the more

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.640
controversial works ever. I think it's the most infamous paper in all of psychology,

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:48.280
I would go on to say. Because in 1969, the genetic data was very skimpy on this question.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.120
Skimpy and controversial. It's always been controversial, but it was even skimpy and

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:59.080
controversial. It's kind of a long story that I go into a little bit in more detail in the book

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:06.520
Neuroscience of Intelligence. But to say he was vilified is an understatement. I mean,

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:14.040
he couldn't talk at the American Psychological Association without bomb threats clearing the

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:21.320
lecture hall. Campus security watched him all the time. They opened his mail. He had to retreat

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:30.440
to a different address. This was one of the earliest kinds, this is before the internet,

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:42.040
and kind of internet social media mobs. But it was that intense. And I have written that overnight,

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:48.920
after the publication of this article, all intelligence research became radioactive.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:59.640
Nobody wanted to talk about it. And then nobody was doing more research. And then

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:06.520
the bell curve came along. And the Jensen controversy was dying down. I have stories that

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:11.640
Jensen told me about his interaction with the Nixon White House on this issue. I mean, it was,

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:17.800
this was like a really big deal. It was some unbelievable stories, but he told me this,

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:25.480
so I kind of believe these stories. Nonetheless, 25 years later, 25 years later, all the silence

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:33.720
basically saying, you know, this nobody wants to do this kind of research. There's so much pressure,

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:42.440
so much attack against this kind of research. And here's sort of a bold, stupid, crazy people that

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.640
decided to dive right back in. I wonder how much discussion that was, do we include this chapter

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:56.200
or not? Murray has said they discussed it, and they felt they should include it. And they were

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:05.400
very careful in the way they wrote it, which did them no good. So as a matter of fact, when the

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:13.160
bell curve came out, it was so controversial. I got a call from a television show called Nightline,

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:19.800
it was with a broadcaster called Ted Koppel, who had this evening show, I think it was on late at

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:27.080
night, talked about news, it was a straight up news thing. And producer called and asked if I would

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:34.920
be on it to talk about the bell curve. And I said, you know, she asked me what I thought

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.880
about the bell curve as a book. I said, look, it's a very good book. It talks about the role of

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:47.080
intelligence in society. And she said, no, no, what do you think about the chapter on race?

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:53.000
That's what we want you to talk about. I remember this conversation. I said, well,

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:02.520
she said, what would you say if you were on TV? And I said, well, what I would say is that it's

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:09.240
not at all clear if there's any genetic component to intelligence,

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:18.760
any differences. But if there were a strong genetic component, that would be a good thing.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.000
And, you know, complete silence on the other end of the phone. And she said, well, what do you mean?

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:35.160
And I said, well, if it's the more genetic any difference is, the more it's biological. And

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:41.720
if it's biological, we can figure out how to fix it. I see. That's interesting. She said,

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.240
would you say that on television? Yes. I said, no. And so that was the end of that.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:13:01.240
So that's for more like biology is within the reach of science. And the environment is a public

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:09.000
policy, social and all those kinds of things. From your perspective, whichever one you think

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:15.560
is more amenable to solutions in the short term is the one that excites you. But you're saying

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:30.280
that it's good. The truth of genetic differences, no matter what the between groups is a painful,

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:37.960
harmful, potentially, potentially dangerous thing. So let me ask you to this question,

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.880
whether it's Bell Curve or any research on race differences,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.760
can that be used to increase the amount of racism in the world? Can that be used to increase the

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:56.200
amount of hate in the world? Do you think about this kind of stuff? I've thought about this a lot,

01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:06.840
not as a scientist, but as a person. And my sense is, there is such enormous

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:15.560
reservoirs of hate and racism that have nothing to do with scientific knowledge of the data

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:25.800
that speak against that. No, I don't want to give racist groups of veto power over what

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:33.240
scientists study. If you think that the differences, and by the way, virtually no one disagrees that

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:40.280
there are differences in scores, it's all about what causes them and how to fix it. So if you

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:48.040
think this is a cultural problem, then you must ask the problem, do you want to change anything

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:54.040
about the culture? Or are you okay with the culture because you don't feel it's appropriate to change

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:59.960
a person's culture? So are you okay with that and the fact that that may lead to disadvantages in

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:07.400
school achievement? It's a question. If you think it's environmental, what are the environmental

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:15.880
parameters that can be fixed? I'll tell you one, lead from gasoline in the atmosphere,

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:23.080
lead in paint, lead in water. That's an environmental toxin that society has the means to

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:28.200
eliminate, and they should. Yeah, just to sort of try and define some

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:37.640
insight and conclusion to this very difficult topic. Is there been research on environment

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.240
versus genetics, nature versus nurture on this question of race differences?

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:49.480
No one wants to do this research. First of all, it's hard research to do. Second of all, it's a

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:54.520
minefield. No one wants to spend their career on it. Tenured people don't want to do it,

01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:02.360
let alone students. The way I talk about it, well, before I tell you the way I talk about it,

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:08.040
I want to say one more thing about Jensen. He was once asked by a journalist straight out,

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:15.400
are you a racist? His answer was very interesting. His answer was, I've thought about that a lot,

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:23.640
and I've concluded it doesn't matter. Now, I know what he meant by this.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.800
The guts to say that. Wow.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:30.440
He was a very unusual person. I think he had a touch of Asperger's syndrome to tell you the

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:36.040
truth, because I saw him in many circumstances. He would be canceled on Twitter immediately

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.680
with that sentence. Yeah, but what he meant was he had a hypothesis,

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:47.800
yeah, and with respect to group differences, he called it the default hypothesis. He said,

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.400
whatever factors affect individual intelligence are likely the same factors that affect group

01:16:53.400 --> 01:17:00.200
differences. It was the default, but it was a hypothesis. It should be tested, and if it turned

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.560
out, empirical test didn't support the hypothesis, he was happy to move on to something else.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:15.160
He was absolutely committed to that scientific ideal, that it's an empirical question.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.680
We should look at it, and let's see what happens.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:24.520
The scientific method cannot be racist from his perspective. It doesn't matter what the

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:31.960
scientists, if they follow the scientific method, it doesn't matter what they believe.

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:38.600
And if they are biased, and they consciously or unconsciously bias the data,

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:47.480
other people will come along to replicate it, they will fail, and the process over time will work.

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:55.960
So let me push back on this idea, because psychology to me is full of gray areas,

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:04.360
and what I've observed about psychology, even replication crisis aside, is that

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:10.680
something about the media, something about journalism, something about the virality of

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:20.600
ideas in the public sphere, they misinterpret. They take up things from studies willfully or

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:28.920
from ignorance misinterpret findings, and tell narratives around that. I personally believe,

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.680
for me, I'm not saying that broadly about science, but for me, it's my responsibility to

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:42.200
anticipate the ways in which findings will be misinterpreted. So I've had, I thought about

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:51.720
this a lot, because I published papers on semi autonomous vehicles, and cars, people dying cars.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.840
There's people that have written me letters saying emails, nobody writes letters, I wish they did,

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:05.000
that have blood in my hands, because of things that I would say positive or negative, there's

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.680
consequences. In the same way, when you're a researcher of intelligence, I'm sure you might get

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:18.040
emails, or at least people might believe that finding your study is going to be used by a

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.880
large number of people to increase the amount of hate in the world. I think there's some

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:32.120
responsibility on scientists, but for me, I think there's a great responsibility to anticipate the

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:38.840
ways things will be misinterpreted. And there you have to, first of all, decide whether you want

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:45.560
to say a thing at all, or do the study at all, publish the study at all, and to the words with

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:53.080
which you explain it. I find this on Twitter a lot, actually, which is when I write a tweet,

01:19:53.080 --> 01:20:01.720
and I'm usually just doing it so innocently, I'll write it, it takes me like five seconds to write

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:08.120
it, or whatever, 30 seconds to write it, and then I'll think, all right, I'll close my eyes, open,

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:13.080
and try to see how will the world interpret this? What are the ways in which this will be

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:20.760
misinterpreted? And I'll sometimes adjust that tweet to see, yeah, so in my mind, it's clear,

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:25.400
but that's because it's my mind from which this tweet came, but you have to think in a fresh

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:35.000
mind that sees this, and it's spread across a large number of other minds, how will the interpretation

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:41.000
morph? I mean, for a tweet, this is a silly thing, it doesn't matter, but for a scientific

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:48.760
paper and study and finding, I think it matters. So I don't know, I don't know what your thoughts

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:55.960
about that, because maybe for Jensen, the data is there, what do you want me to do? This is a

01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:02.120
scientific process has been carried out. If you think the data was polluted by bias,

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:11.320
do other studies that reveal the bias, but the data is there? I'm not a poet,

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:17.400
I'm not a literary writer, what do you want me to do? I'm just presenting you the data.

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:21.080
What do you think on that spectrum? What's the role of a scientist?

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:29.240
The reason I do podcasts, the reason I write books for the public is to explain what I think

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:36.680
the data mean and what I think the data don't mean. I don't do very much on Twitter other than to

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:43.720
retweet references to papers, I don't think it's my role to explain these because they're complicated,

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:54.280
they're nuanced, but when you decide not to do a scientific study or not to publish a result,

01:21:54.280 --> 01:22:01.000
because you're afraid the result could be harmful or insensitive,

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:09.880
that's not an unreasonable thought, and people will make different conclusions and decisions

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:16.920
about that. I wrote about this, I'm the editor of a journal called Intelligence,

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:23.080
which publishes scientific papers. Sometimes we publish papers on group differences,

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:29.480
those papers sometimes are controversial. These papers are written for a scientific audience,

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:35.240
they're not written for the Twitter audience, so I don't promote them very much on Twitter,

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:45.800
but in a scientific paper you have to now choose your words carefully also because those papers

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:53.800
are picked up by non-scientists, by writers of various kinds, and you have to be available to

01:22:53.800 --> 01:23:02.600
discuss what you're saying and what you're not saying. Sometimes you are successful at having

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:10.440
a good conversation like we are today that doesn't start out pejorative. Other times I've been asked

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:17.400
to participate in debates where my role would be to justify race science. Well, you can see,

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:25.000
you start out, and that was a BBC request that I received.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:31.800
I have so much, it's a love-hate relationship, mostly hate with these shallow journalism

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:39.480
organizations, so they would want to use you as a kind of in a debate setting to communicate as to

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:45.880
there is race differences between groups and make that into a debate and put you in a role of...

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:51.000
Justifying racism, that's what they're asking me to do.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.480
...forces like educating about this field of the science of intelligence.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:24:02.840
Yeah, I want to say one more thing before we get off the normal distribution. You also asked me,

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:09.480
what is the science after the bell curve? And the short answer is there's not much new work,

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:15.240
but whatever work there is supports the idea that there still are group differences.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.360
It's arguable whether those differences have diminished at all or not,

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:28.120
and there is still a major problem in underperformance for school achievement.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:36.200
For many disadvantaged and minority students, and there so far is no way to fix it.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:43.640
What do we do with this information? Is this now a task? Now, we'll talk about the future

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.080
on the neuroscience and the biology side, but in terms of this information as a society,

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.080
in the public policy, in the political space, in the social space, what do we do with this

01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:02.600
information? I've thought a lot about this. The first step is to have people interested in policy

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:09.800
understand what the data actually show to pay attention to intelligence data.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:16.680
You can read policy papers about education, and using your word processor, you can search for

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:23.080
the word intelligence. You can search a 20,000 word document in a second and find out the word

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:31.480
intelligence does not appear anywhere in most discussions about what to do about achievement

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:37.640
gaps. I'm not talking about test gaps. I'm talking about actual achievement gaps in schools, which

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:43.080
everyone agrees is a problem. The word intelligence doesn't appear among educators.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.600
That's fascinating. As a matter of fact, in California,

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:53.720
there has been tremendous controversy about recent attempts to revise the curriculum for math

01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:01.320
in high schools. We had a Stanford professor of education who was running this review

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:10.600
assert there's no such thing as talent, a mathematical talent. She wanted to get rid of the

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.520
advanced classes in math because not everyone could do that. Of course, this has been very

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:22.280
controversial. They've retreated somewhat, but the idea that a university professor was in charge

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:33.560
of this who believes that there's no talent, that it doesn't exist, this is rather shocking,

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:39.320
let alone the complete absence of intelligence data. By the way, let me tell you something about

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:47.000
what the intelligence data show. Let's take a race out of it. Even though the origins of these

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:55.320
studies were a long time ago, I'm blocking on the name of the report, the Coleman report was a

01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:03.480
famous report about education. They measured all kinds of variables about schools, about teachers,

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:11.880
and they looked at academic achievement as an outcome. They found the most predictive

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:19.000
variables of education outcome where the variables the student brought with him or her

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:27.240
into the school, essentially their ability. When you combine the school and the teacher

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.760
variables together, the quality of the school, the funding of the school, the quality of the

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:38.120
teachers, their education, you put all the teacher and school variables together, it barely

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:48.840
accounted for 10% of the variance. This has been replicated now. The best research we have

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:57.320
shows that school variables and teacher variables together account for about 10% of student academic

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:05.480
achievement. Now, you want to have some policy on improving academic achievement. How much money

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:12.440
do you want to put into teacher education? How much money do you want to put into the quality of

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.000
the school administration? You know who you can ask? You can ask the Gates Foundation,

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:24.120
because they spent a tremendous amount of money doing that. At the end of it, because they're

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:29.560
measurement people, they want to know the data. They found it had no impact at all,

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:40.120
and they've pulled out of that program. Boy, let me ask you, this is me talking, but there's

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:46.600
just the two of us. Just the two of us, but I'm going to say some funny and ridiculous things.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.840
You're surely not approving of it, but there's a movie called Clerks.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:01.080
I've seen it. There's a funny scene in there where a lovely couple are talking about the

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:09.560
number of previous sexual partners they had. The woman says that, I believe she just had a handful,

01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:14.120
like two or three or something like that, sexual partners, but then she also mentioned

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:22.520
that she, what's that called, a fallacious? What's the scientific? She gave a blow job

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:34.040
to 37 guys, I believe it is. That has to do with the truth. Sometimes knowing the truth

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.880
can get in the way of a successful relationship of love of some of the human flourishing.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:48.520
And that seems to me that's at the core here, that facing some kind of

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:55.560
truth that's not able to be changed, it makes it difficult to sort of

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:04.840
is limiting as opposed to empowering. That's the concern. If you sort of test for intelligence

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:10.520
and lay the data out, it feels like you will give up on certain people. You will

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:18.920
sort of start bidding people as like, well, this person is like, let's focus on the average people

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:24.680
or let's focus on the very intelligent people. That's the concern. And there's a kind of

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:33.000
intuition that if we just don't measure and we don't use that data, that we would treat everybody

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.600
equal and give everybody equal opportunity. If we have the data in front of us, we're likely to

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:49.320
misdistribute the amount of sort of attention we allocate, resources we allocate to people.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:57.080
That's probably the concern. It's a realistic concern, but I think it's a misplaced concern

01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:02.840
if you want to fix the problem. If you want to fix the problem, you have to know what the

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:09.560
problem is. Now, let me tell you this. Let's go back to the bell curve, not the bell curve,

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:18.440
but the normal distribution. 16% of the population on average has an IQ under 85,

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:25.960
which means they're very hard. If you have an IQ under 85, it's very hard to find gainful

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:36.040
employment at a salary that sustains you at least minimally in modern life. Not impossible,

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:45.640
but it's very difficult. 16% of the population of the United States is about 51 or 52 million people

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:55.640
with IQs under 85. This is not a small issue. 14 million children have IQs under 85.

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:03.640
Is this something we want to ignore? Does this have any, what is the Venn diagram between,

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:10.680
you know, when you have people with IQs under 85 and you have achievement in school

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:19.560
or achievement in life? There's a lot of overlap there. This is why, to go back to the IQ pill,

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:31.080
if there were a way to shift that curve toward the higher end, that would have a big impact.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.040
If I could maybe before we talk about the impact on life and so on,

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:42.520
some of the criticisms of the bell curve. So Stephen Jay Gould wrote that the bell curve

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:47.960
rests on four incorrect assumptions. It would be just interesting to get your thoughts on the four

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:53.400
assumptions, which are intelligence must be reducible to a single number, intelligence must

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:59.560
be capable of rank ordering people in a linear order, intelligence must be primarily genetically

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:06.840
based and intelligence must be essentially immutable. Maybe not as criticisms, but as

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:12.760
thoughts about intelligence. Yeah, we could spend a lot of time on him.

01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:25.000
Stephen Jay Gould, yeah. He wrote that in what about 1985, 1984. His views were overtly political,

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.600
not scientific. He was a scientist, but his views on this were overtly political,

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:38.200
and I would encourage people listening to this if they really want to understand his criticisms.

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:48.920
They should just Google what he had to say and Google the scientific reviews of his book,

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:55.480
the mismeasure of man, and they will take these statements apart. They were wrong,

01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:03.160
not only were they wrong, but when he asserted in his first book that there was no biological

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:11.560
basis essentially to IQ. By the time the second edition came around, there were studies of MRIs

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:17.720
of showing that brain size, brain volume were correlated to IQ scores, which he declined to

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:26.040
put in his book. I'm learning a lot today. I didn't know the extent of his work. I was just

01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:30.920
using a few little snippets of criticism. That's interesting. There's a battle here. He wrote

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:36.280
a book, Mismeasure of Man, that's missing a lot of the scientific grounding.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:41.960
His book is highly popular in colleges today. You can find it in any college bookstore under

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.600
assigned reading. It's highly popular. The Mismeasure of Man? Yes, highly influential.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:51.400
Can you speak to the Mismeasure of Man? I'm undereducated about this. Is this the book

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:56.600
basically criticizing the ideas in the bulk of it? Yes, where those four things came from.

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:06.360
It is really a book that was really taken apart point by point by a number of people who actually

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:11.320
understood the data. He didn't care. He didn't care. He didn't modify anything.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:17.960
It's a politically... Listen, because this is such a sensitive topic, like I said, I believe

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:29.640
the impact of the work as it is misinterpreted has to be considered because it's not just

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.400
going to be scientific discourse. It's going to be political discourse. There's going to be

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:40.440
debates. There's going to be politically motivated people that would use messages in

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:51.400
each direction, make something like the bulk of the enemy or the support for one's racist beliefs.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:59.640
I think you have to consider that, but it's difficult because Nietzsche was used by Hitler to

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:07.560
justify a lot of his beliefs. It's not exactly on Nietzsche to anticipate Hitler

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:14.440
or how his ideas will be misinterpreted and used for evil, but there's a balance there.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:20.680
This is really interesting. I didn't know. Is there any criticism of the book you find compelling

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:24.840
or interesting or challenging to use from a scientific perspective? There were factual

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:32.600
criticisms about the nature of the statistics that were used, the statistical analyses. These

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:38.600
were more technical criticisms. They were addressed by Murray in a couple of articles where he took

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:45.800
all the criticisms and spoke to them. People listening to this podcast can certainly find all

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:53.080
those online. It's very interesting, but Murray went on to write some additional books, two in

01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:59.400
the last couple of years. One about human diversity, where he goes through the data

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:09.320
refuting the idea that race is only a social construct with no biological meaning. He discusses

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:14.840
the data. It's a very good discussion. You don't have to agree with it, but he presents data in a

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:21.480
cogent way. He talks about the critics of that and he talks about their data in a cogent,

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:28.840
not personal way. It's a very informative discussion. The book is called Human Diversity.

01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:33.400
He talks about race and he talks about gender, same thing, about sex differences.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:41.320
And more recently, he's written what might be his final say on this, a book called Facing Reality,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:50.360
where he talks about this again. He can certainly defend himself. He doesn't need me

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:57.480
to do that, but I would urge people who have heard about him and the bell curve

01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:05.240
and who think they know what's in it. You are likely incorrect and you need to read it for yourself.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:14.120
But it is scientifically, it's a serious subject. It's a difficult subject. Ethically,

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:20.680
it's a difficult subject. Everything you said here calmly and thoughtfully is difficult. This

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:27.800
is difficult for me to even consider that g-factor exists. I don't mean from like,

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:35.160
that somehow g-factors inherently racist or sexist or whatever. It's just, it's difficult in the way

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:41.400
that considering the fact that we die one day is difficult, that we are limited by our biology.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:48.760
It's difficult. And it's, at least from an American perspective, you would like to believe

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:56.680
that everything is possible in this world. Well, that leads us to what I think we should

01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:05.480
do with this information. And what I think we should do with this information is unusual.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:13.480
Uh-oh. Because I think what we need to do is fund more neuroscience research on the molecular

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:23.640
biology of learning and memory because one definition of intelligence is based on how

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:29.960
much you can learn and how much you can remember. Yes. And if you accept that definition of intelligence,

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:37.400
then there are molecular studies going on now and Nobel Prize is being won

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:43.960
on molecular biology or molecular neurobiology of learning and memory.

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:52.040
Now, the step those researchers, those scientists need to take when it comes to intelligence

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:02.760
is to focus on the concept of individual differences. Intelligence research has individual

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:11.080
differences as its heart because it assumes that people differ on this variable and those

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:19.720
differences are meaningful and need understanding. Cognitive psychologists who have morphed into

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:26.040
molecular biologists studying learning and memory hate the concept of individual differences

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:33.800
historically. Some now are coming around to it. I once sat next to a Nobel Prize winner

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:42.040
for his work on memory and I asked him about individual differences and he said,

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:49.480
don't go there. It'll set us back 50 years. I said, don't you think they're the key though

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:55.960
to understand? Why can some people remember more than others? He said, you don't want to go there.

01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.600
I think the 21st century will be remembered by the technology and the science that

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.760
goes to individual differences because we have now data. We have now the tools to much,

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:13.480
much better to start to measure, start to estimate, not just on the sort of through tests and IQ

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:19.640
test type of things, sort of outside the body kind of things, but measuring all kinds of stuff

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:25.400
about the body. So yeah, truly going to the molecular biology, to the neurobiology, to the

01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:36.520
neuroscience. Let me ask you about this life. How does intelligence correlate with or lead to

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.760
or has anything to do with career success? You've mentioned these kinds of things and

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.680
is there any data, you had an excellent conversation with Jordan Peterson, for example.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:52.680
Is there any data on what intelligent means for success in life?

01:41:53.400 --> 01:42:02.040
Success in life. There is a tremendous amount of validity data that looked at

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:13.720
intelligence test scores and various measures of life success. Now, of course, life success is a

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:25.320
pretty broad topic and not everybody agrees on what success means, but there's general agreement

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:34.360
on certain aspects of success that can be measured. And those including life expectancy,

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:44.680
like you said. Life expectancy. Now, there's life success. Life expectancy. I mean,

01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:52.760
that is such an interesting finding, but IQ scores are also correlated to things like

01:42:52.840 --> 01:43:01.960
income. Now, okay, so who thinks income means you're successful? That's not the point. The point

01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:10.120
is that income is one empirical measure in this culture that says something about your level

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:16.920
of success. You can define success in ways that have nothing to do with income. You can define

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:29.720
success based on your evolutionary natural selection success. And even that, by the way,

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:37.560
is correlated to IQ in some studies. So, however you want to define success,

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:46.760
IQ is important. It's not the only determinant people get hung up on. Well, what about personality?

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:53.000
What about so-called emotional intelligence? Yes, all those things matter. The thing that matters

01:43:53.560 --> 01:44:00.280
empirically, the single thing that matters the most is your general ability, your general mental

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:08.280
intellectual ability, your reasoning ability. And the more complex your vocation, the more complex

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:16.360
your job, the more G matters. G doesn't matter and a lot of occupations don't require complex thinking.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.520
And there are occupations like that and G doesn't matter. Within an occupation,

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:32.760
the G might not matter so much. So that if you look at all the professors at MIT

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:42.280
and had a way to rank order them on, you know, there's a ceiling effect is what I'm saying,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:49.160
that, you know... Also, when you get past a certain threshold, then there's impact on wealth,

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:54.360
for example, or career success. However, that's defined in each individual discipline, but

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:59.480
after a certain point, it doesn't matter. Actually, it does matter in certain things. So,

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:08.120
for example, there is a very classic study that was started at Johns Hopkins when I was a graduate

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:11.800
student there. I actually worked on this study at the very beginning, the study of

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:20.040
Mathematically and Scientifically Precocious Youth. And they gave junior high school students,

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:30.360
age 11 and 12, the standard SAT math exam. And they found a very large number of students

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:37.560
scored very high on this exam, not a large number. I mean, they found many students when

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:44.200
they cast the net, all of Baltimore, they found a number of students who scored as high on the

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:51.960
SAT math when they were 12 years old as incoming Hopkins freshmen. And they said, gee, now this

01:45:51.960 --> 01:46:01.640
is interesting, what shall we do now? And on a case by case basis, they got some of those kids

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:09.320
into their local community college math programs. Many of those kids went on to be very successful.

01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:16.040
And now there's a 50-year follow-up of those kids. And it turns out,

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:25.720
these kids were in the top 1%. Okay, so everybody in this study is in the top 1%. If you take that

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:33.720
group, that rarefied group and divide them into quartiles, so that you have the top 25% of the

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:47.960
top 1% and the bottom 25% of the top 1%, you can find on measurable variables of success,

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:54.840
the top quartile does better than the bottom quartile. In the top 1%, they have more patents,

01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:00.440
they have more publications, they have more tenure at universities. And this is based on,

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:05.000
you're dividing them based on their score at age 12.

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:12.200
I wonder how much interesting data is in the variability, in the differences.

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:22.040
That's very interesting, but it's also, I don't know, somehow painful. I don't know why it's so

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:31.080
painful, that that's so, that G-Facture so determinant of even in the nuanced top percent.

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:36.520
This is interesting that you find that painful. Do you find it painful that people with charisma

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:42.920
are very successful, can be very successful in life, even though having no other attributes other

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:50.280
than their famous and people like them? Do you find that painful? Yes, if that charisma is untrainable.

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:56.120
So one of the things, again, this is like I learned psychology from the Johnny Depp trial,

01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:03.080
but one of the things the psychologist, the personality psychologist, he can maybe speak

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:10.200
to this because he had interest in this for time, is she was saying that personality,

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:19.160
technically speaking, is the thing that doesn't change over a lifetime. It's the thing you're,

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.680
I don't know if she was actually implying that you're born with it. Well, it's a trait.

01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:28.920
It's a trait. It's a trait that's relatively stable over time. I think that's generally correct.

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:35.640
So do the degree your personality is stable over time? Yes, that too is painful,

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:43.320
because what's not painful is the thing, if I'm fat, not of shape, I can exercise

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:52.360
and become healthier in that way. If my diet is a giant mess and that's resulting in some kind of

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.000
conditions that my body is experiencing, I can fix that by having a better diet.

01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:05.400
That's sort of my actions, my willed actions can make a change. If charisma is part of the

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:11.480
personality, that's the part of the charisma that is part of the personality that is stable.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:18.520
Well, yeah, yeah, that's painful too, because it's like, oh, shit, I'm stuck with this. I'm

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:25.160
stuck with this. Well, I mean, this pretty much generalizes to every aspect of your being. This

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:30.360
is who you are. You've got to deal with it. And what it undermines, of course, is a realistic

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:41.320
appreciation for this undermines the fairly recent idea prevalent in this country that if you work

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:48.040
hard, you can be anything you want to be, which has morphed from the original idea that if you

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:57.560
work hard, you can be successful. Those are two different things. And now we have, if you work

01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:05.080
hard, you can be anything you want to be. This is completely unrealistic. I'm sorry, it just is.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:10.920
Now you can work hard and be successful. There's no question. But you know what? I could work

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:17.960
very hard and I am not going to be a successful theoretical physicist. I'm just not.

01:50:18.680 --> 01:50:24.040
That said, I mean, we should, because we had this conversation already, but it's good to repeat

01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:31.640
the fact that you're not going to be a theoretical physicist. It's not judgment on your basic

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:39.640
humanity. Returning again to the old men, which means men and women are created equal. So again,

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:44.440
some of the differences we're talking about in quote unquote, success, wealth,

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:54.840
number of, whether you win a Nobel Prize or not, that doesn't put a measure on your basic

01:50:54.840 --> 01:51:03.000
humanity and basic value and even goodness of you as a human being. Because that,

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:12.840
that your basic role and value in society is largely within your control. It's some of these

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:17.880
measures that we're talking about. It's good. It's good to remember this.

01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:26.200
One question about the Flynn effect. What is it? Are humans getting smarter over the years,

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:33.480
over the decades, over the centuries? The Flynn effect is, James Flynn passed away about a year

01:51:33.480 --> 01:51:46.040
ago, published a set of analyses, going back a couple of decades, when he first noticed this,

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:55.480
that IQ scores, when you looked over the years, seemed to be drifting up. Now, this was not

01:51:55.480 --> 01:52:02.840
unknown to the people who make the test, because they renorm the test periodically, and they have

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:11.400
to renorm the test periodically, because what 10 items correct meant relative to other people

01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:19.560
50 years ago is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today. People are getting more

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:26.600
things correct. Now, the scores have been drifting up about three points, IQ scores have been drifting

01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:33.320
up about three points per decade. This is not a personal effect. This is a cohort effect.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:39.800
It's not for an individual, but- The world. How do you explain, so what's the definition?

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:47.000
This has presented intelligence researchers with a great mystery. Two questions. First,

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.800
is it effect on the 50% of the variance that's the G factor or on the other 50%

01:52:53.880 --> 01:53:02.920
and there's evidence that it is a G factor effect. Second, what on earth causes this and

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:09.560
doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor cannot be genetic, because the scale of natural

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:19.080
selection is much, much longer than a couple of decades ago. It's been used to try to undermine

01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:27.480
the idea that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence, but certainly it can be the

01:53:27.480 --> 01:53:34.520
Flynn effect can affect the non-genetic aspects of intelligence, because genes account for maybe

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:43.080
50% of the variance, maybe higher, it could be as high as 80% for adults, but let's just say 50%

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:51.400
for discussion. So, the Flynn effect, it's still a mystery. It's still a mystery. That's

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:55.480
interesting. It's still a mystery, although the evidence is coming out. I told you before I edited

01:53:55.480 --> 01:54:01.160
a journal on intelligence and we're doing a special issue in honor of James Flynn, so I'm

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:08.840
starting to see papers now. I'm really the latest research on this. I think most people who specialize

01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:16.680
in this area of trying to understand the Flynn effect are coming to the view based on data that

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:25.960
it has to do with advances in nutrition and healthcare. And there's also evidence that the

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:35.080
effect is slowing down and possibly reversing. Oh boy. So, how would nutrition, nutrition would

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:42.680
still be connected to the g-factor? So, nutrition as it relates to the g-factor, so the biology that

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:51.800
leads to the intelligence. Yes. That would be the claim. The hypothesis being tested by the

01:54:51.800 --> 01:55:00.520
research. Yes, and there's some evidence from infants that nutrition has made a difference.

01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:07.720
So, it's not an unreasonable connection, but does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence?

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:15.080
Not logically at all. But it is very interesting, so that if you take an IQ test today,

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:25.560
but you take the score and use the tables that were available in 1940, you're going to wind up

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:35.240
with a much higher IQ number. So, are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago? No,

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:43.720
but we might be able to solve problems a little better and make use of our g because of things

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:50.680
like Sesame Street and other curricula in school. More people are going to school,

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:58.360
so there are a lot of factors here to disentangle. It's fascinating though. It's fascinating that

01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:05.960
there's not clear answers yet that as a population, we're getting smarter. When you just zoom out,

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:10.120
that's what it looks like as a population getting smarter. It's interesting to see what the effects

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:15.880
of that are. I mean, this raises the question. We've mentioned it many times, but haven't clearly

01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:22.040
addressed it, which is nature versus nurture question. So, how much of intelligence is nature?

01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:27.640
How much of it is nurture? How much of it is determined by genetics versus environment?

01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:33.480
All of it. All of it is genetics. No, all of it is nature and nurture.

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:43.560
So, yes. Okay. But how much of the variance can you apportion to either?

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:52.200
Most of the people who work in this field say that the framing of that, if the question is framed

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:58.520
that way, it can't be answered because nature and nurture are not too independent influences.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:07.080
They interact with each other and understanding those interactions is so complex that many

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:15.160
behavioral geneticists say it is today impossible and always will be impossible

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:22.280
to disentangle that no matter what kind of advances there are in DNA technology and genomic

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:30.760
informatics. But there's still to push back on that. That same intuition from behavioral geneticists

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.720
would lead me to believe that there cannot possibly be a stable G factor.

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:43.480
It's super complex. Many of them would assert that as a logical outcome,

01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:52.360
but because I believe there is a stable G factor from lots of sources of data, not just one study,

01:57:52.360 --> 01:58:02.840
but lots of sources of data over decades, I am more amenable to the idea that whatever interactions

01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:11.320
between genes and environment exist, they can be explicated, they can be studied,

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:19.320
and that information can be used as a basis for molecular biology of intelligence.

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:27.880
Yes. And we'll do this exact question because doesn't the stability of the G factor give you

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:33.800
at least a hint that there is a biological basis for intelligence?

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:42.840
Yes. I think it's clear that the fact that an IQ score is correlated to things like thickness

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:55.400
of your cortex, that it's correlated to glucose metabolic rate in your brain that identical

01:58:55.400 --> 01:59:05.720
twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores. These are all important observations

01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:14.120
that indicate, not just suggest, but indicate that there's a biological basis. And does anyone

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:20.120
believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain? I mean, it's so obvious.

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:24.440
Well, indirectly definitely has to do with it, but the question is

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:33.720
environment interacting with the brain or is it the actual raw hardware of the brain?

01:59:34.680 --> 01:59:44.760
Well, some would say that the raw hardware of the brain as it develops from conception

01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:52.920
through adulthood or at least through the childhood, that that so-called hardware that you

01:59:52.920 --> 02:00:02.040
are assuming is mostly genetic, in fact, is not as deterministic as you might think, that it is

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:10.280
probabilistic and what affects the probabilities are things like in uterine environment and other

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:20.520
factors like that, including chance, that chance affects the way the neurons are connecting during

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:31.160
gestation. It's not, hey, it's pre-programmed. So there is pushback on the concept that genes

02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:39.640
provide a blueprint, that it's a lot more fluid. Well, but also, yeah, so there's a lot, a lot,

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:51.000
happens in the first few months of development. So for in nine months inside the mother's body,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:58.520
and in the, you know, the months, the few months afterwards, there's a lot of fascinating stuff,

02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:06.040
like including chance and luck, like you said, how things connect up. The question is afterwards,

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:09.880
the neuroplasticity of the brain, how much adjustment there is relative to the environment,

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:15.960
how much that affects the g-factor, but that's where the whole conclusions of the studies that

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:22.840
we've been talking about is that seems to have less and less and less of an effect as pretty quickly.

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:31.240
Yes, and I do think there is more of a genetic, my view, and I'm not an expert on this, I mean,

02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:36.680
genetics is a highly technical and complex subject. I am not a geneticist, not a behavioral

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:46.520
geneticist, but my reading of this, my interpretation of this, is that there is a genetic blueprint

02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:54.120
more or less, and that has a profound influence on your subsequent intellectual development,

02:01:54.120 --> 02:02:01.560
including the g-factor. And that's not to say things can't happen to, I mean,

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:09.400
if you think of that genes provide a potential, fine, and that various variables impact that

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:18.600
potential. And every parent of a newborn, implicitly or explicitly, wants to maximize that potential.

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:25.480
This is why you buy educational toys. This is why you pay attention to organic baby food.

02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:32.440
This is why you do all these things because you want your baby to be as healthy and as smart as

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:38.680
possible. And every parent will say that. Is there a case to be made? Can you steal me on the case

02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:49.240
that genetics is a very tiny component of all this, and the environment is essential?

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:54.760
I don't think the data supports that genetics is a tiny component. I think the data support the

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:59.960
idea that the genetics is a very important, and I don't say component, I say influence.

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:06.760
A very important influence, and the environment is a lot less than people believe.

02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:11.480
Most people believe environment plays a big role. I'm not so sure.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:18.120
I guess what I'm asking you is, can you see where, what you just said, it might be wrong?

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:27.000
Can you imagine a world, and what kind of evidence would you need to see to say,

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.360
you know what, the intuition, the study so far, like reversing the direction. So one of the cool

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:37.880
things we have now more and more is we're getting more and more data, and the rate of the data is

02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:45.880
escalating because of the digital world. So when you start to look at a very large scale of data,

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:51.960
both from the biology side and the social side, we might be discovering some very counterintuitive

02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:59.560
things about society. We might see the edge cases that reveal that if we actually scale those edge

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:06.840
cases, and they become like the norm, that we'll have a complete shift in our, like you'll see

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:17.560
g-factor be able to be modified throughout life in the teens in later life. So in any case you

02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:22.600
can make, or for where your current intuitions are wrong. Yes, and it's a good question because I

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:28.600
think everyone should always be asked, what evidence would change your mind? It's certainly,

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:33.880
not only a fair question, it is really the key question for anybody working on any

02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:45.320
aspect of science. I think that if environment was very important, we would have seen it clearly by

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:52.120
now. It would have been obvious that school interventions, compensatory education, early

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:57.800
childhood education, all these things that have been earnestly tried and well-funded,

02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:03.960
well-designed studies would show some effect, and they don't. They don't. What if school,

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:10.120
the way we've tried school, compensatory school sucks and we need to do better? That's what

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:16.760
everybody said to Jensen. He said, well, maybe we need to start earlier. Maybe we need not do

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:23.640
pre-kindergarten, but pre-pre-kindergarten. It's always an infinite, well, maybe we didn't get it

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:33.800
right. But after decades of trying, 50 years, 50 or 60 years of trying, surely something would have

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:40.760
worked to the point where you could actually see a result and not need a probability level at 0.05

02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:47.560
on some means. That's the kind of evidence that would change my mind.

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:57.480
Population level interventions like schooling that you would see, this actually has an effect.

02:05:57.480 --> 02:06:05.160
Yes. When you take adopted kids and they grow up in another family and you find out when those

02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:10.600
adopted kids are adults, their IQ scores don't correlate with the IQ scores of their adoptive

02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:16.840
parents, but they do correlate with their IQ scores of their biological parents whom they've

02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:26.120
never met. These are powerful observations. It would be convincing to you if the reverse was

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:34.280
true. Yes, that would be more. There is some data on adoption that indicates the adopted children

02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:44.600
are moving a little bit more toward their adoptive parents. To me, the overwhelming, I have this

02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:50.760
concept called the weight of evidence, where I don't interpret any one study too much. The weight

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:55.560
of evidence tells me genes are important. But what does that mean? What does it mean that

02:06:55.560 --> 02:07:02.520
genes are important? Knowing that gene expression, genes don't express themselves in a vacuum.

02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:08.520
They express themselves in an environment. The environment has to have something to do with it,

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:15.480
especially if the best genetic estimates of the amount of variance are around 50 or even if it's

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:24.840
as high as 80%, it still leaves 20% of non-genetic. Now, maybe that is all luck. Maybe that's all

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:36.200
chance. I could easily believe that. But I do think after 50 years of trying various interventions,

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:42.680
and nothing works, including memory training, including listening to Mozart, including playing

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:48.920
computer games, none of that has shown any impact on intelligence test scores.

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:57.080
Is there data on the intelligence, the IQ of parents as it relates to the children?

02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:07.080
Yes. And there is some genetic evidence of an interaction between the parents' IQ and the

02:08:08.600 --> 02:08:17.160
high IQ parents provide an enriched environment, which then can impact the child in addition to

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:21.880
the genes, it's that environment. So there are all these interactions that,

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:30.840
but think about the number of books in a household. This was a variable that's correlated

02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:40.120
with IQ. It is. Yeah. Well, why? Especially if the kid never reads any of the books. It's because

02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:46.760
more intelligent people have more books in their house. And if you're more intelligent,

02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:55.080
and there's a genetic component to that, the child will get those genes or some of those genes,

02:08:55.080 --> 02:09:02.200
as well as the environment. But it's not the number of books in the house that actually directly

02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:09.800
impacts the child. So the two scenarios on this are you find that, and this was used to

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:17.000
get rid of the SAT test, or the SAT scores highly correlated with the social economic status of the

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:24.040
parents. So all you're really measuring is how rich the parents are. Okay, well, why are the parents

02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:35.720
rich? Yes. And so you could, the opposite kind of syllogism is that people who are very bright

02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:44.360
make more money. They can afford homes in better neighborhoods, so their kids get better schools.

02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:50.200
Now the kids grow up bright. Where in that chain of events does that come from?

02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:58.840
Well, unless you have a genetically informative research design, where you look at siblings

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:06.600
that have the same biological parents and so on, you can't really disentangle all that. Most studies

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:14.360
of social economic status and intelligence do not have a genetically informed design. So any

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:21.960
conclusions they make about the causality of the social economic status being the cause of the IQ

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:29.560
is a stretch. And where you do find genetically informative designs,

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:38.760
you find most of the variance in your outcome measures are due to the genetic component,

02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:47.080
and sometimes the SES adds a little, but the weight of evidence is it doesn't add very much

02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:53.880
variance to predict what's going on beyond the genetic variance. So when you actually look at

02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:59.800
it in some, and there aren't that many studies that have genetically informed designs,

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.320
but when you do see those, the genes seem to have an advantage.

02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:08.520
Sorry for the strange questions, but is there a connection between

02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:19.480
fertility or the number of kids that you have and g-factor? So you know the kind of conventional

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:27.800
wisdom is people of maybe higher economic status or something like that or having fewer children.

02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:33.880
I just loosely hear these kinds of things. Is there data that you're aware of in one direction

02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.680
or another on this? Well, strange questions always get strange answers.

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.600
Yes. Do you have a strange answer for that strange question?

02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:51.640
The answer is there were some studies that indicated the more children in a family,

02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:59.800
the firstborn children would be more intelligent than the fourth or fifth or sixth.

02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:07.720
It's not clear that those studies hold up over time, and of course what you see also

02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:15.160
is that families where there are multiple children, four, five, six, seven, you know,

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:25.560
really big families, the social economic status of those families usually in the modern age is

02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:31.880
not that high. Maybe it used to be the aristocracy used to have a lot of kids,

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:41.240
I'm not sure exactly. But there have been reports of correlations between IQ and fertility,

02:12:42.760 --> 02:12:50.360
but I'm not sure that the data are very strong that the firstborn child is always the smartest.

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:54.280
It seems like there's some data to that, but I'm not current on that.

02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:57.880
How would that be explained? That would be a nurture.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:03.320
Well, it could be nurture, it could be in uterine environment. I mean,

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:13.800
and this is why this, you know, like many areas of science, you said earlier that

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.600
there are a lot of gray areas and no definitive answers.

02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:29.400
This is not uncommon in science that the closer you look at a problem, the more questions you get,

02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:38.440
not the fewer questions, because the universe is complicated. And the idea that we have people

02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:46.680
on this planet who can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, that's pretty amazing.

02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:53.080
And I've always said that if they can study the first nanoseconds of the Big Bang,

02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:58.120
we can certainly figure out something about intelligence that allows that.

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:04.280
I'm not sure what's more complicated, the human mind or the physics of the universe.

02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.400
It's unclear to me. I think we over emphasize.

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:10.920
Well, that's a very humbling statement.

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:17.320
Maybe it's very human centric egotistical statement that our mind is somehow super

02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:25.000
complicated, but biology is a trick you want to unravel consciousness. What is that?

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:32.120
I've always believed that consciousness and intelligence are the two real

02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:40.360
fundamental problems of the human brain. And therefore, I think they must be related.

02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:48.920
Part problems like walk together, holding hands, kind of idea.

02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:54.200
You may not know this, but I did some of the early research on anesthetic drugs with brain

02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:59.080
imaging, trying to answer the question, what part of the brain is the last to turn off when

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:05.480
someone loses consciousness? And is that the first part of the brain to turn on when consciousness

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:11.080
is regained? And I was working with an anesthesiologist named Mike Alkire. He was really brilliant

02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:17.400
at this. These were really the first studies of brain imaging using positron emission tomography

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:27.160
long before fMRI. And you would inject a radioactive sugar that labeled the brain,

02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:31.640
and the harder the brain was working, the more sugar it would take up. And then you could make

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:40.840
a picture of glucose use in the brain. And he was amazing. He managed to do this in normal

02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:49.640
volunteers he brought in and anesthetized as if they were going into surgery. He managed all

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:59.800
the human subjects requirements on this research. And he was brilliant at this. And what we did

02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:06.520
is we had these normal volunteers come in on three occasions. On one occasion, he gave them

02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:16.760
enough anesthetic drug so they were a little drowsy. And on another occasion, they came in

02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:27.000
and he fully anesthetized them. And he would say, Mike, can you hear me? And the person would say,

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:38.600
oh, yeah. And then we would scan people under no anesthetic condition. So the same person.

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:47.320
And we were looking to see if we could see the part of the brain turn off. He subsequently

02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:53.240
tried to do this with fMRI, which has a faster time resolution. And you could do it in real time

02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:57.640
as the person went under and then regained consciousness where you couldn't do that with

02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:03.240
PET. You had to have three different occasions. And the results were absolutely fascinating.

02:17:03.240 --> 02:17:08.760
We did this with different anesthetic drugs. And different drugs impacted different parts of the

02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:15.960
brain. So we were naturally looking for the common one. And it seemed to have something to do with

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:24.760
the thalamus and consciousness. This was actual data on consciousness. Real consciousness, actual

02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:31.880
consciousness. What part of the brain turns on? What part of the brain turns off? It's not so clear.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.880
But maybe it has something to do with the thalamus. The sequence of events seemed to

02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:44.280
have the thalamus in it. Boy. Now here's the question. Are some people more conscious than

02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:50.680
others? Are there individual differences in consciousness? And I don't mean it in the

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.920
psychedelic sense. I don't mean it in the political consciousness sense. I just mean it in everyday

02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.680
life. Do some people go through everyday life more conscious than others? And are those the people

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:09.720
we might actually label more intelligent? So now the other thing I was looking for is whether the

02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:14.600
parts of the brain we were seeing in the anesthesia studies were the same parts of the

02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:21.240
brain we were seeing in the intelligent studies. Now this is, you know, this was very complicated,

02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:26.280
expensive research. We didn't really have funding to do this. We were trying to do it on the fly.

02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:33.000
I'm not sure anybody has pursued this. You know, I'm retired now. He's gone on to other things.

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:41.000
But I think it's an area of research that would be fascinating to see the parts. There are a lot

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:47.000
more imaging studies now of consciousness. I'm just not up on them. But basically the question is

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:54.200
which imaging, so newer imaging studies to see in high resolution, spatial and temporal way,

02:18:54.200 --> 02:19:01.160
which part of the brain lights up when you're doing intelligence tasks? And which parts of the

02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:05.000
brain lights up when you're doing consciousness tasks and see the interplay between them?

02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:10.920
Try to infer. That's the challenge of neuroscience. Without understanding deeply,

02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:18.920
looking from the outside, try to infer something about how the whole thing works.

02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:25.320
Well, imagine this. Here's a simple question. Does it take more anesthetic drug

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:36.920
to have a person lose consciousness if their IQ is 140, than a person with an IQ of 70?

02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:46.840
That's an interesting way to study it. If the answer to that is a stable yes,

02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:53.080
that's very interesting. So I tried to find out. And I went to some anesthesiology textbooks

02:19:53.080 --> 02:20:04.040
about how you dose and they dose by weight. And what I also learned, this is a little bit off

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:13.160
subject, anesthesiologists are never sure how deep you are. And they usually tell by poking you with

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:19.000
a needle and if you don't jump, they tell the surgeon to go ahead. I'm not sure that's literally

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:26.920
true, but it might be very difficult to know precisely how deep you are. It has to do with

02:20:26.920 --> 02:20:33.960
the same kind of measurements that you're doing with the consciousness. It's difficult to know.

02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:39.400
So I don't lose my train of thought. I couldn't find in the textbooks anything about dosing by

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:45.880
intelligence. I asked my friend, the anesthesiologist, he said, no, he doesn't know. I said,

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:54.120
can we do a chart review and look at people using their years of education as a proxy for IQ?

02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:58.840
Because if someone's gone to graduate school, that tells you something. You can make some

02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:04.200
inferences as opposed to someone who didn't graduate high school. Can we do a chart review?

02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:12.040
And he says, no, they never really put down the exact dose. And no, he said, no. So to this day,

02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:20.280
the simple question, does it take more anesthetic drug to put someone under if they have a high IQ

02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:27.560
or less? Or less? It could go either way. Because by the way, our early PET scan studies of

02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:36.920
intelligence found the unexpected result of an inverse correlation between glucose metabolic

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:45.160
and intelligence. It wasn't how much a brain area lit up. How much it lit up was negatively

02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:51.000
correlated to how well they did on the test, which led to the brain efficiency hypothesis,

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:58.360
which is still being studied today. And there's more and more evidence that the efficiency of brain

02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:09.080
information processing is more related to intelligence than just more activity.

02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:14.520
Yeah, it'll be interesting. Again, it's the total hypothesis of how much in the relationship between

02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:22.280
intelligence and consciousness, it's not obvious that those two, if there's correlation, they could

02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:33.640
be inversely correlated. Wouldn't that be funny? If you, the consciousness factor, the C factor

02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:42.600
plus the G factor equals one. It's a nice trade off. You get a trade off, how deeply you experience

02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:49.640
the world versus how deeply you're able to reason through the world. What a great hypothesis.

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:53.800
Certainly somebody listening to this can do this study.

02:22:53.800 --> 02:23:00.280
Even if it's the aliens analyzing humans a few centuries from now, let me ask you from an AI

02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:09.080
perspective. I don't know how much you've thought about machines, but there's the famous touring

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:17.400
test, test of intelligence for machines, which is a beautiful, almost like a cute formulation of

02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:26.840
intelligence that Alan Turing proposed. Basically conversation being, if you can fool a human to

02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:36.360
think that a machine is a human that passes the test, I suppose you could do a similar thing

02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:46.680
for humans. If I can fool you that I'm intelligent, then that's a good test of intelligence,

02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:59.480
like you're talking to two people, and the test is saying who has a higher IQ.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.440
It's an interesting test because yeah, maybe charisma can be very useful there,

02:24:07.320 --> 02:24:11.080
and you're only allowed to use conversation, which is the formulation of the Turing test.

02:24:11.640 --> 02:24:19.320
All that to say is, what are good tests of intelligence for machines? What do you think

02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:22.520
it takes to achieve human level intelligence for machines?

02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:31.320
I have thought a little bit about this, but every time I think about these things, I rapidly reach

02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:42.760
the limits of my knowledge and imagination. When Alexa first came out, and I think

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:49.720
there was a competing one, well, there was Siri with Apple, and Google had Alexa.

02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:52.280
No, Amazon had Alexa.

02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:54.760
Amazon had Alexa. Google has Google.

02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:01.880
Something. I propose to one of my colleagues that he buy one of these, one of each,

02:25:02.840 --> 02:25:05.880
and then ask it questions from the IQ test.

02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:16.360
But it became apparent that they all search the internet, so they all can find answers to

02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:23.400
questions like how far is it between Washington and Miami, and repeat after me. Now, I don't know if

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:31.000
you said to Alexa, I'm going to repeat these numbers backwards to me. I don't know what would

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.880
happen. I've never done it. One answer to your question is, you're going to try it right now.

02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:40.440
Let's try it. Let's try it. No, no, no.

02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:47.240
Yes, Siri. It would actually probably go to Google search, and it would be all confusing

02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:50.200
kind of stuff. It would fail.

02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:53.640
Well, then I guess there's a test that it would fail.

02:25:54.520 --> 02:26:03.560
Well, but that has to do more with the language of communication versus the content.

02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:09.400
So if you did an IQ test to a person who doesn't speak English, and the test was administered in

02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:11.560
English, that's not really the test of thought.

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.080
Well, let's think about the computers that beat the Jeopardy champions.

02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:20.840
Yeah, so that's because I happen to know how those are programmed.

02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:24.600
There's a very hard coded, and there's definitely a lack of intelligence there.

02:26:25.240 --> 02:26:35.080
There's something like IQ tests. There's a guy, artificial intelligence researcher,

02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.760
Francois Chollet. He's a Google. He's one of the seminal people in machine learning.

02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:45.480
He also, as a fun aside thing, developed an IQ test for machines.

02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:48.760
Oh, I haven't heard that. I'd just like to know about that.

02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:53.160
I'll actually email you this because it'd be very interesting for you.

02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:57.000
It doesn't get much attention because people don't know what to do with it,

02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:04.280
but it deserves a lot of attention, which is it basically does a pattern type of tests

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:11.160
where you have to do one standard one. You're given three things,

02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:16.760
and you have to do a fourth one, that kind of thing. You have to understand the pattern here,

02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.000
and for that, it really simplifies to...

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:31.640
So the interesting thing is he's trying not to achieve high IQ. He's trying to achieve

02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:37.240
pretty low bar for IQ. Things that are kind of trivial for humans,

02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:45.000
and they're actually really tough for machines, which is playing with these concepts of

02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:53.720
symmetry, of counting. If I give you one object, two objects, three objects, you'll know the last

02:27:53.720 --> 02:28:00.040
one is four objects. You can count them. You can cluster objects together. It's both visually and

02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:06.200
conceptually. We could do all these things with our mind that we take for granted, the object-ness

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:14.920
of things. We can figure out what spatially is an object and isn't, and we can play with those

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:22.600
ideas, and machines really struggle with that. So he really cleanly formulated these IQ tests.

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:28.360
I wonder what that would equate to for humans with IQ, but it'd be a very low IQ.

02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:35.000
But that's exactly the kind of formulation like, okay, we want to be able to solve this. How do we

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:41.080
solve this? And he does this as a challenge, and nobody's been able to... It's similar to the Alexa

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:48.680
Prize, which is Amazon is hosting a conversational challenge. Nobody's been able to do well on his.

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:54.680
But that's an interesting... Those kinds of tests are interesting, because we take for granted all

02:28:55.480 --> 02:29:05.880
the ability of the human mind to play with concepts and to formulate concepts out of novel

02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:14.600
things. Things we've never seen before. We were able to use that. I've talked to a few people that

02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:21.800
design IQ tests online. They write IQ tests, and I was trying to get some questions from them,

02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:25.960
and they spoke to the fact that we can't really share questions with you, because

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:32.360
part of the... First of all, it's really hard work to come up with questions.

02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:39.000
It's really, really hard work. It takes a lot of research, but it also takes a lot of novelty

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:47.080
generating. You're constantly coming up with really new things. And part of the point is that

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:53.400
they're not supposed to be public. They're supposed to be new to you when you look at them.

02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:57.240
It's interesting that the novelty is fundamental to the hardness of the problem,

02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:03.000
at least a part of what makes the problem hard, as you've never seen it before.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:07.960
Right. That's called fluid intelligence, as opposed to what's called crystallized

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:15.720
intelligence, which is your knowledge of facts. You know things, but can you use those things

02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:24.920
to solve a problem? Those are two different things. I don't want to miss opportunity to

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:30.280
talk about this. I spoke about the neurobiology, the molecular biology of intelligence. Do you

02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:39.640
think one day we'll be able to modify the biology or the genetics of a person to

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:44.920
modify their intelligence, to increase their intelligence? We started this conversation

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:49.080
by talking about a pill you could take. Do you think that such a pill would exist?

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:57.160
Metaphorically, I do. And I am supremely confident that it's possible because I am

02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:00.840
supremely ignorant of the complexities of neurobiology.

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:04.920
Ignorance is bliss.

02:31:04.920 --> 02:31:08.760
Well, I have written that the nightmares of neurobiologists,

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:17.160
understanding the complexities, this cascade of events that happens at the synaptic level,

02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:27.240
that these nightmares are what fuel some people to solve. So some people, you have to be

02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:33.640
undaunted. I mean, yeah, this is not easy. Look, we're still trying to figure out cancer.

02:31:34.520 --> 02:31:39.160
Yeah. It was only recently that they figured out why aspirin works.

02:31:40.280 --> 02:31:48.760
You know, these are not easy problems, but I also have the perspective of the history of science

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:56.360
is the history of solving problems that are extraordinarily complex.

02:31:57.400 --> 02:31:58.600
It seemed impossible at the time.

02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:00.920
And seemed impossible at the time.

02:32:00.920 --> 02:32:06.520
And so one of the things you look at at companies like Neuralink, you have brain,

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:11.800
computer interfaces, you start to delve into the human mind and start to talk about machines,

02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:19.880
measuring, but also sending signals to the human mind. You start to wonder what impact that has on

02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:25.880
the g-factor. Modifying in small ways or in large ways, the functioning,

02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:33.400
the mechanical electrical chemical functioning of the brain.

02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:39.640
I look at everything about the brain. There are different levels of explanation.

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:46.840
On one hand, you have a behavioral level, but then you have brain circuitry and then you have

02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:56.440
neurons. And then you have dendrites. And then you have synapses. And then you have

02:32:57.480 --> 02:33:06.840
the neurotransmitters and the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminals. And then you have

02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:13.960
all the things that influence neurotransmitters. And then you have the individual differences

02:33:13.960 --> 02:33:25.160
among people. Yeah, it's complicated. But 51 million people in the United States have IQs

02:33:25.160 --> 02:33:36.600
under 85 and struggle with everyday life. Shouldn't that motivate people to take a look at this?

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:46.360
Yeah, but I just want to linger one more time that we have to remember that the science of

02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:54.920
intelligence, the measure of intelligence is only a part of the human condition. The thing

02:33:54.920 --> 02:34:03.000
that makes life beautiful and the creation of beautiful things in this world is perhaps loosely

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:11.240
correlated, but it's not dependent entirely on intelligence. Absolutely. I certainly agree with

02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:22.680
that. So for anyone sort of listening, I'm still not convinced that more intelligence is always

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:28.360
better if you want to create beauty in this world. I don't know. Well, I didn't say more

02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:34.280
intelligence is always better if you want to create beauty. I just said all things being equal,

02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:40.200
more is better than less. That's all I mean. Yeah, but that's sort of that I just want to

02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:47.800
sort of say because to me, one of the things that makes life great is the opportunity to create

02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:53.400
beautiful things. And so I just want to sort of empower people to do that no matter what

02:34:54.120 --> 02:35:00.520
some IQ test says. At the population level, we do need to look at IQ tests to help people.

02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:06.840
And to also inspire us to take on some of these extremely difficult scientific questions.

02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:13.080
Do you have advice for young people in high school, in college,

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:20.680
whether they're thinking about career or they're thinking about a life they can be proud of? Is

02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:28.760
there advice you can give? Whether they're in the they want to pursue psychology or biology

02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:32.760
or engineering or they want to be artists and musicians and poets?

02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:43.320
I can't advise anybody on that level of what their passion is. But I can't say if you're

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:48.840
interested in psychology or if you're interested in science and the science

02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:59.080
around the big questions of consciousness and intelligence and psychiatric illness.

02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:05.480
We haven't really talked about brain illnesses and what we might learn from,

02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:10.920
you know, if you are trying to develop a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease,

02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:19.560
you are trying to develop a drug to impact learning and memory, which are core to intelligence.

02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:26.520
So it could well be that the so-called IQ pill will come from a pharmaceutical company trying

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:31.320
to develop a drug for Alzheimer's disease. Because that's exactly what you're trying to do, right?

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:37.160
Yeah. Well, what will that what will that drug do in a college student that doesn't have Alzheimer's

02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:45.960
disease? So I would encourage people who are interested in psychology, who are interested in

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:58.440
science to pursue a scientific career and address the big questions. And the most important thing

02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:05.240
I can tell you, if you're going to be in kind of a research environment, is you got to follow

02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:10.440
the data where the data take you. You can't decide in advance where you want the data to go.

02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:15.160
And if the data take you to places that you don't have the technical expertise to follow,

02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:22.120
like, you know, I would like to understand more about molecular biology, but I'm not going to

02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:29.400
become a molecular biologist now, but I know people who are. And my job is to get them interested

02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:37.160
to take their expertise into this direction. And that it's not so easy, but and if the data

02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:42.440
takes you to a place that's controversial, that's counterintuitive in this world,

02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:54.040
no, I would say it's probably a good idea to still push forward boldly, but to communicate

02:37:54.040 --> 02:38:02.040
the interpretation of the results with skill, with compassion, with a greater

02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:08.120
breadth of understanding of humanity, not just the science of the impact of the results.

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:16.360
One famous psychologist wrote about this issue that somehow a balance has to be found between

02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:21.960
pursuing the science and communicating it with respect to people's sensitivities,

02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:29.480
the legitimate sensitivities. Somehow he didn't say how somehow somehow. And this is every part

02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:37.880
of that sentence somehow and balance is left up to the interpretation of the reader. Let me ask

02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:44.520
you, you said big questions, the biggest or one of the biggest. We already talked about

02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.360
consciousness and intelligence, one of the most fascinating, one of the biggest questions.

02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:54.440
But let's talk about the why. Why are we here? What's the meaning of life?

02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.120
Oh, I'm not going to tell you.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:02.600
You know, you're not going to tell me. This is very, I'm going to have to wait for your next book.

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:09.160
The meaning of life, you know, we do the best we can to get through the day.

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:16.680
And then there's just a finite number of the days. Are you, are you afraid of the

02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:24.760
finiteness of it? You think about it more and more as I get older. Yeah, I do. And it's one of

02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:33.800
these human things that it is finite. We all know it. Most of us deny it and don't want to think

02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:40.680
about it. Sometimes you think about it in terms of estate planning. You try to do the rational

02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:46.840
thing. Sometimes you, it makes you work harder because you know your time is more and more limited

02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:57.160
and you want to get things done. I don't know where I am on that. It is just one of those things

02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:02.120
that's always in the back of my mind. And I don't think that's uncommon.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:10.040
Well, it's just like g-factor and intelligence. It's a hard truth that's there. And sometimes

02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:15.240
you kind of walk past it and you don't want to look at it, but it's still there.

02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:23.640
Yeah. Yes, you can escape it. And think about the g-factor and intelligence is everybody

02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:33.240
knows this is true on a personal daily basis. Even if you think back to when you were in school,

02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:42.280
you know who the smart kids were. When you are on the phone talking to a customer service

02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:49.320
representative that in response to your detailed question is reading a script back to you and

02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:56.040
you get furious at this. Have you ever called this person a moron or wanted to call this person

02:40:56.040 --> 02:41:01.480
a moron? You're not listening to me. Everybody has had the experience of dealing with people

02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:09.160
who they think are not at their level. It's just common because that's the way human beings are.

02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:16.920
That's the way life is. But we also have a poor estimation of our own intelligence. We have a

02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:23.720
poor and we're not always a great. Our judgment of human character of other people is not as good

02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:34.760
as a battery of tests. That's where bias comes in. That's where our history, our emotions,

02:41:34.760 --> 02:41:40.680
all of that comes in. So people on the internet, there's such a thing as the internet and people

02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:49.160
on the internet will call each other dumb all the time. That's the worry here is that

02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:58.200
we give up on people. We put them in a bin just because of one interaction or some small

02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:03.560
number of interactions as if that's it. They're hopeless. That's just in their genetics. But

02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:11.320
I think no matter what the science here says, once again, that does not mean we should not

02:42:11.320 --> 02:42:18.600
have compassion for our fellow man. That's exactly what the science does say. It's not

02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:26.520
opposite of what the science is. Everything I know about psychology, everything I've learned

02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:34.440
about intelligence, everything points to the inexorable conclusion that you have to treat

02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:42.200
people as individuals respectfully and with compassion. Because through no fault of their own,

02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:49.400
some people are not as capable as others and you want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to come up

02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:57.320
with theories about why that might be true. Fine. I would like to fix some of it as best I can.

02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:05.080
And everybody is deserving of love. Richard, this is a good way to end it, I think.

02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:11.000
I'm just getting warmed up here. I know. I know you can go for another

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.520
many hours, but to respect your extremely valuable time, this is an amazing conversation.

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:23.240
Thank you for the teaching company, the lectures you've given with the

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:28.280
neuroscience of intelligence, just the work you're doing. It's a difficult topic. It's a

02:43:28.280 --> 02:43:35.000
topic that's controversial and sensitive to people and to push forward boldly. And in that nuanced way,

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.120
just thank you for everything you do. And thank you for asking the big questions of intelligence,

02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.480
of consciousness. Well, thank you for asking me. I mean, there's nothing like good conversation

02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:50.840
on these topics. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Hire. To support this

02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:55.800
podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:03.000
words from Albert Einstein. It is not that I'm so smart, but I stay with the questions much longer.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.960
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
