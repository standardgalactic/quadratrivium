0	5040	The following is a conversation with Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar-winning actor who
5040	11360	has starred in seven The Usual Suspects, American Beauty, and House of Cards.
11360	17140	He is one of the greatest actors ever, creating haunting performances of characters who often
17140	20920	embody the dark side of human nature.
20920	25960	Seven years ago, he was cut from House of Cards and canceled by Hollywood in the world when
25960	32520	Anthony Rapp made an allegation that Kevin Spacey sexually abused him in 1986.
32520	38920	Anthony Rapp then filed a civil lawsuit seeking $40 million.
38920	46280	In this trial, and all civil and criminal trials that followed, Kevin was acquitted.
46280	52280	He has never been found guilty nor liable in the court of law.
52280	57920	In this conversation, Kevin makes clear what he did and what he didn't do.
57920	63320	I also encourage you to listen to Kevin's Dan Wooten and Allison Pearson interviews
63320	69360	for additional details and responses to the allegations.
69360	76320	As an aside, let me say that one of the principles I operate under for this podcast and in life
76440	82520	is that I will talk with everyone, with empathy and with backbone.
82520	88040	For each guest, I hope to explore their life's work, life's story, and what and how they
88040	95160	think, and do so honestly and fully, the good, the bad, and the ugly, the brilliance, and
95160	96840	the flaws.
96840	103160	I won't whitewash their sins, but I won't reduce them to a worse possible caricature
103160	105200	of their sins either.
105200	110480	The latter is what the mass hysteria of internet mobs too often does, often rushing to a final
110480	113120	judgment before the facts are in.
113120	120560	I will try to do better than that, to respect due process, in service of the truth.
120560	125320	And I hope to have the courage to always think independently and to speak honestly, from
125320	130360	the heart, even when the eyes of the outraged mob are on me.
131000	136920	Again, my goal is to understand human beings, at their best and at their worst.
136920	143280	And hope is such an understanding leads to more compassion and wisdom in the world.
143280	151400	I will make mistakes, and when I do, I will work hard to improve.
151400	154840	I love you all.
154840	156480	This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
156480	160080	The support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
160080	164720	And now, dear friends, here's Kevin Spacey.
164720	168480	You played a serial killer in the movie Seven.
168480	175320	Your performance was one of, if not the greatest portrayal of a murderer on screen ever.
175320	177560	What was your process of becoming him?
177560	180080	John Doe, the serial killer.
180080	184960	The truth is, I didn't get the part.
184960	191600	I had been in Los Angeles making a couple of films, Swimming of Sharks and Usual Suspects.
191600	198160	And then I did a film called Outbreak that Morgan Freeman was in.
198160	209800	And I went in to audition for David Fincher in probably late November of 94.
209800	214080	And I auditioned for this part and didn't get it.
214080	217360	And I went back to New York.
217360	223960	And I think they started shooting like December 12th.
223960	224960	And I'm in New York.
224960	230120	I'm back in my wonderful apartment on West 12th Street, and my mom has come to visit
230120	231680	for Christmas.
231680	234440	And it's December 23rd.
234440	239040	And it's like seven o'clock at night, and my phone rings.
239040	243880	And it's Arnold Copelson, who's the producer of Seven.
243880	247840	And he's very jovial, and he's very friendly, and he says, how are you doing?
247840	248840	And I said, fine.
248840	252520	And he said, listen, do you remember that film you came in for, Seven?
252520	254040	And I said, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
254040	260280	He goes, well, it turns out that we hired an actor and we started shooting.
260280	264440	And then yesterday, David fired him.
264440	269360	And David would like you to get on a plane on Sunday and come to Los Angeles and start
269360	272560	shooting on Tuesday.
272560	281520	And I was like, OK, would it be imposing to say, can I read it again?
281520	285640	Because it's been a while now, and I'd like to.
285640	289040	So they sent a script over.
289040	291960	I read the script that night.
291960	296680	I thought about it.
296680	300040	And I had this feeling.
300040	309840	I can't even quite describe it, but I had this feeling that it would be really good
309840	314480	if I didn't take billing in the film.
314480	318560	And the reason I felt that was because I knew that by the time this film would come out,
318560	324360	it would be the last one of the three movies that I just shot, the fourth one.
324360	329880	And if any of those films broke through or did well, if it was going to be Brad Pitt
329880	334280	and Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, and you don't show up for the first
334280	338560	25, 30, 40 minutes, people are going to figure out who you're playing.
338560	345600	So people should know that you play the serial killer in the movie and the serial killer
345600	349120	shows up more than halfway through the movie.
349120	350120	Very late in the movie.
350120	355320	And when you say billing, it's like the posters, the VHS cover and everything.
355320	356320	You're gone.
356320	357320	You're not there.
357320	358320	Not there.
358320	364480	The Green Line Cinema told me to go fuck myself, that they absolutely could use my picture
364480	366400	and my image and all that.
366400	372120	And this became a little bit of a, I'd say, 24-hour conversation.
372120	376840	And it was Fincher who said, I actually think this is a really cool idea.
376840	384840	So the compromise was, I'm the first credit at the end of the movie when the credits start.
384840	391800	So I got on a plane on that Sunday and I flew to Los Angeles and I went into where they
391800	396320	were shooting and I went into the makeup room and David Fincher was there and we were talking
396320	404360	about what should I do, how should I look and I just had my hair short for outbreak
404360	411520	because I was playing a military character and I just looked at the hairdresser and I
411520	413160	said, do you have a razor?
413160	415800	And Fincher went, are you kidding?
415800	418200	And I said, no.
418200	422440	He goes, if you shave your head, I'll shave mine.
422440	426160	So we both shaved our heads.
426160	429440	And then I started shooting the next day.
429440	437600	So my long-winded answer to your question is that I didn't have that much time to think
437600	442120	about how to build that character.
442120	453120	What I think in the end Fincher was able to do so brilliantly with such terror was to set
453120	457760	the audience up to meet this character.
457760	464400	I think the last scene, the ending scene and the car ride leading up to it where it's mostly
464400	471800	on you in conversation with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is one of the greatest scenes
471800	473680	in film history.
473680	476080	So people somehow didn't see the movie.
476080	481120	There's these five murders that happen that are inspired by five of the seven deadly sins
481120	487960	and the ending scene is inspired, represents the last two deadly sins.
487960	496200	And there's this calm subtlety about you and your performance is just terrifying.
496200	504080	Maybe in contrast with Brad Pitt's performance, that's also really strong, but in the contrast
504080	510280	is the terrifying sense that you get in the audience that builds up to the twist at the
510280	516720	end or the surprise at the end with the famous What's in the Box from Brad Pitt.
517120	521240	Brad Pitt's character's wife, her head.
521240	522240	Yeah.
522240	527880	I can really only tell you that while we were shooting that scene in the car, while we were
527880	535640	out in the desert in that place where all those electrical wires were, David just kept
535640	541520	saying less, do less.
541520	550240	And I just tried to, I mean, I remember he kept saying to me, remember, you're in control.
550240	553800	Like you're going to win.
553800	560040	And knowing that should allow you to have tremendous confidence.
560040	570760	And I just followed that lead and I just think it's the kind of film that so many of
570760	577320	the elements that had been at work from the beginning of the movie, in terms of its style,
577320	582680	in terms of how he built this terror, in terms of how he built for the audience a sense of
582680	590360	this person being one of the scariest people they might ever encounter, it really allowed
590360	598760	me to be able to not have to do that much, just say the words and mean them.
598760	613000	And I think it also is, it's an example of what makes tragedy so difficult.
613000	618960	I mean, very often tragedy is people operating without enough information.
618960	622000	They don't have all the facts, Romeo and Juliet.
622000	623000	They don't have all the facts.
623000	628520	They don't know what we know as an audience.
629040	640200	So in the end, whether Brad Pitt's character ends up shooting John Doe or turning the gun
640200	645400	on himself, which was a discussion, I mean, there were a number of alternative endings
645400	649360	that were discussed.
649360	652960	Nothing ends up being tied up in a nice little bow.
652960	663840	It is complicated and shows how nobody wins in the end when you're not operating with
663840	665280	all the information.
665280	676200	When you say, say the words and mean them, what does mean them mean?
676200	685840	I've been very fortunate to be directed by Fincher a couple of times and he would say
685840	693440	to me sometimes, I don't believe a thing that is coming out of your mouth.
693440	697320	Shall we try it again?
697320	703040	And you go, okay, yeah, we can try it again.
703040	714520	And sometimes he'll do take and then you'll look to see if he has any added genius to hand
714520	715520	you.
715520	718760	And he just goes, let's do it again and then let's do it again.
718760	723960	And sometimes I say this in all humility.
723960	729120	He's literally trying to beat the acting out of you.
729120	732920	And by continually saying, do it again, do it again, do it again, and not giving you
732920	746120	any specifics, he is systematically shredding you of all pretense of all, because look,
746120	750120	very often, you know, actors would come in on the set and we've thought about the scene
750120	753480	and we've worked out, you know, I've got this prop and I'm gonna do this thing with a can
753480	758800	and you know, all these things, all the tea, I'm gonna do a thing with that thing.
758800	764680	And David is the kind of director where he just wants you to stop adding all that crap
764680	770880	and just say the words and say them quickly and mean them.
770880	774560	And it takes a while to get to that place.
774560	776200	I'll tell you a story.
776200	782120	This is a story I just love because it's in the exactly the same wheelhouse.
782120	786800	So Jack Lemmon's first movie was a film called It Should Happen to You and it was directed
786800	788040	by George Kuecher.
788040	793120	And Jack tells the story and it was just an incredibly charming story to hear Jack tell.
793120	798760	He said, so I'm doing his picture and let me tell you, this is a terrific part for me
798760	799840	and I'm doing a scene.
799840	800840	It's on my first day.
800840	803080	It's in my first day and it's a terrific scene.
803080	807320	And he goes, we do the first take and George Kuecher comes up to me and he says, Jack,
807320	811120	I said, yeah, he said, could you do, let's do another one, but just do a little less
811120	812120	in this one.
812120	815040	And Jack said, a little less, a little less than what I just did.
815040	816320	He said, yeah, just a little less.
816320	819440	So he goes, we do another take and I think, boy, that was it.
819440	821400	I mean, let's just go home.
821400	824360	And Kuecher walked up to him and said, Jack, let's do another one.
824360	827000	This time just a little bit less.
827000	830280	And Jack said, less than what I just did now.
830280	831520	He said, yeah, just a little bit less.
831520	832520	He goes, oh, okay.
832520	836240	So he did another take and Kuecher came up and he said, Jack, just a little bit less.
836240	839200	And Jack said, a little less than what I just did.
839200	840200	He said, yes.
840200	842200	He said, well, if I do any less, I'm not going to be acting.
842600	846080	And Kuecher said, exactly, Jack, exactly.
846840	852520	I mean, I guess what you're saying is it's extremely difficult to get to the bottom
852520	859240	of a little less because the power, if we just stick even on seven of your
859240	861920	performance is in the tiniest of subtleties.
862160	867000	Like when you say, oh, you didn't know, and you turn your head a little bit and
867000	875280	a little bit like the little bit, maybe a glimmer of a smile appears in your face.
875280	876240	That's subtlety.
876440	877280	That's less.
877880	879840	That's hard to get to, I suppose.
880040	880360	Yeah.
880960	888560	And also because I so well remember, I think the work that Brad did and also
888560	892160	Morgan did in that scene, but the work that Brad had to do, where he had to go.
892920	896480	I remember rehearsing with him as we were all staying at this little hotel
896480	897600	nearby that location.
897600	900440	And we rehearsed the night before we started shooting that sequence.
900440	909360	And I just, I mean, it was just incredible to see the levels of emotions he had to go
909360	913800	through and then the decision of what do I do?
915240	917760	Because if I do what he wants me to do, then he wins.
917760	921160	But if I don't do it, then I'm, what kind of a man, husband am I?
922360	924840	I just thought he did really incredible work.
924920	933120	So it was also not easy to not react to the power of what he was throwing at me.
934520	939200	I just thought it was an extraordinary, a really extraordinary scene.
939480	941040	So what's it like being in that scene?
941040	947440	So it's you, Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt is going over the top, just having
947440	953800	a mental breakdown and is weighing these extremely difficult moral choices, as you're
953800	961480	saying, but he's like screaming and in pain and tormented while you're very subtly smiling.
962600	966680	In terms of the writing and in terms of what the characters had to do is it was an
966680	975520	incredible culmination of how this character could manipulate in the way that he did.
975840	980840	And, and in the end, succeed.
981600	984280	You mentioned Fincher likes to do a lot of takes.
984280	987720	That's the, the famous thing about David Fincher.
988280	989960	So what are the pros and cons of that?
990480	994400	I think I read that he does some crazy amount.
994800	1001600	He averages 25 to 65 takes and most directors do less than 10.
1002560	1003080	So.
1003960	1005440	Yeah, sometimes it's timing.
1005440	1010040	Sometimes it's literally, he has a stopwatch and he's, he's timing it.
1010120	1012280	He's timing how long a scene is taking.
1013200	1018320	And then he'll say, you need to take a minute off this scene.
1020240	1022560	Like a minute, yeah, a minute off this scene.
1023200	1024920	I want it to move like this.
1025400	1026360	So let's pick it up.
1026400	1027280	Let's pick up the pace.
1027520	1029320	Let's take, let's see if we can take a minute off.
1029920	1030640	Why the speed?
1030640	1033600	Why, why say it fast is the important thing for him, you think?
1036720	1038960	I think because Fincher hates indulgence.
1041040	1047240	And he wants, he wants people to talk the way they do in life, which is, you know, we
1047240	1054560	don't take big dramatic pauses, you know, before we speak, we speak, we say what we want.
1054560	1055200	We, you know.
1056040	1060840	And I guess actors like the dramatic pauses and the, the, the indulge in the dramatic
1060840	1060880	pauses.
1060880	1062520	They didn't always like the dramatic pauses.
1062520	1066800	I mean, look, you didn't want to, you go back any student of acting, you go back to
1066800	1069320	the 30s and the 40s, 50s.
1071000	1077920	The speed at which actors spoke, not just in the comedies, which of course, you know,
1077920	1082520	you look at any Preston Sturges movie and it's incredible how fast people are talking
1082520	1087440	and how, and how funny things are when they happen that fast.
1089280	1092360	But then, you know, acting styles changed.
1092360	1099160	We got into a different kind of thing in the late fifties and sixties and, and, you know,
1099200	1105240	a lot of actors are feeling it, which is, I'm not saying it's, it's a, it's a bad thing.
1105240	1114360	It's just that if you want to keep an audience engaged as Fincher does, and I believe
1114400	1127520	successfully does in all of his work, pace, timing, movement, clarity, speed are admirable
1128160	1128840	to achieve.
1129440	1133920	And all of that, he wants the actor to be as natural as possible, to strip away all
1133920	1137920	the bullshit of acting and become human.
1138360	1140200	Look, I've been lucky with other directors.
1140200	1141760	Sam Mendes is similar.
1142240	1146240	I remember when I walked in to maybe the first rehearsal for Richard, the third that
1146240	1154240	we were doing, I had brought with me a canopy of, of ailments that my Richard was
1154240	1161640	going to suffer from, and Sam, you know, eventually whittled it down to like three,
1161640	1165120	like maybe your arm and maybe thing, and maybe your leg.
1165320	1169480	But let's get rid of the other 10 things that you brought into the room because I was,
1169480	1172880	you know, I was so excited to, you know, capture this character.
1172880	1179480	So, you know, very often, Trevor, known as this way, a lot, a lot of wonderful directors
1179520	1185120	I've worked with, they're really good at helping you trim and edit.
1186280	1192440	David Fincher said about you, he's talking in general, I think, but also specifically
1192440	1197760	in the moment of House of Cards said that you have exceptional skill both as an actor
1197800	1202480	and as a performer, which he says are different things.
1202760	1206920	So he defines the former as dramatization of a text and the latter as the
1206960	1208400	seduction of an audience.
1209600	1214320	Do you see wisdom in that distinction?
1214400	1219840	And what does it take to do both the dramatization of a text and the seduction of an audience?
1220880	1223160	Those are two very interesting descriptions.
1225120	1232080	When I think, I guess when I think performer, I tend to think entertaining.
1232080	1235040	I tend to think, I tend to think comedy.
1235040	1236840	I tend to think winning over an audience.
1236840	1248160	I tend to think that there's something about that quality of wanting to have people enjoy
1248160	1249160	themselves.
1251360	1261000	And when you saddle that against what maybe he means as an actor, which is more dramatic
1261000	1273080	or more text driven, more, look, I've always believed that my job, not every actor feels
1273080	1277120	this way, but my job, the way that I've looked at it is that my job is to serve the writing.
1279720	1286520	And that if I serve the writing, I will in a sense serve myself because I'll be in the
1286520	1290280	right world, I'll be in the right context, I'll be in the right style.
1291000	1297080	I'll have embraced what a director's, you know, it's not my painting.
1297080	1298240	It's someone else's painting.
1298240	1300440	I'm a series of colors and someone else's painting.
1301600	1312440	And the barometer for me has always been that when people stop me and talk to me about a
1312440	1320360	character I've played and reference their name as if they actually exist, that's when I feel
1320360	1322120	like I've gotten close to doing my job.
1323880	1329000	Yeah, one of the challenges for me in this conversation is remembering that your name is
1329000	1338360	Kevin, not Frank or John or any of these characters because they live deeply in the psyche.
1338440	1346680	To me, that's the greatest compliment for me as an actor.
1349000	1350840	I love being able to go.
1350840	1359960	I mean, when I think about performers who inspire me and I remember when I was young
1359960	1366040	and I was introduced to Spencer Tracey, Henry Fonda, Catherine Hepburn,
1367080	1368680	I just, I believed who they were.
1368680	1369720	I knew nothing about them.
1369720	1374600	They were just these extraordinary characters doing this extraordinary stuff.
1375160	1384600	And then I think more recently contemporary when I think of the work that Philip Seymour
1384600	1391960	Hoffman did and Heath Ledger and people that when I think about what they could be doing,
1391960	1396200	what they could do, what they would have done had they stayed with us.
1398440	1405480	I'm so excited when I go into a cinema or I go into a play and I completely am taken
1406360	1412840	to some place that I believe exists and characters that become real.
1412840	1416920	And those characters become lifelong companions.
1416920	1421800	Like for me, they travel with you and even if it's the darkest aspects of human nature,
1421800	1422520	they're always there.
1424760	1431720	I feel like I almost met them and gotten to know them and gotten to become friends with them almost,
1431720	1434280	Hannibal Lecter or Forrest Gump.
1435240	1439080	I mean, I feel like I'm like best friends with Forrest Gump.
1439080	1443080	I know the guy and I guess he's played by some guy named Tom,
1443080	1445400	but like Forrest Gump is the guy I'm friends with.
1447080	1450760	And I think everybody feels like that when they're in the audience with great characters.
1450760	1456680	They just kind of, they become part of you in some way, the good, the bad and the ugly of them.
1458040	1467000	One of the things that I feel that I try to do in my work is when I read something for the first
1467000	1477160	time, when I read a script or play, and I am absolutely devastated by it.
1477160	1483800	It is, it is the most extraordinary, the most beautiful, the most life affirming or terrifying.
1486120	1494440	It's then a process weirdly of working backwards because I want to work in such a way that
1494440	1497720	that's the experience I give to the audience when they first see it,
1498600	1502200	that they have the experience I had when I read it.
1503720	1506520	I remember that there's been times in the creative process when
1508280	1511960	something was pointed out to me or something was, I remember I was doing a play
1512680	1519080	and I was having this really tough time with one of the last scenes in the play and I just
1519080	1523720	couldn't figure it out. I was in rehearsal and although we had a director in that play,
1523800	1527800	I called another friend of mine who was also a director and I had him come over and I said,
1527800	1532920	look, this scene, I'm just having the toughest. I cannot seem to crack this scene.
1533960	1538680	We read it through a couple of times and then this wonderful director named John Swanbeck
1539400	1541640	who would eventually direct me in a film called The Big Kahuna.
1542280	1546920	But this is before that, he said to me the most incredible thing he just said,
1548120	1553000	all right, what's the last line you have in this scene before you fall over and fall asleep?
1553000	1560040	And I said, the last line is that last drink, the old KO. And he went, okay,
1561640	1567720	I want you to think about what that line actually means and then work backwards.
1570040	1576440	And so he left and I sort of was left with this, what? Like, what does that mean? How am I supposed
1577720	1580760	to? And then like a couple of days went by, a couple of days went by and I thought,
1580760	1588120	okay, so I said, what does that line actually mean? Well, that last drink, the old KO. KO
1589480	1599400	is knockout, which is a boxing term. It's the only boxing term the writer uses in the play.
1600040	1608440	And then I went back and I realized my friend was so smart and so incredible to have said,
1608440	1613480	ask a question you haven't thought of asking yet. I realized that the playwright wrote
1614040	1620840	the last round, the eighth round between these two brothers, and it was a fight, physical as
1620840	1625320	well as emotional. And when I brought that into the rehearsal room to the directors doing that play,
1626440	1632040	he liked that idea. And we staged that scene as if it was the eighth round, although the audience
1632040	1638600	wouldn't have known that. But just what I loved about that was that somebody said to me,
1640360	1644200	ask yourself a question you haven't asked yourself yet. What does that line mean and
1644200	1651640	then work backwards? What is that like a catalyst for thinking deeply about what is
1651640	1656360	magical about this play, this story, this narrative? That's what that is, like thinking
1656360	1661400	backwards, that's what that does? Yeah. But also because it's this incredible,
1663240	1667320	why didn't I think to ask that question myself? That's what you have directors for, that's what
1667320	1673960	you have. So many places where ideas can come from. But that just illustrates that even though in
1673960	1679880	my brain I go, I always like to work backwards. I missed it in that one and I'm very grateful to
1680760	1687640	to my friend for having pushed me into being able to realize what that meant and
1688600	1696120	to ask the interesting question. I like the poetry and the humility of I'm just a series
1696120	1703800	of collars in someone else's painting. That was a good line. That said, you've talked about
1703800	1708920	improvisation. You said that it's all about the ability to do it again and again and again and
1708920	1715080	yet never make it the same. And you also just said that you're trying to stay true to the text.
1715800	1722520	So where's the room for the improvisation? That it's never the same? Well, there's two
1722520	1730520	slightly different contexts, I think. One is in the rehearsal room, improvisation can be a wonderful
1730520	1737880	device. I mean, Sam Mendes, for example, will start, he'll start a scene and he does this wonderful
1737880	1745000	thing. He brings rugs and he brings chairs and sofas in and he says, well, let's put two chairs
1745000	1749480	here and here. You guys, let's start in these chairs far apart from each other. Let's see what
1749480	1753720	happens with the scene if you're that far apart. And so we'll do the scene that way and then he
1753720	1759560	goes, okay, let's bring a rug in and let's bring these chairs much closer and let's see what happens
1759560	1767160	if the space between you is. And so then you try it that way. And then it's a little harder in
1767160	1776680	Shakespeare to improv. But in any situation where you want to try and see where could a scene go,
1776680	1780440	where would the scene go if I didn't make that choice? Where would the scene go if I made this
1780440	1785640	choice? Where would the scene go if I didn't say that or I said something else? So that's how improv
1785640	1801320	can be a valuable process to learn about limits and boundaries and what's going on with a character
1801320	1809000	that somehow you discover in trying something that isn't on the page. Then there's the different
1809000	1814680	thing which is the trying to make it fresh and trying to make it new. And that is really a
1814680	1827080	reference to theater. I'll put it to you this way. Anybody loves sports, right? So you go and you
1827080	1834280	watch on a pitch, you watch on a tennis game, you watch basketball, you watch football. Yeah,
1834280	1839320	the rules are the same. But it's a different game every time you're out on that court or on that field.
1840200	1854600	It's no different in theater. Yes, it's the same lines. Maybe even blocking is similar. But what's
1854600	1864600	different is attack, intention, how you are growing in a role and watching your fellow actors grow in
1865560	1871960	theirs and how every night it's a new audience and they're reacting differently. And you literally,
1872840	1883640	where you can go from week one of performances in a play to week 12 is extraordinary. And the
1883640	1891480	difference between theater and film is that no matter how good someone might think you are in a
1891560	1900120	movie, you'll never be any better. It's frozen. Whereas I can be better tomorrow night than I
1900120	1909880	was tonight. I can be better in a week than I was tonight. It is a living, breathing, shifting,
1909880	1918040	changing, growing thing every single day. But also in theater, there's no safety net. If you fuck it up,
1919000	1923480	everybody gets to see you do that. And if you start giggling on stage, everyone gets to see you
1923480	1932680	do that too, which I am very guilty of. I mean, there is something of a seduction of an audience
1932680	1940040	in theater even more intense than there is when you're talking about film. I got a chance to watch
1940040	1946280	the documentary now in the wings on a world stage, which is behind the scenes of you mentioned
1947240	1951880	you teaming up with Sam Mendes in 2011 to stage Richard III,
1954040	1957080	a play by William Shakespeare. I was also surprised to learn
1958120	1963960	you haven't really done much Shakespeare, or at least you said that in the movie. But there's
1963960	1968760	a lot of interesting behind the scenes stuff there. First of all, the camaraderie of everybody,
1968760	1973640	how like the bond theater creates, especially when you're traveling.
1974680	1978840	But the another interesting thing you mentioned with the chairs of Sam Mendes trying different
1978840	1984120	stuff. It seemed like everybody was really open to trying stuff, embarrassing themselves,
1984120	1992280	taking risks, all that. I suppose that's part of acting in general, but theater especially.
1992280	1996280	Just take risks. It's okay to embarrass a shit out of yourself, including the director.
1997240	2005480	And it's also because you become a family. It's unlike a movie where I might have a scene with
2005480	2009240	so and so on this day and then another scene with them in a week and a half,
2009240	2014040	and then that's the only scenes we have in the whole movie together. Every single day
2015160	2020680	when you show up in the rehearsal room, it's the whole company. You're all up for it every day.
2020760	2029480	You're learning, you're growing, you're trying, and there is an incredible trust that happens.
2030520	2035720	And I was of course fortunate that some of the things I learned and observed about
2037960	2041880	being a part of that family, being included in that family and being a part of creating that
2041880	2048360	family, I was able to observe from people like Jack Lemmon who led many companies that I was
2048360	2055400	fortunate to work in and be a part of. There's also a sad moment where at the end,
2055400	2060280	everybody is really sad to say goodbye because you do form a family and then it's over.
2061880	2065000	I guess somebody said that that's just part of theater. It's like,
2066120	2069080	I mean, they should kind of assume goodbye and that this is it.
2070200	2075000	Yeah, and also there are sometimes when like six months later, I'll wake up
2075080	2079160	middle of the night and I'll go, that's how to play that scene.
2081560	2084280	Oh God, I just finally figured it out.
2085640	2090040	So maybe you could speak a little bit more to that. What's the difference between film acting and
2090040	2095400	live theater acting? I don't really think there is any. I think there's just,
2097640	2103320	you eventually learn about yourself on film, you know, when I first did like my first
2103560	2110840	episode of The Equalizer, you know, it's just horrible. It's just so bad,
2111880	2117160	but I didn't know about myself. I didn't slowly begin to learn about yourself, but
2118280	2123960	I think good acting is good acting. And I think that, you know, if a camera's right here, you
2123960	2130200	know that your front row is also your back row. You just don't have to do so much.
2130200	2139000	There is in theater a particular kind of energy, almost like an athlete,
2139560	2145960	that you have to have vocally to be able to get up seven performances a week and never lose your
2145960	2149480	voice and always be there and always be alive and always be doing the best work you can,
2150040	2153880	that you just don't require in film. You know, you don't have to have the same,
2154120	2163640	it just doesn't require the same kind of stamina that doing a play does.
2164360	2169640	It just feels like also in theater, you have to become the character more intensely because
2170600	2174440	you can't take a break. You can't take a bathroom break. You're like on stage.
2175000	2179400	There's no, this is you. Yeah, but you have no idea what's going on on stage with the actors.
2179400	2186440	I mean, I have literally laughed through speeches that I had to give because
2186440	2191400	my fellow actors were putting carrots up their nose or broccoli in their ears or doing whatever
2191400	2195960	they were doing to make me laugh. So they're just having fun. They're having the time of their life.
2195960	2201640	And by the way, Judy Dench is the worst giggler of all. I mean, they had to bring the curtain down
2201640	2207160	on her and Maggie Smith because they were laughing so hard, they could not continue the play.
2207160	2210760	So even when you're doing like a dramatic monologue still, they're still fucking with you.
2210760	2216920	There's stuff. Okay, that's great. That's good to know. You also said an interesting line that
2216920	2229560	improvisation helps you learn about the character. Can you explain that? So like through maybe playing
2229560	2235480	with the different ways of saying the words or the different ways to bring the words to life,
2236040	2239640	you get to learn about yourself, about the character you're playing.
2239640	2249320	It can be helpful. But improv is, I'm such a big believer in the writing and in serving the writing
2249320	2256280	and doing the words the writer wrote. That improv for me, unless you're just doing like
2256280	2262600	comedy and you know, like, I mean, I love improv and in comedy, it's brilliant. So much fun to
2262600	2268760	watch people just come up with something right there. But that's where you're looking for laughs
2268760	2276920	and you're specifically in a little scene that's being created. But I think improv has had value.
2279640	2289720	But I have not experienced it as much in doing plays as I have sometimes in doing film where
2290040	2295320	you'll start off rehearsing and a director may say, let's just go off book and see what happens.
2295960	2301800	And I've had moments in film where someone went off book and it was terrifying.
2305000	2307480	There was a scene I had in Glen Gary Glen Ross
2310040	2317640	where the character I play has fucked something up, just screwed something up and Pacino is livid.
2317960	2325720	And so we had the scene where Al is walking like this and the camera is moving with him
2326680	2336120	and he is chewing me a new asshole. And in the middle of the take Al starts talking about me.
2338280	2345880	Oh, Kevin, you don't think we know how you got this job? You don't think we know
2345880	2351080	who's dick you've been sucking on to get this part in this movie? And I'm now,
2352600	2359400	I'm literally like, I don't know what the hell is happening, but I'm reacting.
2361240	2368760	We got to the end of that take. Al walked up to me and went, oh, that was so good. Oh my god,
2368760	2374360	that was so good. Just so you know, the sound, I asked them not to record. So you have no dialogue.
2374360	2381480	So it's just me. Oh, that was so good. You look like a car wreck. And I was like, yeah.
2383240	2390680	And it was actually an incredibly generous thing that he gave me so that I would react.
2391720	2398520	Oh, wow. Did they use that shot? Because you were in the shot. It was my close-up.
2398760	2403000	Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, that's the take. That was an intense, right? I mean,
2403000	2408520	what was it like if we can just linger on that, just that intense scene with Al Pacino?
2410040	2414920	Well, he's the reason I got the movie. A lot of people might think because Jack was in the film
2414920	2419480	that he had something to do with it. But actually, I was doing a play called Lost in Yonkers on
2419480	2424440	Broadway. And we had the same dresser who worked with him, a girl named Laura. It was wonderful.
2425400	2433160	Laura Beattie. And she told Al that he should come and see this play because she wanted to see
2433160	2440040	me in this play. I was playing this gangster's fun, fun, fun part. So I didn't know Pacino came
2440040	2445160	on some night and saw this play. And then like three days later, I got a call to come in and
2445160	2450120	auditioned for this Glenn Gray, Glenn Ross, which of course I knew is a play, David Mambis play.
2450840	2459400	And then I auditioned. Jamie Foley was the director who would eventually direct a bunch of House of
2459400	2466440	Cards. Wonderful, wonderful guy. And I got the part. Well, I didn't quite get the part. They were
2466440	2471880	going to bring together the actors that they thought they were going to give the parts to on a Saturday
2471880	2477000	at Al's office. And they asked me if I would come and do a read through. And I said, who's going to
2477960	2482280	be there? And they said, well, so-and-so-and-so-and-so-and-so. And Jack Lemon is flying in. And I said,
2482280	2487560	don't tell Mr. Lemon that I'm doing the read through. Is that possible? And I'm like, sure.
2488120	2494200	So I'll never forget this. Jack was sitting in the chair in Pacino's office doing the New
2494200	2499880	York Times crossword puzzle as he did every day. And I walked in the door and he went, oh, Jesus
2499880	2505640	Christ. Is it possible you could get a job without me? Jesus Christ. I'm so tired of holding up your
2505640	2515080	end of it. Oh my God. Jesus Christ. So I got the job because of Pacino. And it was really one of the
2515080	2521480	first major roles that I ever had in a film. And to be working with that group.
2522360	2529960	Yeah, that's one of the greatest ensemble casts ever. We got Al Pacino, Jack Lemon,
2530760	2539960	Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, you, Jonathan Price. It's just incredible. And I would have to
2539960	2545240	say, I mean, maybe you can comment. You've talked about how much of a mentor and a friend Jack
2545240	2550040	Lemon has been. That's one of his greatest performances ever. Ever. You have a scene at
2550040	2555400	the end of the movie with him. That was really powerful. Like firing on all cylinders. You're
2556360	2562520	playing the stain to perfection. And he's playing desperation to perfection.
2563480	2568360	What a scene. What was that like? Just like at the top of your game, the two of you. Well,
2568360	2574120	by that time, we had done Long Day's Journey Tonight in the theater. We'd done a mini series
2574120	2581000	called The Murder of Mary Fagan on NBC. We'd done a film called Dad, that Gary David Goldberg directed
2581960	2588360	with Ted Danson. So this was the fourth time we were working together and we knew each other.
2588360	2595160	We'd become, he'd become my father figure. And I don't know if you know that I originally met
2595160	2601160	Jack Lemon when I was very, very young. He was doing a production at the Mark Taper
2601160	2606840	Forum of a Chateau Casey play called Juno and the Peacock with Walter Matthew and Maureen Stapleton.
2606840	2616360	And on a Saturday in December of 1974, my junior high school drama class went to a workshop. It was
2616360	2623080	called How to Audition. And we did this workshop. Many schools in Southern California were part
2623080	2627640	of this Drama Teachers Association. So we got these incredible experiences of being able to go
2627640	2632680	see professional productions and be involved in these workshops or festivals. So I had to get up
2632680	2639320	and do a monologue in front of Mr. Lemon when I was 13 years old. And he walked up to me at the
2639320	2643640	end of that and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said, that was a touch of terrific. He said,
2643640	2648200	no, everything I've been talking about, you just did. What's your name? I said, Kevin, he said,
2648200	2651480	let me tell you something. When you get finished with high school, as I'm sure you're going to go
2651480	2655080	on and do theater, you should go to New York and you should study to be an actor because this is
2655080	2664920	what you're meant to do with your life. And he was like an idol. And 12 years later, I read in
2664920	2668760	the New York Times that he was coming to Broadway to do this production of A Long Day's Journey
2668760	2675880	tonight, a year and some months after I read this article, and I was like, I'm going to play Jamie in
2675880	2684600	that production. And I then, with a lot of opposition, the cast and director didn't want to
2684600	2692120	see me. They said that the director, Jonathan Miller, wanted movie actors to play the two sons.
2693960	2700280	And ultimately, I found out that Jonathan Miller, the director, was coming to New York to do a
2700280	2708680	series of lectures at Alice Tully Hall. And I went to try to figure out how I could maybe meet him.
2709960	2716760	And I was sitting in that theater listening to this incredible lecture he was doing, and sitting
2716760	2725160	next to me was an elderly woman. I mean, elderly, 80 something, and she was asleep.
2725960	2735400	But sticking out of her handbag, which was on the floor, was an invitation to a cocktail reception
2735400	2744600	on her, Dr. Jonathan Miller. And so I thought, you know, she's tired. She's probably going to go home.
2745000	2753000	So I took that and walked into this cocktail reception, and ultimately went over to Dr. Miller,
2753000	2759000	who was incredibly kind, and said, sit down, always very curious, what brings young people
2759000	2764920	to my lectures? And I said to him, Eugene O'Neill brought me here. And he was like, what? I've always
2764920	2771640	wanted to meet him. Where is he? And I told him that I'd been trying for seven months to get
2772040	2779320	an audition for a long day's journey, and that his American cast directors were telling my agents
2779320	2784760	that he wanted big American movie stars. And at that moment, he turned and he saw
2785720	2791480	one of those cast directors who was there that night. So I knew he was going to be in New York
2791480	2799240	starting auditions that week. And she was staring daggers at me. And he just got it.
2800200	2805320	And he said, someone have a pen. And he took the paper and started writing. He said, listen,
2805320	2810040	Kevin, there are many situations in which casting directors have a lot of say and a lot of power
2810040	2814440	and a lot of leverage. And then there are other situations where they just take directors' messages.
2814440	2817960	And on this one, they're taking my messages. This is where I'm staying. Make sure you people get to
2817960	2825240	me. We start auditions on Thursday. And on Thursday, I had an opportunity to come in and audition
2826120	2834120	for this play that I've been working on and preparing. And at the end of it, I did four scenes
2834120	2838920	at the end of it. He said to me that unless someone else came in and blew him against the wall,
2838920	2843960	like I had just done, as far as he was concerned, I pretty much had the part, but I couldn't tell
2843960	2849320	my agents that yet because I had to come back and read with Mr. Lemon. And so three months later,
2849320	2857320	in August of 1985, I found myself in a room with Jack Lemon again at 890 Broadway, which is where
2857320	2863160	they rehearsed a lot of Broadway plays. And we did four scenes together and I was toppling over him.
2863160	2869640	I was pushing him. I was relentless. And I'll never forget at the end of that.
2873320	2877160	Lemon came over to me. He put his hand on my shoulder and he said, that would you touch it?
2877160	2881080	Terrific. I never thought we'd find the rotten kid, but he's it. Jesus Christ, what the hell was that?
2883400	2891480	And I ended up spending the next year of my life with that man. So it turns out he was right.
2894360	2901880	Yeah. This world works in mysterious ways. It also speaks to the fact of the power of somebody
2901880	2907960	you look up to giving words of encouragement, because those can just reverberate through your
2907960	2914920	whole life and just make the path clear. I've always, we used to joke that if every
2914920	2918440	contract came with a Jack Lemon clause, it would be a more beautiful world.
2920120	2926520	Beautifully said. Jack Lemon is one of the greatest actors ever. What do you think makes him so damn good?
2927400	2929400	Wow.
2935640	2945480	I think he truly set out in his life to accomplish what his father said to him on his deathbed.
2947240	2951080	His father was died. His father was, by the way, called the Donut King in Boston.
2951400	2958600	And not in the entertainment business at all. He was literally owned a donut company. And
2960280	2964280	when he was passing away, Jack said, the last thing my father said to me was,
2965160	2973480	go out there and spread a little sunshine. And I truly think that's what Jack loved to do.
2973480	2986040	I remember this, and I don't know if this will answer your question, but I think it's revealing
2986040	2993640	about what he's able to do and what he was able to do and how that ultimately influenced what I
2993640	2999960	was able to do. Sam Endes had never directed a film before American Beauty.
3002120	3009640	And so what he did was he took the best elements of theater and applied them to the process. So we
3009640	3015160	rehearsed it like a play in a soundstage where everything was laid out like it would be in a
3015160	3024600	play and this couch will be here. And he'd sent me a couple of tapes. He'd sent me two cassette
3024600	3031560	tapes, one that he'd like to call pre-Lester before he begins to move in a new direction,
3031560	3039080	and then post-Lester. And they just were different songs. And then he said to me one day, and I
3039080	3045240	think always thought this was brilliant of Sam to use lemon, knowing what lemon meant to me.
3046600	3051640	He said, when was the last time you watched The Apartment? I said, I don't know. I mean,
3052200	3055880	I love that movie so much because I want you to watch it again and then let's talk.
3058360	3063480	So I went and I watched the movie again and we sat down and Sam said,
3063640	3073320	what lemon does in that film is incredible because there is never a moment in the movie
3074200	3084200	where we see him change. He just evolves. And he becomes the man he becomes because
3084200	3089720	of the experiences that he has through the course of the film. But there's this remarkable
3089720	3096680	consistency in who he becomes. And that's what I need you to do is Lester. I don't want the
3096680	3105000	audience to ever see him change. I want him to evolve. And so we did some, I mean, first of all,
3105000	3111320	it was just a great direction. And then second of all, we did some things that people don't know
3111320	3121640	we did to aid that gradual shift of that man's character. First of all, I had to be in the
3121640	3126040	best shape from the beginning of the movie because we didn't shoot it in sequence. So
3126840	3133080	I was in this crazy shape. I had this wonderful trainer named Mike Torsche who just was incredible.
3133640	3141880	But so what we did was in order to then show this gradual shift was I had three different
3141880	3150120	hairpieces. I had three different kinds of costumes of different colors and sizes. And I had different
3150120	3158520	makeup. So in the beginning, I was wearing a kind of drab, dull, slightly, you know,
3158520	3165080	uninspired hairpiece. And my makeup was kind of gray and boring. And I was a little bit,
3165080	3169560	there were times when I was like too much like this and Sam would go, Kevin, you look like
3169560	3173640	Walter Mathau, would you please stand up a little bit? We're sort of midway through at this point.
3174600	3182760	And then at a certain point, the wig changed and it had little highlights in it, a little more
3182760	3189160	color, a little more, the makeup became a little, the suits got a little tighter. And then finally,
3189160	3196280	a third wig that was golden highlights and sunshine and, and, you know, rosy cheeks and tight fit.
3196920	3200680	And these are what we call theatrical tricks. You know, this is, this is how you,
3201240	3207720	an audience doesn't even know it's happening. But it is this gradual. And I just always felt that
3207720	3217480	that was such a brilliant way because he knew what I felt about Jack. And when you watch the
3217480	3224520	apartment, it is extraordinary that he doesn't ever change. He just, so I'm, I'm,
3224520	3242120	and in fact, I, I thanked Jack when I won the Oscar. And I, I did my thank you speech and I
3242120	3247080	walked off stage and I remember I had to sit down for a moment because I didn't want to go,
3247080	3250840	I didn't want to go to the press room because I wanted to see if Sam was going to win.
3251800	3258840	And so I was waiting and my phone rang and it was lemon. He said, you're a son of a bitch.
3260040	3265720	I said, I said, what? He goes, do you, first of all, congratulations and thanks for thanking me
3265720	3269400	because, you know, God knows you couldn't have done it without me. He said, second of all,
3269960	3275400	he said, you know how long it took me to win from supporting actor. I won it for Mr. Roberts and
3275400	3279640	it took me like 10, 12 years to win Oscar. You did it in four, you son of a bitch.
3281800	3288920	Yeah. The apartment was, I mean, it's widely considered one of the greatest movies ever.
3290760	3295640	People sometimes refer to it as a comedy, which is an interesting kind of classification.
3296200	3302120	I suppose that's a lesson about comedy that the best, the best comedy is the one that's
3302120	3306440	basically a tragedy. Well, I mean, some people think Clockwork Orange is a comedy.
3307320	3311880	And I'm not saying there are some good laughs in Clockwork Orange, but yeah, you know, it's...
3312760	3318920	I mean, yeah. What's that line between comedy and tragedy for you?
3323080	3331640	Well, if it's a line, it's a line I cross all the time because I've tried always to find the humor
3332440	3342760	unexpected sometimes, maybe inappropriate sometimes, maybe shocking, but I've tried and
3342760	3351640	I think almost every dramatic role I've had to have a sense of humor and to be able to bring
3352520	3358760	that along with everything else that is serious. Because frankly,
3358840	3366200	that's how we deal with stuff in life, you know? I think Sam Mendes actually said in the
3366200	3374440	now documentary something like, with great theater, with great stories, you find humor
3375080	3381480	on the journey to the heart of darkness, something like this. Very poetic, it stood out to me.
3381480	3386120	Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't be that poetic. I'm very sorry. But it's true. I mean,
3387080	3390440	the people I've interacted in this world have been to a war zone and
3392440	3398040	the ones who have lost the most and have suffered the most are usually the ones who are able to
3400040	3405880	make jokes the quickest and the jokes are often dark and absurd and cost every single line,
3406440	3410440	no political correctness, all of that. Sure. Well, I mean, you know, it's like
3411400	3417080	the Great Mary Tyler Moore show where they can't stop giggling at the clown's funeral. I mean,
3417080	3423640	it's just one of the great episodes ever. Giggling at a funeral is as bad as farting at a funeral
3423640	3433000	and I'm sure that there's some people who've done both. Oh, man. So you mentioned American beauty
3433320	3442280	and the idea of not changing but evolving. That's really interesting because that movie is about
3442920	3449320	like finding yourself. So it's a philosophically profound movie. It's about various characters
3449320	3458120	in their own ways, finding their own identity in a world where maybe a system, a materialistic
3458120	3463400	system that wants you to be like everyone else. And so, I mean, Lester just really transforms
3463400	3468840	himself throughout the movie and you're saying the challenge there is to still be the same human
3468840	3481960	being fundamentally. Yeah, and I also think that the film was powerful because you had three
3482920	3492200	very honest and genuine portrayal of young people and then you had Lester behaving like a young
3492200	3503720	person, doing things that were unexpected. And I think that the honesty with which it dealt with
3503720	3509240	those issues that those teenagers were going through and the honesty with which it dealt with
3509240	3517720	what Lester was going through, I think are some of the reasons why the film had the response that
3517720	3526120	it did from so many people. I mean, I used to get stopped and someone would say to me,
3527240	3532920	when I first saw American beauty, I was married. And the second time I saw it, I wasn't.
3533080	3539720	And I was like, well, we weren't trying to increase the divorce rate. It wasn't our intention, but
3540520	3551960	it is interesting how so many people have those kinds of crazy fantasies. And what I
3553480	3557960	admired so much about who Lester was as a person, why I wanted to play him is because in the end,
3558760	3564680	he makes the right decision. I think a lot of people live lives of quiet desperation
3566440	3576280	in a job they don't like. In a marriage they're unhappy in and to see somebody
3577560	3584440	living that life and then saying, fuck it in every way possible. And not just in a cynical way,
3584440	3591640	but in a way that opens Lester up to see the beauty in the world. That's the beauty in American
3591640	3598280	beauty. Well, you may have to blackmail your boss to get there, but you know. And in that,
3598280	3607080	there's a bunch of humor also. In the anger and the absurdity of taking a stand against the
3607080	3614760	conformity of life, there's this humor. And I read somewhere that the scene, the dinner scene,
3614760	3624280	which is kind of play-like, where Lester slams the plate against the wall, was improvised by you,
3625960	3631400	the slamming of the plate against the wall. No. No. Absolutely. The internet lies once again.
3631480	3640600	Absolutely written and directed. Can't take credit for that.
3640600	3645880	The plate. Okay. Well, that was a genius interaction there. There's something about the
3645880	3651240	dinner table and losing your shit at the dinner table. Having a fight and losing your shit at the
3651240	3659720	dinner table. Where else? Yellowstone was another situation where there's a family
3660280	3665080	at the dinner table and then one of them says, fucking, I'm not eating this anymore and I'm
3665080	3670840	going to create a scene. Right. It's a beautiful kind of environment for dramatic scenes.
3670840	3677400	Or Nicholson in The Shining. There's some family scenes gone awry in that movie.
3677400	3680600	The contrast between you and Annette Benning in that scene
3683080	3689000	creates the genius of that scene. So how much of acting is the dance between two actors?
3690280	3701720	Well, with Annette, I just adored working with her. And we were the two actors that Sam wanted
3701720	3708680	from the very beginning, much against the will of the higher ups who wanted other actors to
3708680	3719320	play those roles. But I've known Annette since we did a screen test together from Milos Forman
3719960	3725640	for a film he did of the Les Léves-en-Dangerous movie. It was a different film from that one,
3725640	3731960	but it was the same story. And I've always thought she is just remarkable. And I think that
3732920	3740840	the work she did in that film, the relationship that we were able to build,
3743720	3749320	for me, the saddest part of that success was that she didn't win the Oscar,
3750120	3757240	and I felt she should have. What kind of interesting direction did you get from Sam
3757320	3764280	and how you approached playing Lester and how to take on the different scenes?
3764280	3766680	There's a lot of just brilliant scenes in that movie.
3766680	3776040	Well, I'll share with you a story that most people don't know, which is our first two days
3776040	3783480	of shooting were in Smiley's, the place where I get a job in a fast food place.
3783560	3787640	Yeah, it's a burger joint. And I guess it was like maybe
3789080	3795800	the third day or the fourth day of shooting, we'd now done that. And I said to Sam,
3796600	3802600	so how are the dailies? How do they look? He goes, which ones? I said, well, the first
3803320	3810280	Smiley's. He goes, oh, they're shit. And I went, yeah, no, how were they? He goes, no, they're
3810280	3817960	shit. I hate them. I hate everything about them. I hate the costumes. I hate the location.
3817960	3826360	I hate that you're inside. I hate the way you acted. I hate everything but the script.
3827320	3830760	So I've gone back to the studio and asked them if we can reshoot the first two days.
3831560	3841480	And it was like, Sam, this is your very first movie. You're going back to Steven Spielberg
3841480	3849960	and saying, I need to reshoot the first two days entirely. Yeah. And that's exactly what we did.
3850840	3856600	A couple of weeks later, they decided that it was now a drive through because Annette and
3856600	3863160	Peter Galler used to come into the place and ordered from the counter. Now, Sam decided,
3863160	3866440	it has to be a drive through. You have to be in the window of the drive through,
3866440	3871160	change the costumes, and we reshot those first two days. And Sam said,
3873160	3880040	it was actually a moment of incredible confidence because he said the worst thing that could
3880040	3887160	possibly have happened happened in my first two days. And after that, I was like, I know what
3887160	3892200	I'm doing and I knew I had to reshoot it and it was absolutely right. And I guess that's what a
3892200	3898520	great director must do is have the guts in that moment to reshoot everything. That's a pretty
3898520	3905560	gutsy move. Two other little things to share with you about Sam, but the way he is, you wouldn't
3905560	3916840	know it, but the original script opened and closed with a trial. Ricky was accused of Lester's murder.
3917880	3921720	And the movie was bookended by this trial. It's a very different movie.
3921720	3932440	Which they shot the entire trial for weeks. And I used to fly in my dreams.
3933000	3939080	You know those opening shots over the neighborhood? I used to come into those shots in my bathrobe
3940280	3946360	flying. And then when I hit the ground and the newspaper was thrown at me by the newspaper guy
3946360	3952840	and I caught it, the alarm would go off and I'd wake up in bed. I spent five days being hung by
3952840	3959640	wires and filming these sequences of flying through my dreams. And Sam said to me,
3959720	3966760	yeah, the flying sequences are all gone and the trial is gone. And I was like, what?
3968120	3974920	What are you talking about? And here's my other little favorite story about Sam and that.
3975480	3981480	When we were shooting in the valley, one of those places I flew, this was an indoor set.
3982040	3989800	Sam said to me in the morning, hey, at lunch, I just want to record a guide track of all the
3989800	3994600	dialogue, all of your narration, because they just needed an editing as a guide. And I said, sure.
3995160	4000120	So I remember we came outside of this in this hallway where I had a dressing room in this
4000120	4007960	little studio we were in. And Sam had like a cassette tape recorder and like a little microphone.
4008920	4016600	And we put it on the floor and he pushed record. And I read the entire narration.
4019160	4028440	And I never did it again. That's the narration in the movie. Because Sam said, when he listened to it,
4031000	4035320	I wasn't trying to do anything. He said, you had no idea where these things were going,
4035400	4039480	where they were going to be placed, what they were going to mean. You just read it so
4040360	4048040	innocently, so purely, so directly that I knew if I brought you into a studio and put headphones
4048040	4057640	on you and had you do it again, it would change the ease with which you'd done it. And so they
4057640	4065000	just fixed all of the problems that they had with this little cassette. And that is the way I did
4065000	4072520	it. And the only time I did it was in this little hallway. And once again, a great performance lies
4072520	4079400	in being doing less. Yeah. Yeah. The innocence and the purity of less. He knew I would have
4079400	4086600	come into the studio and fucked it up. Yeah. What do you think about the notion of beauty that
4086600	4092120	permeates American beauty? What do you think that theme is with the roses, with the rose petals,
4092120	4101960	the characters that are living this mundane existence slowly opening their eyes up to what is
4101960	4107720	beautiful in life? See, it's funny. I don't think of the roses and I don't think of her body and
4107720	4118680	the poster and I don't think of those things as the beauty. I think of the bag. I think that
4119080	4128440	there are things we miss that are right in front of us that are truly beautiful.
4130520	4135240	The little things, the simple things. Yeah. And in fact, I'll even tell you something that I always
4135240	4144280	thought was so incredible. When we shot the scenes in the office where Lester worked,
4144280	4148120	the job he hated, there was a bulletin board behind me on a wall.
4151480	4158760	And someone who was watching a cut or early dailies who was in the marketing department
4160600	4167880	saw that someone had cut out a little piece of paper and stuck it and it said, look closer.
4168120	4175240	And they presented that to Sam as the idea of what that should, that could go on the poster.
4175960	4183880	The idea of looking closer was such a brilliant idea, but it wasn't, I mean, it wasn't like,
4183880	4188520	it wasn't in the script. It was just on a wall behind me and someone happened to
4189160	4195080	zoom in on it and see it and thought, that's what this movie's about. This movie's about
4195160	4203640	taking the time to look closer. And I think that in itself is just beautiful.
4204680	4210600	Mortality also permeates the film. It starts with acknowledging that death is on the way,
4211160	4221080	that Lester's time is finite. You ever think about your own death? Yeah. Scared of it?
4225640	4229640	When I was at my lowest point, yes, it scared me.
4230840	4237160	What does that fear look like? What's the nature of the fear? What are you afraid of?
4241240	4242280	That there's no way out.
4245240	4246280	That there's no answer.
4247080	4254600	That nothing makes sense.
4257960	4265320	See, the interesting thing about Lester is facing the same fear. He seemed to be somehow liberated
4266760	4270040	and accepted everything and then saw the beauty of it.
4270040	4277320	Because he got there. He was given the opportunity to reinvent himself and to
4281160	4290120	try things he'd never tried, to ask questions he'd never asked, to trust his instincts
4290920	4300440	and to become the best version of himself he could become. And so Dick Van Dyke, who has
4300440	4309000	become an extraordinary friend of mine, Dick is 98 years old. And he says, you know, if I'd known
4309000	4315400	I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself. When I spend time with him,
4316360	4323400	I'm just moved by every day, you know, he gets up and he goes, it's a good day, I woke up.
4324280	4336280	And I learn a lot about, I have a different feeling about death now than I did seven years ago.
4337240	4349000	And I'm on the path to being able to be in a place where
4350760	4356200	I've resolved the things I needed to resolve and won't probably get to all of it in my lifetime,
4356200	4363880	but I certainly would like to be at a place where if I were to drop dead tomorrow,
4363880	4369880	it would have been an amazing life. So Lester got there, it sounds like Dick Van Dyke got there,
4369880	4377480	he tried to get there. Sure. You said you feared death at your lowest point. What was the lowest
4377480	4388680	point? It was November 1st of 2017, and then Thanksgiving Day of that same year.
4388760	4397160	So let's talk about it. Let's talk about this dark time. Let's talk about the sexual allegations
4397160	4404120	against you that led to you being canceled by, well, the entire world for the last seven years.
4405880	4411880	I would like to personally understand the sins, the bad things you did and the bad things you
4411880	4417560	didn't do. So I also should say that the thing I hope to do here is to
4419720	4427080	give respect to due process, innocent until proven guilty that the mass hysteria machine of
4427880	4434600	the internet and clickbait journalism doesn't do. So here's what I understand.
4435480	4439640	There were criminal and civil trials brought against you,
4440680	4444840	including the one that started it all when Anthony Rapp sued you for $40 million.
4446360	4454280	In these trials, you were acquitted, found not guilty and not liable. Is that right? Yes. I think
4454280	4462840	that's really important again in terms of due process. And I read a lot and I watched a lot
4462840	4469640	in preparation for this on this point, including, of course, the recently detailed interviews you
4469640	4476680	did with Dan Wooten and then Allison Pearson of the Telegraph. And those are all focused on this
4476680	4482040	topic and they go in detail where you respond in detail to many of the allegations. If people are
4482040	4486760	interested in the details, they can listen to those. So based on that and everything I looked at,
4486760	4492120	as I understand, you never prevented anyone from leaving if they wanted to.
4492200	4496520	Sort of in the sexual context, for example, by blocking the door. Is that right? That's correct.
4498520	4504440	You always respected the explicit no from people. Again, the sexual context. Is that right? That is
4504440	4511320	correct. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person, right? Never. And also,
4512200	4517880	as is sometimes done in Hollywood, let me ask this, you've never explicitly offered to exchange
4517880	4523960	sexual favors for career advancement, correct? Correct. In terms of bad behavior, what did you
4523960	4531640	do? What was the worst of it? And how often did you do it? I have heard now quite often that
4531640	4537320	everybody has a Kevin Spacey story. And what that tells me is that I hit on a lot of guys.
4538520	4544360	How often did you cross the line? And what does that mean to you? I did a lot of horsing around.
4544360	4549400	I had a lot of things that at the time I thought were sort of playful and fun. And I have learned
4549400	4558040	since we're not. And I have had to recognize that I crossed some boundaries and I did some
4558040	4564120	things that were wrong and I made some mistakes. And that's in my past. I mean, I've been working
4564680	4571640	so hard over these last seven years to have the conversations I needed to have, to listen to people,
4571640	4575400	to understand things from a different perspective than the one that I had,
4576040	4580840	and to say, I will never behave that way again for the rest of my life.
4581560	4587160	Just to clarify, I think you're often too pushy with the flirting.
4590200	4597800	And that manifests itself in multiple ways. But just to make clear, you never prevented anyone
4597800	4606280	from leaving if they wanted to. You always took the explicit no from people as an answer. No, stop.
4607320	4612840	You took that for the answer. You've never done anything sexual with an underage person.
4613560	4618280	And you've never explicitly offered to exchange sexual favors for career advancement.
4619000	4625000	These are some of the sort of accusations that have been made. And in the court of law, multiple
4625000	4631320	times have been shown not to be true. But I have had a sexual life and I've fallen in love.
4631880	4640280	And I've been so admiring of people that I, I mean, I'm so romantic. I'm such a romantic person
4640920	4646600	that there's this whole side of me that hasn't been talked about, isn't being discussed. But
4647160	4654040	that's who I know. That's the person I know. It's been very upsetting to hear that some people have
4654040	4659080	said I, I mean, I don't have a violent bone in my body, but to hear people describe things as
4659960	4668120	having been very aggressive is incredibly difficult for me. And I'm deeply sorry that
4668760	4675640	I ever offended anyone or hurt anyone in any way. It is, it is crushing to me. And I have to work
4676200	4684600	very hard to show and to prove that I have learned I got the memo and I will never,
4684600	4688520	ever, ever behave in those ways again. From everything I've seen in public
4688520	4694280	interactions with you, people love you. Colleagues love you, coworkers love you. They,
4694280	4699400	there's a flirtatiousness. Another word for that is chemistry. There's a chemistry between the
4699400	4704920	people you work with. And by the way, not to take anything away from my accountability for
4704920	4710200	things I did where I got it wrong, I crossed the line, I pushed some boundaries. I accept all of
4710200	4720840	that. But I live in an industry in which flirtation, attraction, people meeting in the workspace and
4721480	4730520	ending up marrying each other and having children. And so it is a, it is a, it is a space and a place
4730520	4738200	where these notions of family, these notions of attraction, these notions of, it's always
4738200	4743560	complicated if you meet someone in the workspace and find yourselves attracted to each other.
4744120	4749320	You have to be mindful of that. And you have to be very mindful that you don't ever want anyone to
4749320	4758120	feel that their job is in jeopardy. Or you would punish them in some way if they no longer wanted
4758120	4766200	to be with you. So those are important things to just acknowledge. Another complexity to this
4766200	4772920	as I've seen is that there's just a huge number of actors that look up to you. A huge number of
4772920	4778040	people in the industry that look up to you. So just and love you. I've seen just from this
4778040	4783320	documentary, just a lot of people just love being around you, learning from you what it means to
4783320	4790680	create great theater, great film, great stories. And so that adds to the complexity. I wouldn't
4790680	4797960	say it's a power dynamic like a boss-employee relationship. It's a admiration dynamic that
4798920	4803000	is easy to miss and easy to take advantage of. Is that something you understand?
4803560	4810600	Yes. And I also understand that there are people who met me and spent a very brief period of time
4810600	4820200	with me, but presumed I was now going to be their mentor. And then behaved in a way that I was unaware
4820200	4830280	of that they were either participating or flirting along or encouraging me without me having any idea
4830360	4841080	that at the end of the day they were expecting something. So these are about relationships.
4841080	4846680	So these are about two people. These are about people making decisions, people making choices,
4847480	4855960	and I accept my accountability in that. But there are a number of things that I've been accused of
4855960	4865000	that just simply did not happen. And I can't say, and I don't think it would be right for me to say,
4865000	4870600	well, everything that's ever been I've been accused of is true because we've now proved
4870600	4878920	that it isn't and it wasn't. But I am perfectly willing to accept that I had behaviors that were
4878920	4887480	wrong and that I shouldn't have done and I am regretful for. I think that also speaks to
4888440	4894760	dark side of fame. The sense I got is that there are some people, potentially a lot of people,
4894760	4899960	trying to make friends with you in order to get roles, in order to advance their career.
4900760	4904200	So not you using them, but they trying to use you.
4908920	4916600	What's that like? How do you know if somebody likes you for you for Kevin or likes you for
4919160	4923480	like you said, you're romantic, you see a person and you're like, I like this person
4925160	4928520	and they seem to like you. How do you know if they like you for you?
4930440	4937000	Well, to some degree, I would say that I have been able to trust my instincts on that and that
4937480	4943720	most of the time been right. But obviously in the last number of years,
4944840	4948680	not just with people who've accused me, but just also people in my own industry,
4948680	4953800	to realize that, oh, I thought we had a friendship, but I guess that was about an inch thick and
4955720	4963800	not what I thought it was. But look, one shouldn't be surprised by that. I have to also say,
4964440	4968520	you know, you said a little while ago that the world had canceled me and I have to
4968520	4976360	disagree with you. I have to disagree because for seven years, I've been stopped by people
4977480	4983400	sometimes every day, sometimes multiple, multiple times a day. And the conversations that I have
4983400	4990760	with people, the generosity that they share, the kindness that they show, and how much they want
4990760	4998040	to know when I'm getting back to work tells me that while there may be a very loud minority,
4999000	5003640	there is a quieter majority. In the industry, have you been betrayed
5005240	5009560	in life and how do you not let that make you cynical?
5010520	5021240	I think betrayal is a really interesting word. But I think if you're going to be betrayed,
5021240	5028440	it has to be by those who truly know you. And I can tell you that I have not been betrayed.
5029400	5030760	What's the beautiful way to put it?
5033560	5038680	For the times you cross the line, do you take responsibility for the wrongs you've done?
5039640	5045400	Yes. Are you sorry to the people you may have hurt emotionally? Yes.
5048600	5055960	And I have spoken to many of them. Privately. Privately, which is where a man should be made.
5057080	5065000	Were they able to start finding forgiveness? Absolutely. Some of the most moving conversations
5065000	5074600	that I have had when I was determined to take accountability have been those people who said,
5074600	5080760	thank you so much, and I think I can forgive you now.
5082200	5086600	If you got a chance to talk to the Kevin Spacey of 30 to 40 years ago,
5088440	5094680	what would you tell him to change about his ways? How would you do it? What would be your approach?
5094680	5097560	Would you be nice about it? Would you smack him around?
5098920	5102840	I think if I were to go back that far, I probably would have found a way to
5105480	5112440	not have been as concerned about my revealing my sexuality and hiding that for as long as I did.
5112440	5122680	I think that had a lot to do with confusion and a lot to do with mistrust, both my own and other
5122680	5129480	peoples. For most of your life, you were not open with the public about being gay.
5130760	5134360	What was the hardest thing about keeping who you love a secret?
5137320	5146440	That I didn't find the right moment of celebration to be able to share that.
5147160	5151640	There must be a thing that weighs on you to not be able to fully
5155240	5164440	celebrate your love. Ian McKellen said, he was 49 when he came out,
5165400	5172200	27 years he'd been a professional actor being in the closet. He said he felt it was like he was
5172680	5180680	living a part of his life not being truthful and that he felt that it affected his work
5180680	5186840	when he did come out because he no longer felt like he had anything to hide. I absolutely believe
5186840	5197400	that that is what my experience has been and will continue to be. I am sorry about the way I came out,
5198360	5206120	but Evan and I had already had the conversation. I had already decided to come out.
5207800	5214120	It wasn't like, oh, I was forced to come out, but it was something I decided to do. By the way,
5214120	5220200	much against Evan's advice, I came out in that statement and he wishes that I had not done so.
5220200	5229240	Yeah, you made a statement when the initial accusation happened. It could be up there as
5230040	5239800	one of the worst social media posts of all time. It's like two for one.
5239800	5241800	Don't hold back. No, come on. Really tell me how you feel.
5241800	5249800	The first part, you kind of implicitly admitted to doing something bad, which was later shown
5249800	5253400	and proved completely to never have happened. It was a lie.
5255400	5260360	I basically said that I didn't remember what this person was that Anthony Rapp was claiming
5260920	5266680	from 31 years before. I had no memory of it, but if it had happened, if this embarrassing moment
5266680	5273000	had happened, then I would owe him an apology. That was what I said. Then I said, and while I'm
5273000	5278600	at it, I think I'll come out. It was definitely not the greatest coming-out party ever. I will admit
5278600	5283480	that. From the public perception, the first part of that, so first of all, the second part is a
5283480	5288920	horrible way to come out. Yes, we all agree. Then the first part, from the public viewpoint,
5289880	5297400	they see guilt in that, which also is tragic because at least that particular accusation is
5297400	5303000	a very dramatic one. It's a $40 million lawsuit. It's a big deal, and an underage person was shown
5303000	5310520	to be false. You're melding two things together. The lawsuit didn't happen until 2020, and then
5310520	5316120	it didn't get to court until 2022. We're back in 2017 when it was just an accusation he made
5316200	5324920	in BuzzFeed Magazine. Look, I was backed into a corner. When someone says, you were so drunk,
5324920	5331080	you won't remember this thing happened, what's your first instinct? Is your first instinct to
5331080	5340280	say this person's a liar, or is your first instinct to go, what? 31 years at a party,
5340280	5345640	I don't even remember throwing? Obviously, a lot of investigation happened after that,
5345640	5351480	in which we were then able to prove in that court case that it had never occurred. But at the moment,
5353400	5362280	I was sort of being taught, I couldn't push back. You have to be kind. I think even to me now,
5363400	5367880	none of it sounds right, but I don't know that I could have said anything that would have been
5368200	5375720	satisfactory to anybody. Okay. That is an almost convincing explanation for the worst social
5375720	5380840	media post of all time. I almost accept it. I'm really surprised. I guess you haven't read a lot
5380840	5385720	of media posts because I can't believe that's the actual worst one. It's beautifully bad,
5385720	5391800	is how bad that social media post is. As you mentioned, Liam Neeson and Sharon Stone came out
5391800	5399800	in support of you recently, speaking to your character. A lot of people who know you, and some
5399800	5405560	of whom I know, who have worked with you privately, show support for you, but are afraid to speak up
5405560	5411640	publicly. What do you make of that? I mean, to me personally, this just makes me sad because
5411640	5419080	perhaps that's the nature of the industry, that it's difficult to do that, but I just wish it
5419160	5422760	would be a little bit more courage in the world. I don't think it's about the industry. I think
5422760	5428200	it's about our time. I guess the time that we're in, and people are very afraid.
5429080	5433880	Just afraid, just a general fear. No, they're literally afraid that
5435320	5439560	they're going to get canceled if they stand up for someone who has been.
5442200	5448520	I think it's... I mean, we've seen this many times in history. This is not the first time it's
5448520	5458680	happened. So as you said, your darkest moment in 2017, when all of this went down, one of the
5458680	5463240	things that happened is you were no longer in the house of cards for the last season.
5464520	5470360	Let's go to the beginning of that show. Okay. One of the greatest TV series of all time,
5471400	5476520	a dark, fascinating character in Frank Underwood, a ruthless, cunning, borderline, evil politician.
5477480	5484280	What are some interesting aspects to the process you went through becoming Frank Underwood?
5484920	5489080	Maybe, Richard III, there's a lot of elements there in your performance that maybe
5490280	5501080	inspired that character. Is that fair or no? I'll give you one very interesting, specific
5501640	5511880	education that I got in doing Richard III and closing that show
5513480	5519480	at BAM in March of 2012, and two months later, started shooting house of cards.
5522440	5524200	There is something called direct address.
5524920	5538280	In Shakespeare, you have Hamlet talks to the world, but when Shakespeare wrote Richard III,
5538280	5544280	it was the first time he created something called direct address, which is the character looks
5545080	5551320	at each person close by. It is a different kind of
5552760	5557560	sharing than when a character is doing a monologue, an opening of Henry IV.
5561480	5564920	And while there are some people who believe that direct address was invented in Ferris
5564920	5571640	Bueller, it wasn't. It was Shakespeare who invented it. So I had just had this experience
5571960	5579400	every night in theaters all over the world, seeing how people reacted
5581080	5585880	to becoming a co-conspirator, because that's what it's about.
5588120	5595560	And what I tried to do and what Fincher really helped me with in those beginning days
5596120	5603880	was how to look in that camera and imagine I was talking to my best friend.
5608440	5612280	Because you're sharing the secret of the darkness of how this game is played
5612280	5619000	with that best friend. Yeah, and there were many times when I suppose the writers thought I was
5619000	5623720	crazy, where I would see a script and I would see like this moment where this direct address
5623720	5628680	would happen and say all this stuff and I'd go, when we do a read-through of the script, I go,
5629720	5633320	I don't think I need to say any of that. And they were like, what do you mean? I said,
5633320	5639880	well, the audience knows all of that. All I have to do is look. They know exactly what's going on.
5639880	5647480	I don't need to say a thing. So I was often cutting dialogue because it just wasn't needed,
5648120	5652840	because that relationship that I'd learned that I'd experienced doing Richard III,
5654680	5661560	was so extraordinary. Where I literally watched people, they were like, oh, I'm in on the thing
5661560	5666520	and this is so awesome. And then suddenly, wait, he killed the kids. He killed those kids in the
5666520	5675080	tower. Oh, maybe it's not so. And you literally would watch them start to reverse their having had
5675080	5681560	such a great time with Richard III in the first, you know, three acts. I thought this is going to
5681560	5696680	happen in this show. If this intimacy can actually land, and I think just think there was some
5696680	5703000	brilliant writing and we always attempted to do it in one take. No matter how long something was,
5703000	5709240	we would try to do it in one take, the direct addresses. So there was never a cut. When we
5709240	5715960	went out on locations, we started to then find ways to cut it and make it slightly broader.
5715960	5720520	But that's interesting because you're doing a bunch of with both Richard III and Frank Underwood,
5720520	5728040	a bunch of dark, borderline evil things. And then I guess the idea is you're going to be
5728040	5732280	losing the audience and then you win them back over with the addresses.
5732360	5740520	That's the remarkable thing is against their instincts and their better sense of what they
5740520	5745400	should and should not do, they still rallied around Frank Underwood.
5746600	5750520	And I saw even with the documentary, the glimmers of that with Richard III,
5752040	5756360	I mean, you were seducing the audience. Like there was such a chemistry between you and the
5756360	5761320	audience on stage. Yeah. Well, in that production, that's absolutely true.
5763400	5767640	Also, Richard is one of the weirder, weird, I mean by weird,
5770680	5778520	was an early play of Shakespeare's. And he's basically never offstage. I mean,
5779240	5783800	I remember when we did the first run through, I had no idea what the next scene was every time I
5783800	5788600	came offstage. I had no idea what was next. They literally had to drag me from one place to another
5788600	5794520	scene. Now it's the scene with Hastings. And now it's the scene. But I now understand these
5794520	5801160	wonderful stories that you can read in old books about Shakespeare's time that actors
5802280	5807960	grabbed Shakespeare around the cuff and punched him and threw him up against the wall. So you
5807960	5812360	ever write a part like this again, I'm going to kill you. And that's why in later plays,
5812360	5817640	he started to have a pageant happened and then a wedding happened. And the main character was
5817640	5824120	offstage resting because the actor had said, you can't do this to us. There's no breaks.
5824120	5828840	And it's true. There's very few breaks in Richard III. You're on stage most of the time.
5829560	5835640	The comedic aspect of Richard III and Frank Underwood. Is that a component that helps bring out
5836760	5841560	the full complexity of the darkness that is Frank Underwood?
5842200	5849240	I certainly can't take credit for Shakespeare having written something that is funny or
5850040	5854440	Bo Williman and his team to have written something that is funny, is fundamentally funny.
5855960	5864440	It just depends on how I interpret it. That's one of the great things why we love
5864520	5871800	you know, in a year's time, we can see five different Hamlets. We can see four Richard
5871800	5878440	the Thirds. We can see two Richard the Seconds. That's part of the thrill that we don't own these
5878440	5886760	parts. We borrow them and we interpret them. And what Ian McKellen might do with a role
5886760	5892200	could be completely different from what I might do because of the way we perceive it.
5892200	5898360	And also, very often in terms of going for humor, it's very often a director will say,
5898360	5903240	why don't you say that with a bit of irony? Why don't you try that with a bit of boba?
5903240	5909800	Yeah, there's often like that, like a wry smile. The line that jumps to me when you're talking about
5909800	5920520	Claire in the early, maybe first episode even, I love that woman more than sharks love blood.
5922680	5930120	I mean, I guess there's a lot of ways to read that line, but the way you read it had both
5930120	5937560	humor, had legitimate affection, had all the ambition and narcissism, all of that mixed up together.
5938120	5942120	I also think that one should just acknowledge that where he was from,
5943880	5950920	there is something that happens when you do an accent. And in fact, sometimes when I would say
5951880	5956600	to Bo or one of the other writers, this is really good and I love the idea,
5956600	5963480	but it rhythmically doesn't help. I need at least two more words to rhythmically make this work
5964120	5972280	in his accent because it just doesn't scan. And that's not iambic pentameter. I'm not talking
5972280	5978760	about that. There is that as well in Shakespeare, but there was sometimes when it's too many lines,
5978760	5984920	it's not enough lines in order for me to make this work for the way he speaks, the way he sounds,
5985480	5993560	and what that accent does to emphasis. How much of that character in terms of the musicality
5994760	6001160	of the way he speaks is Bill Clinton? Not really at all. I mean, Clinton, you know,
6001400	6009640	Bill Clinton, he had a way of talking, you know, that he was very slow and he felt your pain,
6009640	6022280	you know. But Frank Underwood was a deeper, more direct and less poetic in the way that
6022280	6025800	Clinton would talk. I'll tell you this Clinton story that you like.
6026040	6034280	So we decided to do a performance of the Iceman cometh for the Democratic Party
6034280	6038920	on Broadway and the president is going to come. He's going to see this four and a half hour play
6038920	6043640	and then we're going to do this event afterward. And a couple weeks before we're going to do this
6043640	6049160	event, someone at the White House calls and says, listen, it's very unusual to get the president
6049160	6055320	for like six and a half hours. So we're suggesting that the president come and see the first act
6055400	6062440	and then he goes. And I knew what was happening. Now, first of all, Clinton knows this play.
6063000	6069400	He knows what this play is about. And I, you know, as gently as I could said, well,
6069960	6075080	if the president is thinking of leaving at intermission, then I'm afraid we're going to have
6075080	6080200	to cancel the event. There's just no way that, so anyway, then I don't know, it's fine. Now,
6080200	6084760	I know what was happening. What was happening was that someone had read the play and they were
6084760	6091800	quite concerned. And I'll tell you why. Because the play is about this character that I portrayed
6091800	6097480	named Hickey. And in the course of the play, as things get more and more revealed, you realize
6097480	6103160	that this man that I'm playing has been a philanderer. He's cheated on his wife quite a lot.
6104040	6112280	And by the end of the play, he is arrested and taken off because he ended up ending his wife's
6112280	6118840	life because she forgave him too much and he couldn't live with it. So now imagine this,
6118840	6125240	there's 2,000 people at the Brooks Acton's Theater watching President Clinton watching this play.
6127640	6132040	And at the end of the night, we take our curtain call. They bring out the presidential podium.
6132600	6134680	Bill Clinton stands up there and he says,
6135160	6144200	Well, I suppose we should all thank Kevin and this extraordinary company of actors
6145480	6150200	for giving us all way too much to think about.
6154680	6160360	And the audience fell over and laughed her and then he gave a great speech. And I thought
6161080	6162440	that was a pretty good way to handle that.
6163400	6168200	Well, in that way, him and Frank Arnold would share like a charisma. There's certain presidents that
6168200	6173160	just have politicians that just have this charisma. You can't stop listening to them.
6173160	6178040	Some of it is the accent, but some of it is some other magical thing.
6179160	6187000	When I was starting to do research, I wanted to meet with the whip, Kevin McCarthy.
6187640	6193320	And he wouldn't meet with me until I called his office back and said,
6194040	6199560	tell him I'm playing a Democrat, not a Republican. And then he met with me.
6200920	6201400	Nice.
6201400	6204040	And he was helpful. He took me to whip meetings.
6206120	6211720	Politicians. So you worked with David Fincher there. He was the executive producer, but
6212280	6216120	he also directed the first two episodes. Yeah.
6216920	6222440	High level. What was it like working with him again? In which ways do you think he
6223080	6227800	helped guide you and the show to become the great show that it was?
6228280	6242840	I give him a huge amount of the credit and not just for what he established,
6244360	6252760	but the fact that every director after stayed within that world. I think that's why the series had
6252760	6257800	a very consistent feeling to it. It was like watching a very long movie.
6260360	6265640	The style, where the camera went, what it did, what it didn't do, how we used this,
6265640	6270520	how we used that, how we didn't do this. There were things that he laid the foundation for
6271400	6279800	that we managed to maintain pretty much until Bo Williman left the show.
6280520	6286280	They got rid of Fincher, and I was sort of the last man standing in terms of
6287240	6292920	fighting again. Netflix had never had any creative control at all. We had complete creative control,
6292920	6299080	but over time, they started to get themselves involved because, look, this is what happens
6299080	6304920	to networks. They'd never made a television show before ever, and then four years later,
6305400	6311080	they were the best. Then you're going to get suggestions about casting and about writing and
6311080	6319480	about whose music and scenes. There was a considerable amount of pushback that I had to do
6320280	6324520	when they started to get involved in ways that I thought was affecting the quality of the show.
6325480	6331960	What are those battles like? I heard that there was a battle of the execs, like you mentioned
6332040	6337640	early on about your name not being on the billing for Seven. I heard that there's battles about the
6337640	6349400	ending of Seven, which was pretty dark. What's that battle like? How often does that happen?
6349400	6359000	How do you win that battle? It feels like there's a line where the networks or the execs are really
6359000	6367160	afraid of crossing that line into this strange, uncomfortable place. Then the great directors
6367160	6376120	and great actors flirt with that line. It can happen in different ways. I remember one argument
6376120	6383000	we had was we had specifically shot a scene so that there would be no score in that scene,
6383000	6390120	so that there was no music. It was just two people talking. Then we end up seeing a cut where
6390760	6396280	they've decided to put music in. It is against everything that scene is supposed to be about.
6397240	6401800	You have to go and say, guys, this was intentional. We did not want score. Now you've
6401800	6407320	added score because you think it's too quiet. You think our audience can't listen to two people
6407320	6412120	talk for two and a half minutes. This show has proved anything. It's proved that people have
6412120	6417800	patience and they're willing to watch an entire season over a weekend. There are those kind of
6418760	6428040	arguments that can happen. There are different arguments on different levels and they sometimes
6428040	6432920	have to do with, I mean, look, go back to the godfather. They wanted to fire Pacino because
6432920	6438200	they didn't see anything happening. They saw nothing happening, so they wanted to fire Pacino.
6439080	6443960	And then finally, Coppola thought, I'll shoot the scene where he kills the police commissioner
6443960	6448600	and they'll do that scene now. That was the first scene where they went, yeah, actually,
6448600	6452040	there's something going on there. So Pacino kept the role.
6453640	6459960	You think that godfathers when Pacino was like the Pacino we know was born? Or is that more like
6459960	6466200	there's the character that really over the top, insensible woman? There's like stages, I suppose.
6466200	6472360	Yeah, of course. Look, I think that we can't forget that Pacino is also an animal of the theater.
6473480	6480600	He does a lot of plays and he started off doing plays and movies where Panic and Needle Park was
6480600	6487800	his first. And yeah, I think there's that period of time when he was doing some incredible parts
6487800	6494520	and incredible movies. When I did a series called Wise Guy, I got cast on a Thursday
6494520	6499240	and I flew up to Vancouver on a Saturday and I started shooting on Monday. And all I had time
6499240	6505880	to do was watch The Godfather in Superco and then I went to work. Would you say,
6505880	6508600	ridiculous question, Godfather's greatest film of all time?
6511400	6520040	Well, certainly, yes, yes. But I also look, I'm allowed to change my opinion. I can next week
6520040	6526120	say it's Lawrence of Arabia or a week after that, I can say Sullivan's Travels. I mean,
6527080	6530840	that's the wonderful thing about movies and particularly great movies is when you see them
6530840	6536680	again, it's like seeing them for the first time. And you pick up things that you didn't see the last
6536680	6543320	time. And for that day, you fall in love with that movie. You might even say to a friend that
6543320	6549160	that is the greatest movie of all time. And also I think it's the degree with which directors are
6549240	6560200	daring. I mean, Kubrick decided to cast one actor to play three major roles in Dr. Strangelove.
6561240	6568360	I mean, who has the balls to do that today? I was going to mention when we're talking about seven
6568360	6576840	that just if you're looking at the greatest performances portrayals of murderers, so obviously
6576840	6581640	like I mentioned, Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, that's up there. Seven to me is like
6581640	6586520	competing for first place with Silence of the Lambs. But then there's a different one
6588520	6596680	with Kubrick and Jack Nicholson, right, with a shot. And there's, as opposed to a murderer
6597240	6603000	who's always been a murderer, here's a person like an American beauty who becomes that,
6603880	6610760	who descends into madness. I read also that Jack Nicholson improvised here's Johnny in that scene.
6610760	6616760	I believe that. That's a very different performance than yours in Seven. What do you make of that
6616760	6625000	performance? Nicholson's always been such an incredible actor because he has absolutely no
6625000	6632200	shame about being demonstrative and over the top. And he also has no problem playing characters who
6632200	6637320	were deeply flawed. And he interested in that. I have a pretty good Nicholson story though,
6637320	6642040	nobody knows. You also have a pretty good Nicholson impression, but what's the story?
6642920	6650280	Story is a story was told to me by a sound man, Dennis Maitland, who's a great, great, great guy.
6651560	6657160	He said he was very excited because he got on Pritzze's Honor, which was Jack Nicholson,
6657160	6662520	Angelica Houston, directed by John Houston. And he said, I was so excited. It was my first day
6662520	6668360	on the movie and I get told to go into Mr. Nicholson's trailer and mic him up for the first scene.
6668920	6676760	So I knock on the trailer door and I hear, yes. And come on in. I come inside and Mr. Nicholson
6676760	6682360	is changing out of his regular clothes and he's putting, he's going to put on his costume. And
6682360	6688440	so I'm setting up the mic and I'm getting ready. And I said, Mr. Nicholson, I just wanted to tell
6688440	6694120	you, I'm extremely excited to be working with you again. It's a great pleasure. And Jack goes,
6694760	6699640	did we work together before? And he says, yes, yes, we, we did. And he goes, what,
6699640	6706920	what film did we do together? He says, well, we did Missouri Breaks. Nicholson goes, oh my God,
6706920	6713000	Missouri Breaks. Jesus Christ, we were out of our minds on that film. Holy shit. Jesus Christ,
6713000	6718680	wonder I'm alive. My God, there was so much drugs going on and we were stoned out of our minds.
6718680	6725160	Holy shit. And just then he folds the pants that he's just taken off over his arm and an eighth
6725160	6736280	of coke drops out on the floor. Dennis looks at it. Nicholson looks at it. Jack goes,
6738040	6745480	have more in these pants since Missouri Breaks. Man, I love that guy unapologetically himself.
6746520	6751800	Oh yeah. Your impression of him, look at the AFI was just, is just great.
6751880	6757560	Well, that was for, that was for Mike Nichols. Oh yeah. He had a big impact in your career.
6757560	6763000	He's really important. Can you talk about him? Like what, what role did he play in your life?
6763000	6771560	I think it was, yeah, it was 1984. I went into audition for the national tour of a play called
6771560	6776520	The Real Thing, which Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close were doing on Broadway that Mr. Nichols
6776520	6781560	had directed. So I went in to read for this character Brody, who is a Scottish character.
6782760	6789160	And I did the audition and Mike Nichols comes down the aisle of the theater and he's asking me
6789160	6792680	questions about where'd you go to school and what have you been doing. And I just come back from
6793480	6797400	doing a bunch of years of regional theater and different theaters. So I was in New York and
6797400	6804600	meeting Mike Nichols was just incredible. So Mr. Nichols went, have you, have you seen the other
6804600	6809320	play that I directed up the block called Hurley Burley? And I said, no, I haven't. He says, why
6809320	6815400	not? I said, I can't afford a Broadway ticket. He said, we can arrange that. I'd like you to go
6815400	6820840	see that play and then I'd like you to come in next week and audition for that. I was like, okay.
6821640	6830040	So I went to see Hurley Burley, William Hurt, Harvey Keitel, Chris Walken, Candace Bergen,
6830920	6839240	Cynthia Nixon, Jerry Stiller. And I watched this play. David Ray played about Hollywood.
6840040	6847560	This is crazy. I mean, Bill Hurt was like unbelievable. It was extraordinary. Chris Walken,
6848600	6853320	so there's this Harvey Keitel. Walken came in later. Harvey Keitel's playing this part.
6854360	6859480	And I come in and I audition for it and Nichols says, I want you to understudy Harvey Keitel,
6859480	6866440	I want you to understudy Phil. And I'm like, Phil? I mean, Harvey Keitel is like in his 40s,
6866440	6871240	he looks like he can beat the shit out of everybody on stage. I'm just like 24 year old.
6872920	6876840	And Nichols said, it's just all about attitude. If you believe you can beat the shit out of
6876840	6882920	everybody on stage, the audience will too. So I then started to learn Phil.
6882920	6889320	Phil. And the way it works when you're in understudy, unless you're in name,
6889320	6893800	they don't let you rehearse on the stage. You just rehearse in a rehearsal room.
6893800	6898040	But I used to sneak onto the stage and rehearse and try to figure out where the props were.
6898840	6906760	Anyway, one day I get a call, you're going on today, it's Phil. So I went on.
6907160	6912120	Nichols is told by Peter Lawrence, who's the stage manager. Spacey's going on as Phil. So
6912120	6919080	Nichols comes down and watches the second act, comes backstage. He says, that was really good.
6919880	6926120	How soon could you learn Mickey? Mickey was the role that Ron Silver was playing,
6927000	6934440	Chris Walken also played. I said, I don't know. Maybe a couple of weeks. He goes,
6934840	6944440	learn Mickey too. So I learned Mickey. And then one day I'm told, you're going on tomorrow night
6944440	6953480	is Mickey. Nichols comes, sees the second act, comes backstage, says, that was really good.
6953480	6961640	I mean, that was really funny. How soon could you learn Eddie? And so I became like the pinch
6961640	6965400	hitter on Hurley Burley. I learned all the male parts, including Jerry Stiller's, although I
6965400	6974840	never went on his Jerry Stiller's part. And then I left the play. I guess about two months later,
6974840	6980360	I get this phone call from Mike Nichols. He's like, Kevin, how are you? And I'm like, I'm fine.
6981160	6986520	What can I do for you? He says, well, I'm going to make a film this summer with Mandy and Meryl.
6986520	6995560	And there's a role I'd like you to come in and audition for. So I went in, auditioned, cast me
6995560	7002120	as this mugger on a subway. Then there's this whole upheaval that happens because he then
7003160	7009160	doesn't continue with Mandy Pitemkin. Mandy leaves the movie and he asks Jack Nicholson to come in
7009880	7016840	and replace Mandy Pitemkin. So now I had no scenes with him, but I'm in a movie with Jack
7016840	7023800	Nicholson and Meryl Streep. And my first scene in this movie, which I shot on my birthday, July 26th
7023800	7032280	of 85, I got to wink at Meryl Streep in this scene. And I was so nervous. I literally couldn't
7032280	7040600	wink. Nichols had to like, calm me down and help me wink. But that became my first, my very first
7040600	7047480	film. And he was incredible. And he let me come and watch when they were shooting scenes. I wasn't in.
7048760	7053880	And I remember ending up one day in the makeup trailer on the same day we were working. Jack and
7053880	7058680	me, we had no scene together. But I remember him coming in and they put him down in the chair and
7058680	7065000	they put cucumbers, frozen cucumbers on his eyes and did his neck. And then they raised him up and
7065000	7068440	did his face. And then I remember Nicholson went like this, looked in the mirror and he went,
7073240	7079880	another day, another $50,000. And walked out of the trailer.
7081000	7088280	What was Christopher Walker like? Oh, so he's a theater guy too. Oh, yeah. He started out as a
7088280	7096440	course boy, dancer. Oh, I can see that. Yeah. I know I'm walking a long time and I did a
7096440	7105000	Saturday Live where I did, we did these Star Wars auditions. I did Chris Walken as Hans.
7105000	7112200	So good. And I'll never forget this. I was in Los Angeles about two weeks after and I was at
7112200	7116520	Chateau Marmal. There's some party happening at Chateau Marmal. And I saw Chris Walken come
7117320	7123160	out of onto the balcony and I was like, Oh, it's Chris Walken. And he walked up to me and he went,
7123800	7128680	Kevin, I saw you little sketch. It was funny. Haha.
7133000	7140920	Oh, man, it was a really good sketch. And that guy, there's certain people that are truly unique
7141880	7148840	and unapologetic, continue being that throughout their whole career, the way they talk, the
7148840	7155400	musicality of how they talk, how they are, their way of being, he's that. And it somehow works.
7155400	7164360	His watch. Yeah. I mean, it works in so many different contexts. He plays like a mobster in
7164440	7170760	true romance. And it's like genius. That's genius. But he could be anything. He could be soft. He
7170760	7176200	could be a badass, all of it. And he's always Christopher Walken, but somehow works for all
7176200	7182920	these different characters. So I guess we were talking about House of Cards like two hours ago
7182920	7190120	before we took a tangent upon a tangent, but there's a moment in episode one where President
7190200	7194760	Walker broke his promise to Frank Underwood that he would make him a Secretary of State.
7196360	7201880	Was this when the monster in Frank was born? Or was the monster always there? The sort of,
7203000	7209480	for you looking at that character, was there an idealistic notion to him that there's loyalty
7210040	7216040	and that broke him? Or did he always know that there is, this whole world is about manipulation
7216120	7222200	and do anything to get power? Well, I mean, it might have been the first moment an audience saw
7222200	7228280	him be betrayed, but it certainly was not the first betrayal he'd experienced. And once you start
7228280	7233160	to get to know him and learn about his life and learn about his father and learn about his, you
7233160	7239400	know, friends and learn about their relationship and learn what he was like even as a cadet,
7239960	7243560	I think you start to realize that this is a man who has
7246840	7254600	very strong beliefs about loyalty. And so it wasn't the first, it was just the first moment that
7256040	7262440	in terms of the storyline that's being built, Night Takes King was the name of our production
7262440	7269960	company. Yeah. What do you think motivated him at that moment and throughout the show?
7269960	7276680	Was it all about power and also legacy? Or was there some small part underneath it all where he
7277720	7286360	wanted to actually do good in the world? No, I think power is a afterthought.
7287320	7293240	What he loved more than anything was being able to predict how human beings would react.
7295080	7305000	He was a behavioral psychologist and he could know like he was 17 moves ahead in the chess game.
7305960	7311880	He could know if he did this at this moment that eventually this would happen.
7312840	7323560	He was able to be predictive and was usually right. He knew just how far he needed to push someone
7323560	7328280	to get them to do what he needed them to do in order to make the next step work.
7330440	7336760	You've played a bunch of evil characters. Well, you call them evil. But you don't,
7336760	7340680	but the reason I say that, I don't mean to be snarky about it, but the reason I say it that way
7341000	7349560	is because I never judge the people I play. And the people that I have played or that any actor
7349560	7360120	has played don't necessarily view themselves as this label. It's easy to say, but that's not
7360120	7368920	the way I can think. I cannot judge a character I play and then play them well. I have to be
7369000	7375400	free of judgment. I have to just play them and let the cards drop where they may
7375960	7380520	and let an audience judge. I mean, the fact that you use that word is perfectly fine.
7382280	7387320	But it's like people asking me, was I really from K-Pax or not? It just entirely depends on
7387880	7395640	your perspective. Do roles like that, like seven, like Frank Underwood,
7397800	7406440	like a lesser from American beauty, did they change you psychologically as a person? So walking
7406440	7415400	around in the skin of these characters, these complex characters with very different moral
7415400	7430920	systems. I absolutely believe that wandering around in someone else's ideas, in someone else's clothes,
7432440	7442920	in someone else's shoes, teaches you enormous empathy and that goes to the heart of not judging
7443400	7453160	and I have found that I have been so moved by, I mean, look, yes, you've identified the darker
7453800	7461160	characters, but I put Clarence Darrow three times. I've played a play called National Anthems. I've
7461160	7469320	done movies like Recount. I've done films like The Ref. I've done films in which that doesn't
7469320	7476440	exist in any of those characters, those qualities, paid forward. And so it is
7479560	7488200	incredible to be able to embrace those things that I admire and that are like me and those
7488200	7495800	things that I don't admire and aren't like me, but I have to put them on an equal footing and say,
7495800	7505480	I have to just play them as best I can and not decide to wield judgment over them.
7506440	7507560	Without judgment.
7507560	7509000	Without judgment.
7509000	7515960	In Gulag Archipelago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn famously writes about the line between good
7515960	7524440	and evil and that it runs to the heart of every man. So the full paragraph there when he talks
7524440	7531400	about the line. During the life of any heart, this line keeps changing place. Sometimes it is
7531400	7537480	squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish.
7538360	7544920	One and the same human being is at various ages under various circumstances a totally different
7544920	7552600	human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood, but his name doesn't
7552600	7559560	change. And to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil. What do you think about this note
7561560	7567640	that we're all capable of good and evil and throughout life that line moves and shifts
7567640	7569400	throughout the day, throughout every hour?
7572280	7576840	Yeah, I mean one of the things that I've been focused on
7577160	7583240	very succinctly is the idea that every day is an opportunity.
7585320	7596520	It's an opportunity to make better decisions, to learn and to grow.
7596760	7611400	And I also think that, look, I grew up not knowing if my parents loved me, particularly my father.
7615320	7622040	I never had a sense that I was loved and that stayed with me my whole life.
7622760	7635720	And when I think back at who my father was and more succinctly who he became,
7639400	7648040	it was a gradual and slow and sad development.
7648120	7657720	When I've gone back and now I've looked at diaries my father kept and albums he kept, particularly
7658920	7664920	when he was a medic in the U.S. Army, served our country with distinction.
7666600	7674120	When the war was over and they went to Germany, the things my father said, the things that he
7674120	7679160	wrote, the things that he believed were as patriotic as any American soldier who had ever served.
7682280	7687240	But then when he came back to America and he had a dream of being a journalist
7688760	7693320	or his big hope was that he was going to be the great American novelist.
7694520	7698120	He wanted to be a creative novelist and so he sat in this office and he wrote
7698760	7704600	for 45 years and never published anything.
7707560	7710120	And somewhere along the way in order to make money he
7711880	7718680	became what they call a technical procedure writer, which the best way to describe that is
7718680	7725000	that if you built the F-16 aircraft, my father would have written the manual to tell you how to do it.
7725000	7729960	I mean as boring, as technical, as tedious as you can imagine.
7732040	7742280	And so somewhere in the 60s and into the 70s my father fell in with groups of people and individuals
7742280	7750520	pretend intellectuals who started to give him reasons why he was not successful as a white
7751400	7761000	Aryan man in the United States. And over time my father became a white supremacist.
7766040	7774680	And I cannot tell you the amount of times as a young boy that my father would sit me down
7775560	7782920	and lecture me for hours and hours and hours about his
7785240	7794120	fucked up ideas of America, of prejudice, of white supremacy. And thank God for my sister
7794680	7797720	who said don't listen to a thing he says he's out of his mind.
7798600	7806200	And even though I was young I knew everything he was saying was against people and I loved people.
7809480	7819240	I had so many wonderful friends. My best friend Mike, who's still my close friend to this day,
7819240	7826360	I was afraid to bring him to my house because I was afraid that my father would find out he was
7826360	7833960	Jewish or that my father would leave his office door open and someone would see his Nazi flag
7833960	7846360	or his pictures of Hitler or Nazi books or what he might say. So when I found theater
7847160	7857400	in the eighth grade and debate club and choir and festivals and plays and
7858440	7866760	everything I could do to participate in that wouldn't make me have to come back home, I did.
7866760	7884280	And I had to reconcile who he became because the gap between that man who was in the U.S.
7884280	7897480	army as a medic and the man he became I could never fill that gap but I've forgiven him.
7901240	7904280	But then at the same time I've had to look at my mother and say
7906040	7911800	she made excuses for him. Oh he just needs to get it off his chest or it doesn't matter just let him
7911800	7922200	say. So while on the outside I would say oh yeah my mother loved me but she didn't protect me.
7926600	7935960	So was the was all the stuff that she expressed and all of the attention and all the love that I
7935960	7942600	felt was that because I became successful and I was able to fulfill an emptiness that she'd
7942600	7950440	lived with her whole life with him? I don't know but I've had to ask myself
7952360	7959080	those questions over these last years to try to reconcile that for myself.
7960040	7966040	And the thing you wanted from them and for them is less hate and more love.
7967800	7975960	Did your dad say he loves you? I don't have any memory of that. I was in a program and they were
7975960	7983960	showing us an experiment that they'd done with psychologists and mothers and fathers and their
7983960	7988440	children and the children were anywhere between six months and a year sitting in a little crib.
7989720	7995160	And the exercise was this parents are playing with the baby right there toys yada yada babies
7995160	7999880	laughing at and then the psychologists would say stop and the parent would go like this.
8003000	8009800	And you would then watch for the next two and a half three minutes this child trying to get their
8009800	8018120	parents attention in any possible way and I remember when I was sitting in this theater watching this
8019160	8028520	baby I saw myself that was me screaming and reaching out and trying to get my parents
8028520	8035560	attention that was me and that was not something I'd I'd ever remembered before
8036120	8039320	but I I knew that what that baby was going through.
8039960	8052120	Is there some elements of politics and maybe the private sector that are captured by the by
8052120	8058520	house of cards like how true to life do you think that is from everything you've seen about politics
8058520	8065080	for maybe everything you've seen about the politicians of this particular elections.
8066040	8073240	I heard so many different reactions from politicians about house of cards some would say
8073240	8078840	oh it's not like that at all and then others would say it's closer to the truth than anyone
8078840	8084360	wants to admit and I think I fall down in the side of that idea.
8084920	8094600	I have to interview some world leaders some big politicians
8097480	8103400	in your understanding of trying to become Frank Underwood what advice would you give
8103400	8111400	in interviewing Frank Underwood. How to how to get it to say anything that's at all honest.
8112360	8115720	Well in Frank's case all you have to do is tell him to look into the camera and he'll tell
8116520	8120600	he'll tell you what you want to hear. Unfortunately we don't get that look
8120600	8126520	into the the mind of a person the way we do with Frank Underwood in real life sadly.
8126520	8132040	Well but you could say to somebody you like the series house of cards you know I'd love
8132040	8137240	for you to just look into the camera and tell us what's really going on what you really feel about
8137800	8143880	blah blah blah. That's a good technique I'll try that with Zelensky with Putin.
8146440	8153160	What do you hope your legacy as an actor is and as a human being. People ask me now
8154600	8162280	what's your favorite performance you've ever given and my answer is I haven't given it yet.
8163160	8173080	So there's a lot more that I want to be challenged by be inspired by.
8178040	8183480	There's a lot that I don't know there's a lot I have to learn
8184200	8191560	and that is a very exciting place to feel that I'm in.
8194600	8198360	You know it's been interesting because you know we're we're going back we're talking
8199560	8207880	and you know it's it's nice to go back every now and then but I'm focused on on what's next.
8208760	8211640	Do you hope the world forgives you.
8218200	8221320	People go to church every week to be forgiven
8223640	8229240	and I believe that forgiveness and I believe that redemption are beautiful things. I mean look
8229240	8236440	don't forget I live in an industry in which there is a tremendous amount of conversation about
8237000	8242280	redemption from a lot of people who are very serious people in very serious positions
8243560	8251240	who believe in it. I mean that guy who finally got out of prison he was wrongly accused that guy
8251240	8258200	who served his time and got out of prison. We see so many people saying let's find a path for that
8258280	8267800	person let's help that person rejoin society but there is an odd situation if you're in the
8267800	8276440	entertainment industry you're not offered that kind of a path and I hope that the fear that
8276440	8283240	people are experiencing will eventually subside and common sense will get back to the table.
8283800	8289720	If it does do you think you have another Oscar worthy performance in you.
8291560	8296280	Listen if it would piss off Jack Lemmon again for me to win a third time I absolutely think so yeah.
8297560	8302600	Well you have to mention him again you know Ernest Hemingway once said that the world is
8302600	8309960	a fine place and worth fighting for and I agree with him on both counts. Kevin thank you so much
8309960	8315960	for talking to me thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kevin Spacey to support
8315960	8321160	this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some
8321160	8329560	words from Meryl Streep acting is not about being someone different it's finding the similarity
8329560	8337480	in what is apparently different and then finding myself in there thank you for listening and hope
8337480	8347480	to see you next time.
