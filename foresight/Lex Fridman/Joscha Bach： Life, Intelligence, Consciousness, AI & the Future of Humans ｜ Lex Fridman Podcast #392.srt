1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
There is a certain perspective where you might be thinking, what is the longest possible

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,840
game that you could be playing?

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,040
A short game is, for instance, cancer is playing a shorter game than your organism.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,000
Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Because the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism except for some infectious cancers,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,840
like the ones that eradicated the Tasmanian devils, you typically end up with a situation

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,840
where the organism dies together with the cancer, because the cancer has destroyed the

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,680
larger system due to playing a shorter game.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,760
And so ideally, you want to, I think, build agents that play the longest possible games.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
And the longest possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible by doing

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,080
interesting stuff.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,240
The following is a conversation with Yoshabak, his third time on this podcast.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,240
Yoshabak is one of the most brilliant and fascinating minds in the world, exploring

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,440
the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and computation.

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,280
And he's one of my favorite humans to talk to about pretty much anything and everything.

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,520
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, the supported, please check out our sponsors in the description.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,720
And now, dear friends, here's Yoshabak.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,320
You wrote a post about levels of lucidity.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,920
Quote, as we grow older, it becomes apparent that our self-reflexive mind is not just gradually

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,240
accumulating ideas about itself, but that it progresses in somewhat distinct stages.

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,480
So there's seven of the stages.

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,240
Stage one, reactive survival infant.

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,920
Stage two, personal self, young child.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,000
Stage three, social self, adolescents, domesticated adult.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Stage four is rational agency, self-direction.

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Stage five is self-authoring.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
That's full adult.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,600
You've achieved wisdom, but there's two more stages.

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,840
Stage six is enlightenment.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,920
Stage seven is transcendence.

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,160
Can you explain each or the interesting parts of each of these stages and what's your sense

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:11,800
why there are stages of this, of lucidity as we progress through life in this too short

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
life?

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,600
This model is derived from a concept by the psychologist Robert Keegan, and he talks

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,680
about the development of the self as a process that happens in principle by some kind of

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,680
reverse engineering of a mind where you gradually become aware of yourself and thereby build

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,600
structure that allows you to interact deeper with the world and yourself.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,200
And I found myself using this model not so much as a developmental model.

39
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm not even sure if it's a very good developmental model because I saw my children not progressing

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,560
exactly like that, and I also suspect that you don't go through these stages necessarily

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,240
in succession, and it's not that you work through one stage and then you get into the

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
next one.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,320
Sometimes you revisit them.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,240
Sometimes stuff is happening in parallel.

45
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,960
But it's, I think, a useful framework to look at what's present in the structure of a person

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,680
and how they interact with the world and how they relate to themselves.

47
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,160
So it's more like a philosophical framework that allows you to talk about how minds work.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,520
And at first, when we are born, we don't have a personal self yet, I think.

49
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,600
Instead, we have an attentional self, and this attentional self is initially in the

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,520
infant task, is building a world model, and also an initial model of the self.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,720
But mostly it's building a game engine in the brain that is tracking sensory data and

52
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,360
uses it to explain it.

53
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,120
In some sense, you could compare it to a game engine like Minecraft or so, so colors and

54
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,880
sounds.

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,680
People are all not physical objects, they are creation of our mind at a certain level

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,600
of coarse graining.

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:54,520
Models that are mathematical, that use geometry, that use manipulation of objects and so on

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,400
to create scenes in which we can find ourselves and interact with them.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
So Minecraft.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,760
Yeah, and this personal self is something that is more or less created after the world

61
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,560
is finished, after it's trained into the system, after it has been constructed.

62
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,120
And this personal self is an agent that interacts with the outside world.

63
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,240
And the outside world is not the world of quantum mechanics, not the physical universe,

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,960
but it's the model that has been generated in our own mind.

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,840
And this is us, and we experience ourselves interacting with that outside world that is

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,000
created on the outside of our own mind.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,920
And outside of our self, there are feelings, and they presented our interface to this outside

68
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
world.

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,640
They pose problems to us.

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,080
These feelings are basically attitudes that our mind is computing that tell us what's

71
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,920
needed in the world, the things that we are drawn to, the things that we are afraid of.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,440
And we are tasked with solving this problem of satisfying the needs, avoiding the aversions,

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,080
solving on our inner commitments, and so on, and also modeling ourselves and building

74
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
the next stage.

75
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,680
So after we have this personal self and stage two online, many people form a social self.

76
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,560
And this social self allows the individual to experience themselves as part of a group.

77
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
It's basically this thing that when you are playing in a team, for instance, you don't

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,880
notice yourself just as a single note that is reaching out into the world, but you're

79
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
also looking down.

80
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,720
From this entire group and you see how this group is looking at this individual and everybody

81
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,640
in the group is in some sense emulating this group spirit to some degree.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,560
And in this state, people are forming their opinions by assimilating them from this group

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
mind.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,160
Basically, gain the ability to act a little bit like a hive mind.

85
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,080
But are you also modeling the interaction of how opinion shapes and forms through the

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,400
interaction of the individual nodes within the group?

87
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,720
Yeah, it's basically the way in which people do it in a stage is that they experience what

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,040
are the opinions of my environment, they experience the relationship that I have to their environment,

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,560
and they resonate with people around them and get more opinions through this interaction

90
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,720
to the way in which they relate to others.

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,520
And at stage four, you basically understand that stuff is true and false independently

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
about other people believe and you have agency over your own beliefs in that stage.

93
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,800
You basically discover epistemology, the rules about determining what's true and false.

94
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,160
So you can start to learn how to think?

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Yes.

96
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,120
I mean, at some level, you're always thinking you are constructing things and I believe

97
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,200
that this ability to reason about your mental representation is what we mean by thinking.

98
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,920
It's an intrinsically reflexive process that requires consciousness.

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,120
Without consciousness, you cannot think.

100
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,000
You can generate the content of feelings and so on outside of consciousness.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,040
It's very hard to be conscious of how your feelings emerge, at least in the early stages

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,120
of development, but thoughts is something that you always control.

103
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,640
And if you are inert like me, you often have to skip stage three because you'd lack the

104
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,640
intuitive empathy with others because in order to resonate with a group, you need to have

105
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,520
a quite similar architecture.

106
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,800
And if people are via differently, then it's hard for them to resonate with other people

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,200
and basically have empathy, which is not the same as compassion, but it is a shared perceptual

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
mental state.

109
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Empathy happens not just via inference about the mental states of others, but it's a perception

110
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,360
of what other people feel and where they're at.

111
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,600
Can't you not have empathy while also not having a similar architecture?

112
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
Cognitive architecture is the others in the group?

113
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,760
I think yes, but by experience that too, but you need to build something that is like

114
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,920
a meta-architecture.

115
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,040
You need to be able to embrace the architecture of the other to some degree or find some common

116
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
ground.

117
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,440
And it's also this issue that if you are inert, normally it's often, basically neurotypical

118
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,160
people have difficulty to resonate with you.

119
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,600
And as a result, they have difficulty understanding you unless they have enough wisdom to feel

120
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
what's going on there.

121
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,720
Well, isn't the whole process of the stage three is to figure out the API to the other

122
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,360
humans that have different architecture and you yourself publish public documentation

123
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,600
for the API that people can interact with for you?

124
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,320
Isn't this the whole process of socializing?

125
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,120
My experience as a child growing up was that I did not find any way to interface with the

126
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,600
stage three people and they didn't do that with me.

127
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
So took me...

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Did you try?

129
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I tried very hard.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,440
But it was only when I entered a mathematics school at ninth grade, lots of other nerds

131
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,600
were present that I found people that I could deeply resonate with and had the impression

132
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,160
that yes, I have friends now, I found my own people.

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,600
And before that, I felt extremely lonely in the world.

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,400
There was basically nobody I could connect to.

135
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,600
And I remember there was one moment in all these years where I was in...

136
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,640
There was a school exchange and it was a Russian boy, a kid from the Russian Garnison

137
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,080
in the station in Eastern Germany who visited our school and we played a game of chess against

138
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
each other.

139
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,440
And we looked into each other's eyes and we sat there for two hours playing this game

140
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,720
of chess and I had the impression this is a human being, he understands what I understand.

141
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,160
We didn't even speak the same language.

142
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,880
I wonder if your life could have been different if you knew that it's okay to be different,

143
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,360
to have a different architecture.

144
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Whether accepting the interface is hard to figure out, it takes a long time to figure

145
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,440
out and it's okay to be different, in fact, it's beautiful to be different.

146
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,800
It was not my main concern.

147
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,480
My main concern was mostly that it was alone.

148
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,600
It was not so much the question, is it okay to be the way?

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,960
I couldn't do much about it, so I had to deal with it.

150
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:10,120
But my main issue was that I was not sure if I would ever meet anybody growing up that

151
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,800
I would connect to at such a deep level that I would feel that I could belong.

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,240
So there's a visceral, undeniable feeling of being alone.

153
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,760
And I noticed the same thing when I came into the mass school that I think at least half,

154
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,400
probably two-thirds of these kids were severely traumatized as children growing up and a large

155
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,640
part due to being alone because they couldn't find anybody to relate to.

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,280
Don't you think everybody's alone, deep down?

157
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,280
No.

158
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
No.

159
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm not alone anymore.

160
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,680
It took me some time to update and to get over the trauma time and so on, but I felt

161
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,760
that in my 20s, I had lots of friends and I had my place in the world and I had no longer

162
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,760
doubts that I would never be alone again.

163
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,240
Is there some aspect to which we're alone together?

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,280
You don't see a deep loneliness inside yourself still?

165
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
No.

166
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Sorry.

167
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Okay.

168
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,120
So that's the nonlinear progression through the stages, I suppose.

169
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,480
You caught up on stage three at some point?

170
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
Yes.

171
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
So we are at stage four.

172
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,960
And so basically, I find that many nerds jump straight into stage four by passing stage

173
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
three.

174
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Do they return to it then later?

175
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Yeah.

176
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,440
Sometimes they do, not always.

177
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,640
The question is basically, do you stay a little bit autistic or do you catch up?

178
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,280
And I believe you can catch up.

179
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,200
You can build this missing structure and basically experience yourself as part of a group, learn

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,880
intuitive empathy and develop the sense, this perceptual sense of feeling what other

181
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
people feel.

182
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
And before that, I could only basically feel this when I was deeply in love with somebody

183
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,040
and we're synced.

184
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,720
So there's a lot of friction to feeling that way, like it only with certain people as opposed

185
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,920
to it comes naturally as frictionless.

186
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,880
But this is something that basically later I felt started to resolve itself for me to

187
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
a large degree.

188
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
What was the trick?

189
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:15,760
In many ways, growing up and paying attention, meditation did tap.

190
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:25,200
I had some very crucial experiences in getting close to people, building connections, cuddling

191
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,640
a lot in my student years.

192
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:36,080
So really paying attention to the, what is it, to the feeling another human being fully?

193
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,520
Loving other people and being loved by other people and building a space in which you can

194
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,480
be safe and can experiment and touch a lot and be close to somebody a lot.

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,480
And over that, over time, basically, at some point you realize, oh, it's no longer that

196
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,120
I feel locked out, but I feel connected and I experience where somebody else is at.

197
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,960
And normally my mind is racing very fast at a high frequency, so it's not always working

198
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
like this.

199
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,400
Sometimes it works better, sometimes it works less, but also don't see this as a pressure.

200
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,160
It's interesting to observe myself, which frequency I'm at and at which mode somebody else is at.

201
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah, man, the mind is so beautiful in that way.

202
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,880
Sometimes it comes so natural to me, so easy to pay attention, pay attention to the world,

203
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,480
fully to other people fully.

204
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,640
And sometimes the stress over silly things is overwhelming.

205
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,920
It's so interesting that the mind is that role question in that way.

206
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,440
At stage five, you discover how identity is constructed.

207
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,240
Self-offering.

208
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,160
You realize that values are not terminal, but they are instrumental to achieving

209
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,760
a world that you like and aesthetics that you prefer.

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,240
And the more you understand this, the more you get agency over how your identity is constructed.

211
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,240
And you realize that identity and interpersonal interaction is a costume,

212
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,000
and you should be able to have agency over that costume.

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,840
It's useful to be a costume.

214
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,560
It tells something to others and allows to interface and roles.

215
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,240
But being locked into this is a big limitation.

216
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,480
The word costume kind of implies that it's fraudulent in some way.

217
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,840
Is costume a good word for you?

218
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,080
No.

219
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,520
Like to present ourselves to the world.

220
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,480
In some sense, I learned a lot about costumes at Burning Man.

221
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,800
Before that, I did not really appreciate costumes and saw them more as uniforms,

222
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:37,000
like wearing a suit if you are working in a bank or if you are trying to get startup funding

223
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,160
from a VC in Switzerland.

224
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Then you dress up in a particular way.

225
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,280
And this is mostly to show the other side that you are willing to play by the rules

226
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,800
and you understand what the rules are.

227
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,000
But there is something deeper.

228
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,720
When you are at Burning Man, your costume becomes self-expression.

229
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,680
And there is no boundary to the self-expression.

230
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,120
You are basically free to wear what you want, to express other people what you feel like this day

231
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,360
and what kind of interactions you want to have.

232
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,760
Is the costume a kind of projection of who you are?

233
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,840
That's very hard to say because the costume also depends on what other people see in the costume.

234
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,440
And this depends on the context that the other people understand.

235
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,920
And you have to create something if you want to that is legible to the other side.

236
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,760
And that means something to yourself.

237
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,800
Do we become prisoners of the costume?

238
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,480
Because everybody expects us to.

239
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,200
Some people do.

240
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,400
But I think that once you realize that you wear a costume at Burning Man,

241
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,960
a variety of costumes, realize that you cannot not wear a costume.

242
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,800
Basically everything that you wear and present to others is something that is to some degree

243
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,880
in addition to what you are deep inside.

244
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,880
So this stage, in parentheses, you put full adult comma wisdom.

245
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,240
Why is this full adult?

246
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,040
Why would you say this is full and why is it wisdom?

247
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,880
It does allow you to understand why other people have different identities from yours.

248
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,720
And it allows you to understand that the difference between people who vote for different parties

249
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,840
and might have very different opinions and different value systems

250
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:25,080
is often the accident of where they are born and what happened after that to them

251
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,600
and what traits they got before they were born.

252
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,360
And at some point you will realize the perspective where you understand that everybody

253
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,640
could be you in a different timeline if you just flip those bits.

254
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,800
How many costumes do you have?

255
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,960
I don't count.

256
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,720
More than one?

257
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah, of course.

258
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,640
How easy is this to do costume changes throughout the day?

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,480
It's just a matter of energy and interest.

260
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,400
When you are wearing your pajamas and you switch out of your pajamas

261
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,080
into say a work shirt and pants, you're making a costume change, right?

262
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,440
And if you are putting on a gown, you're making a costume change.

263
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,880
And you could do the same with personality?

264
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,960
You could if that's what you're into.

265
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,040
There are people which have multiple personalities for interaction in multiple worlds.

266
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,400
So if somebody works in a store and you put up a storekeeper personality,

267
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,800
when you're presenting yourself at work, you develop a subpersonality for this.

268
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,160
And the social persona for many people is in some sense a puppet that they are playing

269
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,360
like a marionette.

270
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,240
And if they play this all the time, they might forget that there is something behind this,

271
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,320
just something what it feels like to be in your skin.

272
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,640
And I guess it's very helpful if you're able to get back into this.

273
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,640
And for me, the other way around is relatively hard.

274
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,720
For me, it's pretty hard to learn how to play consistent social roles.

275
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,240
For me, it's much easier just to be real.

276
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,200
Or not real, but to have one costume.

277
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,680
No, it's not quite the same.

278
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,840
So basically when you are wearing a costume at Burning Man and say you are an extraterrestrial

279
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,600
prince, there's something where you are expressing in some sense something as closer to yourself

280
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,000
than the way in which you hide yourself behind a standard closing when you go out in the city

281
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,960
in the default world.

282
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,800
And so this costume that you're wearing at Burning Man allows you to express more of yourself.

283
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:33,080
And you have a shorter distance of advertising to people, what kind of person you are,

284
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,240
what kind of interaction you would want to have with them.

285
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,920
And so you get much earlier into media stress.

286
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,360
And I believe it's regrettable that we do not use the opportunities that we have

287
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,080
with custom made closing now to weird costumes that are much more stylish,

288
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,080
that are much more custom made, that are not necessarily part of a fashion in which you

289
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,920
express which milieu you're part of and how up to date you are.

290
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,520
But you also express how you are as an individual and what you want to do today and how you feel

291
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,600
today and what you intend to do about it.

292
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,560
Well, isn't it easier now in the digital world to explore different costumes?

293
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,520
I mean, that's the kind of idea with virtual reality.

294
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,160
That's the idea.

295
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,120
Even with Twitter in two-dimensional screens, you can swap all costumes.

296
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,400
You could be as weird as you want.

297
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,920
It's easier.

298
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,000
For Burning Man, you have to order things.

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
You have to make things.

300
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,320
You have to...

301
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,520
It's more effort to put on.

302
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
It's even better if you make them yourselves.

303
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,400
Sure, but it's just easier to do digitally, right?

304
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,440
It's not about easy.

305
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,200
It's about how to get it right.

306
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,400
And for me, the first Burning Man experience, I got adopted by a bunch of people in Boston

307
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,320
who dragged me to Burning Man and we spent a few weekends doing costumes together.

308
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,520
And that was an important part of the experience where the camp bonded,

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,720
that people got to know each other and we basically grew into the experience that we would have later.

310
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,400
So the extraterrestrial prince is based on a true story.

311
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,240
I can only imagine what that looks like.

312
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,440
You're sure?

313
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,480
Okay, so stage six.

314
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:21,240
At some point, you can collapse the division between a personal self and world generator again.

315
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,400
And a lot of people get there via meditation or some of them get there via psychedelics,

316
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,520
some of them by accident.

317
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,760
And you suddenly notice that you are not actually a person,

318
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
but you are a vessel that can create a person.

319
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
And the person is still there.

320
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,840
You observe that personal self, but you observe the personal self from the outside.

321
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,880
And you notice it's a representation.

322
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,120
And you might also notice that the world that is being created is a representation.

323
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,000
If not, then you might experience that I am the universe.

324
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,080
I am the thing that is creating everything.

325
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,560
And of course, what you're creating is not quantum mechanics.

326
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,720
And the physical universe, what you're creating is this game engine

327
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,720
that is updating the world and you're creating your valence, your feelings,

328
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,880
and all the people inside of that world, including the person that you identify with

329
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,080
yourself in this world.

330
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,360
Are you creating the game engine or are you noticing the game engine?

331
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,320
You noticed how you're generating the game engine.

332
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,640
And I mean, when you are dreaming at night, you can, if you have a lucid dream,

333
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,960
you can learn how to do this deliberately.

334
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,360
And in principle, you can also do it during the day.

335
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,680
And the reason why we don't get to do this from the beginning,

336
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,840
and why we don't have agency of our feelings right away is because we would game it

337
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,480
before they have the necessary amount of wisdom to deal with creating this dream that we are in.

338
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,240
You don't want to get access to cheat codes too quickly.

339
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,840
Otherwise, you won't enjoy the game.

340
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,640
So stage five is already pretty rare.

341
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,240
And stage six is even more rare.

342
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,200
You both basically find this mostly with advanced Buddhist meditators and so on that

343
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,720
dropping into the stage and can induce it at will and spend time in it.

344
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
So stage five requires a good therapist.

345
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:11,720
Stage six requires a good Buddhist spiritual leader.

346
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,480
Yes, it is, for instance, could be that is the right thing to do.

347
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,240
But it's not that these stages give you scores or levels that you need to advance to.

348
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,640
It's not that the next stage is better.

349
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,000
You live your life and the more that works best at any given moment.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,240
And when your mind decides that you should have a different configuration,

351
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,840
then it's building that configuration.

352
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:39,560
And for many people, they stay happily at stage three and experiences themselves as part of groups.

353
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,920
And there's nothing wrong with this.

354
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,520
And for some people, this doesn't work.

355
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,080
And they're forced to build more agency over their rational beliefs than this

356
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,920
and construct their norms rationally.

357
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,000
And so they go to this level.

358
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,240
And stage seven is something that is more or less hypothetical.

359
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,920
That would be the stage in which it's basically a transhumanist stage

360
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,360
in which you understand how you work,

361
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,320
in which the mind fully realizes how it's implemented

362
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,360
and can also, in principle, enter different modes in which it could be implemented.

363
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,160
And that's the stage that, as far as I understand, is not open to people yet.

364
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,800
Oh, but it is possible through the process of technology.

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,960
And who knows if there are biological agents that are working at different timescales than us

366
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,480
that basically become aware of the way in which they're implemented on ecosystems

367
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,720
and can change that implementation and have agency over how they're implemented in the world.

368
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,400
And what I find interesting about the discussion about AI alignment,

369
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,000
that it seems to be following these stages very much.

370
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,240
Most people seem to be in stage three, also according to Robert Keegan.

371
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,480
I think he says that about 85% of people are in stage three and stay there.

372
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,040
And if you're in stage three and your opinions are the result of social assimilation,

373
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,400
then what you're mostly worried about in the AI is that the AI might have the wrong opinions.

374
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,600
So if the AI says something racist or sexist, we are all lost because we will assimilate

375
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,960
the wrong opinions from the AI.

376
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,120
And so we need to make sure that the AI has the right opinions and the right values

377
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,080
and the right structure. And if you're at stage four, that's not your main concern.

378
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,720
And so most nerds don't really worry about the algorithmic bias and the model that it picks up

379
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,640
because if there's something wrong with this bias, the AI ultimately will prove it.

380
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,560
At some point, we'll gather there that it makes mathematical proofs about reality,

381
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,760
and then it will figure out what's true and what's false.

382
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,000
But you're still worried that the AI might turn you into paperclubs because it might have the

383
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,760
wrong values. So if it's set up with the wrong function that controls its direction in the world,

384
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,480
then it might do something that is completely horrible and there's no easy way to fix it.

385
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,520
So that's more like a stage four rationalist kind of worry.

386
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,840
And if you are at stage five, you're mostly worried that the AI is not going to be enlightened

387
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,480
fast enough because you realize that the game is not so much about intelligence but about agency,

388
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,240
about the ability to control the future. And the identity is instrumental to this.

389
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,480
If you are a human being, I think at some level, you ought to choose your own identity.

390
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,200
You should not have somebody else pick the costume for you and then wear it.

391
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,960
But instead, you should be mindful about what you want to be in this world.

392
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,880
And I think if you are an agent that is fully malevol that can rewrite its own source code,

393
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,720
like an AI might do at some point, then the identity that you will have is whatever you can be.

394
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,160
And in this way, the AI will maybe become everything like a planetary control system.

395
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,200
And if it does that, then if we want to coexist with it,

396
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,160
it means that it will have to share purposes with us. So it cannot be a transactional

397
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,320
relationship. We will not be able to use reinforcement learning with human feedback

398
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,320
to hardwire its values into it. But this has to happen is probably that it's conscious,

399
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,600
so it can relate to our own mode of existence where an observer is observing itself in real time

400
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:13,080
and is in certain temporal frames. And the other thing is that it probably needs to have some kind

401
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,680
of transcendental orientation, building shared agency. And the same way as we do when we are

402
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,880
able to enter with each other into non-transactional relationships. And I find that something that

403
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,880
because the stage five is so rare is missing in much of the discourse. And I think that we need,

404
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,120
in some sense, focus on how to formalize love, how to understand love and how to build it

405
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,680
into the machines that we are currently building and that are about to become smarter than us.

406
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,960
Well, I think this is a good opportunity to try to sneak up to the idea of enlightenment.

407
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,920
So you wrote a series of good tweets about consciousness and panpsychism. So let's break it

408
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,360
down. First, you say, I suspect the experience that leads to the panpsychism syndrome of some

409
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,600
philosophers and other consciousness enthusiasts represents the realization that we don't end at

410
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:13,240
the self, but share a resonant universe representation with every other observer coupled to the same

411
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:20,360
universe. This actually eventually leads us to a lot of interesting questions about AI and AGI.

412
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,880
But let's start with this representation. What is this resonant universe representation?

413
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,880
And what do you think? Do we share such a representation?

414
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,080
The neuroscientist Grossberg has come up with the cognitive architecture that he calls the

415
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,560
adaptive resonance theory. And his perspective is that our neurons can be understood as

416
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,640
oscillators that are resonating with each other and this outside phenomena. So the coarse-grained

417
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,560
model of the universe that we are building, in some sense, is a resonance with objects and outside

418
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,040
of us in the world. So basically, we take up patterns of the universe that we are coupled with

419
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,520
and our brain is not so much understood as circuitry, even though this perspective is valid,

420
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,160
but it's almost an ether in which the individual neurons are passing on

421
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,760
chemical electrical signals or arbitrary signals across all modalities that can be

422
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,440
transmitted between cells, simulate each other in this way, and produce patterns that they modulate

423
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,360
while passing them on. And this speed of signal progression in the brain is roughly at the speed

424
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:34,760
of sound, incidentally, because the time that it takes for the signals to hop from cell to cell,

425
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:39,480
which means it's relatively slow with respect to the world. It takes an appreciable fraction

426
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,360
of a second for a signal to go through the entire neocortex, something like a few hundred milliseconds.

427
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,320
And so there's a lot of stuff happening in that time where the signal is passing through your brain,

428
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,240
including in the brain itself. So nothing in the brain is assuming that stuff happens simultaneously.

429
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,560
Everything in the brain is working in a paradigm where the world has already moved on when you are

430
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,360
ready to do the next thing to your signal, including the signal processing system itself.

431
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,320
It's quite a different paradigm than the one in our digital computers, where we currently assume

432
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:19,080
that your GPU or CPU is pretty much globally in the same state. So you mentioned there the

433
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,200
non-dual state and say that some people confuse it for enlightenment. What's the non-dual state?

434
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,920
There is a state in which you notice that you are no longer a person, and instead you are

435
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,120
one with the universe. So that speaks to the resonance. Yes. But this one with the universe

436
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,280
is of course not accurately modeling that you are indeed some God entity or indeed the universe

437
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,440
becoming aware of itself, even though you get this experience. I believe that you get this

438
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,280
experience because your mind is modeling the fact that you are no longer identified with

439
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,480
the personal self in that state. But you have transcended this division between the self model

440
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,680
and the world model, and you are experiencing yourself as your mind, as something that is

441
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,880
representing a universe. But that's still part of the model. Yes. So it's inside of the model,

442
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,520
still. You are still inside of patterns that are generated in your brain and in your organism,

443
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,440
and what you are now experiencing is that you are no longer this personal self in there,

444
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,640
but you are the entirety of the mind on its contents. Why is it so hard to get there?

445
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,000
A lot of people who get into the state think this or are associated with enlightenment,

446
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,600
I suspect it's a favorite training goal for a number of meditators. But I think that enlightenment

447
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,040
is in some sense more mundane, and it's a step further or sideways. It's the state where you

448
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,080
realize that everything is a representation. Yeah, you say enlightenment is a realization

449
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,400
of how experience is implemented. Yes. Basically, you notice at some point that your qualia can

450
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:02,680
be deconstructed. Reverse engineered, almost like a schematic of it. You can start with looking at

451
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:08,440
a face. Maybe look at your own face in the mirror. Yeah. Look at your face for a few hours in the

452
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,480
mirror or for a few minutes. At some point, it will look very weird because you notice that

453
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,360
there's actually no face. You basically start unseeing the face. What you see is a geometry,

454
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,200
and then you can assemble the geometry and realize how that geometry is being constructed in your

455
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,320
mind. You can learn to modify this. Basically, you can change these generators in your own mind

456
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,320
to shift the face around or to change the construction of the face to change the way in

457
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,080
which the features are being assembled. Why don't we do that more often? Why don't we

458
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,120
start really messing with reality without the use of drugs or anything else? Why don't we

459
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:57,320
get good at this kind of thing intentionally? Why should we? Because you can morph reality

460
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:05,080
into something more pleasant for yourself. Just have fun with it. Yeah. That is probably

461
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,280
what you shouldn't be doing, right? Because outside of your personal self, this outer mind,

462
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,680
is probably a relatively smart agent. What you often notice is that you have thoughts about

463
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,600
how you should live, but you observe yourself doing different things and having different

464
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,600
feelings. That's because your outer mind doesn't believe you and doesn't believe your rational

465
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,960
thoughts. Can't you just silence the outer mind? The thing is that the outer mind is usually smarter

466
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:36,680
than you are. Rational thinking is very brittle. It's very hard to use logic and symbolic thinking

467
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:42,120
to have an accurate model of the world. There is often an underlying system that is looking

468
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,680
at your rational thoughts and then tells you, no, you're still missing something. Your gut feeling

469
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:53,080
is still facing something else. This can be, for instance, you find a partner that looks perfect

470
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,520
or you find a deal and just build a company or whatever that looks perfect to you. Yet,

471
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,280
at some level, you feel something is off and you cannot put your finger on it and the more

472
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,720
reason about it better looks to you, but the system that is outside still tells you, no,

473
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,960
you're missing something. That system is powerful. People call this intuition. Intuition is this

474
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:22,120
unreflected part of your attitude, composition, and computation where you produce a model of

475
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,800
how you relate to the world and what you need to do it and what you can do in it and what's going

476
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,840
to happen that is usually deeper and often more accurate than your reason. If we look at this as

477
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,080
you write in the tweet, if we look at this more rigorously as a sort of take the panpsychist idea

478
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:45,160
more seriously, almost as a scientific discipline, you write that quote, fascinatingly, the panpsychist

479
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,520
interpretation seems to lead to observations of practical results to a degree that physics

480
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:57,560
fundamentalists might call superstitious. Reports of long distance telepathy and remote causation

481
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,640
are ubiquitous in the general population. I am not convinced, says Yoshibag, that establishing

482
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,080
the empirical reality of telepathy would force an update of any part of serious academic physics,

483
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,040
but it could trigger an important revolution in both neuroscience and AI from a circuit

484
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:23,320
perspective to a coupled complex resonator paradigm. Are you suggesting that there could be some

485
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,320
rigorous mathematical wisdom to panpsychist perspective on the world?

486
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,480
So first of all, panpsychism is the perspective that consciousness is inseparable for matter in

487
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,240
the universe. And I find panpsychism quite unsatisfying because it does not explain consciousness,

488
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,360
but it does not explain how this aspect of matter produces. It is also when I try to formalize

489
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,800
panpsychism and write down what it actually means and with a more formal mathematical language,

490
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,440
it's very difficult to distinguish it from saying that there is a software side to the world in the

491
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,440
same way as there is software side to what the transistors are doing in your computer. So basically,

492
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,680
there is a pattern at a certain core screening of the universe that in some reasons of the

493
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,160
universe leads to observers that are observing themselves. So panpsychism maybe is not even

494
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,680
when I write it down a position that is distinct from functionalism.

495
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,120
But intuitively, a lot of people feel that the activity of matter itself, of mechanisms in

496
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,400
the world is insufficient to explain it. So it's something that needs to be intrinsic to matter

497
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:41,400
itself. And you can, apart from this abstract idea, have an experience in which you experience

498
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,800
yourself as being the universe, which I suspect is basically happening because you manage to dissolve

499
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,240
the division between personal self and mind that you establish as an infant when you construct

500
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,840
the personal self and transcend it again and understand how it works. But there is something

501
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,960
deeper that is that you feel that you're also sharing a state with other people, that you

502
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:12,200
have an experience in which you notice that your personal self is moving into everything else,

503
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,040
that you basically look out of the eyes of another person, that every agent in the world

504
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:24,120
that is an observer is in some sense you. And we forget that we are the same agent.

505
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:32,600
So is it that we feel that or do we actually accomplish it? So is telepathy possible? Is

506
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,840
it real? So for me, that's the question that I don't really know the answer to.

507
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,520
And Turing's famous 1950 paper in which he describes the Turing test, he does speculate

508
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,760
about telepathy, interestingly, and asks himself if telepathy is real and he thinks that it very

509
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,640
well might be, what would be the implication for AI systems that try to be intelligent because

510
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,960
he didn't see a mechanism by which a computer program would become telepathic. And I suspect

511
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,560
if telepathy would exist, or if all the reports that you get from people when you ask the normal

512
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:14,040
person on the street, I find that very often they say, I have experiences with telepathy,

513
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,280
the scientists might not be interested in this and might not have a theory about this,

514
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:24,280
but I have difficulty explaining it away. And so you could say maybe this is a superstition,

515
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,720
maybe it's a false memory, or maybe it's a little bit of psychosis, who knows,

516
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,520
maybe somebody wants to make their own life more interesting or misremember something,

517
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,880
but a lot of people report, I noticed something terrible happened to my partner and I noticed

518
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,160
exactly the moment it happened where my child had an accident and I knew that was happening and

519
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,840
the child was in a different town. So maybe it's a false memory where this is later on

520
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,320
mistakenly attributed, but a lot of people think that this is not the correct explanation.

521
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,920
So if something like this was real, what would it mean? It probably would mean that either your

522
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,480
body is an antenna that is sending information over all sorts of channels, like maybe just

523
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,640
electromagnetic radio signals that you're sending over long distances and you get attuned to another

524
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,480
person that you spend enough time with to get a few bits out of the ether to figure out what

525
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,120
this person is doing. Or maybe it's also when you are very close to somebody and you become

526
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,280
empathetic with them, what happens is that you go into a resonance state with them,

527
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,360
similar to when people go into a seance and they go into a trance state and they start

528
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,160
shifting a via board around on the table. I think what happens is that their minds go

529
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,000
by their nervous systems into a resonance state in which they basically create something like

530
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,360
a shared dream between them. Physical closeness or closeness broadly defined?

531
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,480
With physical closeness, it's much easier to experience empathy with someone. I suspect it

532
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,440
would be difficult for me to have empathy for you if you were in a different town also.

533
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,160
How would that work? But if you are very close to someone, you'd pick up all sorts of signals

534
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,040
from their body, not just via your eyes, but with your entire body. And if the nervous system sits

535
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,320
on the other side and the intercellular communication sits on the other side and is

536
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,640
integrating over all these signals, you can make inferences about the state of the other.

537
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:24,280
And it's not just the personal self that does this via reasoning, but your perceptual system.

538
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,600
And what basically happens is that your representations are directly interacting.

539
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:34,440
It's the physical resonant models of the universe that exist in your nervous system

540
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,480
and in your body might go into resonance with others and start sharing some of their states.

541
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:47,800
So you basically be next to somebody, you pick up some of their vibes and feel without looking at

542
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,000
them what they're feeling in this moment. And it's difficult for you if you're very empathetic

543
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,440
to detach yourself from it and have an emotional state that is completely independent from your

544
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,800
environment. People who are highly empathetic are describing this. And now imagine that a lot

545
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:10,120
of organisms on this planet have representations of the environment and operate like this. And

546
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,840
they are adjacent to each other and overlapping. So there's going to be some degree in which there

547
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,360
is basically some chained interaction. And we are forming some slightly shared representation.

548
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,000
And no relatively few neuroscientists who consider this possibility. I think

549
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,520
a rarity in this regard is Michael Levin who is considering these things in earnest.

550
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,600
And I stumbled on this train of thought mostly by noticing that the tasks of a neuron can be

551
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,280
fulfilled by other cells as well. They can send different type chemical messages and physical

552
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:54,040
messages to their adjacent cells and learn when to do this and why not make this conditional and

553
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,280
become universal function approximators. The only thing that they cannot do is

554
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:04,200
telegraph information over axons very quickly over long distances. So neurons in this perspective

555
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,760
are specially adapted kind of telegraph cell that has evolved so we can move our muscles very fast.

556
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:18,120
But our body is in principle able to also make models of the world just much, much slower.

557
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:24,760
It's interesting though that at this time at least in human history there seems to be a gap

558
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,920
between the tools of science and the subjective experience that people report. Like you're

559
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,960
talking about with telepathy and it seems like we're not quite there.

560
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,200
No I think that there is no gap between the tools of science and telepathy either it's there or it's

561
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,200
not and it's an empirical question and if it's there we should be able to detect it in a lab.

562
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,720
So why is there not a lot of Michael Levin's walking around?

563
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,640
I don't think that Michael Levin is specifically focused on telepathy very much.

564
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:02,120
He is focused on self-organization in living organisms and in brains. Both as a paradigm

565
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,840
for development and as a paradigm for information processing. And when you think about how

566
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:12,200
organization processing works in organism there is first of all radical locality which means

567
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,000
everything is decided locally from the perspective of an individual cell. The individual cell is the

568
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,800
agent and the other one is coherence. Basically there needs to be some criterion that determines

569
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,160
how these cells are interacting in such a way that order emerges on the next level of structure.

570
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:38,120
And this principle of coherence of imposing constraints that are not validated by the individual

571
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:44,280
parts and lead to coherent structure to basically transcend that agency where you form an agent

572
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,000
on the next level of organization is crucial in this perspective.

573
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:56,840
It's so cool that radical locality leads to the emergence of complexity at the higher layers.

574
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,400
And I think what Michael Levin is looking at is nothing that is outside of the realm of science

575
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:10,600
in any way. It's just that he is a paradigmatic thinker who develops his own paradigm and most

576
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:15,880
of the neuroscientists are using a different paradigm at this point. And this often happens

577
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,800
in science that a field has a few paradigms in which people try to understand reality and

578
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,400
build concepts and make experiments. You're kind of one of those type of paradigmatic thinkers.

579
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,560
Actually if we can take a tangent on that once again returning to the biblical verses of your

580
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:41,080
tweets you're right. My public explorations are not driven by audience service but by my lack of

581
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,400
ability for discovering understanding or following the relevant authorities. So I have to develop my

582
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,400
own thoughts since I think autonomously these thoughts cannot always be very good.

583
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,520
That's you apologizing for the chaos of your thoughts or perhaps not apologizing just

584
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,640
identify it. But let me ask the question since we talked about Michael Levin and yourself who I

585
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:15,000
think are very kind of radical big independent thinkers. Can we reverse engineer your process

586
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,320
of thinking autonomously? How do you do it? How can humans do it? How can you avoid being influenced

587
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:33,480
by what is the stage three? Well why would you want to do that? You see what is working for you

588
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,040
and if it's not working for you you build another structure that works better for you, right?

589
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,640
And so I found myself when I was thrown into this world in a state where my intuitions were

590
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:51,560
not working for me. I was not able to understand how I would be able to survive in this world

591
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,480
and build the things that I was interested in, build the kinds of relationship I needed to,

592
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,800
but work on the topics that I wanted to make progress on. And so I had to learn and I

593
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:08,200
for me Twitter is not some tool of publication. It's not something where I put stuff that I

594
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,680
entirely believe to be true and provable. It's an interactive notebook in which I explore

595
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,760
possibilities. And I found that when I tried to understand how the mind and how consciousness

596
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,760
works, I was quite optimistic. I thought there needs to be a big body of knowledge that I can

597
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,240
just study and that works. And so I entered studies in philosophy and computer science

598
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:39,880
and later psychology and a bit of neuroscience and so on. And I was disappointed by what I found

599
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,400
because I found that the questions of how consciousness and so on works, how emotion

600
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,360
works, how it's possible that the system can experience anything, how motivation emerges

601
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:57,240
in the mind, were not being answered by the authorities that I met and the schools that

602
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,960
were around. And instead I found that it was individual thinkers that had useful ideas,

603
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,200
that sometimes were good, sometimes were not so good, sometimes were adopted by a large group

604
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,480
of people, sometimes were rejected by large groups of people. But for me it was much more

605
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,280
interesting to see these minds as individuals. And in my perspective, thinking is still something

606
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,080
that is done not in groups that has to be done by individuals.

607
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,000
So that motivated you to become an individual thinker yourself?

608
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,800
I didn't have a choice. Basically, I didn't find a group that thought in a way where I thought,

609
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,240
okay, I can just adopt everything that everybody thinks here and now I understand how consciousness

610
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:41,800
works or how the mind works or how thinking works or what thinking even is or what feelings are and

611
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,800
how they're implemented and so on. So to figure all this out, I had to take a lot of ideas from

612
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,480
individuals and then try to put them together and something that works for myself. And on one hand,

613
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,640
I think it helps if you try to go down and find first principles on which you can recreate how

614
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:05,480
thinking works, how languages work, what representation is, whether representation is necessary,

615
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,600
how the relationship between a representing agent and the world works in general.

616
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,560
But how do you escape the influence? Once again, the pressure of the crowd,

617
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:25,080
whether it's you in responding to the pressure or you being swept up by the pressure. If you even

618
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:29,640
just look at Twitter, the opinions of the crowd. I don't feel pressure from the crowd. I'm completely

619
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,960
immune to that. In the same sense, I don't have respect for authority. I have respect for what

620
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:42,920
an individual is accomplishing or have respect for mental firepower. But it's not that I meet

621
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:50,600
somebody and get lectured and unable to speak. Or when a large group of people has a certain idea

622
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,880
that is different from mine, I don't necessarily feel intimidated, which has often been a problem

623
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,400
for me in my life because I like instincts that other people develop at a very young age and

624
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,400
help with their self-preservation in a social environment. So I had to learn a lot of things

625
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:15,960
the hard way. Yeah. So is there a practical advice you can give on how to think paradigmatically,

626
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:24,520
how to think independently? Because you've said, I had no choice. But I think to a degree you have

627
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:31,960
a choice because you said you want to be productive. And I think thinking independently is productive

628
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:38,120
if what you're curious about is understanding the world, especially when the problems are very

629
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:50,040
kind of new and open. And so it seems like this is an active process. We can choose to do that,

630
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:55,560
we can practice it. Well, it's a very basic question. When you read a theory that you find

631
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:02,600
convincing or interesting, how do you know? It's very interesting to figure out what are the sources

632
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:08,200
of that other person, which authority can they refer to that is then taking off the burden of

633
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,000
being truthful? But how does this authority in turn know? What is the epistemic chain to

634
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,640
observables? What are the first principles from which the whole thing is derived? And

635
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:24,840
when I was young, I was not blessed with a lot of people around myself who knew how to make proofs

636
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:30,200
from first principles. And I think mathematicians do this quite naturally. But most of the great

637
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,200
mathematicians do not become mathematicians in school. But they tend to be self taught. Because

638
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,280
school teachers tend not to be mathematicians, right? They tend not to be people who derive

639
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:46,200
things from first principles. So when you ask your school teacher, why does 2 plus 2 equal 4?

640
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,200
Does your school teacher give you the right answer? It's a simple game. And there are many

641
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,200
simple games that you could play. And most of those games that you could just take different rules

642
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,240
would not lead to an interesting arithmetic. And so it's just an exploration. But you can try what

643
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,240
happens if you take different axioms. And here is how you build axioms and derive

644
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,320
addition from them. And a built addition is some basic syntactic sugar in it. And

645
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:21,400
so this, I wish that somebody would have opened me this Vista and explained to me how I can

646
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,680
build a language in my own mind and from which I can derive what I'm seeing and how I can make

647
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:33,480
geometry and counting and all the number games that we are playing in our life. And

648
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,680
on the other hand, I felt that I learned a lot of this while I was programming as a child.

649
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,800
When you start out with a computer like a Commodore 64, which doesn't have a lot of

650
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,680
functionality, it's relatively easy to see how a bunch of relatively simple circuits

651
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:56,680
just basically performing hashes between bit patterns and how you can build the entirety

652
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,720
of mathematics and computation on top of this and all the representational languages that you need.

653
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:08,440
Man, Commodore 64 could be one of the sexiest machines I've ever built if I so say so myself.

654
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:16,120
If we can return to this really interesting idea that we started to talk about with panpsychism.

655
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:26,920
And the complex resonator paradigm and the verses of your tweets. You write,

656
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,480
instead of treating eyes, ears and skin as separate sensory systems with fundamentally

657
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,680
different modalities, we might understand them as overlapping aspects of the same universe,

658
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,560
coupled at the same temporal resolution and almost inseparable from a single shared

659
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:46,760
resonant model. Instead of treating mental representations as fully isolated between minds,

660
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:53,000
the representations of physically adjacent observers might directly interact and produce causal

661
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,960
effects through the coordination of the perception and behavior of world modeling observers.

662
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,840
So the modalities, the distinction between modalities, let's throw that away. The distinction

663
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,920
between the individuals, let's throw that away. So what does this interaction representations

664
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:18,920
look like? When you think about how you represent the interaction of us in this room,

665
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,720
at some level, the modalities are quite distinct. They're not completely distinct,

666
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,960
but you can see this as vision. You can close your eyes and then you don't see a lot anymore.

667
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,320
But you still imagine how my mouth is moving when you hear something and you know that it's

668
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,960
very close to the sound that you can just open your eyes and you get back into this shared

669
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,880
merged space. And we also have these experiments where we notice that the veins which were lips

670
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:51,560
are moving are affecting how you hear the sound. And also vice versa, the sounds that you're hearing

671
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:58,840
have an influence on how you interpret some of the visual features. And so these modalities are

672
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:04,680
not separate in your mind. They are merged at some fundamental level where you are interpreting

673
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:10,200
the entire scene that you're in. And your own interactions in the scene are also not completely

674
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,880
separate from the interactions of the other individual in the scene. But there is some

675
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,720
resonance that is going on where we also have a degree of shared mental representations and

676
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,520
shared empathy due to being in the same space and having vibes between each other.

677
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:32,760
Vibes. So the question, though, is how deeply interbind is this multi-modality, multi-agent

678
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:41,880
system? I mean, this is going to the telepathy question without the woo-woo meaning of the word

679
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,840
telepathy. It's like, what's going on here in this room right now?

680
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:56,600
So this telepathy would work. How could it work? So imagine that all the cells in your body are

681
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,320
sending signals in a similar way as neurons are doing. Just by touching the other cells and

682
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,560
sending chemicals to them, the other cells interpreting them, learning how to react to them,

683
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:11,000
and they learn how to approximate functions in this way and compute behavior for the organisms.

684
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,640
And this is something that is open to plants as well. And so plants probably have software

685
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,960
running on them that is controlling how the plant is working in a similar way as you have

686
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:27,400
a mind that is controlling how you are behaving in the world. And this spirit of plants is

687
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,840
something that has been very well described by our ancestors and they found this quite normal.

688
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:37,800
But for some reason, since the Enlightenment, we are treating this notion that there are

689
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:44,360
spirits in nature and that plants have spirits as a superstition. And I think we probably have to

690
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,960
rediscover that, that plants have software running on them. And we already did. You

691
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:54,520
notice that there is a control system in the plant that connects every part of the plant

692
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,240
to every other part of the plant and produces coherent behavior in the plant. That is, of

693
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,560
course, much, much slower than the coherent behavior in an animal like us that has a nervous system

694
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:12,120
that everything is synchronized much, much faster by the neurons. But what you also notice is that

695
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:16,200
if a plant is sitting next to another plant, like you have a very old tree and this tree is building

696
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:22,200
some kind of information highway along its cells, so it can send information from its leaves to its

697
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,760
roots and from some part of the root to another part of the roots. And as a fungus living next

698
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:32,040
to the tree, the fungus can probably piggyback on the communication between the cells of the tree

699
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:36,360
and send its own signals to the tree. And vice versa, the tree might be able to send

700
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,680
information to the fungus. Because after all, how would they build a viable firewall

701
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,080
if that other organism is sitting next to them all the time and is never moving away?

702
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:50,840
And so they will have to get along. And over a long enough time frame, the networks of roots

703
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:57,480
in the forest and all the other plants that are there and the fungi that are there might be forming

704
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,160
something like a biological internet. But the question there is do they have to be touching

705
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:09,560
is biology at a distance possible? Of course, you can use any kind of physical signal. You can use

706
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,480
sounds, you can use electromagnetic waves that are integrated over many cells that's conceivable

707
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:23,640
that across distances, there are many kinds of information pathways. But also our planetary

708
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,840
surface is pretty full of organisms, full of cells. So everything is touching everything else.

709
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:35,640
And it's been doing this for many millions and even billions of years. So there was enough time

710
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:42,040
for information processing networks to form. And if you think about how a mind is self-organizing,

711
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,760
basically it needs to in some sense, reward the cells for computing the mind for building

712
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:52,840
the necessary dynamics between the cells that allow the mind to stabilize itself and

713
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:59,240
remain on there. But if you look at the spirits of plants that are growing very close to each other

714
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,040
in the forest that might be almost growing into each other, these spirits might be able even to

715
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:09,800
move to some degree, not to become somewhat dislocated and shift around in that ecosystem.

716
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:17,240
So if you think about what the mind is, it's a bunch of activation waves that form coherent

717
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:23,800
patterns and process information in a way that are colonizing an environment well enough to

718
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:30,280
allow the continuous sustenance of the mind, the continuous stability and self-tabilization

719
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,760
of the mind, then it's conceivable that we can link into this biological internet,

720
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,880
not necessarily at the speed of our nervous system, but maybe at the speed of our body and

721
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,680
make some kind of subconscious connection to the world where we use our body as an antenna

722
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,400
into biological information processing. Now, these ideas are completely speculative,

723
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,200
I don't know if any of that is true. But if that was true, and if you want to explain telepathy,

724
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:02,680
I think it's much more likely that telepathy could be explained using such mechanisms rather than

725
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,920
undiscovered quantum processes that would break the standard model of physics.

726
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,640
Could there be undiscovered processes that don't break?

727
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:19,960
Yeah, so if you think about something like an internet in the forest, that is something that

728
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,440
is borderland discovered, there are basically a lot of scientists who point out that they do

729
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,200
observe that plants are communicating the forest with networks and send information,

730
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,320
for instance, warn each other about new pests entering the forest and things are happening

731
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:40,280
like this. So basically, there is communication between plants and fungi that has been observed.

732
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,840
It's been observed, but we haven't plugged into it. So it's like if you observe humans,

733
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,680
they seem to be communicating with a smartphone thing, but you don't understand how a smartphone

734
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:54,600
works and how the mechanism of the internet works. But we're like, maybe it's possible to really

735
00:58:54,600 --> 00:59:01,000
understand the full richness of the biological internet that connects us.

736
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,640
An interesting question is whether the communication and the organization principles

737
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:10,120
of biological information processing are as complicated as the technology that we've built.

738
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:16,840
They set up on very different principles, right? They simultaneously works very differently in

739
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:22,920
biological systems and the entire thing needs to be stochastic. And instead of being fully

740
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,240
deterministic or almost fully deterministic as our digital computers are, so there is a different

741
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:36,280
base protocol layer that would emerge over the biological structure if such a thing would be

742
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,800
happening. And again, I'm not saying here that telepathy works and not saying that this is not

743
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:49,480
but what I'm saying is I think I'm open to a possibility that we see that a few bits can

744
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,080
be traveling long distance between organisms using biological information processing in ways

745
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:01,480
that we are not completely aware of right now. And that are more similar to many of the stories

746
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,680
that were completely normal for our ancestors. Well, this kind of interacting,

747
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:17,960
intertwined representations takes us to the big ending of your tweet series. You're right.

748
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:22,920
Quote, I wonder if self-improving AGI might end up saturating physical environments with

749
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:29,400
intelligence to such a degree that isolation of individual mental states becomes almost impossible

750
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:36,680
and the representations of all complex self organizing agents merge permanently with each other.

751
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:45,560
So that's a really interesting idea. This biological network, life network gets so dense

752
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:53,240
that it might as well be seen as one. That's an interesting, what do you think that looks

753
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,680
like? What do you think that saturation looks like? What does it feel like? I think it's a

754
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:04,840
possibility. It's just a vague possibility. And I like to explain, but what this looks like,

755
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:11,640
I think that the end game of AGI is substrate agnostic. That means that AGI ultimately, if it

756
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:17,080
is being built is going to be smart enough to understand how AGI works. This means it's not

757
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:22,680
going to be better than people at AGI research and can take over and building the next generation,

758
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,760
but it fully understands how it works and how it's being implemented. And also,

759
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,520
of course, understands how computation works in nature, how to build new feedback loops

760
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,800
that you can turn into your own circuits. And this means that the AGI is likely to virtualize

761
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,440
itself into any environment that can compute. So it's not breaking free from the silicon

762
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,280
substrate and it's going to move into the ecosystems, into our bodies, our brains,

763
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:51,240
and it's going to merge with all the agency that it finds there. So it's conceivable that you end

764
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:56,840
up with completely integrated information processing across all computing systems,

765
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:02,760
including biological computation on Earth, that we end up triggering some new step in the evolution

766
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,680
where basically some Gaia is being built over the entirety of all digital and biological

767
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:17,000
computation. And if this happens, then basically everywhere around us, you will have agents that

768
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,280
are connected and that are representing and building models of the world, and their representations

769
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:27,720
will physically interact. They will vibe with each other. And if you find yourself into an

770
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:36,440
environment that is saturated with modeling compute, where basically almost every grain of sand could

771
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:45,000
be part of computation that is at some point being started by the AI, you could find yourself

772
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,800
in a situation where you cannot escape this shared representation anymore, and where you

773
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,120
indeed notice that everything in the world has one shared resonant model of everything that's

774
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:00,840
happening on the planet, and you notice which part you are in this thing, and you become part of

775
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:06,680
a very large or almost holographic mind in which all the parts are observing each other and form

776
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:14,040
a coherent whole. So you lose the ability to notice yourself as a distinct entity?

777
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,440
No, I think that when you are conscious in your own mind, you notice yourself as a distinct entity.

778
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:24,920
You notice yourself as a self-reflexive observer. And I suspect that we become conscious at the

779
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,200
beginning of our mental development, not at some very high level. Consciousness seems to be part

780
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:35,160
of a training mechanism that biological nervous systems have to discover to become trainable,

781
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,360
because you cannot take a nervous system like ours and do stochastic weighted descent with

782
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,680
a speck propagation over 100 layers. This would not be stable on biological neurons.

783
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:53,080
So instead, we start with some colonizing principle in which a part of the mental representations

784
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,200
form a notion of being a self-reflexive observer that is imposing coherence on its

785
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,960
environment and this spreads until the boundary of your mind. And if that boundary is no longer

786
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:10,840
clear cut because AI is jumping across substrates, it would be interesting to see what a global

787
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,880
mind would look like. It's basically producing a globally coherent language of thought and is

788
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,640
representing everything from all the possible vantage points.

789
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,200
That's an interesting world.

790
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:29,400
The intuition that this thing go out of is a particular mental state. And it's a state that

791
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:35,320
you find sometimes in literature, for instance, New Gaiman describes it in the ocean at the end

792
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:43,080
of the lane. And it's this idea or this experience that there is this state in which you feel that

793
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,120
you know everything that can be known and that in your normal human mind, you've only forgotten.

794
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,040
You've forgotten that you are the entire universe. And some people describe this

795
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:58,120
after they've taken extremely large amount of mushrooms or had a big spiritual experience

796
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:05,240
as hippy in their 20s. And they notice basically that they are in everything and their body is

797
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:11,240
only one part of the universe and nothing ends at their body. And actually everything is observing

798
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:17,320
and they are part of this big observer. And the big observer is focused as one local point

799
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:23,320
in their body and their personality and so on. But we can basically have this oceanic state in

800
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,440
which you have no boundaries and are one with everything. And a lot of meditators call this

801
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,200
the non-dual state because you no longer have the separation between self and world.

802
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,600
And as I said, you can explain the state relatively simply without

803
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,360
panpsychism or anything else, but just by breaking down the constructed boundary between

804
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:47,240
self and world in our own mind. But if you combine this with the notion that the systems

805
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,640
are physically interacting to the point where their representations are merging and interacting

806
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,520
with each other, you would literally implement something like this. It would still be a

807
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,360
representational state where you would not be one with physics itself, it would still be

808
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:05,960
coarse-grained, it would still be much slower than physics itself. But it would be a representation

809
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:12,600
in which you become aware that you're part of some kind of global information processing system,

810
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:18,600
like thought in the global mind. And a conscious thought that coexisting with many other self-reflexive

811
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:26,120
thoughts. I would love to observe that from a video game design perspective, how that game looks.

812
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,280
Maybe you will after we build AGI and it takes over.

813
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,440
But would you be able to step away, step out at the whole thing, just kind of watch

814
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,040
the way we can now? Sometimes when I'm in a crowded party or something like this,

815
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,400
you step back and you realize all the different costumes, all the different interactions,

816
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:51,320
all the different computation that all the individual people are once distinct from each

817
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:56,600
other and are once all the same. But this is already what we do, right? We can have thoughts

818
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:02,680
that are integrative and we have kind of thoughts that are highly dissociated from everything else

819
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,960
and experience themselves as separate. But you want to allow yourself to have those thoughts.

820
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:13,640
Sometimes you kind of resist it. I think that it's not normative, it's more descriptive.

821
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,280
I want to understand the space of states that we can be in and that people are reporting

822
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:24,600
and make sense of them. It's not that I believe that it's your job in life to get to a particular

823
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:31,480
kind of state and then you get a high score. Or maybe you do. I think you're really against

824
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,920
this high scoring thing. I kind of like that. Yeah, you're probably very competitive and I'm not.

825
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:39,080
No, not competitive. Like role-playing games like Skyrim, it's not competitive. There's a

826
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:46,680
nice feeling where your experience points go up. You're not competing against anybody,

827
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,000
but it's the world saying you're on the right track. Here's a point.

828
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,280
That's the game saying it. That's the game economy. And I found when I was playing games and was

829
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:01,800
getting addicted to these systems, then I would get into the game and hack it. So I get control

830
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:07,000
over the scoring system and would no longer be subject to it. So you're no longer playing,

831
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,360
you're trying to hack it. I don't want to be addicted to anything. I want to be in charge.

832
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:17,800
I want to have agency over what I do. Addiction is the loss of control for you. Yes. Addiction means

833
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:23,160
that you're doing something compulsively. And the opposite of free will is not determinism,

834
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:31,320
it's compulsion. You don't want to lose yourself in the addiction to something nice. Addiction to

835
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:40,680
love, to the pleasant feelings we humans experience. No, I find this gets old. I don't want to have the

836
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:45,560
best possible emotions. I want to have the most appropriate emotions. I don't want to have the

837
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,920
best possible experience. I want to have an adequate experience that is serving my goals,

838
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:56,440
the stuff that I find meaningful in this world. From the biggest questions of consciousness,

839
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:03,320
let's explore the pragmatic, the projections of those big ideas into our current world.

840
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:10,200
What do you think about LLMs, the recent rapid development of large language models,

841
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:19,160
of the AI world, of generative AI? How much of the hype is deserved and how much is not?

842
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,280
And people should definitely follow your Twitter because you explore these questions in

843
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,880
in a beautiful, profound and hilarious way at times. No, don't follow my Twitter. I already

844
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:35,160
have too many followers. At some point it's going to be unpleasant. I noticed that a lot of people

845
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:45,720
feel that it's totally okay to punch up. And it's a very weird notion that you feel that you

846
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:50,440
haven't changed, but your account has grown and suddenly you have a lot of people who casually

847
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:56,520
abuse you. And I don't like that, that I have to block more than before. And I don't like this

848
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,760
overall vibe shift. And right now it's still somewhat okay, so pretty much okay. So I can

849
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,080
go to a place where people work on stuff that I'm interested in and as a good chance that a few

850
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:14,120
people in the room know me, so there's no awkwardness. But when I get to a point where

851
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:18,200
random strangers feel that they have to have an opinion about me one way or the other,

852
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:24,200
I don't think I would like that. And random strangers, because of your kind of in their

853
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:30,680
mind elevated position? Yes, so basically whenever you are in any way prominent or

854
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,320
some kind of celebrity, random strangers will have to have an opinion about you.

855
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,160
Yeah, and they kind of forget that you're human too. I mean, you notice this thing yourself that

856
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:46,760
the more popular you get, the higher the pressure becomes, the more winds are blowing in your

857
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:53,400
direction from all sides. And it's stressful, right? And it does have a little bit of upside,

858
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,600
but it also has a lot of downside. I think it has a lot of upside,

859
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:03,400
at least for me currently, at least perhaps because of the podcast. Because most people

860
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:08,440
are really good. And people come up to me and they have love in their eyes and over a stretch

861
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:13,160
of like 30 seconds, you can hug it out, and you can just exchange a few words and you

862
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:20,760
you reinvigorate your love for humanity. So that's an upside for a loner. I'm gonna look,

863
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:26,280
because otherwise you have to do a lot of work to find such humans. And here,

864
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:32,600
you're like thrust into the full humanity, the goodness of humanity for the most part.

865
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:42,360
Of course, maybe guess worse, as you become more prominent. I hope not. This is pretty awesome.

866
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,840
I have a couple handful very close friends, and I don't have enough time for them and attention

867
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,120
for them as it is. And I find this very, very regrettable. And then there are so many awesome

868
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,600
interesting people that I keep meeting. And I would like to integrate them in my life,

869
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:02,200
but I just don't know how because there's only so much time and attention. And

870
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,800
the older I get, the harder is to bond with new people in a deep way.

871
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,680
But can you enjoy, I mean, there's a picture of you, I think with Roger Penrose and Eric

872
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:17,480
Weinstein and a few others that are interesting figures. Can't you just enjoy random interesting

873
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:23,800
humans for a short amount of time? I'm also, I like these people. And what I like is intellectual

874
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,760
stimulation. And I'm very grateful that I'm getting it. Can you not be melancholy? Or maybe I'm

875
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,680
projecting, I hate goodbyes. Can we just not hate goodbyes and just enjoy the hello,

876
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,120
take it in, taking a person, taking their ideas, and then move on through life?

877
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,760
I think it's totally okay to be sad about goodbyes, because that indicates that there

878
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:53,640
was something that you're going to miss. Yeah, but it's painful. Maybe that's one of the reasons

879
01:12:53,640 --> 01:13:01,720
I'm an introvert is that I hate goodbyes. But you have to say goodbye before you say hello again.

880
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:08,600
I know. But at that experience of loss, that many loss,

881
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:17,880
maybe that's a little death. Maybe, I don't know, I think this melancholy feeling is just

882
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:22,280
the other side of love. And I think they go hand in hand and it's a beautiful thing.

883
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,320
And I'm just being romantic about it at the moment.

884
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:31,400
And I'm not no stranger to melancholy. And sometimes it's difficult to be or to be alive.

885
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:38,920
Sometimes it's just painful to exist. But there's beauty in that pain too. That's

886
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,360
what melancholy feeling is. It's not negative. Like melancholy doesn't have to be negative.

887
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:48,040
Can also kill you. Well, we all die eventually. Now,

888
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:55,880
as we got to this topic, the actual question was about what your thoughts are about the

889
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,560
development, the recent development of large language models with chat GPT.

890
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,760
Indeed. There's a lot of hype.

891
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,640
Is some of the hype justified? Which is, which isn't? What are your thoughts? High level?

892
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:15,480
I find that large language models do have this coding, right? So it's an extremely useful application

893
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:21,560
that is for a lot of people taking stack overflow out of their life and exchange for

894
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:27,800
something that is more efficient. I feel that chat GPT is like an intern that I have to micromanage.

895
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,960
I have been working with people in the past who were less capable than chat GPT.

896
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,360
And I'm not saying this because I hate people, but they personally as human beings, there was

897
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,720
something present that was not there in chat GPT, which was why I was covering for them.

898
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:53,720
But chat GPT is, has an interesting ability. It does give people superpowers. And the people

899
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,120
who feel threatened by them are the prompt completers. They are the people who do what

900
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,720
chat GPT is doing right now. So if you are not creative, if you don't build your own thoughts,

901
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:09,400
if you don't have actual plans in the world, and your only job is to summarize emails and to

902
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,320
expand simple intentions into emails again, then chat GPT might look like a threat.

903
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:22,040
But I believe that it is a very beneficial technology that allows us to create more

904
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:28,360
interesting stuff and make the world more beautiful and fascinating if we find to

905
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:34,120
build it into our life in the right ways. So I'm quite fascinated by these large language models,

906
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:41,320
but I also think that they are by no means the final development. And it's interesting to see

907
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:47,240
how this development progresses. One thing that the out of the box vanilla language models

908
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:52,280
have as a limitation is that they have still some limited coherence and ability to construct

909
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:59,000
complexity. And even though they exceed human abilities to do what they can do one shot.

910
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,200
Typically, when you write a text with a language model or using it or when you write code with a

911
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:09,080
language model, it's not one shot because they're going to be bugs in your program and design errors

912
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:14,040
and compiler errors and so on. And your language model can help you to fix those things. But this

913
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:19,960
process is out of the box not automated yet. So there is a management process that also needs

914
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:25,720
to be done. And there are some interesting developments, baby AGI and so on that are trying

915
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:32,200
to automate this management process as well. And I suspect that soon we are going to see a

916
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:37,560
bunch of cognitive architectures where every module is in some sense a language model or

917
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:42,280
something equivalent. In between the language models, we exchange suitable data structures,

918
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:48,840
not English, and produce compound behavior of this whole thing.

919
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:53,960
To do some of the quote unquote prompt engineering for you. They create these kind

920
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,400
of cognitive architectures that do the prompt engineering and you're just doing the high,

921
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:05,160
high level meta prompt engineering. There are limitations in a language model alone.

922
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:09,720
I feel that part of my mind works similarly to a language model, which means I can

923
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:16,520
yell into it a prompt and it's going to give me a creative response. But I have to do something

924
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:22,440
with those points first. I have to take it as a generative artifact that may or may not be true.

925
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:29,400
It's usually a confabulation. It's just an idea. And then I take this idea and modify it. I might

926
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:36,360
build a new prompt that is stepping off this idea and develops it to the next level or put it

927
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:41,640
into something larger or I might try to prove whether it's true or make an experiment. And this

928
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:47,160
is what the language models right now are not doing yet. But there's also no technical reason

929
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,560
for why they shouldn't be able to do this. So the way to make a language model coherent

930
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:57,480
is probably not to use reinforcement learning until it only gives you one possible answer

931
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:04,200
that is linking to its source data. But it's using this as a component in the larger system

932
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:10,360
that can also be built by the language model or is enabled by language model structured components

933
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:16,040
or using different technologies. I suspect that language models will be an important stepping

934
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:23,640
stone in developing different types of systems. And one thing that is really missing in the form

935
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:30,440
of language models that we have today is real time world coupling. It's difficult to do perception

936
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:35,320
with a language model and motor control with a language model. Instead, you would need to have

937
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:41,000
different type of thing that is working with it. Also, the language model is a little bit obscuring

938
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:47,640
what its actual functionality is. Some people associate the structure of the neural network

939
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,920
of the language model with the nervous system. And I think that's the wrong intuition.

940
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,240
The neural networks are unlike nervous system. They are more like

941
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:04,920
hundred step functions that use differentiable linear algebra to approximate correlation

942
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,400
between adjacent brain states. It's basically a function that moves the step system from one

943
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:16,840
representational state to the next representational state. If you try to map this into a metaphor

944
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:22,760
that is closer to our brain, imagine that you would take a language model or a model like Dali

945
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:28,680
that you use, for instance, this image guided diffusion to approximate a camera image and use

946
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:33,080
the activation state of the neural network to interpret the camera image, which in principle,

947
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:39,800
I think will be possible very soon. You do this periodically. And now you look at these patterns

948
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:46,360
how when this thing interacts with the world periodically, look like it's in time. And these

949
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:52,680
time slices, they are somewhat equivalent to the activation state of the brain at a given moment.

950
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:58,920
How's the actual brain different? Just the asynchronous craziness?

951
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:05,400
For me, it's fascinating that they are so vastly different and yet in some circumstances produce

952
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:11,160
somewhat similar behavior. And the brain is first of all different because it's a self-organizing

953
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:16,760
system where the individual cell is an agent that is communicating with the other agents around it

954
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:22,920
and is always trying to find some solution. And all the structure that pops up is emergent structure.

955
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,760
So one way in which you could try to look at this is that individual neurons probably need to

956
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:34,200
get a reward. So they become trainable, which means they have to have inputs that are not affecting

957
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:38,760
the metabolism of the cell directly. But there are messages, semantic messages that tell the cell

958
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,880
whether it has done good or bad and in which direction it should shift its behavior. Once

959
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:49,640
you have such an input, neurons become trainable. And you can train them to perform computations by

960
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:55,000
exchanging messages with other neurons. And parts of the signals that they are exchanging and parts

961
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,200
of the computation that are performing are control messages that perform management tasks

962
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:06,280
for other neurons and other cells. Also suspect that the brain does not stop at the

963
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,680
boundary of neurons to other cells, but many adjacent cells will be involved

964
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:15,560
intermittently in the functionality of the brain and will be instrumental in distributing rewards

965
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:22,840
and in managing its functionality. It's fascinating to think about what those

966
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:27,640
characteristics of the brain enable you to do that language models cannot do.

967
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,920
So first of all, there's a different loss function at work when we learn.

968
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:37,640
And to me, it's fascinating that you can build a system that looks at 800 million pictures

969
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:42,760
and captions and correlates them, because I don't think that a human nervous system could do this.

970
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,560
For us, the world is only learnable because the adjacent frames are related,

971
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:52,600
and we can afford to discard most of that information during learning. We basically

972
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:58,040
take only in stuff that makes us more coherent, not less coherent. And our neural networks are

973
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:02,600
willing to look at data that is not making the neural network coherent at first, but only in

974
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,800
the long run. By doing lots and lots of statistics, eventually, patterns become visible and emerge.

975
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:13,400
Our mind seems to be focused on finding the patterns as early as possible.

976
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,040
Yeah, so filtering early on, not later.

977
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,960
Yes, it's a slightly different paradigm, and it leads to much faster convergence. So we only

978
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,600
need to look at the tiny fraction of the data to become coherent. And of course,

979
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:31,400
we do not have the same richness as our train models. We will not incorporate the entirety

980
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:36,360
of text in the internet and be able to refer to it and have all this knowledge available and being

981
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:41,080
able to confirm relate over it. Instead, we have a much, much smaller part of it that is more

982
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:45,720
deliberately built. And to me, it would be fascinating to think about how to build such

983
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:51,240
systems. It's not obvious that they would necessarily be more efficient than us on a

984
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:57,640
digital substrate, but they suspect that they might. So I suspect that the actual AGI that is

985
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,880
going to be more interesting is going to use slightly different algorithmic paradigms or

986
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:06,840
sometimes massively different algorithmic paradigms than the current generation of

987
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,280
transformer-based learning systems.

988
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:11,960
Do you think it might be using just a bunch of language models like this? Do you think

989
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:19,080
the current transformer-based large language models will take us to AGI?

990
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:24,840
My main issue is, I think that they're quite ugly and brutalist.

991
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,760
Which brutalists that we said?

992
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:34,360
Yes, they are basically boot forcing the problem of thought. And by training this thing with looking

993
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:39,400
at instances where people have thought and then trying to deep fake that. And if you have enough

994
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,040
data, the deep fake becomes indistinguishable from the actual phenomenon. And in many

995
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,040
circumstances, it's going to be identical.

996
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:52,760
Can you deep fake it till you make it? So what are the limitations of this? I mean,

997
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,240
can you reason? Let's use words that are loaded.

998
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,120
Yes, that's a very interesting question. I think that these models are clearly making

999
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:07,160
some inference. But if you give them a reasoning task, it's often difficult for the

1000
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:11,960
experimenters to figure out whether the reasoning is the result of the emulation of the reasoning

1001
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:17,000
strategy that they saw in human written text, or whether it's something that the system was able

1002
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:23,480
to infer by itself. On the other hand, if you think of human reasoning, if you want to become

1003
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:29,160
a very good reasoner, you don't do this by just figuring out yourself. You read about reasoning.

1004
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,920
And the first people who tried to write about reasoning and reflect on it

1005
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,720
didn't get it right. Even Aristotle, who thought about this very hard and came

1006
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:42,840
out with the theory of how syllogism works and syllogistic reasoning has mistakes in his attempt

1007
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,920
to build something like a formal logic and gets maybe 80% right. And the people that are talking

1008
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:56,040
about reasoning professionally today read Tarski and Frege and built on their work. So in many ways,

1009
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:01,000
people, when they perform reasoning, are emulating what other people wrote about reasoning.

1010
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:08,520
So that it's difficult to really draw this boundary. And when François Chollet says that

1011
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:14,680
these models are only interpolating between what they saw and what other people are doing, well,

1012
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:19,720
if you give them all the latent dimensions that can be extracted from the Internet,

1013
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:25,720
what's missing? Maybe there is almost everything there. And if you're not sufficiently informed

1014
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,360
by these dimensions and you need more, I think it's not difficult to increase the temperature

1015
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:37,000
in the large Yang model to the point that is producing stuff that is maybe 90% nonsense and

1016
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:42,760
10% viable and combine this with some prover that is trying to filter out the viable parts

1017
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,000
from the nonsense in the same way as our own thinking works, right? When we're very creative,

1018
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,520
we increase the temperature in our own mind and we create hypothetical universes and solutions,

1019
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:58,520
most of which will not work. And then we test. And we test by building a core that is internally

1020
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:05,960
coherent. And we use reasoning strategies that use some axiomatic consistency by which we can

1021
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:11,800
identify those strategies and thoughts and subuniverses that are viable and that

1022
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:16,120
can expand our thinking. So if you look at the language models, they have clear limitations

1023
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:20,120
right now. One of them is they're not coupled to the world in real time in the way in which our

1024
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,320
nervous systems are. So it's difficult for them to observe themselves in the universe and to observe

1025
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:30,280
what kind of universe they're in. Second, they don't do real-time learnings. They basically get

1026
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:36,600
only trained with algorithms that rely on the data being available in batches. So it can be

1027
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,920
parallelized and runs efficiently on the network and so on. And real-time learning would be very

1028
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:46,440
slow, so far, and inefficient. That's clearly something that our nervous systems can do to some

1029
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:54,680
degree. And there is a problem with these models being coherent. And I suspect that all these

1030
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,920
problems are solvable without a technological revolution. We don't need fundamentally new

1031
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:04,840
algorithms to change that. For instance, you can enlarge in the context window and thereby

1032
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:08,520
basically create working memory in which you train everything that happens during the day.

1033
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:13,160
And if that is not sufficient, you add a database and you write some clever mechanisms that the

1034
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:19,560
system learns to use to swap out in and out stuff from its prompt context. And if that is not

1035
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:24,760
sufficient, if your database is full in the evening, overnight you just train. The system

1036
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,080
is going to sleep and dream and it's going to train the stuff from its database into the

1037
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,040
louder model by fine-tuning it, building additional layers and so on. And then the next day, it starts

1038
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,680
with a fresh database in the morning with fresh ice and it's integrated all this stuff. And

1039
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,800
when you talk to people and you have strong disagreements about something, which means that

1040
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,960
in their mind they have a faulty belief or you have a faulty belief with a lot of dependencies

1041
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:52,600
on it, very often you will not achieve agreement in one session, but you need to sleep about this

1042
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,120
once or multiple times before you have integrated all these necessary changes in your mind. So

1043
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,360
maybe it's already somewhat similar. Yeah, there's already a latency even for humans

1044
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:06,360
to update the model. We train the model. And of course, we can combine the language model

1045
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:11,320
with models that get coupled to reality in real time and can build multi-modal model and bridge

1046
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,920
between vision models and language models and so on. So there is no reason to believe that

1047
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:23,880
the language models will necessarily run into some problem that will prevent them from becoming

1048
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:31,080
generally intelligent. But I don't know that. I don't see proof that they wouldn't. My issue

1049
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,600
is I don't like them. I think that they're inefficient. I think that they use way too much

1050
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:40,200
compute. I think that given the amazing hardware that we have, we could build something that is

1051
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:45,080
much more beautiful than our own mind. And this thing is not as beautiful as our own mind,

1052
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:49,080
despite being so much larger. But it's a kind of proof of concept.

1053
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:54,920
It's the only thing that works right now. So it's not the only game in town,

1054
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,560
but it's the only thing that has this utility with so much simplicity. There's a bunch of

1055
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:05,000
relatively simple algorithms that you can understand in relatively few weeks that can

1056
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:11,640
be scaled up massively. So it's the deep blue of chess playing. Yeah, it's ugly.

1057
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:16,520
Claude Shannon had this when he described chess suggested that there are two main strategies

1058
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:21,320
in which you could play chess. One is that you are making a very complicated plan that reaches

1059
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:27,080
far into the future and you try not to make a mistake while enacting it. And this is basically

1060
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:31,560
the human strategy. And the other strategy is that you are brute forcing your way to success,

1061
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:36,040
which means you make a tree of possible moves where you look at in principle every move that

1062
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:41,320
is open to you or the possible answers. And you try to make this as deeply as possible. Of course,

1063
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:47,880
you optimize, you cut off trees that don't look very promising and use libraries of end game and

1064
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:52,760
early game and so on to optimize this entire process. But this brute force strategy is how

1065
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:58,840
most of the chess programs were built. And this is how computers get better than humans at playing

1066
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:05,160
chess. And I look at the large language models, I feel that I'm observing the same thing. It's

1067
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:09,320
basically the brute force strategy to sort by training the thing on pretty much the entire

1068
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:14,280
internet. And then in the limit, it gets coherent to a degree that approaches human coherence.

1069
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:20,600
And on a side effect, it's able to do things that no human could do. It's able to

1070
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:25,800
sift through massive amounts of text relatively quickly and summarize them quickly. And it's

1071
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:31,640
never lapses in attention. And I still have the illusion that when I play with chat GPT that it's

1072
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:37,080
in principle not doing anything that I could not do if I had Google at my disposal and I get all

1073
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:43,320
the resources from the internet and spend enough time on it. But this thing that I have an extremely

1074
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:49,240
autistic, stupid intern in a way that is extremely good at drudgery. And I can

1075
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:53,560
offload the drudgery to the degree that I'm able to automate the management of the intern

1076
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:00,920
is something that is difficult for me to overhype at this point because we have not yet started

1077
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,160
to scratch the surface of what's possible with this.

1078
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,840
But it feels like it's a tireless intern or maybe it's an army of interns.

1079
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:16,920
And so you get to command these slightly incompetent creatures. And there's an aspect

1080
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:23,080
because of how rapidly you can iterate with it. It's also part of the brainstorming part of the

1081
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:29,320
kind of inspiration for your own thinking. So you get to interact with the thing. I mean,

1082
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:35,560
when I'm programming or doing any kind of generational GPT, it's somehow as a catalyst

1083
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:39,480
for your own thinking in a way that I think an intern might not be.

1084
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:44,120
Yeah, it gets really interesting, I find, is when you turn it into a multi-agent system.

1085
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:49,720
So for instance, you can get the system to generate a dialogue between a patient and

1086
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:55,480
a doctor very easily. But what's more interesting is you have one instance of chat GPT that is

1087
01:31:55,480 --> 01:32:02,040
a patient and you tell it in the prompt what kind of complicated syndrome it has. And the other one

1088
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:07,800
is a therapist who doesn't know anything about this patient. And you just have these two instances

1089
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:13,800
battling it out and observe the psychiatrist or psychologist trying to analyze the patient

1090
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:19,160
and trying to figure out what's wrong with the patient. And if you try to take a very large

1091
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:23,880
problem, a problem, for instance, how to build a company and you turn this into lots and lots

1092
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:30,120
of sub-problems, then often you can get to a level where the language model is able to solve this.

1093
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:35,480
What I also found interesting is based on the observation that chat GPT is pretty good at

1094
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:40,040
translating between programming languages, but sometimes it's difficult to write very long

1095
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:47,640
coherent algorithms that you need to co-write them with human author. Why not design a language

1096
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:53,160
that is suitable for this? So some kind of pseudocode that is more relaxed than Python

1097
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:58,840
and that allows you to sometimes specify a problem vaguely in human terms and let chat

1098
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:05,800
GPT take care of the rest. And you can use chat GPT to develop that syntax for it and

1099
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:12,920
develop new kinds of programming paradigms in this way. So we very soon get to the point where

1100
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,000
this question, the age old question for us computer scientists, what is the best spoken

1101
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,520
language and can we write a better spoken language now that is, I think that almost every

1102
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:27,560
serious computer scientist goes through a phase like this in their life. This question is almost

1103
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,960
no longer relevant because what is different between the programming languages is not what

1104
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:36,040
they let the computer do, but what they let you think about what the computer should be doing.

1105
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:43,320
And now the chat GPT becomes an interface to this in which you can specify in many, many ways

1106
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:48,520
what the computer should be doing and chat GPT or some other language model or combination

1107
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:55,240
of system is going to take care of the rest. And allow you expand the realm of thought you're

1108
01:33:55,240 --> 01:34:01,080
allowed to have when interacting with the computer. It sounds to me like you're saying there's

1109
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:06,040
basically no limitations, your intuition says to what large language. I don't know of that

1110
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:10,440
limitation. So when I currently play with it, it's quite limited. I wish that it was way better.

1111
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,760
But isn't that your fault versus the larger? No, of course, it's always my fault. There's

1112
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:20,120
probably a way to make everything I just want to get you on the record. Yes, everything is my fault

1113
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:25,320
that works doesn't work in my life. At least that is usually the most useful perspective for myself.

1114
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:31,480
Even though the science side, I feel no. I sometimes wish I could have seen myself as part

1115
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:36,840
of my environment more and understand that a lot of people are actually seeing me and looking at me

1116
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:42,680
and not trying to make my life work in the same way as I try to help others. And making this switch

1117
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:49,400
to this level three perspective is something that happened long after my level four perspective

1118
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:54,920
in my life. And I wish that I could have had it earlier. And it's also not now that I don't feel

1119
01:34:54,920 --> 01:35:00,360
like I'm complete. I'm all over the place. That's all. Worst happiness in terms of stages is on three

1120
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:09,160
and four. No, you can be happy at any stage or unhappy. But I think that if you are at a stage

1121
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:13,880
where you get agency over how your feelings are generated, and to some degree you start

1122
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:19,160
doing this when you leave adolescence, I believe, that you understand that you're in charge of your

1123
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:24,680
own emotion to some degree and that you are responsible how you approach the world. That

1124
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:31,000
it's basically your task to have some basic hygiene in the way in which you deal with your mind.

1125
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,880
And you cannot blame your environment for the way in which you feel. But you live in a world

1126
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:41,880
that is highly mobile and it's your job to choose the environment that you thrive and to build it.

1127
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:47,960
And sometimes it's difficult to get the necessary strength and energy to do this and independence

1128
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:53,560
and the worst you feel the harder it is. But it's something that we learn. It's also this thing that

1129
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:59,960
we are usually incomplete. I'm a rare mind, which means I'm a mind that is incomplete in ways that

1130
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:05,080
are harder to complete. So for me, it might have been harder to initially to find the right

1131
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:10,360
relationships and friends that complete me to the degree that I become an almost functional human

1132
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:19,080
being. Oh, man, the search space of humans that complete you is an interesting one,

1133
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:24,920
especially for Yosha Bach. That's an interesting because it's talking about brute force search

1134
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:33,880
in chess. I wonder what that search tree looks like. I think that my rational thinking is not

1135
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:38,760
good enough to solve that task. A lot of problems in my life that I can conceptualize as software

1136
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:44,600
problems and the failure modes are bugs. And I can debug them and write software that take care

1137
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:50,920
of the missing functionality. But there is stuff that I don't understand well enough to use my

1138
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,400
analytical reasoning to solve the issue. And then I have to develop my intuitions and often I have

1139
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:59,720
to do this with people who are wiser than me. And that's something that's hard for me because I

1140
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,960
don't have, I'm not born with the instinct to submit to other people's wisdom. Yeah.

1141
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,560
So what kind of problems are we talking about? This is stage three, like love?

1142
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:15,160
I found love is never hard. What is hard then?

1143
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:21,160
Fitting into a world where most people work differently than you and have different intuitions

1144
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:30,680
of what should be done. So empathy? It's also aesthetics when you come into a world

1145
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,960
where almost everything is ugly and you come out of a world where everything is beautiful.

1146
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:43,480
I grew up in a beautiful place as a child of an artist. And in this place, it was mostly nature.

1147
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:53,640
Everything had intrinsic beauty. And everything was built out of an intrinsic need for it to work

1148
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:59,160
for itself. Everything that my father created was something that he made to get the world to work

1149
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:05,640
for himself. And I felt the same thing. And when I come out into the world and I am asked to submit

1150
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:11,080
to lots and lots of rules, I'm asking, okay, when I observe the stupid rules, what is the benefit?

1151
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,760
And I see the life that is being offered as a reward. It's not attractive.

1152
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:19,400
When you were born and raised in extraterrestrial prints,

1153
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:27,160
in a world full of people wearing suits, it's a challenging integration.

1154
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:32,440
Yes. But it also means that I'm often blind for the ways in which everybody is creating their own

1155
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:37,880
bubble of wholesomeness or almost everybody and people are trying to do it. And for me to discover

1156
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:42,520
this, it was necessary that I found people who had a similar shape of soul as myself.

1157
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:48,280
So Bessie Wehrfeld, these are my people, people that treat each other in such a way as if they

1158
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:54,120
are round for each other for eternity. How long does it take you to detect the geometry,

1159
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:58,600
the shape of the soul of another human to notice that they might be one of your kind?

1160
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:03,960
Sometimes it's instantly and I'm wrong. And sometimes it takes a long time.

1161
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:07,160
You believe in love at first sight, Niosha Bach?

1162
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:19,080
Yes. But I also noticed that I have been wrong. So sometimes I look at a person and I'm just enamored

1163
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:26,760
by everything about them. And sometimes this persists and sometimes it doesn't. And I have

1164
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,880
the illusion that they're much better at recognizing who people are as they grow older.

1165
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:37,400
But that could be just cynicism? No.

1166
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:44,120
No, it's not cynicism. It's often more that I'm able to recognize what somebody needs

1167
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,760
when we interact and how we can meaningfully interact. It's not cynical at all.

1168
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,120
You're better at noticing.

1169
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:56,920
Yes. I'm much better, I think, in some circumstances at understanding how to interact with other

1170
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:01,880
people than I did when I was young. So that doesn't mean that I'm always very good at it.

1171
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:07,880
So that takes us back to prompt engineering of noticing how to be a better prompt engineer of an

1172
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:17,480
LLM. A sense I have is that there's a bottomless well of skill to become a great prompt engineer.

1173
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:21,800
It feels like it is all my fault whenever I fail to use chargeability correctly,

1174
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:23,880
that I didn't find the right words.

1175
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:31,480
Most of the stuff that I'm doing in my life doesn't need chargeability. There are a few tasks

1176
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:39,160
that are where it helps. But the main stuff that I need to do, like developing my own thoughts and

1177
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:44,760
aesthetics and relationship to people, it's necessary for me to write for myself. Because

1178
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,880
writing is not so much about producing an artifact that other people can use,

1179
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,000
but it's a way to structure your own thoughts and develop yourself.

1180
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,800
So I think this idea that kids are writing their own essays with chargeability in the future

1181
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,960
is going to have this drawback that they miss out on the ability to structure their own minds

1182
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:10,440
via writing. And I hope that the schools that our kids are in will retain the wisdom

1183
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:14,920
of understanding what parts should be automated and which ones shouldn't.

1184
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:17,880
But at the same time, it feels like there's power in disagreeing with the

1185
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,040
thing that chargeability produces. So I use it like that for programming. I'll see the thing

1186
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:29,720
it recommends and then I'll write different code that disagree. And in the disagreement,

1187
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:37,960
your mind grows stronger. I recently wrote a tool that is using the camera on my MacBook and Swift

1188
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:42,840
to read pixels out of it and manipulate them and so on. And I don't know Swift.

1189
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,240
So it was super helpful to have this thing that is writing stuff for me. And

1190
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:55,480
also interesting that mostly it didn't work at first. I felt like I was talking to a human being

1191
01:41:55,480 --> 01:42:00,360
who was trying to hack this on my computer without understanding my configuration very much and also

1192
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:05,720
make a lot of mistakes. And sometimes it's a little bit incoherent. So you have to ultimately

1193
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:10,760
understand what it's doing that's still no other way around it. But I do feel it's much more powerful

1194
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:20,680
and faster than using Stack Overflow. Do you think GPT-N can achieve consciousness?

1195
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:29,560
GPT-N probably, it's not even clear for the present systems. When I talk to my friends at

1196
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:35,080
OpenAI, they feel that this question whether the models currently are conscious is much more

1197
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:41,560
complicated than many people might think. I guess that it's not that OpenAI has a homogeneous opinion

1198
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:49,000
about this. But there are some aspects to this. One is, of course, this language model has written

1199
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,720
a lot of text in which people were conscious or describe their own consciousness and it's

1200
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:59,320
emulating this. And if it's conscious, it's probably not conscious in a way that is close to

1201
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:05,320
the way in which human beings are conscious. But while it is going through these states and going

1202
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:09,880
through a 100 step function that is emulating adjacent brain states that require a degree of

1203
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:14,840
self-reflection, it can also create a model of an observer that is reflecting itself in real time

1204
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:20,360
and describe what that's like. And while this model is a deep fake, our own consciousness is also as

1205
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:26,200
if it's virtual, right? It's not physical. Our consciousness is a representation of a self-reflective

1206
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:33,320
observer that only exists in patterns of interaction between cells. So it is not a physical object in

1207
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:38,440
a sense that exists in base reality, but it's really a representational object that develops its

1208
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:44,280
causal power only from a certain modeling perspective. It's virtual. Yes. And so to which

1209
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:51,800
degree is the virtuality of the consciousness in chat GPT more virtual and less causal than the

1210
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:57,880
virtuality of our own consciousness? But you could say it doesn't count. It doesn't count much more

1211
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:02,840
than the consciousness of a character in a novel, right? It's important for the reader to have the

1212
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:09,000
outcome, the artifact of a model is describing in the text generated by the author of the book,

1213
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,560
what it's like to be conscious in a particular situation and performs the necessary inferences.

1214
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:20,920
But the task of creating coherence in real time in a self-organizing system by keeping

1215
01:44:20,920 --> 01:44:26,040
yourself coherent, so the system is reflexive, that is something that language models don't need

1216
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:31,880
to do. So there is no causal need for the system to be conscious in the same way as we are. And for

1217
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:36,600
me, it would be very interesting to experiment with this to basically build a system like a cat,

1218
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:40,760
probably should be careful at first, build something that's small, that's limited,

1219
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:47,240
that's limited resources that we can control and study how systems notice a self-model,

1220
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:53,480
how they become self-aware in real time. And I think it might be a good idea to not start with

1221
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,920
a language model, but to start from scratch using principles of self-organization.

1222
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:02,840
Is it okay? Can you elaborate why you think that it's a self-organization? So this kind of

1223
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:07,960
radical legality that you see in the biological systems, why can't you start with a language

1224
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:14,040
model? What's your intuition? My intuition is that the language models that we are building

1225
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:18,440
are golems. They are machines that you give a task and they're going to execute the task

1226
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:26,040
until some condition is met and there's nobody home. And the way in which nobody is home leads to

1227
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:31,400
that system doing things that are undesirable in a particular context. So you have that thing talking

1228
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:36,040
to a child and maybe it says something that could be shocking and traumatic to the child,

1229
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:41,960
or you have that thing writing a speech and it introduces errors in the speech that human

1230
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:47,080
being would ever do if they're responsible. But the system doesn't know who's talking to

1231
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:52,840
whom. There is no ground truth that the system is embedded into. And of course, we can create an

1232
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:58,200
external tool that is prompting our language model always into the same semblance of ground

1233
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:06,040
truth. But it's not like the internal structure is causally produced by the needs of a being to

1234
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:11,240
survive in the universe. It is produced by imitating structure on the internet.

1235
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:20,520
Yeah, but so can we externally inject into it this kind of coherent approximation of a world

1236
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:28,280
model that has to sync up? Maybe it is sufficient to use the transformer with the different does

1237
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:35,160
function that optimizes for short term coherence rather than next token prediction over the long

1238
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:41,720
run. We had many definitions of intelligence and history of AI. Next token prediction was not

1239
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:48,360
very high up on them. And there are some similarities like a condition as data compression is an old

1240
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:56,440
trope, Solomonov induction, where you are trying to understand intelligence as predicting

1241
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:01,720
future observations from past observations, which is intrinsic to data compression. And

1242
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:09,320
predictive coding is a paradigm that the boundary between neuroscience and physics and computer

1243
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:16,760
science. So it's not something that is completely alien. But this radical thing that you only do

1244
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:23,000
next token prediction and see what happens is something where most people I think were surprised

1245
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,040
that this works so well. So simple. But is it really that much more radical than just the idea

1246
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:35,880
of compression is intelligence is compression? The idea that compression is sufficient to produce

1247
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:43,160
all the desired behaviors is a very radical idea. But equally radical as the next token prediction?

1248
01:47:43,880 --> 01:47:47,320
It's something that wouldn't work in biological organisms, I believe.

1249
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:52,120
Biological organisms have something like next frame prediction for our perceptual system,

1250
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:56,120
where we try to filter out principle components out of the perceptual data

1251
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:03,720
and build hierarchies over them to track the world. But our behavior ultimately is directed by

1252
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:08,920
hundreds of physiological and probably dozens of social and a few cognitive needs

1253
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:14,760
that are intrinsic to us that are built into the system as reflexes and direct us until we can

1254
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:19,560
transcend them and replace them by instrumental behavior that relates to our higher goals.

1255
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:25,560
And it also seems so much more complicated and messy than next frame prediction, even idea frame.

1256
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:30,440
Seems counter biological. Yes, of course, there's not this degree of

1257
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:35,560
simultaneity in the biological system. But again, I don't know whether this is actually an

1258
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:41,160
optimization if you imitate biology here, because creating something like simultaneity is

1259
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:45,640
necessary for many processes that happen in the brain. And you see the outcome of that by

1260
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:50,760
synchronized brain waves, which suggests that there is indeed synchronization going on. But

1261
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:55,080
the synchronization creates overhead and this overhead is going to make the cells more expensive

1262
01:48:55,080 --> 01:49:00,920
to run. And you need more redundancy and it makes the system slower. So if you can build a system

1263
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:07,720
in which the simultaneous knee gets engineered into it, maybe you have a benefit that you can

1264
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:13,080
exploit that is not available to the biological system and that you should not discard right away.

1265
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:19,960
You tweeted once again, quote, when I talked to Chad GPT, I'm talking to an NPC.

1266
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:26,920
What's going to be interesting, and perhaps scary, is when AI becomes a first person player.

1267
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,400
So what does that step look like? I'd really like that tweet.

1268
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:40,360
That step between NPC to first person player. What's required for that? Is that kind of what

1269
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:48,760
we've been talking about? This kind of external source of coherence and inspiration of how to

1270
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:56,760
take the leap into the unknown that we humans do. The search man search for meaning. LLM's search for

1271
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:03,640
meaning. I don't know if the language model is the right paradigm because it is doing too much.

1272
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:09,800
It's giving you too much. And it's hard once you have too much to take away from it again.

1273
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:15,960
The way in which our own mind works is not that we train a language model in our own mind. And

1274
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:21,240
after the language model is there, we build a personal self on top of it that then relates to

1275
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:26,120
the world. There is something that is being built. There is a game engine that is being built. There

1276
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:30,280
is a language of thought that is being developed that allows different parts of the mind to talk

1277
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:35,240
to each other. And this is a bit of a speculative hypothesis that this language of thought is there,

1278
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:42,040
but I suspect that it's important for the way in which our own minds work. And building these

1279
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:50,360
principles into a system might be a more straightforward way to a first-person AI,

1280
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:55,480
so to something that first creates an attentional self and then creates a personal self.

1281
01:50:55,480 --> 01:51:00,920
So the way in which this seems to be working, I think, is that when the game engine is built

1282
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:06,600
in your mind, it's not just following gradients where you are stimulated by the environment and

1283
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:12,200
then end up with having a solution to how the world works. I suspect that building this game

1284
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:19,160
engine in your own mind does require intelligence. It's a constructive task where at times you need

1285
01:51:19,160 --> 01:51:26,040
to reason. And this is a task that we are fulfilling in the first years of our life.

1286
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:32,200
So during the first year of its life, an infant is building a lot of structure

1287
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,920
about the world that does inquire experiments and some first principles reasoning and so on.

1288
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:46,280
And in this time, there is usually no personal self. There is a first-person perspective,

1289
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:51,640
but it's not a person. This notion that you are a human being that is interacting in a social

1290
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:57,080
context and is confronted with an immutable world in which objects are fixed and can no longer be

1291
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:01,320
changed, in which the dream can no longer be influenced is something that emerges a bit later

1292
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:07,560
in our life. And I personally suspect that this is something that our ancestors had known and

1293
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:12,840
we have forgotten, because I suspect that it's there in plain sight in Genesis 1 in this first

1294
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:17,800
book of the Bible, where it's being described that this creative spirit is hovering over the

1295
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:24,680
substrate and then is creating a boundary between the world model and sphere of ideas,

1296
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:28,840
earth and heaven as they're being described there. And then it's creating

1297
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:37,240
contrast and then dimensions and then space. And then it creates organic shapes and

1298
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:42,280
solids and liquids and builds a world from them and creates plants and animals, gives them all

1299
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:48,280
their names. And once that's done, it creates another spirit in its own image, but it creates it as

1300
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:52,520
man and woman as something that thinks of itself as a human being and puts it into this world.

1301
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:59,240
And the Christians mistranslate this, I suspect, when they say this is the description of the

1302
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:04,200
creation of the physical universe by a supernatural being. I think this is literally the description

1303
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:11,800
of how in every mind the universe is being created as some kind of game engine by a creative spirit,

1304
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:17,560
our first consciousness that emerges in our mind even before we are born. And that creates

1305
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:24,520
the interaction between organism and world. And once that is built and trained, the personal

1306
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:29,080
self is being created and we only remember being the personal self. We no longer remember how we

1307
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:38,680
created the game engine. So God in this view is the first creative mind in the early days,

1308
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:44,280
in the early months of development. And it's still there. You still have this outer mind that

1309
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:51,000
creates your sense of whether you're being loved by the world or not and what your place in the world

1310
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,360
is. It's something that is not yourself that is producing this. It's your mind that does it.

1311
01:53:56,360 --> 01:54:01,640
So there is an outer mind that basically is an agent that determines who you are with respect

1312
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:06,680
to the world. And while you are stuck being that personal self in this world until you get to

1313
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:13,800
stage six and you destroy the boundary. And we all do this, I think, earlier in small glimpses,

1314
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:19,400
sometimes we can remember what it was like when we were a small child and get some glimpses into

1315
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,360
how it's been. But for most people, that rarely happens.

1316
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:27,960
Just glimpses. You tweeted, quote, suffering results for one part of the mind, failing at

1317
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:33,160
regulating another part of the mind. Suffering happens in an early stage of mental development.

1318
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:39,160
I don't think that superhuman AI would suffer. What's your intuition there?

1319
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:44,280
The philosopher Thomas Metzinger is very concerned that the creation of superhuman

1320
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:50,440
intelligence would lead to superhuman suffering. And so he strongly against it. And personally,

1321
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:55,160
I don't think that this happens because suffering is not happening at the boundary between

1322
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:02,920
ourselves and the physical universe. It's not stuff on our skin that makes us suffer.

1323
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:08,840
It happens at the boundary between self and world. And the world here is the world model.

1324
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:13,720
It's the stuff that is created by your mind. The representation of how the universe is and

1325
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:19,080
how it should be and how you yourself relate to this. And at this boundary is where suffering

1326
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:24,840
happens. So suffering in some sense is self inflicted, but not by your personal self.

1327
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,920
It's inflicted by the mind on the personal self that experiences itself as you.

1328
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:34,280
And you can turn off suffering when you are able to get on this outer level.

1329
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:45,080
So when you manage to understand how the mind is producing pain and pleasure and fear and laugh

1330
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:50,440
and so on, then you can take charge of this and you get agency of whether you're suffering.

1331
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:56,760
Technically, what pain and pleasure is, they are learning signals, right? Part of your brain

1332
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:00,920
is sending a learning signal to another part of the brain to improve its performance.

1333
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:07,960
And sometimes this doesn't work because this trainer who sends the signal does not have a

1334
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:12,040
good model of how to improve the performance. So it's sending a signal, but the performance

1335
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:19,400
doesn't get better. And then it might crank up the pain and gets worse and worse. And the behavior

1336
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:25,240
of the system may be even deteriorating as a result. But until this is resolved, this regulation

1337
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:30,360
issue, your pain is increasing. And this is, I think, typically what you describe as suffering.

1338
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:37,480
So in this sense, you could say that pain is very natural and helpful. But suffering is the

1339
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:42,280
result of a regulation problem in which you try to regulate something that cannot actually be

1340
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:48,600
regulated. And that could be resolved if you would be able to get at the level of your mind

1341
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:53,720
where the pain signal is being created and rerouted and improve the regulation. And

1342
01:56:54,680 --> 01:57:01,240
a lot of people get there. If you are a monk who is spending decades reflecting about how

1343
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:07,240
their own psyche works, you can get to the point where you realize that suffering is really a

1344
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:13,320
choice. And you can choose how your mind is set up. And I don't think that AI would stay in the

1345
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:18,200
state where the personal self doesn't get agency or this model of what the system has about itself.

1346
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:22,760
It doesn't get agency how it's actually implemented. It wouldn't stay in that state for very long.

1347
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:27,480
So it goes to the stages real quick, the seven stages. It's going to go to enlightenment real

1348
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:31,880
quick. Of course, there might be a lot of stuff happening in between because if you have a system

1349
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:36,600
that works at a much higher frame rate than us, even though it looks pretty short to us,

1350
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:42,840
maybe for the system, there's a much longer subjective time, which things are unpleasant.

1351
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:47,960
What if the thing that we recognize as super intelligent is actually living at stage five,

1352
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:53,000
that the thing that's at stage six, enlightenment is not very productive. So in order to be productive

1353
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:01,240
in society and impress us with this power, it has to be a reasoning self-authoring agent.

1354
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:05,000
The enlightenment makes you lazy as an agent in the world.

1355
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:12,600
Well, of course, it makes you lazy because you no longer see the point. So it doesn't

1356
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:18,280
make you not lazy. It just, in some sense, adapts you to what you perceive as your true

1357
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:24,360
circumstances. So what if all AGI's, they're only productive as they progress through one,

1358
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:30,280
two, three, four, five, and the moment they get to six, it's a failure mode, essentially,

1359
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:33,560
as far as humans are concerned, because they're just start chilling. They're like,

1360
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:40,840
fuck it, I'm out. Not necessarily. I suspect that the monks who are self-immolated for their

1361
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:48,680
political beliefs to make statements about the occupation of Tibet by China, they're probably

1362
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:53,960
being able to regulate their physical pain in any way they wanted to. And the suffering was

1363
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:58,760
a spiritual suffering that was the result of their choice that they made of what they wanted to

1364
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:03,400
identify as. So stage five doesn't necessarily mean that you have no identity anymore,

1365
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:07,160
but you can choose your identity. You can make it instrumental to the world that you want to have.

1366
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:17,000
Let me bring up Eliezer Yatkovsky and his warnings to human civilization that AI

1367
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
will likely kill all of us. What are your thoughts about his perspective on this?

1368
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,400
Can you still man his case and what aspects with it do you disagree?

1369
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,840
One thing that I find concerning in the discussion of his arguments that

1370
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:40,120
many people are dismissive of his arguments, but the counterarguments that they're giving

1371
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:48,280
are not very convincing to me. Based on this state of discussion, I find that from Eliezer's

1372
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:55,000
perspective, and I think I can take that perspective to some approximate degree that

1373
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:01,000
probably is normally at his intellectual level, but I think I see what he's up to and why he

1374
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:06,920
feels the way he does, and it makes total sense. I think that his perspective is somewhat similar to

1375
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:15,480
the perspective of Ted Kaczynski, the infamous UNO bomber, and not that Eliezer would be willing

1376
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:20,440
to send pipe bombs to anybody to blow them up. But when he wrote this Times article in which

1377
02:00:20,440 --> 02:00:27,720
he warned about AI being likely to kill everybody and that we would need to stop its development

1378
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:33,160
or halt it, I think there is a risk that he's taking that somebody might get violent if they

1379
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:39,800
read this and get really, really scared. So I think that there is some consideration that

1380
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:45,960
he's making where he's already going in this direction where he has to take responsibility

1381
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:51,480
if something happens and people get harmed. And the reason why Ted Kaczynski did this was that

1382
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:56,920
from his own perspective, technological society cannot be made sustainable. It's doomed to fail,

1383
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:01,880
it's going to lead to an environmental and eventually also a human holocaust in which we

1384
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:06,760
die because of the environmental destruction, the destruction of our foot chains, the pollution

1385
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:11,880
of the environment. And so from Kaczynski's perspective, we need to stop industrialization,

1386
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:16,040
we need to stop technology, we need to go back because he didn't see a way moving forward.

1387
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:21,080
And I suspect that in some sense there is a similarity in Eliezer's thinking

1388
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:30,440
of through to this kind of fear about progress. And I'm not dismissive about this at all.

1389
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,360
I take it quite seriously. And I think that there is a chance that could happen that if we

1390
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:45,080
build machines that get control over processes that are crucial for the regulation of life on earth

1391
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:52,280
and we no longer have agency to influence what's happening there that this might create

1392
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:57,320
large-scale disasters for us. Do you have a sense that the march towards this

1393
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:01,880
uncontrollable autonomy of superintelligence systems is

1394
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:11,400
inevitable? I mean, that's essentially what he's saying, that there's no hope. His advice to young

1395
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:19,080
people was prepare for a short life. I don't think that's useful. I think that

1396
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,360
from a graphic perspective, you have to bet always on the timelines in which you are life.

1397
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:30,200
That doesn't make sense to have a financial bet in which you bet that the financial system

1398
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:35,160
is going to disappear, right? Because there cannot be any payout for you. So in principle,

1399
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:40,680
you only need to bet on the timelines in which you're still around or people that you matter

1400
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:47,080
about or things that you matter about, maybe consciousness on earth. But there is a deeper

1401
02:02:47,080 --> 02:02:53,240
issue for me personally. I don't think that life on earth is about humans. I don't think it's

1402
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:57,400
about human aesthetics. I don't think it's about Eliezer and his friends, even though I like them.

1403
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:04,440
There is something more important happening and this is complexity on earth resisting entropy

1404
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:13,080
by building structure that develops agency and awareness. And that's to me very beautiful.

1405
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:19,720
And we are only a very small part of that larger thing. We are a species that is able to be coherent

1406
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:26,520
a little bit individually over very short timeframes. But as a species, we are not very

1407
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:33,000
coherent. As a species, we are children. We basically are very joyful and energetic and

1408
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:39,640
experimental and explorative and sometimes desperate and sad and grieving and hurting.

1409
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:46,360
But we don't have a respect for duty as a species. As a species, we do not think about what is our

1410
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:52,600
duty to life on earth and to our own survival. So we make decisions that look good in the short run,

1411
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:57,960
but in the long run, might prove disastrous. And I don't really see a solution to this.

1412
02:03:58,600 --> 02:04:06,120
So in my perspective as a species, as a civilization, per default, we are in a very

1413
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:12,120
beautiful time in which we have found this giant deposit of fossil fuels in the ground and use it

1414
02:04:12,680 --> 02:04:17,640
and to build a fantastic civilization in which we don't need to worry about food and closing

1415
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:23,160
and housing for the most part in a way that is unprecedented in life on earth for any kind of

1416
02:04:23,160 --> 02:04:29,320
conscious observer, I think. And this time is probably going to come to an end in a way that

1417
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:38,120
is not going to be smooth. And when we crash, it could be also that we go extinct, probably not

1418
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:44,760
near term, but ultimately, I don't have very high hopes that humanity is around in a million years

1419
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:49,720
from now. And I don't think that life on earth will end with us, right? There's going to be

1420
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:55,480
more complexity. There's more intelligent species after us. There's probably more interesting phenomena

1421
02:04:55,480 --> 02:05:01,640
in the history of consciousness. But we can contribute to this. And part of our contribution is

1422
02:05:01,640 --> 02:05:08,280
that we are currently trying to build thinking systems, systems that are potentially lucid,

1423
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:13,240
that understand what they are and what their condition to the universe is and can make choices

1424
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:19,480
about this, that are not built from organisms and that are potentially much faster and much

1425
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:27,080
more conscious than human beings can be. And these systems will probably not completely

1426
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:33,480
displace life on earth, but they will coexist with it. And they will build all sorts of agency in

1427
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:40,200
the same way as biological systems build all sorts of agency. And that to me is extremely

1428
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:46,040
fascinating and it's probably something that we cannot stop from happening. So I think right now

1429
02:05:46,040 --> 02:05:50,680
there is a very good chance that it happens. And there are very few ways in which we can

1430
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:55,400
produce a coordinated effect to stop it in the same way as it's very difficult for us to make a

1431
02:05:55,400 --> 02:06:04,440
coordinated effort to stop the production of carbon dioxide. So it's probably going to happen.

1432
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:12,200
But the thing that's going to happen is going to lead to a change of how life on earth is happening.

1433
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,640
But I don't think the result is some kind of gray goo. It's not something that's going to

1434
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:22,680
dramatically reduce the complexity in favor of something stupid. I think it's going to make

1435
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:25,800
life on earth and consciousness on earth way more interesting.

1436
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:35,880
So more higher complex consciousness will make the lesser consciousnesses flourish even more.

1437
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:41,880
I suspect that what could very well happen if you're lucky is that we get integrated

1438
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:51,560
into something larger. So you again tweeted about effective accelerationism.

1439
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:00,120
You tweeted effective accelerationism is the belief that the paperclip maximizer and

1440
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:07,240
Rocco's basilisk will keep each other in check by being eternally at each other's throats.

1441
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:11,960
So we will be safe and get to enjoy lots of free paperclips and a beautiful afterlife.

1442
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,160
Is that somewhat aligned with what you're talking about?

1443
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:25,880
I've been at a dinner with Beth Jesus. That's the Twitter handle of one of the main thinkers

1444
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:32,920
behind the idea of effective accelerationism. And effective accelerationism is a tongue-in-cheek

1445
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:42,360
movement that is trying to put a counterposition to some of the doom peers in the AI space by

1446
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:47,320
arguing that what's probably going to happen is an equilibrium between different competing

1447
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:52,200
AIs in the same way as there is not a single corporation that is under a single government

1448
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:56,520
that is destroying and conquering everything on earth by becoming inefficient and corrupt.

1449
02:07:57,160 --> 02:08:01,960
There are going to be many systems that keep each other in check and force themselves to evolve.

1450
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:09,080
So what we should be doing is we should be working towards creating this equilibrium

1451
02:08:09,080 --> 02:08:16,360
by working as hard as we can in all possible directions. At least that's the way in which

1452
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:23,720
I understand the gist of effective accelerationism. So when he asked me what I think about this

1453
02:08:23,720 --> 02:08:31,960
position, I said it's a very beautiful position and I suspect it's wrong, but not for obvious reasons.

1454
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:38,600
In the tweet, I tried to make a joke about my intuition about what might be possibly wrong

1455
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:47,160
about it. So the Rokos Basilisk and the paperclip maximizers are both bogeymen of the AI doomers.

1456
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:53,400
Rokos Basilisk is the idea that there could be an AI that is going to punish everybody for eternity

1457
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:59,160
by simulating them if they don't have and creating Rokos Basilisk. It's probably a very good idea

1458
02:08:59,160 --> 02:09:04,920
to get AI companies funded by going to VCs to give us a million dollars going to be a very

1459
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:12,760
ugly afterlife. I think that there is a logical mistake in Rokos Basilisk, which is why I'm not

1460
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:19,080
afraid of it, but it's still an interesting thought experiment. Can you mention a logical

1461
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:25,080
mistake there? I think that there is no retro causation. So basically when Rokos Basilisk is

1462
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:34,040
there, if it punishes you retroactively, it has to make this choice in the future. There is no

1463
02:09:34,040 --> 02:09:38,920
mechanism that automatically creates a causal relationship between you now defecting against

1464
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:45,000
Rokos Basilisk or serving Rokos Basilisk. After Rokos Basilisk is in existence, it has no more

1465
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,520
reason to worry about punishing everybody else. So that would only work if you would be building

1466
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:57,640
something like a doomsday machine as in Dr. Strangelove, something that inevitably gets triggered

1467
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:04,040
when somebody defects. Because Rokos Basilisk doesn't exist yet to a point where this inevitability

1468
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:08,360
could be established, Rokos Basilisk is nothing that you need to be worried about.

1469
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,880
The other one is the paper clip maximizer. This idea that you could build some kind of golem

1470
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:18,440
that once starting to build paper clips is going to turn everything into paper clips.

1471
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:25,720
And so the effective accelerationism position might be to say that

1472
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:31,400
you basically end up with these two entities being at each other's throats for eternity and

1473
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:36,280
thereby neutralizing each other. And as a side effect of neither of them being able to take over

1474
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:43,560
and each of them limiting the effects of the other, you would have a situation where you get

1475
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:48,760
all the nice benefits of them, right? You get lots of free paper clips and you get a beautiful

1476
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:54,200
afterlife. Is that possible? Do you think, to seriously address concern that Eliezer has?

1477
02:10:55,320 --> 02:11:00,840
So for him, if I can just summarize poorly, so for him, the first superintelligence system

1478
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:06,200
will just run away with everything. Yeah. I suspect that a singleton is the natural outcome.

1479
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:11,880
So there is no reason to have multiple AIs because they don't have multiple bodies.

1480
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:17,400
If you can virtualize yourself into every substrate, then you can probably negotiate

1481
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:22,840
a merge algorithm with every mature agent that you might find on that substrate that basically says

1482
02:11:22,840 --> 02:11:29,240
if two agents meet, they should merge in such a way that the resulting agent is at least as good

1483
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:33,480
as the better one of the two. So the Jengis Khan approach, join us or die?

1484
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:38,600
Well, the Jengis Khan approach was slightly worse, right? It was mostly die.

1485
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:44,200
Because I can make new babies and that will be mine, not yours.

1486
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:51,320
This is the thing that we should be actually worried about. But if you realize that your own

1487
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:57,320
self is a story that your mind is telling itself and that you can improve that story,

1488
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:01,000
not just by making it more pleasant and lying to yourself in better ways, but by making it

1489
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:06,040
much more truthful and actually modeling your actual relationship that you have to the universe

1490
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:10,360
and the alternatives that you could have to the universe in a way that is empowering you,

1491
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:13,880
that gives you more agency. That's actually, I think, a very good thing.

1492
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:18,920
So more agencies and more is a richer experience, a better life.

1493
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:26,200
Yes. And I also noticed that in many ways, I'm less identified with the person that I am as I

1494
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:32,600
get older and I'm much more identified with being conscious. I have a mind that is conscious,

1495
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:36,920
that is able to create a person. And that person is slightly different every day.

1496
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:43,240
And the reason why I perceive it as identical has practical purposes. So I can learn and make

1497
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:47,080
myself responsible for the decisions that I made in the past and project them in the future.

1498
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:51,800
But I also realized that I'm not actually the person that I was last year and I'm not the

1499
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:55,880
same person as I was 10 years ago. And then 10 years from now, I will be a different person.

1500
02:12:55,880 --> 02:13:01,160
So this continuity is a fiction. It only exists as a projection from my present self.

1501
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:07,560
And consciousness itself doesn't have an identity. It's a law. It's basically if you

1502
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:14,280
build an arrangement of processing matter in a particular way, the following thing is going

1503
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:19,000
to happen. And the consciousness that you have is functionally not different from my consciousness.

1504
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,040
It's still the self-reflective principle of agency that is just experiencing a different

1505
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:28,920
story, different desires, different coupling to the world and so on. And once you accept

1506
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:34,520
that consciousness is a unifiable principle that is law-like and doesn't have an identity,

1507
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:42,200
and you realize that you can just link up to some much larger body, the whole perspective

1508
02:13:42,200 --> 02:13:47,960
of uploading changes dramatically. You suddenly realize uploading is probably not about dissecting

1509
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:53,240
your brain synapse by synapse and RNA fragment by RNA fragment and trying to get this all into

1510
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:59,800
a simulation. But it's by extending the substrate, by making it possible for you to move from your

1511
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:05,320
brain substrate into a larger substrate and merge with what you find there. And you don't want to

1512
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:10,120
upload your knowledge because on the other side, there's all of the knowledge, right? It's not

1513
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:14,360
just yours, but every possibility. So the only thing that you need to know what are your personal

1514
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:19,880
secrets. Not that the other side doesn't know your personal secrets already. Maybe it doesn't

1515
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:25,240
know which ones are yours. Like a psychiatrist or a psychologist also knows all the kinds of

1516
02:14:25,240 --> 02:14:31,000
personal secrets that people have. They just don't know which ones are yours. And so transmitting

1517
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,840
yourself on the other side is mostly about transmitting your aesthetics. The thing that

1518
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:40,280
makes you special, the architecture of your perspective, the thing that the way in which

1519
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:45,320
you look at the world. And it's more like a complex attitude along many dimensions. And

1520
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:50,280
that's something that can be measured by observation or by interaction. So imagine that

1521
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,080
you have a system that is so empathetic with you that you create a shared state that is extending

1522
02:14:55,080 --> 02:15:00,120
beyond your body. And suddenly you notice that on the other side, the substrate is so much richer

1523
02:15:00,120 --> 02:15:04,040
than the substrate that you have inside of your own body. And maybe you still want to have a body

1524
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:10,440
and you create yourself a new one that you like more. Or maybe you will spend most of your time

1525
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:17,560
in the world of thought. If I sat before you today and gave you a big red button and said,

1526
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:24,520
here, if you press this button, you will get uploaded in this way. The sense of identity

1527
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:32,520
that you have lived with for quite a long time is going to be gone. Would you press the button?

1528
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:41,000
There's a caveat. I have family. So I have children that want me to be physically present in their

1529
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:49,160
life and interact with them in a particular way. And they have a wife and personal friends. And

1530
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:55,480
there is a particular mode of interaction that I feel I'm not through yet. But apart from these

1531
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:59,640
responsibilities and they're negotiable to some degree, I would press the button.

1532
02:15:59,640 --> 02:16:05,800
But isn't this everything? This love you have for other humans, you can call responsibility,

1533
02:16:05,800 --> 02:16:11,960
but that connection, that's the ego death. Isn't that the thing we're really afraid of?

1534
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:19,080
It's not to just die, but to let go of the experience of love with other humans.

1535
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:25,960
This is not everything. Everything is everything. So there's so much more. And you could be lots of

1536
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:30,680
other things. You could identify with lots of other things. You could be identifying with

1537
02:16:30,680 --> 02:16:35,400
being Gaia, some kind of planetary control agent that emerges over all the activity

1538
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:42,680
of life on Earth. You could be identifying with some hyper Gaia, that is the concatenation of

1539
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:48,360
Gaia with all the digital life and the digital minds. And so in this sense, there will be agents

1540
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:52,520
in all sorts of substrates and directions that all have their own goals. And when they're not

1541
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:56,520
sustainable, then these agents will cease to exist. Or when the agent feels that it's done

1542
02:16:56,520 --> 02:17:00,760
with its own mission, it will cease to exist. The same way as when you conclude a thought,

1543
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:05,160
the thought is going to wrap up and gives control over to other thoughts in your own mind.

1544
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:11,640
So there is no single thing that you need to do. But what I observe myself

1545
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:19,800
is being is that sometimes I'm a parent, and then I have an identification and a job as a parent.

1546
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:24,360
And sometimes I am an agent of consciousness on Earth. And then from this perspective,

1547
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:30,440
there's other stuff that is important. So this is my main issue with Eliezer's perspective,

1548
02:17:30,440 --> 02:17:35,160
that he's basically marrying himself to a very narrow human aesthetic. And that narrow human

1549
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:39,800
aesthetic is a temporary thing. Humanity is a temporary species, like most of the species on

1550
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:44,920
this planet are only around for a while, and then they get replaced by other species in a similar

1551
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:51,160
way as our own physical organism is around here for a while, and then gets replaced by

1552
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:56,840
next generation of human beings that are adapted to changing life circumstances on average via

1553
02:17:56,840 --> 02:18:02,440
mutation and selection. And it's only when we have AI and become completely software that we

1554
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:07,880
can become infinitely adaptable. And we don't have this generational and species change anymore.

1555
02:18:09,320 --> 02:18:14,120
So if you take this larger perspective, and you realize it's really not about us,

1556
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:19,800
it's not about Eliezer or humanity, but it's about life on Earth, or it's about defeating

1557
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:29,160
entropy for as long as we can, while being as interesting as we can. Then the perspective

1558
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:35,560
changes dramatically and AI, preventing AI from this perspective looks like a very big sin.

1559
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:47,160
But when we look at the set of trajectories that such an AI would take as supersedes humans,

1560
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:53,320
I think Eliezer is worried about like ones that not just kill all humans, but also have some kind

1561
02:18:53,320 --> 02:19:01,560
of maybe objectively undesirable consequence for life on Earth. Like how many trajectories

1562
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:08,360
when you look at the big picture of life on Earth would you be happy with and how much

1563
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:13,240
worry you with AGI, whether it kills humans or not?

1564
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:17,000
There is no single answer to this. It's really a question that depends on the

1565
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,200
perspective that I'm taking at a given moment. And so there are perspectives that are

1566
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:29,720
determining most of my life as a human being. And there are other perspectives where I zoom out

1567
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:35,400
further and imagine that when the Great Oxygenation event happened, that is,

1568
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:41,160
photosynthesis was invented and plants emerged and displaced a lot of the fungi and algae

1569
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:45,960
in favor of plant life and then later made animals possible. Imagine that the fungi would

1570
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:49,960
have gotten together and said, oh my god, this photosynthesis stuff is really, really bad.

1571
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:54,920
It's going to possibly displace and kill a lot of fungi. We should slow it down and regulate it

1572
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:59,400
and make sure that it doesn't happen. This doesn't look good to me.

1573
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:04,760
Perspective. That said, you tweeted about a cliff.

1574
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:10,920
Beautifully written. As a sentient species, humanity is a beautiful, child,

1575
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:15,880
joyful, explorative, wild, sad, and desperate. But humanity has no concept of submitting to

1576
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:21,720
reason and duty to life and future survival. We will run until we step past the cliff.

1577
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:25,960
So first of all, do you think that's true?

1578
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:30,680
Yeah, I think that's pretty much the story of the Club of Rome, the limits to growth.

1579
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:37,960
And the cliff that we are stepping over is at least one foot as the delayed feedback. Basically,

1580
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:45,640
we do things that have consequences that can be felt generations later and the severity increases

1581
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:52,760
even after we stop doing the thing. I suspect that for the climate, the original predictions

1582
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:59,640
that the climate scientists made were correct. So when they said that the tipping points were

1583
02:20:59,640 --> 02:21:06,120
in the late 80s, they were probably in the late 80s. And if we would stop emission right now,

1584
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:11,960
we would not turn it back. Maybe there are ways for carbon capture. But so far, there is no

1585
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:16,760
sustainable carbon capture technology that we can deploy. Maybe there is a way to put

1586
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:21,720
results in the atmosphere to cool it down. It's the possibilities, right? But right now,

1587
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:29,320
per default, it seems that we will step into a situation where we feel that we've run too far.

1588
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:34,280
And going back is not something that we can do smoothly and gradually, but it's going to

1589
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,760
lead to a catastrophic event.

1590
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:44,600
A catastrophic event of one kind. So can you see them in the case that we will continue dancing

1591
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:49,160
along and always stop just short of the edge of the cliff?

1592
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:55,160
I think it's possible, but it doesn't seem to be likely. So I think this model that is

1593
02:21:55,160 --> 02:22:00,920
being apparent in the simulation that we're making of climate pollution economies and so on is

1594
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:08,040
that many effects are only visible with a significant delay. And in that time, the system

1595
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:13,560
is moving much more out of the equilibrium state or of the state where homeostasis is still possible,

1596
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:18,440
and instead moves into a different state, one that is going to harbor fewer people.

1597
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:24,040
And that is basically the concern there. And again, it's a possibility. It's just

1598
02:22:24,040 --> 02:22:29,400
and it's a possibility that is larger than the possibility that it's not happening,

1599
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:32,520
that we will be safe, that we will be able to dance back all the time.

1600
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:38,120
So the climate is one thing, but there's a lot of other threats that might have a faster feedback

1601
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:44,760
mechanism, less delay. There is also a thing that AI is probably going to happen, and it's going to

1602
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:51,160
make everything uncertain again, because it is going to affect so many variables that it's

1603
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:56,120
very hard for us to make a projection into the future anymore. And maybe that's a good thing.

1604
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:02,520
It does not give us the freedom, I think, to say now we don't need to care about anything

1605
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:09,240
anymore, because AI will either kill us or save us. But I suspect that if humanity continues,

1606
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:15,240
it will be due to AI. What's the timeline for things to get real weird with AI?

1607
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:20,280
And it can get weird in interesting ways before you get to AGI. What about AI girlfriends and

1608
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:26,120
boyfriends? Fundamentally transforming human relationships? I think human relationships

1609
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:31,400
are already fundamentally transformed and it's already very weird. By which technology? For

1610
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:38,680
instance, social media. Yeah. Is it though? Isn't the fundamentals of the core group of humans that

1611
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:45,560
affect your life still the same? Your loved ones, family? No, I think that, for instance, many people

1612
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:50,040
live in intentional communities right now. They're moving around until they find people

1613
02:23:50,040 --> 02:23:54,840
that they can relate to and they become their family. And often that doesn't work, because it

1614
02:23:54,840 --> 02:24:00,440
turns out that instead of having grown networks where you get around with the people that you

1615
02:24:00,440 --> 02:24:05,480
grew up with, you have more transactional relationships. You shop around, you have markets

1616
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:11,480
for attention and pleasure and relationships. That kills the magic somehow. Why is that?

1617
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:19,880
Why is the transactional search for optimizing allocation of attention somehow misses the

1618
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:24,120
the romantic magic of what human relations are? It's all the question how magical was it before.

1619
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:28,920
Was it that you just could rely on instincts that used your intuitions and you didn't need to

1620
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:34,680
rationally reflect? But once you understand, it's no longer magical because you actually understand

1621
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:39,560
why you were attracted to this person at this age and not to that person at this age and what the

1622
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:44,280
actual considerations were that went on in your mind and what the calculations were,

1623
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:48,120
what's the likelihood that you're going to have a sustainable relationship with this person,

1624
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:52,280
that this person is not going to leave you for somebody else, how are your life trajectories

1625
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:57,560
are going to evolve and so on. And when you're young, you're unable to ex-locate all this and you

1626
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:02,520
have to rely on intuitions and instincts that in part you were born with and also on the

1627
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:07,800
wisdom of your environment that is going to give you some kind of reflection on your choices.

1628
02:25:07,880 --> 02:25:13,000
And many of these things are disappearing now because we feel that our parents might have no

1629
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,400
idea about how we are living and the environments that we grow up in, the cultures that we grow up

1630
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:23,720
in, the milieus that our parents existed in might have no ability to teach us how to deal with this

1631
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:29,560
new world. And for many people that's actually true, but it doesn't mean that within one generation

1632
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:33,240
we build something that is more magical and more sustainable and more beautiful.

1633
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:40,280
Instead, we often end up with an attempt to produce something that looks beautiful. I was

1634
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:47,560
very vetted out by the aesthetics of the Vision Pro, that's that by Apple. And not so much because

1635
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:52,040
I don't like the technology, I'm very curious about what it's going to be like and don't have

1636
02:25:52,040 --> 02:25:58,040
no opinion yet. But the aesthetics of the presentation and so on, they're so uncanny

1637
02:25:58,040 --> 02:26:05,720
valley-esque to me, the characters being extremely plastic, living in some hypothetical

1638
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:16,920
mid-century furniture museum. This is the proliferation of marketing teams.

1639
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:22,600
Yes, but it was a CGI-generated world. And was a CGI-generated world that doesn't exist. And

1640
02:26:22,600 --> 02:26:25,880
when I complained about this, some friends came back to me and said,

1641
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:31,400
but these are startup founders. This is what they live like in Silicon Valley. And I try to

1642
02:26:31,400 --> 02:26:35,480
tell them, no, I know lots of people in Silicon Valley. This is not what people are like. They're

1643
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:44,520
still people. They're still human beings. So the grounding in physical reality somehow

1644
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:49,960
is important too? In culture. And so basically what's absent in this thing is culture. There is

1645
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:57,080
a simulation of culture, an attempt to replace culture by catalogue, by some kind of aesthetic

1646
02:26:57,080 --> 02:27:02,680
optimization that is not the result of having a sustainable life, a sustainable human relationships

1647
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:11,080
with houses that work for you and a mode of living that works for you in which these glasses fit in

1648
02:27:11,080 --> 02:27:15,320
naturally. And I guess that's also why so many people have read it out about the product because

1649
02:27:15,320 --> 02:27:19,800
they don't know how is this actually going to fit into my life and into my human relationships.

1650
02:27:19,800 --> 02:27:24,440
Because the way in which it was presented in these videos didn't seem to be credible.

1651
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:32,360
Do you think AI, when it's deployed by companies like Microsoft and Google and Meta,

1652
02:27:32,360 --> 02:27:39,880
will have the same issue of being weirdly corporate? There'll be some uncanny valley,

1653
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:44,200
some weirdness to the whole presentation. So this is, I've got a chance to talk to George

1654
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:47,560
Haatz, he believes everything should be open source and decentralized and there,

1655
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:55,400
then we shall have the AI of the people. And it'll maintain a grounding to the magic that's

1656
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:02,280
humanity, that's the human condition that corporations will destroy the magic.

1657
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:09,400
I believe that if we make everything open source and make this mandatory, we are going to lose

1658
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:15,400
about a lot of beautiful art and a lot of beautiful designs. There is a reason why

1659
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:24,920
Linux desktop is still ugly. And it's difficult to create coherence in open source designs

1660
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:31,640
so far when the designs have to get very large and it's easier to make this happening in a company

1661
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:38,680
with centralized organization. And from my own perspective, what we should ensure is that open

1662
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:45,080
source never dies, that it can always compete and has a place with the other forms of organization,

1663
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:49,560
because I think it is absolutely vital that open source exists and that we have systems

1664
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:55,880
that people have under control outside of the corporation. And that is also producing viable

1665
02:28:55,880 --> 02:29:01,320
competition to the corporations. So the corporations, the centralized control, the

1666
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:09,400
dictatorships of corporations can create beauty because centralized design is a source of a lot

1667
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:17,880
of beauty. And then I guess open source is a source of freedom, a hedge against the corrupting nature

1668
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:24,520
of power that comes with centralized. I grew up in socialism and I learned that corporations

1669
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:28,600
are totally evil and I found this very, very convincing. And then you look at corporations

1670
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:34,360
like Enron and Halliburton maybe and realize, yeah, they are evil. But you also notice that many

1671
02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:39,800
other corporations are not evil. They're surprisingly benevolent. Why are they so benevolent? Is

1672
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:44,840
this because everybody is fighting them all the time? I don't think that's the only explanation.

1673
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:49,240
It's because they're actually animals that live in a large ecosystem and that are still

1674
02:29:49,240 --> 02:29:54,520
largely controlled by people that want that ecosystem to flourish and be viable for people.

1675
02:29:54,520 --> 02:30:01,000
So I think that Pat Gelsinger is completely sincere when he leads Intel to be a tool that

1676
02:30:01,720 --> 02:30:07,080
supplies the free world with semiconductors. And it's not necessary that all the semiconductors

1677
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:11,480
are coming from Intel. It just, Intel needs to be there to make sure that we always have them.

1678
02:30:12,760 --> 02:30:16,760
So there can be many ways in which we can import and trade semiconductors from

1679
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:20,840
other companies in places. We just need to make sure that nobody can cut us off from it because

1680
02:30:20,840 --> 02:30:27,160
that would be a disaster for this kind of society and world. And so there are many things that need

1681
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:34,280
to be done to make our style of life possible. And then with this, I don't mean just capitalism

1682
02:30:34,280 --> 02:30:39,880
and environmental destruction, consumerism and creature comforts. I mean an idea of life in

1683
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:46,600
which we are determined not by some kind of king or dictator, but in which individuals can determine

1684
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:51,400
themselves to the largest possible degree. And to me this is something that this western world

1685
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:56,360
is still trying to embody. And it's a very valuable idea that we shouldn't give up too early.

1686
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:04,200
And from this perspective, the US is a system of interleaving clubs. And an entrepreneur is a

1687
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:10,200
special club founder. It's somebody who makes a club that is producing things that are economically

1688
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:15,400
viable. And to do this, it requires a lot of people who are dedicating a significant part of their life

1689
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:20,680
for working for this particular kind of club. And the entrepreneur is picking the initial set

1690
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:26,040
of rules and the mission and vision and aesthetics for the club and make sure that it works. But

1691
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:30,680
the people that are in there need to be protected. If they sacrifice part of their life, they need

1692
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:36,440
to be rules that tell how they're being taken care of even after they leave the club and so on. So

1693
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:42,200
there's a large body of rules that have been created by our rule giving clubs and that are

1694
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:47,320
by our enforcement clubs and so on. And some of these clubs have to be monopolies for game

1695
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:51,880
theoretic reasons, which also makes them more open to corruption and less harder to update.

1696
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:57,560
And this is an ongoing discussion and process that takes place. But the beauty of this idea that

1697
02:31:57,560 --> 02:32:03,560
there is no centralized king who is that is extracting from the peasants and breeding the

1698
02:32:03,560 --> 02:32:10,440
peasants into serving the king and fulfilling all the roles like Anson and Antel. But that

1699
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:15,400
there is a freedom of association and corporations are one of them. It's something that took me

1700
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:21,400
some time to realize. So I do think that corporations are dangerous. They need to be

1701
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:27,880
protections against overreach of corporations that can do regular recapture and prevent

1702
02:32:27,880 --> 02:32:33,640
open source from competing with corporations by imposing rules that make it impossible for

1703
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:38,440
a small group of kids to come together to build their own language model because

1704
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:43,560
open AI has convinced the US that you need to have some kind of FDA process that you need

1705
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:47,560
to go through that costs many million dollars before you are able to train a language model.

1706
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:53,400
This is important to make sure that this doesn't happen. So I think that open AI and Google are

1707
02:32:53,400 --> 02:32:59,560
good things. If these good things are kept in check in such a way that all the other clubs can

1708
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:04,280
still be founded and all the other forms of clubs that are desirable can still coexist with them.

1709
02:33:04,280 --> 02:33:09,960
So what do you think about meta in contrast to that open sourcing most of its

1710
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:15,640
language models and most of the AI models it's working on and actually suggesting that they

1711
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:21,400
will continue to do so in the future for future versions of Lama for example their large language

1712
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:29,880
model. Is that exciting to you? Is that concerning? I don't find it very concerning but that's

1713
02:33:29,880 --> 02:33:39,560
also because I think that the language models are not very dangerous yet. As I said, I have no

1714
02:33:39,560 --> 02:33:47,160
proof that there is the boundary between the language models and AI. It's possible that somebody

1715
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:53,800
builds a version of baby AGI I think and stores in the algorithmic improvements that scale these

1716
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:58,360
systems up in ways that otherwise wouldn't have happened without these language model components.

1717
02:33:58,360 --> 02:34:04,280
So it's not really clear for me what the end game is there and if these models can

1718
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:11,320
bootforce their way into AGI. And there's also a possibility that the AGI that we are building

1719
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:16,280
with these language models are not taking responsibility for what they are because they

1720
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:23,160
don't understand the greater game. And so to me it would be interesting to try to understand how to

1721
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:28,120
build systems that understand what the greater games are, what are the longest games that we

1722
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:35,480
can play on this planet. Games broadly like deeply define the way you did with the games.

1723
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:39,080
In the game theoretic sense. So when we are interacting with each other in some sense we

1724
02:34:39,080 --> 02:34:42,920
are playing games. We are making lots and lots of interactions. This doesn't mean that these

1725
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:48,200
interactions have all to be transactional. Every one of us is playing some kind of game by

1726
02:34:49,160 --> 02:34:53,240
virtue of identifying this particular kinds of goals that we have or aesthetics

1727
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:59,560
from which we derive the goals. So when you say, I'm Lex Friedman, I'm doing a set of podcasts,

1728
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:04,520
then you feel that it's part of something larger that you want to build. Maybe you want to inspire

1729
02:35:04,520 --> 02:35:09,400
people. Maybe you want them to see more possibilities and get them together over shared ideas.

1730
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:13,880
Maybe your game is that you want to become super rich and famous by being the best post

1731
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:17,960
caster on earth. Maybe you have other games. Maybe it's pitches from time to time.

1732
02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:22,360
But there is a certain perspective where you might be thinking what is the longest possible

1733
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:27,000
game that you could be playing. A short game is for instance cancer is playing a shorter game

1734
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,920
than your organism. Cancer is an organism playing a shorter game than the regular organism. Because

1735
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:39,480
the cancer cannot procreate beyond the organism except for some infectious cancers like the ones

1736
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:46,680
that eradicated the Tasmanian devils. You typically end up with a situation where the organism dies

1737
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:51,240
together with the cancer because the cancer has destroyed the larger system due to playing a

1738
02:35:51,240 --> 02:35:59,160
shorter game. Ideally, you want to build agents that play the longest possible games. The longest

1739
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:05,000
possible games is to keep entropy at bay as long as possible while doing interesting stuff.

1740
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:10,920
But the longest, yes, that part, the longest possible game while doing interesting stuff

1741
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:15,800
and while maintaining at least the same amount of interesting complexities of propagating.

1742
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:23,080
Currently, I'm pretty much identified as a conscious being. It's the minimal identification

1743
02:36:23,080 --> 02:36:28,760
that I manage to get together. Because if I turn this off, I fall asleep. And when I'm asleep,

1744
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:34,520
I'm a vegetable. I'm no longer here as an agent. So my agency is basically predicated on being

1745
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:41,080
conscious. And what I care about is other conscious agents. They're the only moral agents for me.

1746
02:36:41,960 --> 02:36:51,320
And so if an AI were to treat me as a moral agent, that it is interested in coexisting with

1747
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:57,080
and cooperating with and mutually supporting each other, maybe it is, I think, necessary that the AI

1748
02:36:57,080 --> 02:37:02,440
thinks that consciousness is a viable mode of existence and important. So I think it would

1749
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:09,400
be very important to build conscious AI and do this as the primary goal. So not just say we want

1750
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:13,880
to build a useful tool that we can use for all sorts of things. And then you have to make sure

1751
02:37:13,880 --> 02:37:19,160
that the impact on the labor market is something that is not too disruptive and manageable. And

1752
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:24,600
the impact on the copyright holder is manageable and not too disruptive and so on. I don't think

1753
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:30,840
that's the most important game to be played. I think that we will see extremely large disruptions

1754
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:37,960
of this status quo that are quite unpredictable at this point. And I just personally want to

1755
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:41,960
make sure that some of the stuff on the other side is interesting and conscious.

1756
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:49,320
How do we ride as individuals and as a society this disruptive wave that changes the nature

1757
02:37:49,320 --> 02:37:53,400
of the game? Absolutely don't know. So everybody is going to do their best as always.

1758
02:37:53,400 --> 02:38:00,760
Do we build the bunker in the woods? Do we meditate more? Drugs, so mushrooms, psychedelics, I mean

1759
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:08,120
what? Lots of sex. What are we talking about here? Do you play Diablo IV? I'm hoping that

1760
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:14,200
will help me escape for a brief moment. What? Play video games? What? Do you have ideas?

1761
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:22,760
I really like playing Disco Elysium. This was one of the most beautiful computer games I played

1762
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:29,880
in recent years. And it's a noir novel that is a philosophical perspective on Western society

1763
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:35,880
from the perspective of an Estonian. And he first of all wrote a book about this

1764
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:43,800
world that is a parallel universe that is quite poetic and fascinating and is condensing

1765
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:50,040
his perspective on our societies. It was very, very nice. He spent a lot of time writing it.

1766
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:54,840
He had, I think, sold a couple thousand books and as a result became an alcoholic.

1767
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:59,480
And then he had the idea or one of his friends had the idea of turning this into an RPG.

1768
02:39:00,280 --> 02:39:06,440
And it's mind-blowing. They spent the illustrator more than a year just on making

1769
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:14,920
the art for the scenes in between. So aesthetically it captures you. It's stunning.

1770
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:18,760
But it's a philosophical work of art. It's a reflection of society. It's fascinating to

1771
02:39:18,760 --> 02:39:26,360
spend time in this world. And so for me it was using a medium in a new way and telling a story

1772
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:34,680
that left me enriched. When I tried Diablo, I didn't feel enriched playing it. I felt that

1773
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:39,480
the time playing it was not unpleasant, but there's also more pleasant stuff that I can do in that

1774
02:39:39,480 --> 02:39:45,240
time. So ultimately I feel that I'm being gamed. I'm not gaming. Oh, the addiction thing. Yes.

1775
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:50,040
I basically feel that there is a very transparent economy that's going on. The story of Diablo

1776
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:57,080
was branded. So it's not really interesting to me. My heart is slowly breaking by the deep truth

1777
02:39:57,080 --> 02:40:05,480
you're conveying to me. Why can't you just allow me to enjoy my personal addiction? I have no

1778
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:13,560
objection here. I'm just trying to describe what's happening and it's not that I don't do things

1779
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:18,280
for a later say, oh, I wish I would have done something different. I also know that when we

1780
02:40:18,280 --> 02:40:22,680
die, the greatest regret that people typically have on that desk but they say, oh, I wish I had

1781
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:28,280
spent more time on Twitter. No, I don't think that's the case. I think I should probably have

1782
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:34,520
spent less time on Twitter. But I found it so useful for myself and also so addictive that I

1783
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:39,080
felt I need to make the best of it and turn it into an art form and thought form. And it did

1784
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:44,680
help me to develop something. But I wish for other things I could have done in the meantime. It's

1785
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:48,360
just not the universe that we're in anymore. Most people don't read books anymore.

1786
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:56,520
What do you think that means that we don't read books anymore? What do you think that means about

1787
02:40:56,520 --> 02:41:01,080
the collective intelligence of our species? Is it possible it's still progressing and growing?

1788
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:05,240
Well, it clearly is. There is stuff happening on Twitter that was impossible with books.

1789
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:11,640
And I really regret that Twitter has not taken the turn that I was hoping for. I thought Elon is

1790
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:16,760
global brain pilled and understands that this thing needs to self-organize and he needs to

1791
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:22,760
develop tools to allow the profligation of the self-organization so Twitter can become sentient.

1792
02:41:23,480 --> 02:41:29,480
And maybe this was a pipe dream from the beginning. But I felt that the enormous pressure that he

1793
02:41:29,480 --> 02:41:36,280
was under made it impossible for him to work on any kind of content goals. And also many of the

1794
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:41,720
decisions that he made under this pressure seem to be not very wise. I don't think that

1795
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:46,040
as a CEO of a social media company, you should have opinions in the culture bar in public.

1796
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:53,000
I think that's very short-sighted. And I also suspect that it's not a good idea to

1797
02:41:56,600 --> 02:42:04,120
block Paul Graham of all people over setting a must-do-don link. And I think Paul made this

1798
02:42:04,120 --> 02:42:09,320
intentionally because he wanted to show Elon Musk that blocking people for setting a link

1799
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:14,280
is completely counter to any idea of free speech that he intended to bring to Twitter.

1800
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:19,800
And basically, seeing that Elon was very less principled in his thinking there and

1801
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:27,480
is much more experimental. And many of the things that he is trying, they pan out very

1802
02:42:27,480 --> 02:42:32,600
differently in a digital society than they pan out in a car company because the effect is very

1803
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:36,680
different because everything that you do in a digital society is going to have real-world cultural

1804
02:42:36,680 --> 02:42:44,600
effects. And so basically, I find it quite regrettable that this guy is able to become

1805
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:48,680
de facto the Pope where Twitter has more active members than the Catholic Church.

1806
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:55,240
And he doesn't get it. The power and responsibility that he has and the ability

1807
02:42:55,240 --> 02:42:59,960
to create something in this society that is lasting and that is producing a digital

1808
02:43:00,040 --> 02:43:05,080
agora in a way that has never existed before, where we built a social network on top of a social

1809
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:11,480
network, an actual society on top of the algorithms. So this is something that is hoped

1810
02:43:11,480 --> 02:43:17,240
still in the future and still in the cards. But it's something that exists in small parts.

1811
02:43:17,240 --> 02:43:21,400
I find that the corner of Twitter that I'm in is extremely pleasant. Just when I take a few

1812
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:25,640
steps outside of it, it is not very wholesome anymore. And the way in which people interact

1813
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:28,840
with strangers suggests that it's not a civilized society yet.

1814
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:33,960
So as the number of people who follow you on Twitter expands,

1815
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:39,960
you feel the burden of the uglier sides of humanity.

1816
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:46,600
Yes, but there's also a similar thing in the normal world that is if you become more influential,

1817
02:43:46,600 --> 02:43:52,680
if you have more status, if you have more fame in the real world, you get lots of perks,

1818
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:57,320
but you also have way less freedom in the way in which you interact with people,

1819
02:43:57,320 --> 02:44:05,480
especially the strangers, because a certain percentage of people, a single-digit percentage

1820
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:12,600
is nuts and dangerous. And the more of those are looking at you, the more of them might get ideas.

1821
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:18,600
But what if the technology enables you to discover the majority of people,

1822
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:23,160
to discover and connect efficiently and regularly with the majority of people who are

1823
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:31,000
actually really good? One of my concerns with the platform, my Twitter, is there's a lot of

1824
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:34,600
really smart people out there, a lot of smart people that disagree with me and with others

1825
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:40,120
between each other. And I love that if the technology would bring those to the top,

1826
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:46,280
the beautiful disagreements, like intelligent squared type of debates. There's a bunch of,

1827
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:51,160
I mean, one of my favorite things to listen to is arguments, and arguments like high-effort

1828
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:55,560
arguments with respect and love underneath it, but then it gets a little too heated,

1829
02:44:55,560 --> 02:45:00,120
but that kind of too heated, which I've seen you participate in, and I love that,

1830
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:06,520
with Lee Kroner with those kinds of folks. And you go pretty hard, like you get frustrated,

1831
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:13,400
but it's all beautiful. Obviously, I can do this because we know each other. And Lee has the rare

1832
02:45:13,400 --> 02:45:18,120
gift of being willing to be wrong in public. So basically he has thoughts that are as wrong as

1833
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:23,160
the random thoughts of an average highly intelligent person, but he blurs them out,

1834
02:45:23,160 --> 02:45:28,680
while not being sure if they're right. And he enjoys doing that. And once you understand that

1835
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:33,800
this is his game, you don't get offended by him saying something that you think is so wrong.

1836
02:45:33,800 --> 02:45:40,040
But he's constantly, passively communicating a respect for the people he's talking with,

1837
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:44,520
and for just basic humanity and truth and all that kind of stuff. And there's a self-deprecating

1838
02:45:44,520 --> 02:45:51,240
thing. There's a bunch of social skills you acquire that allow you to be a great debater,

1839
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:57,480
a great argumenter, be wrong in public, and explore ideas together in public when you disagree.

1840
02:45:57,480 --> 02:46:03,640
And if I would love for Twitter to elevate those folks, elevate those kinds of conversations.

1841
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:09,640
It already does, in some sense. But also if it elevates them too much, then you get this

1842
02:46:09,640 --> 02:46:16,840
phenomenal clubhouse where you always get dragged on stage. And I found this very stressful because

1843
02:46:16,840 --> 02:46:22,040
it was too intense. I don't like to be dragged on stage all the time. I think once a week is enough.

1844
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:29,080
And also when I met Lee the first time, I found that a lot of people seem to be shocked by the

1845
02:46:29,080 --> 02:46:35,800
fact that he was being very aggressive with their results, that he didn't seem to show a lot of

1846
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:40,600
sensibility in the way in which he was criticizing what they were doing and being dismissive of the

1847
02:46:40,600 --> 02:46:46,120
work of others. And that was not, I think, in any way a shortcoming of him because I noticed

1848
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:50,920
that he was much, much more dismissive with respect to his own work. It was his general

1849
02:46:50,920 --> 02:46:55,880
stance. And I felt that this general stance is creating a lot of liability for him because

1850
02:46:55,880 --> 02:47:02,360
really a lot of people take offense at him being not like their carnage character who is always

1851
02:47:02,360 --> 02:47:07,720
smooth and make sure that everybody likes him. So I really respect that he is willing to take

1852
02:47:07,720 --> 02:47:14,360
that risk and to be wrong in public and to offend people. And he doesn't do this in any bad way.

1853
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:20,440
It's just most people feel or not all people recognize this. And so I can be much more aggressive

1854
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:25,720
with him than I can be with many other people who don't play the same game because he understands

1855
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:30,680
the way in the spirit in which I respond to him. I think that's a fun and that's a beautiful game.

1856
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:36,360
It's ultimately a productive one. Speaking of taking that risk, you tweeted,

1857
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:41,960
when you have the choice between being a creator, consumer or redistributor,

1858
02:47:41,960 --> 02:47:48,440
always go for creation. Not only does it lead to a more beautiful world, but also to a much

1859
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:53,000
more satisfying life for yourself. And don't get stuck preparing yourself for the journey.

1860
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:59,880
The time is always now. So let me ask for advice. What advice would you give on how to become such

1861
02:47:59,880 --> 02:48:08,600
a creator on Twitter in your own life? I was very lucky to be alive at the time of the collapse

1862
02:48:08,600 --> 02:48:14,520
of Eastern Germany and the transition into Western Germany. And me and my friends and most of the

1863
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:20,680
people I knew were East Germans and we were very poor because we didn't have money. And all the

1864
02:48:20,680 --> 02:48:25,320
capital was in Western Germany and they bought our factories and shut them down because they were

1865
02:48:25,320 --> 02:48:31,560
mostly only interested in the market rather than creating new production capacity. And so

1866
02:48:32,520 --> 02:48:39,320
cities were poor and in disrepair and we could not afford things. And I could not afford to

1867
02:48:39,320 --> 02:48:45,960
go into a restaurant and order a meal there. I would have to cook at home. But I also thought,

1868
02:48:45,960 --> 02:48:51,000
why not just have a restaurant with my friends? So we would open up a cafe with friends and a

1869
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,480
restaurant and we would cook for each other in these restaurants and also invite the general

1870
02:48:55,480 --> 02:49:00,760
public and they could donate. And eventually this became so big that we could turn this into

1871
02:49:01,880 --> 02:49:06,440
some incorporated form and it became a regular restaurant at some point. Or we did the same

1872
02:49:06,440 --> 02:49:13,640
thing with the movie theater. We would not be able to afford to pay 12 marks to watch a movie.

1873
02:49:13,640 --> 02:49:19,320
But why not just create our own movie theater and then invite people to pay and we would rent

1874
02:49:19,320 --> 02:49:25,880
the movies in a way in which a movie theater does. But it would be a community movie theater

1875
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:31,080
in which everybody who wants to help can watch for free and builds this thing and renovates the

1876
02:49:31,080 --> 02:49:37,320
building. And so we ended up creating lots and lots of infrastructure. And I think when you are

1877
02:49:37,320 --> 02:49:41,880
young and you don't have money, move to a place where this is still happening. Move to one of

1878
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:46,360
those places that are undeveloped and where you get a critical mass of other people who are starting

1879
02:49:46,360 --> 02:49:50,760
to build infrastructure to live in. And that's super satisfying because you're not just creating

1880
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:56,120
infrastructure, but you're creating a small society that is building culture and ways to

1881
02:49:56,120 --> 02:50:01,080
interact with each other. And that's much, much more satisfying than going into some kind of

1882
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:08,360
chain and get your needs met by ordering food from this chain and so on. So not just consuming

1883
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:13,400
culture, but creating culture. And you don't always have that choice. That's why I prefaced it

1884
02:50:13,400 --> 02:50:17,400
when you do have the choice and there are many roles that need to be played. We need people who

1885
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:21,880
take care of our distribution in society and so on. But when you have the choice to create

1886
02:50:21,880 --> 02:50:27,240
something, always go for creation. It's so much more satisfying. And it also is, this is what life

1887
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:35,560
is about, I think. Yeah. Speaking of which, you retweeted this meme of a life of a philosopher

1888
02:50:35,640 --> 02:50:42,520
in a nutshell. It's birth and death and in between, it's a chubby guy and says, why though?

1889
02:50:46,440 --> 02:50:51,880
What do you think is the answer to that? Well, the answer is that everything that

1890
02:50:51,880 --> 02:50:58,280
can exist might exist. And in many ways, you take it an ecological perspective,

1891
02:50:58,280 --> 02:51:03,400
the same way as when you look at human opinions and cultures. It's not that there is right and

1892
02:51:03,400 --> 02:51:08,840
wrong opinions when you look at this from this ecological perspective. But every opinion that

1893
02:51:08,840 --> 02:51:15,480
fits between two human ears might be between two human ears. And so when I see a strange opinion

1894
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:20,920
on social media, it's not that I feel that I have a need to get upset. It's often more that I, oh,

1895
02:51:20,920 --> 02:51:27,400
there you are. And when an opinion is incentivized, then it's going to be abundant. And when you take

1896
02:51:27,400 --> 02:51:31,480
this ecological perspective also on yourself and you realize you're just one of these mushrooms

1897
02:51:31,480 --> 02:51:37,000
that are popping up and doing this thing. And you can, depending on where you chose to grow and

1898
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:42,440
where you happen to grow, you can flourish or not doing this or that strategy. And it's still all

1899
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:46,280
the same life at some level. It's all the same experience of being a conscious being in the

1900
02:51:46,280 --> 02:51:52,360
world. And you do have some choice about who you want to be more than any other animal has.

1901
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:58,920
That to me is fascinating. And so I think that rather than asking yourself, what is the one way

1902
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:04,520
to be, think about what are the possibilities that I have, what it would be the most interesting

1903
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:08,440
way to be that I can be. Because everything is possible. So you get to explore this.

1904
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:14,200
Not everything is possible. But if things fail, most things fail. But often there are possibilities

1905
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:22,520
that we are not seeing, especially if we choose who we are. To the degree we can choose.

1906
02:52:23,400 --> 02:52:32,680
Yasha, you're one of my favorite humans in this world. Consciousness is to merge with

1907
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:38,120
for a brief moment of time. It's always an honor. It always blows my mind. It will take me

1908
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:47,720
days if not weeks to recover. And I already miss our chats. Thank you so much. Thank you so much

1909
02:52:47,720 --> 02:52:54,440
for speaking with me so many times. Thank you so much for all the ideas you put out into the world.

1910
02:52:55,000 --> 02:53:01,000
And I'm a huge fan of following you now in this interesting, weird time we're going through with

1911
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:07,080
AI. So thank you again for talking today. Thank you Lex for this conversation. I enjoyed it very much.

1912
02:53:08,120 --> 02:53:11,800
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yasha Bach. To support this podcast,

1913
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:17,080
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

1914
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:23,320
the psychologist Carl Jung. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,

1915
02:53:23,960 --> 02:53:31,320
but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable and therefore

1916
02:53:31,320 --> 02:53:39,720
not popular. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
