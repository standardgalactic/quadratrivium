1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
I don't know what it's like to be an alien, I would like to know.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,040
Two alien civilizations co-existent on a planet, what's that look like exactly?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,360
When you see them and they see you, you're assuming they have vision,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,400
they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
There's a lot of assumptions they're making.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
What human level intelligence has done is quite different.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,840
It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before,

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,560
it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,120
and we can actually make them come into existence.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,480
So you can travel back in time sometimes?

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:32,960
Yes.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,960
You travel forward in time to travel back?

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,280
Yes.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,560
The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,160
They have each been on this podcast once before individually

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,280
and now for their second time they're here together.

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,360
Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, Lee is a chemist,

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,720
and if I may say so, the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
They both are interested in how life originates and develops

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,480
both life here on earth and alien life,

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,400
including intelligent alien civilizations out there in the cosmos.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,640
They are colleagues and friends who love to explore,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,080
disagree and debate nuanced points about alien life.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,680
And so we're calling this an alien debate.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,880
Very few questions to me are as fascinating as what do aliens look like?

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,480
How do we recognize them?

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,080
How do we talk to them?

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,800
And how do we make sense of life here on earth

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,760
in the context of all possible life forms that are out there?

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,720
Treating these questions with the seriousness and rigor they deserve

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,120
so that I hope to do with this conversation and future ones like it.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,240
Our world is shrouded in mystery.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
We must first be humbled to acknowledge this

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,400
and then be bold in diving in and trying to figure things out anyway.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,160
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,440
And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,080
First of all, welcome back, Sarah.

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,960
Welcome back, Lee.

40
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,480
You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,520
You're incredible people.

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,120
I should say thank you to Sarah for wearing really awesome boots.

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
We'll probably overlay a picture later on,

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,600
but why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
This is me dressed up.

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,200
You were saying that you're pink.

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
That your thing is pink.

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,360
My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
Where's the pink?

50
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
When did it hit you that pink is your color?

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,480
I became pink about, I don't know, actually, maybe 2017?

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,720
Did you know me when you first-

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
I think I met you pre-pink.

54
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
So about 2017, I think, I just decided I was boring

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
and I needed to make a statement.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,960
And red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
Well, I think you were always pink.

59
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,280
You just found yourself in 2017.

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,400
There's an amazing photo of him

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,160
where there's like everybody in their black gown

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,440
and he's just wearing the pink pants.

63
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
Well, that wasn't a wagon in university.

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,160
It's totally nuts.

65
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,640
100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
and they didn't find the outfit for me.

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,960
So they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,240
and there was me dressed up in pink,

69
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
looking like a complete idiot.

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,920
We're definitely going to have to find that picture

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,520
and overlay a big full-screen slow motion.

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
All right, let's talk about aliens.

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,760
We'll find places we disagree

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
and places we agree.

75
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,720
Life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,880
Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson

77
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,920
Quote,

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,920
How egocentric of us to think that space aliens

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,520
who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,560
would give, pardon the French,

82
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
would give a shit about humans on Earth.

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,920
So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,

84
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,600
observing, communicating with humans?

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,160
Let's take a perspective of aliens.

86
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Maybe Sarah, first, are we interesting

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,760
in the whole spectrum of life in the universe?

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now

89
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
we're the most interesting thing in the universe.

90
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,240
So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity that we have

91
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,640
and how much I think that's deeply related to the physics of what we are

92
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,920
that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,320
examples of the phenomena they are to understand themselves better.

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
And I don't think there's any kind of judgment on

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,920
it being a lesser being or not.

97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,320
It's like saying you have nothing to learn by talking to a baby.

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,320
You have lots to learn, probably more than you do talking to somebody that's 90.

99
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
So whatever the phenomena is that is human,

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomenon

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
within alien species and they will be seeking that same.

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,520
I think there's got to be some features of us that are universal.

104
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,400
And I think the ones that are most interesting,

105
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
and I hope I live in an interesting universe,

106
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,920
are the ones that are driven by our curiosity

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,480
and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,280
that the universe wouldn't be able to do without things like us existing.

109
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,160
We're going to define a lot of terms.

110
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,440
One of them is interesting.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Yes.

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,880
That's a very interesting term to try to define.

113
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,560
What do you think are humans interesting for aliens?

114
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,720
Well, let's take it from our perspective.

115
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,960
We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
So if we put the shoe on the other foot, of course we're interesting.

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
But I'm wondering, and assuming that we're at the right technological capability

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,040
to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting.

119
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,040
So what I mean is, if there needs to be a massive leap in technology

120
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,720
that we don't have, how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
But I do think that they would come and find us,

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
because they'd want to find out about our culture,

123
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
what things are universal, what about, I mean, I'm a chemist,

124
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
so I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?

125
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Are the creatures that we're going to find making all this commotion,

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
are they made of the same stuff?

127
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
What does their science look like?

128
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,000
Are they off-planet yet?

129
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,520
I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson is being slightly pessimistic

130
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,280
and maybe trying to play the tune that the universe is vast

131
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
and it's not worth them coming here.

132
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,320
I don't think that, but I just worry that maybe we don't have the ability

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,400
to talk to them, we don't have the universal translator,

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,600
we don't have the right physics.

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,280
But sure, they should come.

136
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
We are interesting.

137
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,520
I want to know if they exist.

138
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,040
It would make it easy if they just came.

139
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,240
So again, I'm going to use your tweets like it's Shakespeare and analyze it.

140
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,960
So Sarah tweeted, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,320
So how much do you think aliens are thinking about other aliens,

142
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
including humans?

143
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:15,280
So you said we humans want to visit, we're longing to connect with aliens.

144
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,920
Why is that?

145
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,800
Can you introspect that?

146
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,480
Is that an obvious thing that we should be?

147
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,760
Like, what are we hoping to understand by meeting aliens?

148
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,960
Exactly.

149
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Asking as an introvert is like, I ask myself this all the time,

150
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,600
why go out on a Friday night to meet people?

151
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
What are you hoping to find?

152
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,680
I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
I think I answered it actually as well, which was,

154
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,880
we are thinking about trying to make contact.

155
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,440
So they almost certainly are, but maybe there's a number of classes.

156
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
There are those aliens that have not yet made contact with other aliens, like us.

157
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,680
Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien,

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,440
and maybe it's an anti-climax and slime.

159
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,720
And aliens that have made contact with not just one set of intelligent species,

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,120
but several, that must be amazing actually.

161
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,280
Literally, there is some place in the universe,

162
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,400
there must be one alien civilization to not make contact with, not one,

163
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
but two other intelligent civilizations.

164
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
So they must be thinking about it.

165
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,480
There must be entire degree courses on aliens,

166
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,560
thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.

167
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
Do you think they will survive the meeting?

168
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,480
And by the way, Lee did respond saying that's all the universe wants.

169
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,280
So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

170
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,400
Lee said, that's all the universe wants.

171
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,760
And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.

172
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,160
So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,

173
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,880
all of which we'll try to define mathematically.

174
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,040
Cheeky might be harder than interesting.

175
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
Because there's humor in that too.

176
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,360
Yes.

177
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
I think there's a mathematical definition of humor,

178
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
but we'll talk about that in a bit.

179
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
Oh, interesting.

180
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,560
Yeah, it surely is, yeah.

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,840
So if you're a graduate student alien looking at multiple alien civilizations,

182
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,240
do you think they survive the encounters?

183
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize.

184
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,080
A lot of the discussions about alien life, which is a really big challenge.

185
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems,

186
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,400
I don't try to think about us as humans,

187
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,080
but us as an example of phenomena that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.

188
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,520
And it doesn't seem to be the case that if I think about the features,

189
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,400
I would argue are most universal about that phenomena,

190
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,960
that there's any reason to think that a first encounter with another lineage

191
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,560
or example of life would be antagonistic.

192
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
I think, yeah.

193
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
And I think there's this kind of assumption.

194
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,200
I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote,

195
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
I mean, it kind of bothers me because I'm a physicist,

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,160
so I know we have a lot of egos about how much we can describe the world,

197
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
but that there's this like, because we understand fundamental physics so well,

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate,

199
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
and I just think that we don't.

200
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,840
And the quest there is really to understand something totally new about the universe,

201
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
and that thing just happens to be us.

202
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,160
I agree.

203
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,560
I agree.

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,840
There's something else more profound.

205
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,120
I think Neil was just being, again, he's just trying to stir the pot.

206
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,280
I would say from a contingency point of view,

207
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,360
I want to know how many ways does the universe build structures, build memories, right?

208
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,000
And then I want to know if those memories can interact with each other.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,640
And if you have two different origins of life and then origins of intelligence,

210
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
and then these things become conscious,

211
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,760
surely you want to go and talk to them and figure out what commonalities you share.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,800
And it might be that we're just unable to conceive of what they're going to look like.

213
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,760
They're just going to be completely different, you know, infrastructure.

214
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,320
But surely we'll want to go and find out a map.

215
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,960
And surely curiosity is a property that evolution has made on Earth,

216
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,520
and I can't see any reason that won't happen elsewhere because curiosity

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,600
probably exists because we want to find innovations in the environment.

218
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,840
We want to use that information to help our technology.

219
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,720
And also curiosity is like planning for the future.

220
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
Are they going to fight us?

221
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,560
Are they, are we going to be able to trade with them?

222
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,280
So I think that Neil's just, I don't know, maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.

223
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,840
That's really, I think that's really down on Earth, right?

224
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?

225
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
How would we, so let's put it the other way around.

226
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,120
Slime category.

227
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,200
Maybe, no, no, no, we, maybe we could, they think it's a bit odd, right?

228
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
Look at Instagram, Twitter, all these people taking selfies.

229
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
I mean, does the universe is the ultimate state of consciousness,

230
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
thinking beings that take photographs themselves and upload them to an

231
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,960
internet with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos?

232
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,440
So I think that they will be.

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
What's wrong with that?

234
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,520
Yeah, I did not say there was anything wrong with it.

235
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,400
It's consciousness manifested at scale.

236
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,800
Yeah.

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,600
Selfies.

238
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, it's like the mirror test at scale.

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah, I do think that curiosity is really the driving force of why we have our technology,

240
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,920
right?

241
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out left the cave.

242
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,320
So I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact.

243
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,400
Actually, of course, they'd want to come here.

244
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,840
It doesn't mean they are coming here.

245
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,360
We've seen evidence for that.

246
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I guess we can argue about that, right?

247
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,160
But I think that we want, I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too,

248
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,520
but I won't speak for you when you're here.

249
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,480
You can, I desperately want to have missions to look for life in the solar system right now.

250
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
I want to map life over the solar system.

251
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
And then I want to understand how we can go and find life as quickly as possible

252
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,480
at the nearest stars and also at the same time do it in the lab just to compensate,

253
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,520
you know?

254
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,960
So, sure.

255
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
Yeah, I just want to point on this.

256
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,240
If you think about sort of what's driven the most like features of our own evolution

257
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,960
as a species and try to map that to alien species,

258
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,920
I always think like optimism is what's going to get us furthest.

259
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,760
And so I think a lot of people always think that it's like war and conflict

260
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,000
is going to be the way that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
But if you just look at how we're doing it and how we talk about it,

262
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,240
it's always our future in space is always built from narratives of optimism.

263
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,560
And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out in the universe,

264
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,160
that it's going to be more optimism and curiosity driving it than war and conflict

265
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,080
because those things end up crushing you.

266
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,960
So there might be some selective filter.

267
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
Of course, this is me being an optimist.

268
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,840
I'm a half full kind of person, but...

269
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,360
Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious,

270
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,960
but what do you think is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe than

271
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,400
violence and the will to power?

272
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,920
So, because you said you frame curiosity as a way to also plan on how to avoid violence,

273
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
which is an interesting frame of curiosity.

274
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,120
But I could also argue that violence is a pretty productive way

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,040
to operate in the world, which is like...

276
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,480
That's one way to protect yourself.

277
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,840
The best defense is offense.

278
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.

279
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,040
I think violence...

280
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,480
That's not what violence...

281
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
That's the summary of this podcast.

282
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
Yeah, but maybe I would...

283
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,680
Let's not call it violence, but I call it erasure.

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,400
So if you think about the way evolution works all the way...

285
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,240
Obviously call it assembly theory, but I won't...

286
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
So if you say curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?

287
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:36,080
So new features you can play, what the ability to erase those things allows you to start again,

288
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,360
and do some pruning.

289
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.

290
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
Curiosity gets you rockets at land.

291
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,760
It gets you robots that can make drugs.

292
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,480
It gets you poetry and art and communication.

293
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,280
And then I often think, wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy to have another world war,

294
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,720
not literally a world war now.

295
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
Please, no world war, but the equivalent.

296
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,640
So we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, all the admin violence,

297
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,920
get rid of it and start again.

298
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,640
Do you know what I mean?

299
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,160
Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.

300
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,200
So actually a reset, let's not call it violence,

301
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:16,400
a reset in some aspects of our culture and our technology allows us to then

302
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,680
build more important things without the...

303
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,160
Because how many cookies do I have to click on?

304
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,520
How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life that I could remove

305
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,040
and that a bit of a reset would allow us to start again?

306
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,040
And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter with aliens will be.

307
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,240
Maybe they will fight with us and say,

308
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,040
we're not as excited by you as we thought.

309
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,840
We'll just get rid of you.

310
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Or they might want to reset Earth.

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Yeah, why not?

312
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,280
To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.

313
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,600
This seems like there's nothing new happening here.

314
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,880
They're observing for a while.

315
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,920
This is just not...

316
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,760
Let's keep it more fun.

317
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,960
Let's start with a fish again.

318
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,520
I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.

319
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,680
I suppose that's the kind of violence.

320
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,000
And this is this modern world where words are violence, resetting cookies.

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
I don't know where that came from.

322
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,760
I'm completely...

323
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,080
Yeah.

324
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,680
That's poetic, really.

325
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Okay, so let's talk about life.

326
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,640
What is life?

327
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,880
What is non-life?

328
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
What is the line between life and non-life?

329
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,960
And maybe at any point we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.

330
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,920
Like how do we start to try to define life?

331
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,000
And for people listening,

332
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,280
so Sarah identifies as a physicist

333
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,760
and Lee identifies as a chemist.

334
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,160
Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature in general.

335
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,520
But, so what is life?

336
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,040
Yeah.

337
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
I love asking that question because it's so absurdly big.

338
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,800
I know, I love it.

339
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.

340
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,200
So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.

341
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,600
And I like to say all three of them

342
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,840
because people latch on to different facets of them.

343
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,960
And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on

344
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,240
is not to try to define life,

345
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,000
but to try to find a more fundamental theory

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,320
that explains what the phenomena we call life.

347
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,000
And then it should explain certain attributes.

348
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,840
And you end up having a really different framing

349
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,200
than the way people usually talk.

350
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,360
So the way I talk about it, three different ways.

351
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,840
Life is how information structures matter across space and time.

352
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,360
Life is, I don't know, this one's from you.

353
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,000
Actually, simple machines constructing more complex machines.

354
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
And the other one is the physics of existence, so to speak,

355
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
which is life is the mechanism the universe has

356
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
to explore the space of what's possible.

357
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,200
That's my favorite.

358
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,640
So can I add on to that?

359
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,160
Okay, can you say the physics one again?

360
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
Physics of existence.

361
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,160
Yeah, the physics of existence.

362
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
I don't know what to call it.

363
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,600
You know, if you think of all the things that could exist,

364
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,120
only certain things do exist.

365
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,200
And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism

366
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,160
of bringing things into physically existing in the moment now.

367
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,400
And what's another one?

368
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,680
We were debating this the other day.

369
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,360
So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it,

370
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?

371
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,240
Because this is where physicists really go wrong.

372
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,920
They think of a universe with nothing in it.

373
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,400
They can't.

374
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,800
The non-existence is really hard to think of.

375
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,520
Non-existent, yeah.

376
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
And then you think of a universe with everything in it.

377
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,920
That's really hard.

378
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,160
And you just have this white blob, right?

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,440
This is everything.

380
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,560
But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe beyond,

381
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,200
say, planets.

382
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,480
So you've got star, space, planet stuff, right?

383
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
The boring stuff.

384
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,040
Well, I would define life or say that life is where

385
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120
there are architectures, any architectures,

386
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,960
and we should stop fixating on what is building

387
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,160
the architectures to start with.

388
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,200
And the fact that the universe has discrete things

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
and it is completely mind-blowing.

390
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
If you think about it for one second,

391
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880
the fact there's any objects at all,

392
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,680
and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy

393
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,480
for a machine that built it.

394
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
Some information being moved around,

395
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,840
actuation, sensing, getting resource,

396
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,080
and building these objects.

397
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,480
So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine.

398
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
But I'm like, forget the machine.

399
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
Let's see the objects.

400
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
And I think in a way that assembly theory,

401
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,360
we realized maybe a few months ago that assembly theory

402
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
actually does account for the soul in the objects,

403
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
not mystically like, say,

404
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,520
Sheldrecht's morphic resonance or Leibniz's monodology

405
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,800
seeing souls in things.

406
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,600
But when you see an object, and I've said this before,

407
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,160
but this object is evidence of thought,

408
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
and then there's a lineage of those objects.

409
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,280
So I think what is fascinating is that you put it much more

410
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
elegantly, but the barrier between life and non-life

411
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
is accruing enough memories to then actuate.

412
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
What that means is there are contingency,

413
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
there are things that happen in the universe get trapped.

414
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,440
These memories then have a causal effect on the future.

415
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
And then when you get those concentrated in a machine,

416
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,040
and you're actually able in real time, able to integrate

417
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,760
the past, the present, with the future, and do stuff,

418
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,280
that's when you are most alive.

419
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
You being the machine.

420
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,400
Yes.

421
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Wait a minute.

422
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,560
Why is the object, so one of the ways to define life,

423
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,280
that Sarah said, is simple machines creating complex machines.

424
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,280
So there's a million questions there.

425
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,560
So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?

426
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,840
By mutation.

427
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,160
So this is what we were talking about at the beginning,

428
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,080
is you have a minimum replicator, so a molecule.

429
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,600
So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah

430
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
of the mechanism get there years ago, I think,

431
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,280
but then you've been building on it and saying,

432
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,880
you have a molecule that can copy itself,

433
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,240
but then there has to be some variability,

434
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
otherwise it's not going to get more functional.

435
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,080
So you need to add bits on.

436
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,560
So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,

437
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,120
but then it can add bits on, and that can be copied as well,

438
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,680
and those add-ons can give you additional function

439
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,040
to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.

440
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,240
So existence is weird, but the fact that there is existence

441
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,120
is why there is life.

442
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,400
And that's why I realized a few days ago that there must be,

443
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,480
that's why alien life must be everywhere,

444
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,720
because there is existence.

445
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,680
Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?

446
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,880
So how can you keep injecting more complex things?

447
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,760
Doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be

448
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,280
as or more powerful than the things it creates?

449
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,800
So how can you get complexity from simplicity?

450
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,880
So the way you get complexity from simplicity

451
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
is that you, I'm just making this up,

452
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,840
but this is kind of my notion that you have a large volume of stuff.

453
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,600
So you're able to get seeds if you like random cues from the environment.

454
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,760
So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape,

455
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,960
ones and zeros, whatever.

456
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,680
And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?

457
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
But it has a low assembliness,

458
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
but even though it has a high assembly number,

459
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,480
we can talk about that.

460
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,640
But then when you start to then integrate that all

461
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,120
into a smaller volume as over time,

462
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,320
and you become more autonomous, you then make the transition.

463
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,720
I don't know what you think about that.

464
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,800
I think the easiest way to think about it is actually,

465
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
which I know is a concept you hate,

466
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,520
but I also hate it, which is entropy,

467
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
but people are more familiar with entropy

468
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
than what we talk about in assembly theory.

469
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,360
And also the idea that, like say physics as we know it,

470
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
involves objects that don't exist across time,

471
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,560
or as we would say low memory objects.

472
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,400
So one of the key distinctions that is-

473
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,680
Low memory objects.

474
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,160
Yeah.

475
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,040
So physics is all-

476
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,440
Well, physicists are low memory objects.

477
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,000
Quick clip.

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But physicists are creators of low memory objects

479
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
or manipulators of low memory objects.

480
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,640
Absolutely.

481
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,600
That's a very nice way.

482
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,840
Okay, sorry, I got it.

483
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,480
Yeah, I know, sorry.

484
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,360
Sorry to interrupt you.

485
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,720
No, no, no, it's fine.

486
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,360
I like it too.

487
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,000
It's very funny.

488
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,320
But I think it's a good way of phrasing it,

489
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
because I think this kind of idea

490
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,360
we have in assembly theory is that,

491
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
you know, physics as we know it

492
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
has basically removed time as being

493
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
a physical observable of an object.

494
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,520
And the argument I would make is that

495
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
when you look at things like water bottles or us,

496
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,240
we're actually things that exist

497
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,880
that have a large extent in time.

498
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,400
So we actually have a physical size in time,

499
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,320
and we measure that with something

500
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,440
called the assembly index in molecules,

501
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
but presumably everyone should have

502
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,880
sort of a, do you want to explain what assembly?

503
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,320
Yeah, let's, you know what?

504
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,520
Let's step back and start at the beginning.

505
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,960
What is assembly theory?

506
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,080
Please send me some slides.

507
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,880
There's a big sexy paper coming out,

508
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,360
probably, maybe, I don't know.

509
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,320
We've not finished it.

510
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,440
Almost, almost finished it.

511
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,520
That's also a summary of science.

512
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,720
We're almost done.

513
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,040
Yes.

514
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,320
Well, no, no, we're almost done.

515
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,880
I think we're, we are ready to start

516
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
an interesting discussion with our peers.

517
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,160
You're at the machine that created the object,

518
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,080
and we'll see what the object takes us.

519
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
All right, so what is assembly theory?

520
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,720
Yeah, well, I think the easiest way

521
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,600
for people to understand it

522
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,960
is to think about assembly in molecules,

523
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
although the theory is very general.

524
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
It doesn't just apply to molecules.

525
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
And this was really leased in sight,

526
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it, but.

527
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,280
I'll mark you.

528
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay, all right.

529
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,120
I'm ready, I'm ready.

530
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,520
I'm ready.

531
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,600
You can tell me where I get the check mark minus, but.

532
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,480
It's your theory as well.

533
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,360
Yeah, I know.

534
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,200
But imagine a molecule, and then you can, you know,

535
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,680
break the molecule apart into elementary building blocks.

536
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,960
They happen to be bonds.

537
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
And then you can think of all the ways

538
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
for molecular assembly theory.

539
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,720
You can think of all the ways

540
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,240
of building up the original molecules.

541
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,880
So there's all these paths that you can assemble it,

542
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
and the sort of rules or assemblies

543
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
you can use pieces that have been generated already.

544
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,360
So it has this kind of recursive property to it.

545
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
And so that's where kind of memory

546
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,040
comes into assembly theory.

547
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,640
And then the assembly index is the shortest path

548
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,280
in that space.

549
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,680
So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history

550
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,200
that the universe has to undergo

551
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
in order to assemble that particular object.

552
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
And the reason that this is significant

553
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
is we figured out how to measure that

554
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,200
with a mass spec in the lab.

555
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,800
And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps

556
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,120
was sufficiently large, it would indicate

557
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,600
that you required a machine or a system that had information

558
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,280
about how to assemble that specific object

559
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,040
because the combinatorial space of possibilities

560
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,200
is getting exponentially large

561
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
as the assembly index is increasing.

562
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,520
So just sorry to interrupt, but so that means

563
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,480
there's a sufficiently high assembly index

564
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,480
that if observed in an object is an indicator

565
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,240
that something lifelike created it,

566
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
or is the object itself lifelike?

567
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,680
Both.

568
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,920
But you might want to make the distinction

569
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,840
that a water bottle is not life,

570
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,560
but it would still be a signature

571
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,920
that you were in that domain of physics.

572
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,600
And I might be alive.

573
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
So there will be potentially a lot of arguments

574
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,280
about where the line at which assembly index

575
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
does interesting stuff start to happen.

576
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,480
The point is we can make all the arguments,

577
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,160
but it should be experimentally observable.

578
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,080
And Lee can talk more about that part of it.

579
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,920
But the point I want to make about it

580
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,040
is there was always this intuition that I had

581
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,200
that there should be some complexity threshold

582
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,920
in the universe above which you would start to say

583
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,880
whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.

584
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,920
And I think about it a little bit,

585
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,280
like we have Planck's constant,

586
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,320
and we have the fine structure constant.

587
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,560
And then this sort of assembly threshold

588
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,760
is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature.

589
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
It might depend on specific features of the system,

590
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,480
which we debate about sometimes.

591
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,680
But then when you're past that,

592
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,920
you have to have some other explanation

593
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,520
than the current explanations we have in physics

594
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,720
because now you're in high memory.

595
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,320
The things actually require time for them to exist,

596
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,840
and time becomes a physical variable.

597
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,600
So the path to the creation of the object is the memory.

598
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
So you need to consider that.

599
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,800
Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.

600
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,120
So when I think of all the things in this room,

601
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,360
we see the projection of them as a water bottle,

602
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph

603
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,680
of all the ways the universe can create this thing.

604
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,280
That's what it is as an object.

605
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,520
And we're all interacting a causal graph.

606
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,360
And most of the creativity in the biosphere

607
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,920
is because a lot of the objects that exist now

608
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,480
are huge in their structure across time,

609
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
four billion years of evolution to get to us.

610
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,600
Is it possible to look at me and infer the history

611
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
that led to me as a human?

612
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,880
You as an individual might be hard.

613
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,400
You as a representative of a population

614
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,080
of objects that have high assembly

615
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,160
with similar causal history and structure

616
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,560
that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,

617
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,680
you can infer a lot probably.

618
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,880
Yeah, also with them.

619
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
Which we do genomically even.

620
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,880
I mean, it's not like we have a lot of information in us.

621
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,360
We can reconstruct histories from assembly

622
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,480
saying something slightly deeper.

623
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,440
Yeah, one thing to add.

624
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,800
I mean, it's not just about the object,

625
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
but the objects that occur.

626
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,160
And not just objects with a high assembly number,

627
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,000
because you can have random things

628
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
that have a high assembly number,

629
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,320
they must be a number of identical copies.

630
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,720
So you know you're getting away from the random,

631
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
because you could take a snapshot.

632
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,760
This is why I hate entropy.

633
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,240
I love entropy when used correctly.

634
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,160
But it's about the problem of entropy.

635
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,680
You have to have a labeler.

636
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,560
And so you can label the beginning and the end

637
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,520
to start on the finish.

638
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
You know, what you can do in assembly is say,

639
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,400
oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.

640
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,160
They all have these features.

641
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,200
And then you can infer.

642
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,760
And one of the things that we debated a lot,

643
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,880
particularly during lockdown,

644
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,800
because I almost went insane trying to crush

645
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
the produce the assembly equations.

646
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,400
So we came up with the assembly equation.

647
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,920
I had, just imagine this.

648
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,960
So you have this string where, oh,

649
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,920
actually it makes me sick trying to remember it.

650
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,480
It was so, it did my head in for a long time.

651
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,280
It's dramatic.

652
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,880
Yeah, because I couldn't,

653
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
so if you just have a string of say words,

654
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,960
say, you know, series of words, series of letters.

655
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,840
So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.

656
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,480
And you find that object and you just have four A's,

657
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,560
four B's, four C's, four D's together.

658
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,360
Boom.

659
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Then, and that you measured that.

660
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So you physically measured that string of letters.

661
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,080
Then what you could do is you can infer

662
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,560
subgraphs of maybe the four A's, the four B's,

663
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,600
the four C's and the four C's,

664
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,920
but you don't see them in the real world.

665
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,280
You just infer them.

666
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,760
And I really got stuck with that

667
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,600
because there's a problem to try and work out

668
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,960
what's the difference between a long,

669
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,280
you know, physical object and the assembly space of the objects

670
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,200
so that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.

671
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,080
So although we can't infer your entire history,

672
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,320
we know at some point the four A's were made,

673
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
the four B's were made, the four C's were made,

674
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
and four D's were made, and they all got added together.

675
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
And that's one really interesting thing

676
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,960
that's come out of the theory.

677
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,600
But the killer, when we knew we were going beyond

678
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
beyond standard complexity theories,

679
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,840
it was incredibly successful is that we realized

680
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,800
we could start to measure these things for real across domains.

681
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,560
So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property

682
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,320
of all stuff that you can break into components,

683
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
particularly molecules are good

684
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,600
because you can break them up into smaller molecules,

685
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,400
into atoms.

686
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,760
The challenge will be making that more general

687
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,560
across all the domains,

688
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,680
but we're working on it right now

689
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,880
and I think the theory will do that.

690
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,280
So components, domains, so you're talking about basically

691
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,520
measuring the complexity of an object

692
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,120
in what, biology, chemistry, physics,

693
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,400
that's what you mean by domains.

694
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,720
Complexity of tests,

695
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,160
sociology, computers, complexity of memes, you know.

696
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,960
Memes, yep.

697
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
What is that, ideas?

698
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,120
Yeah, I mean, so one of them.

699
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,960
Ideas are objects in the assembly theory though.

700
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,920
Yeah, they are.

701
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,880
They're physical things,

702
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,320
they're just features of the causal graph.

703
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,080
I mean, the fact I can talk to you right now

704
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,560
is because we're exchanging structure of our assembly space.

705
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:33,200
So conversation is the exchanging structures in assembly space.

706
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
What is assembly space?

707
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,720
When I started working on Origins of Life,

708
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,600
I was writing about something called top-down causation,

709
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,160
which a lot of philosophers are interested in

710
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,000
and people that worry about the mind-body problem.

711
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,280
But the whole idea is, if we have the microscopic world of physics

712
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
is causally complete,

713
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,360
it seems like there's no room for higher-level causes.

714
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,480
Our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.

715
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,440
And that seems problematic when you get to studying life and mind

716
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,400
because it does seem that quote-unquote emergent properties

717
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,360
do matter to matter.

718
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
And then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation

719
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,040
where information looks like it's disembodied.

720
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,320
So we talk about information,

721
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
like it can just move from any physical system

722
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,680
to any other physical system.

723
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,960
And it doesn't require,

724
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,720
like you don't have to specify anything about the substrate

725
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
to talk about information.

726
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,440
And then there's also the way we talk about mathematics

727
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
is also disembodied, like the platonic world of forms.

728
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,040
And I think all of those things are hinging

729
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,200
that we really don't know how to think about abstractions

730
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,240
as physical things.

731
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,000
And really, I think what Assembly Theory is pointing to

732
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,320
is what we're missing there is the dimension of time.

733
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,640
And if you actually look at an object being extended across time,

734
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,320
what we call information and the things that look abstract

735
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,440
are things that are entangled in the histories of those objects.

736
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,000
They're features of the overlapping assembly space.

737
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,360
So they look abstract because they're not part of the current structure,

738
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,520
but they're part of the structure if you thought about it

739
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,920
as like the philosophical concept of a hyper object,

740
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,120
an object that's too big in time for us to actually resolve.

741
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,920
And so I think information is physical.

742
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,760
It's just physical in time, not in space.

743
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,320
Too hyper object, too difficult for us to resolve.

744
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,440
So we're supposed to think about of life

745
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,240
as this thing that stretches through time

746
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,960
and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.

747
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,480
And then you're trying to measure something

748
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,880
with the assembly index about properties of that.

749
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,480
The assembly index is the ordering,

750
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,840
you could think of it as like a partial ordering

751
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,120
of all the things that can happen.

752
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,880
So in thermodynamics, we coarse-grain things

753
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
by temperature and pressure.

754
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,560
In assembly theory, we coarse-grain

755
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,280
by the number of copies of an object and the assembly index,

756
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,240
which is basically, if you think of the space of all possible things,

757
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,400
it's like a depth of how far you've gone into that space

758
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,480
and how much time was required to get there.

759
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
In the shortest possible version.

760
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,960
The shortest possible version.

761
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,520
Not average, because can't you just 3D print?

762
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,200
You're going to kill me with that question.

763
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,440
Oh, not 3D, can't you always 3D print the thing?

764
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,960
That's like cabin in the heart.

765
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,640
No, because I had such fights.

766
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,520
So Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper at the moment.

767
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,120
And I think we kind of share the, at the beginning,

768
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,080
you were like, no, that's not right.

769
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,800
Oh, yes, right.

770
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,160
And we're doing this for a bit.

771
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,760
And then the problem is when you build a theory

772
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,600
and build the intuition, there's some certain features, right?

773
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,200
Of the theory that almost felt like I was being religious about,

774
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,960
say, right, you have to do this.

775
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,320
A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.

776
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,320
And Sarah's postdoc Daniel and my postdoc, Abhishek,

777
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,760
and they were both brilliant.

778
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,560
They're brilliant.

779
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,360
But they were like, no, we don't, we don't buy that.

780
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,440
And I was like, it is, they were like, well, Lee, actually,

781
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,560
I thought you're the first to say that, you know, you can't,

782
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
if you can't explain it, it doesn't,

783
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,160
and you can't do an experiment that doesn't exist.

784
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,800
And that saved me.

785
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
And I said to Abhishek, Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow,

786
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,080
Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU.

787
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,880
I was like, I have the experimental data.

788
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,960
So when I basically take the molecules

789
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
and chop them up in the mass spec,

790
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,400
the assembly number is never the average.

791
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,680
It's always the shortest.

792
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,800
It's an intrinsic property.

793
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,960
And then the penny drop for Abhishek said, okay,

794
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,640
because I had these things that we had to believe to start with

795
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,200
or to trust.

796
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,640
And then we've done the math and it comes out

797
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,560
and they now have the shortest path.

798
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,120
Actually, it's up that explains why the shortest path.

799
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,440
Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.

800
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
The shortest path needs you to identify

801
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
when the universe is basically got a memory, not an average.

802
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,520
So what you want to be able to do is to say,

803
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,680
what is the minimum number of features

804
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
that I want to be able to see in the universe?

805
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,240
When I find those features, I know the universe

806
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,560
has had a coherent memory and is basically alive.

807
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,880
And so that gives you the lower bound.

808
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
So that's like, of course, there's going to be other paths.

809
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
We can be more ridiculous, right?

810
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,360
We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.

811
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,000
So probabilistically, at the beginning,

812
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,560
because assembly theory was built as a measure

813
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,120
for biosignatures, I needed to go there.

814
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,600
And then I realized it was intrinsic.

815
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic

816
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,800
and these hyperobjects were coming.

817
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
And we were kind of fusing that notions together.

818
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,760
And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy

819
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
and I have enough resources, I might not take the shortest path.

820
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,920
I might go a bit longer.

821
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,840
I might take a really long path

822
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,040
because it allows me then to do something else.

823
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,440
So what you do is, let's say I've got two different objects,

824
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,240
A and B, and they both have different shortest paths to get them.

825
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,040
But then if you want to make A and B together,

826
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,720
they will have a compromise.

827
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,480
So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,

828
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,160
but actually it's the shortest way you can make both A and B

829
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
with a minimum amount of resource in time.

830
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,720
So suddenly you then layer these things up.

831
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
And so the average becomes not important,

832
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,600
but as you literally overlap those sets,

833
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,280
you get a new shortest path.

834
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,120
And so what we realized time and time again

835
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,080
when we're doing the math, the shortest path is intrinsic,

836
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:14,160
is fundamental, and is measurable, which is kind of mind-blowing.

837
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,280
So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients,

838
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,960
maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients could be

839
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,760
and how many steps, when you say shortest path,

840
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,320
how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients

841
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,800
into the final meal.

842
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,720
So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?

843
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,120
For a pie, an apple pie.

844
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,480
An apple pie, that's right.

845
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,240
And the pizza and a pie together.

846
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,040
For a scratch.

847
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,680
Yeah.

848
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,960
So there's a lot of ways.

849
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,880
There's the shortest way, and you take the full spectrum of ways,

850
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,200
and there's probably an average duration for a noob to make an apple pie.

851
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
Is the average interesting still?

852
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,960
If you measure the average length of the path to assemble a thing,

853
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,960
does that tell you something about the way nature usually does it?

854
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,840
Versus something fundamental about the object,

855
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,400
which I think is what you're aiming at with the assembly index.

856
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,360
Yeah. I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.

857
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,040
The minimum path gives you the lower bounds,

858
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,240
so you know you're detecting something,

859
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,000
you know you're inferring something.

860
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,080
The average tells you about really how the objects are existing

861
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,160
in the ecosystem or the technology.

862
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,800
And there has to be more paths explored,

863
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,920
because then you can happen upon other memories,

864
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,360
and then condense them down.

865
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
I'm not making too much sense,

866
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,640
but if you look at, say, let's just say,

867
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
I mean, maybe we're going to get to alien civilizations later, right?

868
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,040
But I would argue very strongly that alien civilization A

869
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,520
and alien civilization B, they're different assembly spaces.

870
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,040
So they're kind of going to be a bit messed up

871
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,960
if they happen to come one another.

872
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,160
Only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,

873
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
because if aliens come to us and we,

874
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,560
they don't share any of the causal graph we've shared,

875
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,400
but hopefully they share the periodic table

876
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,280
and some other and bonds and things,

877
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
so we're going to have to really think about the language

878
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,720
to talk to us aliens by inferring,

879
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,600
by using assembly theory to infer their language,

880
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,120
their technology, and other bits and bobs.

881
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,000
And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.

882
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,440
All right, so all aliens in the causality graphs

883
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,160
have a common ancestor in the-

884
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,840
If the building blocks are the same,

885
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,600
which means they live in the same universe as us.

886
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,240
So in this-

887
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
It depends on how far back in time you go, though.

888
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,000
But the universe has all the same building blocks.

889
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,640
Yeah.

890
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,320
And we have to assume that.

891
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,960
So there's not different classes of causality graphs, right?

892
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,440
No.

893
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,640
The universe doesn't just say,

894
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,360
here, you get the red causality graph and you get the blue one.

895
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,640
These basic ingredients and they're geographically constrained

896
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,440
or constrained in space or time or something like that.

897
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
They're constrained in time because only by the virtue of the fact that

898
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,480
you need enough time to have passed for some things to exist.

899
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,040
So the universe has to be big enough in time for some things.

900
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,680
So just a one point on the shortest path versus the average path,

901
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,800
which I think we'll get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it.

902
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,120
It's like the minimal compression is the shortest path

903
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,480
for the universe to produce that.

904
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,840
But it's also like the first time in the ordering of events

905
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,520
that you might expect to see that object.

906
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,000
But the average path tells you something about the actual steps

907
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,880
that were realized and that becomes an emergent property

908
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,600
of that object's interaction with other objects.

909
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,440
So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object.

910
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,680
It's a feature of the interactions with other things.

911
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,840
And so one of the nice features of assembly

912
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,200
is you basically gotten rid of-

913
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,640
you just look at the things that exist

914
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,600
and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms for constructing them

915
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,280
in some sense, like the machines or not,

916
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,560
as important in the current construction of the theory,

917
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,240
although I would like to bridge it to some ideas about constructors.

918
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,400
But then you could only communicate with things as Lee was saying

919
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,960
if you have some overlap in the past history.

920
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,640
So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap,

921
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,320
then there would be no means of communication.

922
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,200
But as we progress further and further in time

923
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,720
and more things become possible

924
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,360
because the assembly spaces are larger-

925
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,640
because you can have a larger assembly space in terms of index

926
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,080
and also just the size of the space

927
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,280
because it's exponentially growing,

928
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
then more things can happen in the future.

929
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,920
And the example I like to give is actually

930
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,960
when we made first contact with gravitational waves

931
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,120
because that's an alien phenomena that's been permeating our plate,

932
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,640
not alien in life phenomena,

933
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,840
but alien like something we had never knew existed.

934
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,760
It's been, you know, like we're, you know,

935
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
there's gravitational waves rippling through this room right now.

936
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,800
But we had to advance to the level of Einstein writing down

937
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,760
his theory of relativity and then 100 years of technological development

938
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
to even quote-unquote see that phenomena.

939
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,440
So the, okay, to see that phenomena,

940
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,920
our causal graph have to start intersecting.

941
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,840
Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first,

942
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,880
the abstraction, right?

943
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,480
And then we had to build the technology

944
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,600
that could actually observe features of that abstraction.

945
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,760
So the nice promising thing is

946
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,440
over time the graph can grow,

947
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
so we can start overlapping eventually.

948
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,760
Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph is

949
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,800
there was an event, you know,

950
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,760
1.4 billion years away of a black hole merger

951
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
that we detected on our detector.

952
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,440
And, you know, now suddenly we're connected

953
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,880
through this communication channel

954
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
with this distant event in our universe

955
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,920
that, you know, if you think about 1.4 billion years ago

956
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,200
what was happening on this planet

957
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,720
or even further back in time,

958
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
that, you know, there is common physics

959
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,960
underlying all those events,

960
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,880
but even for those two events to communicate with them.

961
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,720
Oh, I understand what you were going on about the other week.

962
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,280
Yeah, I'm sorry, this is a really abstract example, but,

963
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,040
but it's sort of-

964
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,560
Your causal graphs are not overlapping.

965
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,800
Yeah, so, well, let's just say

966
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,520
now our causal graphs are overlapping in the deep past.

967
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,680
No, I like it, so you made it-

968
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,320
I totally missed it.

969
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,280
Oh, all of the 1.6 billion.

970
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,680
Yeah.

971
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,640
You made a connection with it.

972
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,440
No, I do like that.

973
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
You know, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.

974
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,320
This is good.

975
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,120
Because I was-

976
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,920
And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.

977
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,680
Oh, I get it now.

978
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:25,760
No, it's all right.

979
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,200
The joke came two minutes ago.

980
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,560
Our flow on the uptake here.

981
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,560
I wasn't able to comprehend what you were talking about

982
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,720
when saying the channel communicating to the past,

983
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,600
but what you're saying is

984
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,200
we were able to infer what happened 1.4 billion years ago.

985
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,600
We detected the gravity wave.

986
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,120
I mean, I think it's amazing that, you know,

987
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,480
at that time we weren't even-

988
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,240
We were just becoming multicellular, right?

989
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,320
It's like insane.

990
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,760
And then we progressed the multicellularity

991
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,280
through to technology and built the detector,

992
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,000
and then we just extrapolate backwards.

993
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,080
So although we didn't do anything back to the graph back in time,

994
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,400
we understood there's existence then overlapped going forward.

995
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,800
And that-

996
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,560
Well, that's because our graphs are larger.

997
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,040
Yeah, but that means that has a consequence.

998
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,880
One of the things I was trying to say is I think

999
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,800
I don't know, Sarah might be, she can correct me, information first.

1000
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,520
And I'm an object first kind of guy.

1001
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,680
So I mean, as things that get constructed,

1002
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,200
there has to be this transition in random constructions.

1003
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
So when the construct,

1004
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,920
the object that's being constructed by the process

1005
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,840
bakes in that memory,

1006
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,640
and those memories then add on and add on and add on.

1007
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,520
So as it becomes more competent,

1008
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,920
and life is about taking those memories

1009
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
and compressing them, increasing their autonomy.

1010
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,040
And so I think that like the cell that we have in biology on Earth

1011
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,080
is our way of doing that,

1012
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,400
that really the maximum ability to take memories and to act on the future.

1013
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,160
Oh, I think that's mathematics.

1014
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,320
No, mathematics doesn't exist.

1015
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,360
No, but that's the point.

1016
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,760
The point is that abstractions do exist.

1017
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,040
They're real physical things.

1018
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,600
We call them abstractions.

1019
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,640
But the point about mathematics that I think is-

1020
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,640
So I don't disagree.

1021
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,640
I think you're object first and I'm information first,

1022
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,120
but I think I'm only information first

1023
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,360
in the sense that I think the thing that we need to explain

1024
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
is what abstractions are and what they are as physical things.

1025
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,680
Because of all of human history,

1026
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,920
we've thought that there were these properties that are disembodied,

1027
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,520
exist outside of the universe.

1028
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,400
And really, they do exist in the universe,

1029
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,800
and we just don't understand what their physics is.

1030
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,720
So I think mathematics is a really good example.

1031
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,280
We do theoretical physics with math,

1032
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,920
but imagine doing physics of math,

1033
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,720
and then thinking about math as a physical object.

1034
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,240
And math is super interesting.

1035
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,640
I think this is why we think it describes reality so well,

1036
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,800
because it's the most copyable kind of information.

1037
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,080
It retains its properties when you move it between physical media,

1038
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,160
which means that it's very deep.

1039
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,040
And so it seems to describe the universe really well,

1040
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,920
but it probably is because it's information that's very deep in our past.

1041
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,400
And it's just we invented a way of communicating it

1042
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,760
very effectively between us.

1043
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,120
Isn't math more fundamental?

1044
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,280
Isn't the assembly of the graph,

1045
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,200
isn't basically, I'm going to say,

1046
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,160
I sound completely boring.

1047
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,280
It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.

1048
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:20,720
It has to be.

1049
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:20,960
Okay.

1050
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,880
So what is math exactly?

1051
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,360
It's a nice simplification,

1052
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,000
a simple description of what?

1053
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,480
So we have a computer scientist, a physicist, and a chemist here.

1054
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,000
Walking to a bar.

1055
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,680
I think the chemist is going to define math,

1056
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,880
and you guys can correct me.

1057
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,080
Go for it.

1058
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,160
Let's lay in honestly.

1059
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,000
We're ready.

1060
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,280
I think the ability to label objects and place them into classes

1061
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,680
and then do operations on the objects is what math is.

1062
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,240
So on that point, what does it mean to be object first versus information first?

1063
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,520
So what's the difference between object and information

1064
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,920
when you get to that low fundamental level?

1065
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Well, I might change my view.

1066
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,600
So I'm stuff first, the stuff.

1067
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,560
And then when stuff becomes objects, it has to invent information.

1068
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,720
And then the information acts on more stuff and becomes more objects.

1069
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,960
So I think there is a transition to information.

1070
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,440
That occurs when you go from stuff to object.

1071
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,560
Just mean time though.

1072
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:30,960
Yeah.

1073
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,440
Information is emergent.

1074
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,400
Not emergent.

1075
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,520
Information is actionable memories from the universe.

1076
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,760
So when memories become actionable, that's information.

1077
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,600
But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.

1078
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:48,480
Yeah.

1079
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,680
And then it's not information.

1080
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:49,920
Great.

1081
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,240
And actionable is what you can create.

1082
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,960
You can use it.

1083
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,680
If you can't use it, then it's not information.

1084
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,280
If you can't transmit it, if it doesn't have any causal consequence.

1085
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,400
It falls in the forest.

1086
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,600
I don't understand.

1087
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,880
Why is that not information?

1088
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,320
It's not information.

1089
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,200
It's stuff.

1090
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,160
It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.

1091
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,600
Yeah, yeah, we can.

1092
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,000
This is cool.

1093
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,800
It's happening.

1094
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,200
No, no.

1095
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,120
The happening requires information.

1096
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,800
No, no, no, no.

1097
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,240
Stuff is always happening.

1098
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,720
No.

1099
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,680
This is where the physicists and the mathematicians get themselves in a loop

1100
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,600
because I think the universe, I mean,

1101
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,200
I think, say, Max Teckmark and is very playful and say like the universe,

1102
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,080
universe is just math.

1103
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,280
Well, the universe is just math.

1104
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,000
Then we might as well not bother having any conversation

1105
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,040
because the conversation will be written.

1106
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,160
We just might as well go to the future and say,

1107
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,520
can you just give us the conversations?

1108
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,640
It's happened already.

1109
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,520
So I think the problem is that mathematicians are so successful at labeling stuff

1110
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,240
and so successful understanding of stuff through those labels.

1111
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,440
They forget that actually those labels had to emerge

1112
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,880
and that information had to be built on those memories.

1113
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,560
So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph,

1114
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,600
when they become actionable and the graph can loop back on itself

1115
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,160
or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,

1116
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,840
those memories become actionable and therefore their information.

1117
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,760
And I think you just changed my mind on something pretty big,

1118
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,520
but I don't have a pen so I can't write.

1119
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,400
I'm going to write it down later.

1120
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,000
But roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs of objects of stuff.

1121
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,520
They have memories and then when they intersect

1122
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,400
and then they can act on each other,

1123
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,880
that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then,

1124
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,200
so then you can then abstract.

1125
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,240
So when one graph can then build another graph and say,

1126
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,720
hey, you don't have to go through the nonsense we had to go through.

1127
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,080
Here's literally the way to do it.

1128
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,680
Stuff always comes first,

1129
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,360
but then when stuff builds the abstraction,

1130
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,600
the abstraction can be then teleported onto other stuff.

1131
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,840
And the abstraction is the looping back power.

1132
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,600
Okay.

1133
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,680
Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck.

1134
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,880
Yeah, so first a God made stuff.

1135
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,320
And after that, when you start to be able to form abstractions,

1136
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:56,880
that's when the-

1137
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,520
God is the memory the universe can remember.

1138
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,320
God is the memory the universe can remember.

1139
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,760
Otherwise there's no-

1140
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,320
I'm just deciphering that statement hundreds of years from now.

1141
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,760
What the hell does that mean?

1142
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,200
What does that mean by this?

1143
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,480
Hey, look, don't diss my one-liners.

1144
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,080
No, no, I wasn't dissing it.

1145
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,560
It took me 15 seconds to come up with that.

1146
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,600
I don't know what it means.

1147
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,240
What does it mean?

1148
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,760
Okay, wait, we need to-

1149
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,960
Well, how do we get onto this?

1150
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,560
We were time causality mathematics.

1151
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,160
So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff,

1152
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,840
objects, memory, and information?

1153
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,880
Is, what is that, is mathematics?

1154
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,880
It's the most efficient labeling scheme

1155
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,040
that you can apply to lots of different graphs.

1156
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,320
Well, the labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.

1157
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,280
Can I try?

1158
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,560
Yep, sure, please.

1159
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,640
Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?

1160
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,280
I'm shocked.

1161
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,120
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

1162
00:50:59,120 --> 00:50:59,920
But it's correct.

1163
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,000
Go ahead, sorry.

1164
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,640
Excellent.

1165
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,320
No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right?

1166
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,480
Because we can't not be us.

1167
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,160
Like, we're stuck in the shells we are,

1168
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,360
and we're trying to observe the world.

1169
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,680
And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.

1170
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,080
And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful

1171
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,960
is to try to imagine, if you were outside of us

1172
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,240
looking at us as physical systems using mathematics,

1173
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,800
what would be the specific features you associate

1174
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,720
to the property of understanding mathematics

1175
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,000
and being able to implement it in the universe, right?

1176
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,240
And when you do that,

1177
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,800
mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties

1178
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,040
relative to other kinds of abstraction

1179
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,240
we might talk about, like language or artistic expression.

1180
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
One of those properties is the one I mentioned already

1181
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,000
that is really easy to copy between physical media.

1182
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,240
So if I give you a mathematical statement,

1183
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,840
you almost immediately know what I mean.

1184
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,920
If I tell you the sky is blue, you might say,

1185
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,800
is it gold ball blue?

1186
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,520
Is it your blue?

1187
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,720
What color blue do you mean?

1188
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,160
And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.

1189
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,840
So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it

1190
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,360
when it's copied between physical systems.

1191
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,440
It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.

1192
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,080
And then the second one is it retains its property

1193
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,760
of actually what it can do in the universe when it's copied.

1194
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,000
So the example I like to give there

1195
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,160
is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.

1196
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,000
It's actually, it's a compressed regularity

1197
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,360
of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe.

1198
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,560
But then that information actually is a causal in a sense

1199
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,400
that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do

1200
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,840
without that particular knowledge

1201
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,280
and that particular abstraction.

1202
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,040
And in this case, like launch satellites to space

1203
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,640
or send people to Mars or whatever it is.

1204
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,800
So if you look at us from the outside

1205
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,640
and you say, what is it for physical systems

1206
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,720
to invent a thing called mathematics?

1207
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,200
And then to use and then it to become a physical observable,

1208
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,680
mathematics is kind of like the universally

1209
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,320
copyable information that allows new possibility spaces

1210
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,200
to be opened in the future

1211
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,280
because it allows this kind of ability

1212
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,960
to map one physical system to another

1213
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,600
and actually understand the general principles.

1214
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,480
So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then?

1215
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,560
Yes.

1216
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,440
By mapping.

1217
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,000
Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is

1218
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,920
in terms of the physical theory of assembly

1219
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,080
would be some feature of the structure

1220
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,560
of the assembly spaces of causal graphs

1221
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,080
and their relationship to each other.

1222
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,560
So for example, and I mean,

1223
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,080
this is things that we're going to have to work out

1224
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,040
over the next few years.

1225
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,680
I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory here.

1226
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,400
But as is usual, diving off the deep end.

1227
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,920
But I would expect that we would be able to come up

1228
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,640
with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems

1229
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,920
can communicate with each other, like language?

1230
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,600
Language is basically because

1231
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,120
we're objects extended over time

1232
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,760
and some of the history of that assembly space

1233
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,960
actually overlaps.

1234
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,080
And when we communicate,

1235
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,680
it's because we actually have shared structure

1236
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,880
in our causal history.

1237
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,400
Let me have another quick go at this, right?

1238
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,360
So I think we all agree.

1239
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,360
So I think we take mathematics for granted

1240
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,800
because we've gone through this chain, right?

1241
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,320
Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?

1242
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,600
And we can, well, we share,

1243
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,480
so we have languages that we can make interoperable.

1244
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,880
And so whether you're speaking, I don't know,

1245
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,440
all the different dialects of Chinese,

1246
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,720
all the different dialects of English at French, German,

1247
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,640
whatever, you can interconvert them.

1248
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,240
The interesting thing about mathematics now

1249
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,480
is that everybody on planet Earth, every human being

1250
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,760
and computers share that common language.

1251
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,280
That language was constructed by a process in time.

1252
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,360
So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math

1253
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,040
is those right from the, you know, mathematics didn't occur,

1254
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,440
didn't exist before life, abstraction was invented by life,

1255
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,000
right?

1256
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable

1257
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,200
of mathematical things.

1258
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,840
Wait, wait a minute.

1259
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,640
Can we just ask that, that old famous question,

1260
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,640
is math invented or discovered?

1261
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,320
So when you say assembly invented or whatever,

1262
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,800
you, it means it's just-

1263
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,280
Well, if someone makes this for an assembly,

1264
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,640
it's a mathematical theory, but sorry.

1265
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:01,840
Right.

1266
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,320
Are we arguing?

1267
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:02,960
Exactly.

1268
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:03,760
Are we arguing now?

1269
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,960
That's what it sounds like.

1270
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,880
Are we discovering mathematics?

1271
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,360
No.

1272
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,400
Well, yes and no.

1273
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,520
I would say-

1274
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,280
And you call mathematics a language.

1275
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:11,920
I would say that-

1276
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,960
So it's developing.

1277
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,360
Look, I'm pretty sure that there are some very common seeds

1278
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,120
of mathematics in the universe, right?

1279
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,040
But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now

1280
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,400
is not discovered, it's invented.

1281
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,040
And but even though, I think there's two terms,

1282
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,920
are very triggering and I don't think they're necessarily useful

1283
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,120
because I think that what people do, the mathematicians that say,

1284
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,520
oh, mathematics was discovered because they live in a universe

1285
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,600
where there is no time and it just all exists.

1286
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,080
But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way you can create,

1287
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,280
let's say I'm going to go and create and make a piece of art.

1288
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,120
Did I make that piece of art or did I discover it?

1289
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,360
Like inventing the airplane.

1290
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,560
Did I invent the airplane?

1291
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,440
Let's stick with the airplane.

1292
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,160
The airplane is a good one.

1293
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,040
I, let's say I'm, did I discover the airplane?

1294
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,720
Well, in a way, the universe discovered the airplane

1295
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,160
because it's just chucked a load of atoms together

1296
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,800
and a load of random human beings want to do stuff and they,

1297
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,080
we, we discovered the airplane in the space of possibilities.

1298
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,280
But here's the thing.

1299
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,440
When the space of possibilities is so vast, infinite almost,

1300
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,960
and you're able to actualize one of those in an object,

1301
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,480
then you are inventing it.

1302
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,760
So in mathematics, because there are infinite number of theorems,

1303
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,280
the fact you're actually pulling,

1304
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,880
there's no difference between inventing a mathematical structure

1305
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,160
and inventing the airplane.

1306
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,280
They're the same thing.

1307
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,400
But that doesn't mean that now the airplane exists in the universe.

1308
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,120
It's something weird about the universe that, you know,

1309
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,800
so I think that the more, this is the thing that you probably,

1310
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:50,240
the more memory required for the object, the more invented it is.

1311
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,080
So when a mathematical theorem has a,

1312
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,640
has a, needs more bytes to store it, the more invented it is,

1313
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,360
and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.

1314
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,000
But everything then is invented.

1315
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,600
It's just more or less invented.

1316
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,320
Absolutely.

1317
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,200
The universe has to generate everything as it goes.

1318
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah.

1319
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,960
And it wasn't there in the beginning.

1320
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,720
And the way we're thinking it,

1321
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,960
when you're thinking about the difference between invented and

1322
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,760
discovered is because we're throwing away all the memory.

1323
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,400
Yeah.

1324
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,440
So if you start to think in terms of causality and time,

1325
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,680
then those things become the same.

1326
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,640
Everything is invented.

1327
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,160
And the idea is to make everything intrinsic to the universe.

1328
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,560
So I think one of the features of assembly theory

1329
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,400
is we don't want to have external observers.

1330
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,560
There's been this long tradition in physics of trying to describe

1331
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,320
the universe from the outside and not the inside.

1332
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,000
And the universe has to generate everything itself

1333
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,960
if you do it from the inside.

1334
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,240
Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.

1335
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,760
They'll take you 15 seconds to say that and do it to come up with that also.

1336
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
No, I've thought about that before.

1337
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,560
Okay, good line.

1338
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,800
Are you making fun again?

1339
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,760
No, I'm not making fun.

1340
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,400
I'm having fun.

1341
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,200
There's a difference.

1342
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:57,840
Oh, that's good.

1343
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,880
All right, I'm you.

1344
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,840
She's inventing fun.

1345
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,120
I'm not all intimidated.

1346
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,800
And there's a causal history to that fun.

1347
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,600
You mentioned that there's no way to communicate with aliens

1348
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,400
until there's overlap in the causal graph.

1349
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,440
Communication includes being able to see them.

1350
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,600
And like what are we, this is the question is,

1351
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,240
is communication any kind of detection?

1352
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,680
And if so, what do aliens look like

1353
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,960
as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?

1354
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,000
You're assuming, let's assume that so when you see them and they see you,

1355
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,640
you're assuming they have vision,

1356
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,760
they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time,

1357
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,680
there's a lot of assumptions we're making.

1358
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,400
What detection?

1359
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,440
All right, let's step back.

1360
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,120
So yes, okay, you're right.

1361
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:52,080
So when in the English language, when we say the word C,

1362
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,720
we mean visually, they show up to a party and it's like,

1363
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,160
oh, wow, that's an alien.

1364
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,880
That's visual.

1365
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,680
That's 3D.

1366
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,040
That's okay.

1367
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:05,520
And that's also assuming spatial scale of something that's visible to you.

1368
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,240
So it can't be microscopic or it can't be so big

1369
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,720
that you don't even realize that's an entity.

1370
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:10,960
Okay.

1371
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,000
But other kinds of detection too.

1372
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,600
I would make it more abstract and go down.

1373
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,400
I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite

1374
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,960
the Arecibo message in assembly theory and also to abandon binary.

1375
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,080
Because I don't think aliens necessarily, why should they have binary?

1376
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,080
Well, they have some basic elements with which to do information exchange.

1377
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,040
Well, let's make it more fundamental or more universal.

1378
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,080
So we need to think about what is the universal way of making a memory

1379
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,400
and then we should re-encode Arecibo in that way.

1380
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,600
What's more basic than 0's and 1's?

1381
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,800
Well, it's really difficult to get out of that causal chain because we're so...

1382
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,600
So let's raise the idea of 0 for a moment.

1383
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,320
It took human beings a long time to come up with the idea of 0.

1384
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,920
Now you've got the idea of 0.

1385
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,720
You can't throw it away.

1386
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,360
It's so useful.

1387
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,040
To discover the idea of 0.

1388
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,000
To discover or invent.

1389
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,360
I don't know.

1390
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:04,320
But it took a long time so it was invented.

1391
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:04,880
That's right.

1392
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,120
Yeah.

1393
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,960
I think 0 was invented.

1394
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,680
It's exactly.

1395
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,160
So it's not given that aliens know what 0 is.

1396
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,440
It's a massive assumption.

1397
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,000
It's a useful discovery.

1398
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You're saying if you break the causal chain,

1399
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,400
there might be some other more efficient way of representing...

1400
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,920
That's why I want to meet him and ask him for a shortcut.

1401
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,600
But you won't be able to ask him until...

1402
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,840
So I interrupted you and I think you're making good point.

1403
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,960
I was just going to say, well look.

1404
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,000
Thank you.

1405
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,400
Sorry.

1406
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,880
Rather than saying...

1407
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:35,600
Please internet.

1408
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Tweet at him for the rude interruptions.

1409
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,240
Oh, go ahead.

1410
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:38,800
I'm sorry.

1411
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,440
No, it's okay.

1412
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,200
Maybe it's change.

1413
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,400
How do we say...

1414
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,840
I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

1415
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,720
I would like to know.

1416
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:52,000
What is the full spectrum of what aliens might look like to us?

1417
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,200
Now that we've laid this all on the table of like,

1418
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,520
all right, so there has to be some overlap

1419
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,880
and this causal chain that led to them.

1420
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,520
What are we looking for?

1421
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,880
What do you think we should be looking for?

1422
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,400
So you mentioned mass spec measuring certain objects

1423
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,440
that aliens could create or are aliens themselves.

1424
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,440
We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet

1425
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,240
or maybe what the hell is the basic object

1426
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,880
we're trying to measure the assembly index of?

1427
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,840
Let's cut ourselves a break.

1428
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,440
Let's assume that they're metabolized.

1429
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,680
They've got an energy source and there are a size

1430
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,800
that we can recognize.

1431
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,000
Let's give our cut ourselves a break

1432
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,240
because there could be aliens that are so big

1433
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,920
we won't recognize we're seeing them.

1434
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,200
There might be aliens that are so small

1435
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,800
we don't yet have the ability to...

1436
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,920
We don't have microscopes that can see far enough away

1437
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,200
that just won't be able to see them.

1438
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,320
So what's a good range?

1439
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,760
So let's just make a range...

1440
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,400
Let's just be very anthropocentric and say

1441
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,320
we're going to look for aliens roughly our size

1442
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,760
and technology our size

1443
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,240
because we know it's possible on Earth, right?

1444
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,280
I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be to find exoplanets

1445
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,480
that in the same zone as Earth in terms of heat and stuff

1446
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,240
and then say, hey, if there's that same kind of gravity,

1447
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,120
same kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume

1448
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,880
that the alien life there might use

1449
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,640
a similar kind of physical infrastructure and then we're good.

1450
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,440
So then your question becomes really relevant.

1451
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,840
Say, right, let's use vision, sound, touch.

1452
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,800
So okay, that's really nice.

1453
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,960
So if there's a lot of aliens out there,

1454
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,400
there's a good likelihood if you match to the planet

1455
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,960
that they're going to be in the same spatial and temporal...

1456
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,320
Operating in the same spatial temporal domain as humans.

1457
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:46,320
Okay, within that, what did they look like?

1458
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,800
Visually, what do they sound like?

1459
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,640
What are they?

1460
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh, God, this sounds creepy.

1461
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,760
Tastes like, what are they?

1462
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,320
Oh, smell like, smell like that.

1463
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,440
It sounds like our clubhouse.

1464
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,200
We was like, can we have sex of aliens?

1465
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,640
Which was basically me saying...

1466
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,520
Passionate, passionate love.

1467
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,640
But it wasn't actually about sex.

1468
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,800
It was about, is our chemistry compatible, right?

1469
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,280
Is there some...

1470
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,840
Yeah, can we...

1471
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,720
Yeah, are they edible too?

1472
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,840
They could be very edible.

1473
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,040
They could be delicious.

1474
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,560
That's why I want to see some aliens, right?

1475
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,000
Because I think, are there...

1476
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,280
I think evolution...

1477
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,440
I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?

1478
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,280
Because why generate memory?

1479
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,840
Why generate storage, the need for storage space

1480
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,960
when you can use symmetry?

1481
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,480
So, and symmetry is quite, maybe quite effective

1482
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,960
in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?

1483
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,000
So maybe you could be reasonable to assume

1484
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:36,960
that aliens could have...

1485
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,680
They could be bipedal.

1486
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,440
They could be symmetric in the same way.

1487
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,960
Might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.

1488
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,240
I mean, we can make them.

1489
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,960
Perhaps there's this whole zoo of different aliens out there

1490
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,640
and we'll never get to be able to classify

1491
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,560
some of the weird aliens we can't interact with

1492
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,720
because they have made such weird stuff.

1493
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,040
But we are just going to look at...

1494
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,040
We're going to find aliens that look most like us.

1495
01:03:59,040 --> 01:03:59,520
Why not?

1496
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.

1497
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:02,720
Yeah.

1498
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,440
Yeah.

1499
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,920
But I think it's really hard to imagine

1500
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,280
what the space of aliens is because the space is huge.

1501
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,520
Because one of the arguments that you can make

1502
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,200
about wildlife emerges in chemistry

1503
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,400
is because chemistry is the first scale

1504
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,600
in terms of building up objects from elementary objects.

1505
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
That the number of possible things that could exist

1506
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,000
is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once, right?

1507
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,200
So imagine you have two planets

1508
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,840
and they're cooking some geochemistry.

1509
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,720
Our planet invented one kind of biochemistry.

1510
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,960
And presumably as you start building up

1511
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,800
the complexity of the molecules,

1512
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,200
the chances of the overlap in those trajectories,

1513
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,760
those causal chains being built up is probably very low.

1514
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,600
And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced

1515
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,960
along its evolutionary path.

1516
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,840
So I think it's very difficult to imagine predicting

1517
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,680
the technologies that aliens are going to have.

1518
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,760
I mean, you're looking at basically planets

1519
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,520
have kind of convergent chemistry,

1520
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,720
but there's some variability.

1521
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,640
And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth

1522
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,400
into the possibility space for chemistry.

1523
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,360
So do you think it would detect the technology,

1524
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,480
the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?

1525
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,240
Possibly.

1526
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,400
So when you're talking about measuring assembly index,

1527
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,480
don't you think we would detect the garbage first?

1528
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,600
Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations,

1529
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:22,880
isn't this going to be trash?

1530
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,920
I think I would come back to Arecibo.

1531
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,320
The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope

1532
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,360
built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.

1533
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,560
How's Arecibo spelled?

1534
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,960
A-R-E-C-I-B-O.

1535
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,320
Yes, thank you.

1536
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,920
And there we go, they got out there.

1537
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,760
That's the telescope that sent the message

1538
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,480
that you're talking about.

1539
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,440
So that message was sent where?

1540
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,720
It was beamed at a star, a specific star,

1541
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,960
and it was sent out many years ago.

1542
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,440
And what they did,

1543
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,120
so this is why I was pushing on binary,

1544
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,160
is a binary message.

1545
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,840
I think it's a semi-prime length number of characters.

1546
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,840
So I think 27E3 by 23, I think.

1547
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,520
And it basically represents human bit,

1548
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,920
proton, binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.

1549
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,000
And it's really cool.

1550
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,280
But I'm just wondering if it could be done

1551
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,640
not making any, because it made assumptions

1552
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,000
that aliens speak binary.

1553
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,160
Why make that assumption?

1554
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,480
Why not just assume that if the difference

1555
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,480
between physics, chemistry, and biology

1556
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,760
is the amount of memory that's recordable

1557
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:36,800
by the substrates, then surely the universal thing,

1558
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,720
I'm going to make some sacrilegious statement

1559
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,320
which I think is pretty awesome for people to argue with.

1560
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,080
So this is, we're looking at an image

1561
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,040
where it's the entirety of the message encoded in binary.

1562
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,080
And then there's probably interpretation

1563
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,680
of different parts of that image.

1564
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,840
There's a person, there's green parts.

1565
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,520
It looks like for people just listening

1566
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,520
like a game of Tetris.

1567
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,600
Encoding in minimal ways, a bunch of cool information probably.

1568
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,640
Representing all of us.

1569
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,800
So at the top, it's kind of teaching yourself to count

1570
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,920
and then it all goes all the way down,

1571
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,680
teaching you chemistry and then just says,

1572
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,920
but it makes so many assumptions.

1573
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,920
And I think if we can actually,

1574
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,120
still look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent

1575
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,400
in expressing this, but I'll have a go

1576
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,760
and you can correct it if you want.

1577
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,800
Which is like, one of the things that Sarah

1578
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:29,360
has had a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of life.

1579
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,520
And this is one of the reasons why we're working together,

1580
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,080
because we don't really care about the origin of life.

1581
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,520
We want to make life, make aliens and find aliens,

1582
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,800
make aliens, find aliens.

1583
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,640
I think we might have to make aliens in the lab

1584
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,720
before we find aliens in the universe, right?

1585
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,480
I think that would be a cool way to do it.

1586
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,160
So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?

1587
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,520
Well, it's selection through assembly theory,

1588
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,520
creating memories, because when you create memories,

1589
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,960
you can then command your domain,

1590
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,240
you can basically do stuff.

1591
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,680
You can command matter.

1592
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,800
So we need to find a way by understanding

1593
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,920
what life is of how the minimal way to command matter,

1594
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,520
how that would emerge in the universe.

1595
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,840
And if we want to communicate,

1596
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,480
I mean, maybe we don't want to necessarily uniformly communicate.

1597
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,200
What I would do, perhaps, if I had,

1598
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,000
is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth

1599
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,920
to have this magic way of communicating with aliens,

1600
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,440
get them quite far away from Earth, plausibly deniable,

1601
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,520
and then send out the message

1602
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,120
that would then attract all the aliens,

1603
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,440
and then basically work out if they're a friend or foe,

1604
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,400
and how will they want to hang out?

1605
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,960
The message is being something that has to do with the memories.

1606
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,680
Yes.

1607
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,640
Like the assembly version of our SIBO,

1608
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,240
so that everyone in the universe

1609
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,160
that has been understands what life is.

1610
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,120
So aliens need to work out what they are.

1611
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,720
Once they've worked out what they are,

1612
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,040
they then can work out how to encode what they are,

1613
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,560
and then they can go out and send messages.

1614
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,160
It's like the universal Rosetta Stone

1615
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,760
for life in the universe is working out

1616
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,800
how the memories are built.

1617
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,720
I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well,

1618
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,240
whether that, you would agree with that?

1619
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,080
No, I wanted to raise a different point,

1620
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,360
which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens yet

1621
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,960
because we haven't gotten the technology.

1622
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,000
And presumably, we think assembly theory

1623
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,040
is the right way of doing it,

1624
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,400
but I don't think that we know how to go

1625
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,920
from the kind of data you're describing,

1626
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,200
Lex, like, you know, visual data or smell

1627
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,440
to construct the assembly spaces yet.

1628
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,600
And in some ways, I think that the problem

1629
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,400
of life detection really is the same problem

1630
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,240
at the foundations of AI,

1631
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,960
that we don't understand how to get machines

1632
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,640
to see causal graphs, to see reality in terms of causation.

1633
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,240
And so I think assembly and AI

1634
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,320
are going to intersect in interesting ways, hopefully.

1635
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,000
But the sort of key point,

1636
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,560
and I've been trying to make this argument more recently,

1637
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,800
I might write an essay on it,

1638
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,040
is, you know, people talk about the great filter,

1639
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,440
right, and which is, again, this like doomsday thing

1640
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,720
that, you know, people want to say,

1641
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:57,680
there's no aliens out there

1642
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,040
because something terrible happened to them.

1643
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,760
And it matters whether that's in our past or our future,

1644
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,320
as to the longevity of our species, presumably,

1645
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:07,920
which is why people find it interesting.

1646
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,640
But I think it's not a physical filter.

1647
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,840
It's not like things go extinct.

1648
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,560
I think it's literally,

1649
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,160
we don't have the technology to see them.

1650
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,880
And you could see that with microscopes.

1651
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,560
I mean, we didn't know there were microbes on this table

1652
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,600
for our tables for thousands of years or telescopes.

1653
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,360
Like, there's so much of the universe we can't see.

1654
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,600
And then, basically, what we have done as a species

1655
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,120
is outsource our physical perceptions to technology,

1656
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,800
building microscopes based on our eyes,

1657
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,360
you know, and building size monitors

1658
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,800
based on our sense of feelings,

1659
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,160
like feel earthquakes and things.

1660
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,000
And AI is basically, we're trying to outsource

1661
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,480
what's actually happening in our thinking apparatus

1662
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,200
into machines now, into technological devices.

1663
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,960
And maybe that's the key technology

1664
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,040
that's going to allow us to see things like us

1665
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,640
and see the universe in a totally different way.

1666
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,160
But you kind of mentioned the great filter.

1667
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,240
Do you think there's a way through technology

1668
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,920
to stop being able to see stuff?

1669
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,680
So can you take a step backwards?

1670
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,400
I think so, yeah.

1671
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,560
Did you imply that with the great, so like...

1672
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,040
Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter

1673
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,360
in the sense that a example of life

1674
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,360
evolving on a planet over billions of years

1675
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,880
has to acquire a certain amount of knowledge and technology

1676
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,480
to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.

1677
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,720
Well, that's the sense I have is,

1678
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,080
I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,

1679
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,200
there's this kind of idea that we have most of the tools

1680
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,200
already to hear the signal.

1681
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,680
But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools

1682
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,640
to see the signal.

1683
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:32,800
No, we don't have what we're doing.

1684
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,600
Yeah, I agree.

1685
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,680
That's the biggest, like, to hear.

1686
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,760
We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.

1687
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:37,920
Yeah.

1688
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,080
Aliens are everywhere.

1689
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:40,960
We just don't have the...

1690
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,440
Exactly.

1691
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,800
Yeah, well, oh, that's...

1692
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,160
I mean, I got this in part, actually,

1693
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,080
because you were like, you know, last time I was here,

1694
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,360
I was like, look at the carpet.

1695
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,040
You know, could it, like, if you had an alien detector,

1696
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,480
would the carpet be aliens?

1697
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,680
I mean, I think we really don't.

1698
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,440
It would be, but the aliens would nevertheless

1699
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,600
have a high assembly index or produce things

1700
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,560
of a high assembly index.

1701
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1702
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,880
And those things of a high assembly index,

1703
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,040
you have to have a detector that can recognize

1704
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,120
high assembly index in all its forms.

1705
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,000
Yeah, yes.

1706
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,800
That's it, that's it.

1707
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,680
Take data, construct assembly space.

1708
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,200
Yeah, those patterns, basically.

1709
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,440
So one way to think about high assembly index

1710
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,440
is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.

1711
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,680
I can give you an example, because, I mean,

1712
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,440
in molecules, we've been talking about in objects,

1713
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,960
but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.

1714
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:32,320
Like, imagine you're just, like, I always get bothered

1715
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,280
by the fact that, like, when you look at birds flocking,

1716
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,360
you can describe that with, like, a simple boys model,

1717
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,800
or, like, you know, people use spin glass

1718
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,000
to describe animal behavior,

1719
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
and those are, like, really simple physics models.

1720
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,640
Yet you're looking at a system that you know has agency,

1721
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,720
and there's intelligence in those birds.

1722
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,840
And I, and basically, like, you can't help but think

1723
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,240
there must be some statistical signatures of the fact that

1724
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,680
they're, that's a group of agents versus, you know,

1725
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,080
like, I don't know, you know, the physics example,

1726
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,560
maybe, like, I don't know, brownie emotion or something.

1727
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,040
And so what we're trying to do is actually apply

1728
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,040
assembly to trajectory data to try to say

1729
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,760
there's a minimal amount of causal history

1730
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,800
to build up certain trajectories for observed agents

1731
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,560
that's, like, an agency detector for behavior.

1732
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,200
Do you think it's possible to do some, like,

1733
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,600
like, Boids or those kinds of things, like, artificial,

1734
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,880
like, cellular automata play with those ideas

1735
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,240
with assembly, with assembly theory?

1736
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,880
Have you found any useful, really simple,

1737
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,280
mathematical, like, simulation tools

1738
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,920
that allow you to play with these concepts?

1739
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,800
So, like, one, of course, you're doing mass spec

1740
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,280
in this physical space with chemistry,

1741
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,640
but it just seems, well, I mean, computer science person,

1742
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,640
maybe, it seems easier to just-

1743
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,440
I agree with you.

1744
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,280
And sexier in terms of tweeting visual information

1745
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,080
on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly, to play,

1746
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,040
like, here's an organism of a low assembly index

1747
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,600
and here's an organism of a high assembly index

1748
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,160
and let's watch them create more and more memories

1749
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,200
and more and more complex objects.

1750
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,840
And so, like, in mathematics, you get to observe

1751
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,240
what that looks like, to build up an intuition

1752
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,680
what assembly index is like.

1753
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,760
We are building a toolkit right now,

1754
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:18,960
so I think it's a really good idea.

1755
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,000
But what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed

1756
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,080
with the infrastructure required.

1757
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,880
And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information

1758
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,720
in mathematics, when human beings,

1759
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,760
when human being, we take a lot of the infrastructure

1760
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,960
for granted.

1761
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,040
And I think we have to strip that back a bit

1762
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:35,760
for going forward.

1763
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,720
But you're absolutely right.

1764
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,400
I would agree that I think the fact that we exist

1765
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,200
in the universe, this is like, I can see that

1766
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,960
lots of people would disagree with this statement,

1767
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,320
but I don't think Sarah will, but I don't know.

1768
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,320
The fact that objects exist,

1769
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,640
I don't think anyone on Earth will disagree

1770
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,120
that objects can exist elsewhere, right?

1771
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,720
But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.

1772
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:03,280
But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition,

1773
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,840
the universe's ability to acquire memory

1774
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,200
is the very first step for building life.

1775
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:14,000
And that must be, that's so easy to happen.

1776
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,480
So therefore alien life is everywhere,

1777
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,000
because all alien life is,

1778
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,000
is those memories being compressed and minimized

1779
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,160
and the alien equivalent of the cell working.

1780
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,680
So I think that we will build new technologies

1781
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,640
to find aliens.

1782
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,160
But we need to understand what we are first

1783
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,120
and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology.

1784
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,960
The most interesting thing, as you're saying,

1785
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,080
to take these two organisms,

1786
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,880
different assemblies, there's one you get into biology.

1787
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,840
Biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent.

1788
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,720
Physics is probably, chemistry is less weird,

1789
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,080
because the rules of chemistry are small

1790
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:50,880
and the rules of biology.

1791
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,760
And then going away to physics where you have a very

1792
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,520
nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things.

1793
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,760
And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.

1794
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,640
And so once we get there,

1795
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,200
my dream is that we are just going to be able to suddenly are,

1796
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,480
I mean, I'm, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.

1797
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,520
I'm not mean to be arrogant.

1798
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,000
It's just, again, I've got this hammer called assembly

1799
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,280
and everything's a nail.

1800
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,280
But I think that once we crack it,

1801
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,640
we'll be able to use assembly theory

1802
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,640
plus telescopes to find aliens.

1803
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,680
Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee

1804
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,080
on the number of aliens that are out there?

1805
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,000
Do actually, yeah.

1806
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,400
Well.

1807
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,520
And what they look like.

1808
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,120
So any of the things we've been talking about,

1809
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:38,000
is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover

1810
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,520
wisdom through nuanced disagreement.

1811
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,840
Yeah, I don't, I don't wholly disagree,

1812
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,560
but I think, but I do think I disagree.

1813
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,480
It's kind of, there's nuance there.

1814
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:51,760
But, but we need to-

1815
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:52,720
You can disagree.

1816
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,360
No, that's fine.

1817
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,600
It is nuanced, right?

1818
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,760
So you made the point earlier that you think,

1819
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,040
you know, once we discover what alien light,

1820
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,200
what life is, we'll see alien life everywhere.

1821
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,240
And I think I agree on some levels in the sense

1822
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,040
that I think the physics that governs us is universal.

1823
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,200
But I don't know how far I would go to say,

1824
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,800
to say that we're a likely phenomena,

1825
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,840
because we don't understand all of the features

1826
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,600
of the transition at the origin of life,

1827
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,600
which we would just say in assembly,

1828
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,800
as you go from the no memory physics to,

1829
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,840
there's like a critical transition around the assembly index

1830
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,520
where assembliness starts to increase.

1831
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,120
And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere

1832
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,720
and complexification of the biosphere.

1833
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,440
So there's a principle of increasing assembliness,

1834
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,120
where that goes back to what I was saying at the very beginning

1835
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,720
about the physics of the possible,

1836
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,440
that the universe basically gets in this mode

1837
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,560
of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.

1838
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,880
Now, how often that transition happens,

1839
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,040
that you get the kind of cascading effect

1840
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,400
that we get in our biosphere,

1841
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,000
I think we don't know, if we did,

1842
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
we would know the likelihood of life in the universe.

1843
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,600
And a lot of people want to say life is common,

1844
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,040
but I don't think that we can say that yet,

1845
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,400
so we have the empirical data,

1846
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,840
which I think you would agree with.

1847
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,040
But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have,

1848
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,160
which I don't like, but I did have it,

1849
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:10,320
which is, if life emerges on one planet,

1850
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,920
and you get this real high density of things

1851
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,200
that can exist on that planet,

1852
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,400
is it sort of dominating the density of creation

1853
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,000
that the universe can actually generate?

1854
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,520
So like if you're thinking about counting,

1855
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,360
entropy, right?

1856
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,760
Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it,

1857
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,840
and then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle,

1858
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,960
it's not entropy.

1859
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,880
But the idea is that now transformations among stuff

1860
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,080
or the actual physical histories of things

1861
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,600
now become things that you have to count

1862
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,000
as far as saying that these things exist

1863
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,920
and we're increasing the number of things that exist.

1864
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:45,440
And if you think about that cosmologically,

1865
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,600
maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential

1866
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,800
of the whole universe, I don't know.

1867
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,600
How's that, can you explain that a little bit?

1868
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,440
Why can anyone geographical region suck up

1869
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,040
the creative capacity of the universe?

1870
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,160
Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought.

1871
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,440
I don't actually agree with it,

1872
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,320
but it was just a thought experiment.

1873
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,920
I love that you can have thoughts

1874
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,880
that you don't like and don't agree with,

1875
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,960
but you have to think through them anyway.

1876
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,280
Yeah.

1877
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,920
The human mind is fascinating.

1878
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,840
Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual thought experiments

1879
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,520
are really good when you're trying to build new theories

1880
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,840
because you have to think through all the consequences.

1881
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,600
And there are people that want to try to account for, say,

1882
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,200
the degrees of freedom on our planet

1883
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,920
in cosmological inventories of talking

1884
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,600
about the entropy of the universe

1885
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,640
and when we're thinking about cosmological era of time

1886
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,440
and things like that.

1887
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,360
Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals

1888
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,080
as they stand now,

1889
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,160
but assembly would give you a way of counting it.

1890
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,280
And then the question is,

1891
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,680
if there's a certain maximal capacity

1892
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,000
of the universe's speed of generating stuff,

1893
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,360
which Lee always has this argument

1894
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,520
that assembly is about time,

1895
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,200
the universe is generating more states.

1896
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,880
Really, what it's generating is more assembly possibilities.

1897
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,000
And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that,

1898
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,240
that the universe is accelerating its expansion

1899
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,000
because that makes more physical space.

1900
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,280
And what's happening on our planet

1901
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,600
is it's accelerating in the expansion

1902
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,120
of possible things that exist.

1903
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,040
And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate

1904
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,280
of what it can do to generate things.

1905
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,040
And then if there is a maximal rate,

1906
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,440
maybe only a certain number of planets can actually do that

1907
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,080
or there's a trade-off about the piece of growth

1908
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,440
on certain planets versus others.

1909
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,120
I have a million questions there.

1910
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,800
Do you have thoughts on what you're saying?

1911
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,440
Just a quick, yeah.

1912
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,160
I'll just say something very quick.

1913
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:22,960
It's a thought experiment.

1914
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,440
No, that's good.

1915
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,160
I think I get it.

1916
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:24,880
I think I get it.

1917
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,800
So what I want to say is,

1918
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,960
when I mean aliens everywhere,

1919
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:36,080
I mean memories are the prerequisite for aliens

1920
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,960
via selection and then concentration of selection

1921
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,320
when selection becomes autonomous.

1922
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,840
So what I would love to do

1923
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,160
is to build, say, a magical telescope

1924
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:44,960
that was a memory...

1925
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,520
A magical one.

1926
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,160
A magical one.

1927
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:46,800
A magical one.

1928
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,000
Sorry, a real one.

1929
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,800
There will be a memory detector to see selection.

1930
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,200
So you could get to exoplanets

1931
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,320
and say that exoplanet looks like

1932
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
there's lots of selection going on there.

1933
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,640
Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life.

1934
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,080
So what I'm trying to say is narrow down

1935
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,760
the regions of space where you say

1936
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,840
there's definitely evidence of memory

1937
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,280
as high assembly there,

1938
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,040
or not high assembly because that would be life,

1939
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,120
but where it's capable of happening.

1940
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,400
And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.

1941
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,680
I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to cells

1942
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,880
and all the other things.

1943
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,160
I think you're right.

1944
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,360
But I think that we just need to get more data.

1945
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,800
Well, I didn't like the thought experiment

1946
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,920
because I don't like the idea

1947
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,600
that if the universe has a maximal limit

1948
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,600
on the amount it can generate per unit time,

1949
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,320
that our existence is actually precluding the existence of other things.

1950
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:32,960
Well, I'll just say one thing.

1951
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,160
But I think that's probably true anyway

1952
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,520
because of the resource limitations.

1953
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,360
So I don't like your thought experiment

1954
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,400
because I think it's wrong.

1955
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,000
Well, no, no.

1956
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,360
I do like the thought experiment.

1957
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,320
So what you're trying to say is like,

1958
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,080
there is a chain of events that goes back

1959
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:47,520
that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth.

1960
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,840
And you're not saying that life isn't possible

1961
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,880
where else where you say that

1962
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,400
there has been these number of things,

1963
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,600
contingent things that have happened

1964
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,520
that have allowed life to merge here.

1965
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,240
That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere,

1966
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,400
but you're saying that the intersection of events

1967
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,320
may be concentrated here.

1968
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,240
Not exactly.

1969
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:10,800
It's more like if you look at, say,

1970
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,160
the causal graphs are fundamental,

1971
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,000
maybe space is an emergent property,

1972
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,560
which is consistent with some proposals in quantum gravity,

1973
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,480
but also how we talk about things in assembly theory,

1974
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,680
then the universe is causal graphs generating

1975
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,080
more structure in causal graphs.

1976
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,080
So this is how the universe is unfolding.

1977
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:30,000
And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation.

1978
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,240
Like there's only so much stuff that gets made

1979
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,560
per update of the universe.

1980
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,320
And then if there's a lot of stuff being made

1981
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,400
in a particular region that happens

1982
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,880
to look the same locally, spatially,

1983
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,200
that's an after effect of the fact

1984
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,960
that the whole causal graph is updating.

1985
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,200
Yeah, I don't know that.

1986
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,880
I think that doesn't work.

1987
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:51,840
I don't think it works either,

1988
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,600
but I don't have a good argument in my mind about.

1989
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,840
But I do like the idea of the capacity of the universe

1990
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,520
because you've got the number of states.

1991
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,640
Yeah, we can come back to it.

1992
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,560
Well, let me ask real quick.

1993
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,760
Why does different local pockets

1994
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,720
of the universe start remembering stuff?

1995
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,400
How does memory emerge exactly?

1996
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,920
So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.

1997
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,600
That's when the physicists were happiest,

1998
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,000
those low memory objects, which is like

1999
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,760
ultra low memory objects,

2000
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,600
which is what the definition of stuff.

2001
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,960
Okay, so how does memory emerge?

2002
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,760
How does, which is this, how does this,

2003
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:33,200
the temporal stickiness?

2004
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,920
So objects emerge.

2005
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,920
I'm going to take a very chemo-centric point of view

2006
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,400
because I can't imagine any other way of doing it.

2007
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:45,760
You could think of other ways maybe.

2008
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:53,360
But I would say heterogeneity in matter is where the memory,

2009
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,440
so you must have enough different ways

2010
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,400
of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.

2011
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,960
So what that means is if you've got particles colliding in a box,

2012
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,520
let's just take some elements in a box.

2013
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,240
Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.

2014
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:11,760
So there's a combinatorial explosion

2015
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,280
of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,

2016
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,240
bonds being made.

2017
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,280
Because there's such a large number,

2018
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,160
the population of different objects that are possible,

2019
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:25,040
this goes back to assembly theory where assembly theory,

2020
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,280
there's four types of universes, right?

2021
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,800
So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier,

2022
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,320
where one universe where you've just got everything is possible,

2023
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,360
so you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything.

2024
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:42,320
Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial,

2025
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,840
where you basically have to accrue information in steps.

2026
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,320
Then you've got assembly observed,

2027
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,360
and then you've got the object assembly going back.

2028
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:55,280
So what I'm trying to say is if you can take atoms and make bonds,

2029
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,080
let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom,

2030
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,520
you find an amino acid,

2031
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,960
then you add another carbon atom on it,

2032
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,080
in a particular configuration,

2033
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,160
then another one, all different molecules,

2034
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,640
they all represent different histories.

2035
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,160
So I would say for me right now,

2036
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,200
the most simple route into life seems to be

2037
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,280
through recording memories and chemistry.

2038
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,080
But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways

2039
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,560
and can't be other emergent effects.

2040
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,600
But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds,

2041
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:29,360
and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future.

2042
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,800
So imagine a box of atoms,

2043
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,880
and then you combine those atoms in some way.

2044
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,080
So you make molecule A from load of atoms,

2045
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,400
and then molecule A can go back to the box and influence the box.

2046
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,600
Then you make A' or AB or ABC,

2047
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,040
and that process keeps going,

2048
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,200
and that's where the memories come from.

2049
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,320
Is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding?

2050
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,000
I don't know if it makes any sense.

2051
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,120
And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.

2052
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,800
So the physicists have no, no, like not enough.

2053
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,520
They're like desperately begging for more freedom

2054
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:20,400
and heterogeneous components to play with.

2055
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:22,960
That's exactly it.

2056
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,720
What do you think about that, Sarah?

2057
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,720
I mentioned already, I think it's significant

2058
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,080
that whatever physics governs life emerges actually in chemistry.

2059
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,880
It's not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale.

2060
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,840
It's in, well, atomic scale chemistry.

2061
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,440
But like when you get into this,

2062
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,760
this combinatorial diversity that you get

2063
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,400
from combining things on the periodic table,

2064
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,520
that's when selection actually matters

2065
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:48,960
or the fact that some things can exist

2066
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,120
and others can't exist actually starts to matter.

2067
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,840
So I think of it like you don't study gravity

2068
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,040
inside the atomic nucleus.

2069
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,520
You study it in terms of large-scale structure of the universe

2070
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,200
or black holes or things like that.

2071
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,240
And whatever we're talking about as physics of information

2072
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:06,080
or physics of assembly becomes relevant

2073
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,000
at a certain scale of reality.

2074
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,040
And the transition that you're talking about,

2075
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,240
I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density

2076
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,720
in terms of the assembly space

2077
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:20,560
of the relationship of the overlap and the assembly space,

2078
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,040
which is a feature of common memory,

2079
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:27,440
there is this transition to assembly-dominated physics,

2080
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,080
whatever that is.

2081
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,320
Oh, like when we're talking about,

2082
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,960
and we're trying to map out exactly what that transition looks like.

2083
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,080
We're pretty sure of some of its features,

2084
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,520
but we haven't done all of that.

2085
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,360
Do you think if you were there in the early universe,

2086
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:43,040
you would have been able to predict the emergence of chemistry and biology?

2087
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,800
And I ask that because at this stage as humans,

2088
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,200
do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory

2089
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,880
that might be able to be formed later on

2090
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,880
in this pocket of the universe?

2091
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,240
Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?

2092
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,880
I think as much time as you have in the past

2093
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,720
is how much you can predict in the future

2094
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,360
because it's actually physical in the system.

2095
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:14,880
And you have to have enough time for features of that structure to exist.

2096
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,800
Wait, let me push back on that.

2097
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:21,040
Isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a shortest path

2098
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,440
that stretches all the way to the beginning,

2099
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,000
that's building some giant monster?

2100
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:27,360
Maybe, yeah.

2101
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,240
The universe has as much memory as the largest assembly object in the universe.

2102
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,560
So you can't predict?

2103
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,440
You can't predict any deeper than that, no.

2104
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,080
So I guess what I'm saying is what intuition do you have

2105
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,680
about complexity living in the world that you'd have today?

2106
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:53,440
I guess how long does it get more fun?

2107
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,760
Isn't there going to be at some point,

2108
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,840
because there's a heat death in the universe,

2109
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:03,680
isn't there going to be a point of the highest assembly of object

2110
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:06,960
with the highest probability being generated?

2111
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,480
When is the universe going to be the most fun

2112
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,160
and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?

2113
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:10,640
Exactly.

2114
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,160
And will you know when you're having the most fun

2115
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,640
that this is the best time you're in your prime?

2116
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:18,000
Are you going to do what everyone does,

2117
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,840
which is deny that you're in your prime

2118
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,280
and the best years are still ahead of you?

2119
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,120
I don't know.

2120
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,080
What option do you have?

2121
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:31,280
I mean, the problem is there's lots of really interesting features here.

2122
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,960
I just want to mention one thing that might be,

2123
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,080
is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back

2124
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,680
to subatomic particles.

2125
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,280
And I also think that cosmological selection might have been actually,

2126
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,760
there might have been a, I would say it's a really boring bit,

2127
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,360
but it's really important for a cosmologist

2128
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,520
that universes have gone through.

2129
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,360
Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?

2130
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,560
Maybe that there is this,

2131
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,160
that basically the universe evolves.

2132
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,680
You've got the wrong constants.

2133
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,880
We'll start again.

2134
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,160
And the most productive constants

2135
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,800
where you can allow particles to form in a certain way,

2136
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,040
propagate to the next universe, we go again.

2137
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,120
So actually selection goes all the way back

2138
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,640
and these are the cycle of universes.

2139
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,480
And now this universe has been selected

2140
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,240
because life can occur and it carries on.

2141
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,320
But I've really butchered that.

2142
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,200
There is a much more-

2143
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,720
So this is some aspect where through the selection process,

2144
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,200
there's parameters that are being fine-tuned

2145
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,560
and we happen to be living in one

2146
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,240
where there's some level of fine-tuning.

2147
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,160
Is there, given that,

2148
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:31,200
can you still man the case that we humans are alone in the universe?

2149
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:34,880
We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.

2150
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,240
Yeah, I can, I guess.

2151
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,320
Sad though, I mean, so from-

2152
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,200
Is it possible?

2153
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,800
Yes, it's possible.

2154
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,080
Let's assume, well, we know.

2155
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,000
I mean, it's possible.

2156
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,240
So let me, so okay, so there is a particular

2157
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,440
set of elements on earth in a particular ratio

2158
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,560
and the right gravitational constant

2159
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,680
and the right viscosity, you know,

2160
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,680
of stuff being at a move around.

2161
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,760
The right distance from our sun,

2162
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,400
right number of events where we have a moon,

2163
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,800
the earth is rotating,

2164
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,120
the late heavy bombardment produced

2165
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,200
a lot of, brought in the right stuff.

2166
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,840
And Mars was cooking up, you know,

2167
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,360
the right molecules first.

2168
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,200
So it was habitable before earth.

2169
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,840
It was literally doing the combinatorial search.

2170
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,600
And before Mars kind of became unhabitable

2171
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,000
it seeded earth with the right molecular replicators

2172
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:36,320
and there was just the right stuff on earth

2173
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,960
and that's how the miracle of life occurred.

2174
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,360
Although I find, I'm very uncomfortable with that

2175
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:48,240
because actually, because life came so quickly

2176
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:49,280
in the earth's past.

2177
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:55,520
But that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere.

2178
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,760
It just might mean that the-

2179
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,080
Because chemistry is actually not a long-term thing.

2180
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,200
Chemistry can happen quickly.

2181
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,080
So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument

2182
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,880
to say, actually, the fact that life emerged quickly

2183
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,240
doesn't mean that life is easy.

2184
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:11,680
It just means that the chemistry was right on earth

2185
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:13,680
and earth is very special.

2186
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,320
And that's why there's no life anywhere else in the universe.

2187
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,800
Yeah. So Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.

2188
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,880
So what if that's the reason we're lucky

2189
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,600
is that we got to have a rare cascading

2190
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,840
of accelerating cascading effect

2191
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,760
in terms of the complexity of things.

2192
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,400
So maybe most of the universe is trying to get sticky

2193
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,280
with the memory and it's not able to really form it.

2194
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,960
And then we got really lucky in that.

2195
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,720
And there's a lot of earth-like conditions, let's say,

2196
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,960
but you really, really have to get lucky on this.

2197
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,080
But I'm doing experiments right now.

2198
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:56,400
In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on

2199
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,240
because we have some joint funding for this,

2200
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,720
where we're seeing that the universe can get sticky

2201
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:01,360
really quickly.

2202
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,320
Now, of course, we're being very anthropocentric.

2203
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,680
We're using laboratory tools.

2204
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:06,400
We're using theory.

2205
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,760
But actually, the phenomena of selection,

2206
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,360
the process of developing heterogeneity,

2207
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,040
we can do in the lab.

2208
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,600
We're just seeing the very first hints of it.

2209
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,440
And wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin down

2210
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:27,520
a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this,

2211
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,080
for the origin of life and the emergence of life,

2212
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,840
defining out what kind of chemistries

2213
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,120
we really need to look for.

2214
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:35,920
And I'm becoming increasingly confident

2215
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,760
we'll be able to do that in the next few years.

2216
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,480
Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab

2217
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,000
from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,

2218
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,600
from dead stuff, from moon.

2219
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,920
Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon,

2220
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:51,040
put it in our origin of life experiment

2221
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:54,000
and make moon life and restrict ourselves

2222
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,320
to interesting self-replicating stuff

2223
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,360
that we find on the moon?

2224
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,560
Sarah, what do you think about this approach

2225
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,040
of engineering life in order to understand life,

2226
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,760
so building life in the machine?

2227
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,240
Yeah.

2228
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,120
So, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now

2229
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:14,720
to build a vision for a large institute

2230
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,520
or experimental program basically to do this problem.

2231
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,960
But I think of it as like we need to simulate a planet.

2232
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,720
So, like the Large Hadron Collider

2233
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,480
was supposed to be simulating conditions

2234
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,600
just after the Big Bang.

2235
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,840
Lee's built a lot of technology in his lab

2236
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,000
to do these kind of selection engines.

2237
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,960
But the question you're asking is,

2238
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,800
how many experiments do you need to run?

2239
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,520
What volume of chemical space do you need to explore

2240
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,480
before you actually see an event?

2241
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,680
And I like to make an analogy

2242
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,520
to one of my favorite particle physics experiments

2243
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:44,800
which is super kamiakande

2244
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,480
that's looking for the decay of the proton.

2245
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,880
So, this is something that we predicted theoretically,

2246
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,560
but we've never observed in our universe.

2247
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,200
And basically what they're doing is every time

2248
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,200
they don't see a proton decay event,

2249
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,600
they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.

2250
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,640
So, imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind

2251
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:03,520
of trying to simulate planetary conditions,

2252
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,400
physically simulate.

2253
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,240
You can't simulate original life in the computer.

2254
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,520
You have to do it in an experiment.

2255
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,720
Simulate enough planetary conditions

2256
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,640
to explore the space of what's possible

2257
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,960
and bound the probability for an original life event.

2258
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,080
Even if you're not observing it,

2259
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,440
you can talk about the probability.

2260
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:23,200
But we, hopefully, life is not exponentially rare

2261
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,840
and we would then be able to evolve

2262
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:31,680
in an automated system alien life in the lab.

2263
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,720
And if we can do that,

2264
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,160
then we understand the physics

2265
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,360
as well as we understand

2266
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,880
what we can do in particle accelerators.

2267
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,920
So, keep expanding physically the simulation,

2268
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,560
the physical simulation until something happens.

2269
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,480
Yeah, or just build a big enough volume

2270
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,320
of chemical experiments and evolve them.

2271
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,800
So, if they say volume, you mean like literally volume.

2272
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,120
I mean physical volume in terms of space,

2273
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,320
but I actually mean volume

2274
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,160
in terms of the combinatorial space of chemistry.

2275
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,600
So, how do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,

2276
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,800
the search space, such that it's always like

2277
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,000
you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit.

2278
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,480
Yeah, how do you build a search engine for chemistry?

2279
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,520
I think you explained it really well.

2280
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,400
We should carry on doing this.

2281
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,600
I should pretend the physics,

2282
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,960
be the physicist, you be the chemist.

2283
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:18,720
So, the way to do it is I will always play a joke

2284
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:24,560
because I like writing grants to ask for money to do cool stuff.

2285
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,880
Years ago, I started wanting to build.

2286
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,560
So, I actually wanted the weather.

2287
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,800
So, I built this robot in my lab called the computer,

2288
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,200
which is this robot you can program to do chemistry.

2289
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,600
Now, I made a programming language for the computer

2290
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,280
and made it operate chemical equipment.

2291
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,920
Originally, I wrote grants to say,

2292
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,240
hey, I want to make an origin of life system.

2293
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,520
No one would give me any money for this.

2294
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,440
They said, what's this ridiculous?

2295
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,400
Why are you wanting to make?

2296
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,120
Oh, it's really hard.

2297
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:56,000
It takes forever.

2298
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,320
You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.

2299
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,520
Why would we give you any money?

2300
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,840
And so, I turned it around and said,

2301
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,440
can you instead, can you give me money to make robots,

2302
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,560
to make molecules?

2303
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,200
Oh, interesting.

2304
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,880
And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.

2305
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,520
And that's, so actually, the funny thing is the computer

2306
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,040
project, which I have in my lab,

2307
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,960
which is very briefly, it's just basically,

2308
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,960
it's like literally an automated test tube.

2309
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,880
And we've made a programming language for the test tube,

2310
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:23,440
which is cool.

2311
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:28,560
Has come, has literally came from this.

2312
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,760
I went to my lab one day and said,

2313
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,080
I want to make a search engine to get the origin of life

2314
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,440
because I don't have a planet.

2315
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,080
And I thought about doing it in a microfluidic format.

2316
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,240
So microfluidic is very nano chat,

2317
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,720
very small channels in device where you can basically

2318
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,840
have all the pipes produced by lithography.

2319
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,600
And you can have a chamber, maybe say,

2320
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,400
between say 10 and 100 microns in volume.

2321
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,920
And we slot them all together like Lego.

2322
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,720
And we can make an origin of life system.

2323
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:54,640
And I could never get it to work.

2324
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:59,600
And I realized I had to make do chemistry at the kind of test

2325
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,240
tube level.

2326
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,120
And what you want to be able to do,

2327
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,320
yeah, it goes back to that tweet, 1981.

2328
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,520
1981, the computer, we're looking at a tweet from Lee.

2329
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,720
In 1981, the computer was a distant dream.

2330
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,920
Oh, wow, this is the scientist looking back.

2331
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,200
It is the young boy who dreamed.

2332
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:24,000
In 2018, it was realized, spelled in the British way, realized.

2333
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,760
Yeah, I'm starting to say it, but not.

2334
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,120
So now there's a system that does the physical manifestation

2335
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:37,040
of whatever the programming language, the spec, tells you to do.

2336
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,920
Yeah, well, in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.

2337
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,520
Well, what was the computer?

2338
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,560
ZX81.

2339
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,080
ZX81.

2340
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,920
Sinclair ZX81.

2341
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,840
It was, and I got a chemistry set.

2342
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,760
And I like, I like the chemistry set.

2343
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,280
And I like the computer.

2344
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,800
And I just wanted to put them together.

2345
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,960
I thought wouldn't it be cool if I could use the computer

2346
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,080
to control the chemistry set.

2347
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,640
And obviously that was insane.

2348
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:04,240
And I was like, you know, eight years old, right?

2349
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,000
Nine years old, going on nine years old.

2350
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:13,440
And then I invented the computer just because I wanted to build

2351
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,600
this origin of life grid, right?

2352
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,720
Which is like, literally a billion test tubes connected together

2353
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:23,280
in real time and real space, basically throwing a chemical dice.

2354
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:24,640
Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.

2355
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:25,520
You're going to get lucky.

2356
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,480
And that's what we, I think Sarah and I have been thinking very deeply about.

2357
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:36,960
Because, you know, there's more money being spent on the origin of the gravity

2358
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,520
or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?

2359
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,680
And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question,

2360
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:46,160
or not the biggest question, it is a big question.

2361
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:46,800
Let's put it that way.

2362
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,000
What is the biggest question?

2363
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,960
You're okay saying that.

2364
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,400
Okay, all right.

2365
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,880
Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life

2366
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,080
that that's not going to solve?

2367
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,360
That's not actually going to solve the question of what is life?

2368
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,560
Like, because you're kind of putting a lot of...

2369
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,040
I don't think so, yeah.

2370
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,480
I think that's the same problem.

2371
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,400
But you're putting, is it possible that you're putting too many,

2372
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,920
too much bets into this origin part?

2373
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,320
Maybe the origin thing isn't, isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?

2374
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,600
Isn't it a stack of turtles?

2375
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,600
Because then if you create it in the lab, maybe you need some other stuff.

2376
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,640
Well, that's not the thing about the origin.

2377
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:27,120
Like you, like in the lab, there's still memory.

2378
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,080
Yeah, yes.

2379
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:28,480
Right.

2380
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:31,600
The experiment is already the product of evolution.

2381
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,000
Right.

2382
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,800
And some may be really deep way, not an obvious way,

2383
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,000
in some very deep way.

2384
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,520
So maybe the haters are always going to be like,

2385
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,000
well, you have to reconstruct the fold.

2386
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,640
They have to build a different score.

2387
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:45,280
Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware of that argument.

2388
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,000
Well, no, I know, I just...

2389
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,760
We're the one making that argument usually.

2390
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,320
I just think that if we create life in the lab,

2391
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:59,360
it's not obvious that you'll get to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily,

2392
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,960
what is the line between life and non-life?

2393
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:03,520
No, I think so.

2394
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,880
Look, there's so much here.

2395
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,240
I'm just saying, playing double.

2396
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:06,800
So much here.

2397
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,320
But let me play doubles back in a previous conversation, right?

2398
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:14,240
And say, yeah, I will.

2399
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:14,640
Why not?

2400
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:14,960
Why not?

2401
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,280
I've got time.

2402
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:15,920
Yeah, let's go.

2403
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,960
Seller Automata.

2404
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:17,280
Yes.

2405
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:23,120
Seller Automata, these very simple things where you color squares,

2406
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,560
black or white, and implement rules and play them in time,

2407
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:30,800
and you can get these very complex patterns coming out.

2408
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,680
There's nice rules.

2409
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,040
They're true and complete rules.

2410
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:41,520
And I would argue that Seller Automata don't really exist on their own.

2411
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,400
They have to exist in a computing device.

2412
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,440
If that were there's computing devices, a piece of paper and abstraction,

2413
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:52,400
a mathematician drawing a grid, or a framework.

2414
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,320
Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things, simple, going complex,

2415
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:02,080
but the complexity is all borrowed from the lithography, the numbers.

2416
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:03,760
Right.

2417
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:08,960
Now, let's take that same argument with the chemistry experiment origin of life.

2418
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,400
What you need to be able to do is go out,

2419
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:16,880
and I'm inspired to do this, to go out and look for CAs occur in nature.

2420
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:23,920
Let's find some CAs that just emerge in our universe.

2421
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:29,120
For people just to start to interrupt, for people just listening in general,

2422
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,040
I think what we're looking at is a Seller Automata, where again, as Lee described,

2423
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:40,160
there is just binary black or white squares, and they only have local information,

2424
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,200
they're born and they die. You would think nothing interesting would emerge,

2425
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:49,120
but actually what we're looking at is something that I believe is called glider guns,

2426
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:58,000
or a glider gun, which is moving objects in this multi-cell space that look like their organisms,

2427
01:42:58,640 --> 01:43:05,040
that have much more information, that have much more complexity than the individual building

2428
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,600
in fact look like they have a long-term memory, while the individual components

2429
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,960
don't seem like they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.

2430
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:19,680
Yes, the argument here is that has to exist on all this layer of infrastructure,

2431
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:23,680
right, and though it looks simple, and then what I would make if I were you,

2432
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:28,560
say, well, I think CAs are really simple and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge

2433
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,920
and substrate. Now, let's go to the origin of life, machine. I don't think we want to do the

2434
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:39,280
origin of life, just any origin is good. So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker,

2435
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,600
shake the sand, like massive grid of chemistry experiments, shaking sand, shaking whatever,

2436
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,480
and then because we know what we've put in, so we know where, how we've cheated,

2437
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,800
and the same way with CA, we know how we've cheated, we know what the,

2438
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,840
we know the number of operations needed, we know how big a grid we want to get this,

2439
01:43:54,560 --> 01:44:02,320
if we could then say, okay, how can we generate this recipe in the lab and make a life form,

2440
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:08,000
what were the, what contingency did we need to put in, and we're up front about how we cheated,

2441
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:13,040
okay, say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic, planet rotates,

2442
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,480
it's tried, comes in and out, so, and then we can start to basically say, okay, how

2443
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:24,720
difficult is it for these features to be found, and then we can look for exoplanets and other

2444
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:29,280
features, so I think Sarah's absolutely right, we want to explain to people we're cheating,

2445
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:33,040
in fact, we have to cheat, no one has given, I'm good at writing grants, I used to be,

2446
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,720
I'm not very good right now, I keep getting rejected, but writing a grant for a planet

2447
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:41,760
in 100 million years, no grant fund there is going to give me that, but maybe money to make a kind

2448
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:49,040
of a grid, a computer grid, origin of life, computer grid, in physical space, and just do it.

2449
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:56,240
So Sarah said something which is, you can't simulate the origin of life in a computer,

2450
01:44:56,240 --> 01:45:04,160
so like in simulation, why not? You said it very confidently, so is it possible,

2451
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,160
and why would it be very difficult? What's your intuition there?

2452
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:13,920
I think it's very difficult right now because we don't know the physics, but if you go based on

2453
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:18,480
principles of assembly theory and you think every molecule is actually a very large causal graph,

2454
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,640
not just the molecule, then you have to simulate all the features of those causal graphs, and I

2455
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:26,080
think it becomes computationally intractable, you might as well just build the experiment.

2456
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,360
Because you have, in the physical space, you have all the objects with all the memories,

2457
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,920
and in a computer you would have to copy them reconstruct.

2458
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:43,440
That's a beautiful put, and I would say that lots of people, you just don't have enough

2459
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:49,680
resources, it's easier to actually do the physical experiment, because we are literally,

2460
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,440
I would view the physical experiment almost like a computational experiment,

2461
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:58,800
we're just outsourcing, it's just basically we're just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.

2462
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:04,800
On your point about the experiment being also an example of life, it's almost like you want to

2463
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,160
design, it's like, you know, all of us are lineages of propagating information across time,

2464
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:14,000
and so everything we do becomes part of life because it's part of that causal chain,

2465
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
so it's like you want to try to pinch off as much as you can of the information from your

2466
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,640
causal chain that goes into the experiment, but you can't pinch off all of it to move it to like

2467
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,920
a different timeline, it's always going to be part of your timeline, but at least if you can

2468
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,840
control how much information you put in, you can try to see how much does that particular

2469
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:35,920
trajectory you set up start generating its own assembly, so you know where it starts,

2470
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,080
and then you want to try to see it take off on its own when you try to pinch it off as much as

2471
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:49,840
possible. Got it. Quick pause, bath and break. Yes. All right, cool. And now we're back. All right,

2472
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,120
we talked about the early days of the universe when there was just stuff and no memory,

2473
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,480
not even causality, I think Lee at least implied the causality is emergent somehow,

2474
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:08,720
we could discuss this. What happened before this all originated? What's outside the universe?

2475
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:17,760
Divide by zero. Okay, so it's not relevant, not understandable. Is it useful to even ask the

2476
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:25,520
question? No. Because it's so hard? No, it's not hard, it's just not a question. If I can't do an

2477
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:30,800
experiment or even think of an experiment, the question doesn't exist. Well, no, you can't think

2478
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:36,800
of a lot of experiments, no offense. What I mean is I can't- Because your causality graph is like

2479
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:44,720
this is what we've been talking about. It's like there is limits to your ability to construct

2480
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:49,440
experiments. I agree, but I was trying to be facetious and I'm trying to make a point because I

2481
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:59,360
think that if there is a causal bottleneck through which information can't propagate in principle,

2482
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,600
then it's very hard to think of an experiment, even in principle, even one that's beyond my

2483
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:12,080
mediocre intellect, which is fine. I'm happy to accept that. But this is one of the things I

2484
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:16,880
actually do think there was something before the Big Bang because I would say that I think

2485
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:22,320
the Big Bang just couldn't occur and create time. Time created the Big Bang. There was time

2486
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:29,120
before the Big Bang. Yeah. There was no space, but there was time. Yeah. I'm just making that

2487
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,440
stuff up just to make all the physicists happy, but I think it's- You think that would make them

2488
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:37,920
happy because they would be quite upset, actually. Why would they be upset? Because they would say

2489
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:44,000
that time can't exist before the Big Bang. Yeah. I mean, this goes back to an argument that you

2490
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:49,120
might not want to have the argument here. I was talking to Sarah earlier today about an argument

2491
01:48:49,120 --> 01:48:55,920
we had about time a long time ago, a long time and time. I think there is this thing called

2492
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,240
time or state creation. The universe is creating states and it's outside of space,

2493
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,200
but they create space. What I mean is you can imagine there are states being created all the

2494
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:11,280
time and there is this thing called time. Time is a clock, which you can use to measure when

2495
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:16,160
things happen, but that doesn't mean because you can't measure something that states aren't being

2496
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:24,800
created. You might locally refer to the Big Bang and the Big Bang occurred at some point

2497
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:29,920
in when those states were there. Probably there had to be enough states for the Big Bang to occur.

2498
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,960
But I think that there is something wrong with our conception of how the universe was created

2499
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:43,680
in the Big Bang because we don't really get time because, again, I don't want to become

2500
01:49:43,680 --> 01:49:51,680
boring and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing. Until I can really explain that

2501
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:56,000
more elegantly, I'm just going to get into more trouble. We're going to talk about time because

2502
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:01,200
time is a useful measure in device for experiments, but also time is an idea.

2503
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:07,120
But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think? Is it a useful question to ask what happened

2504
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,720
before the Big Bang? Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?

2505
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:20,800
I would think about it as the Big Bang is an event that we reconstructed as probably happening

2506
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:25,760
in the past of our universe based on current observational data. The way I like to think about

2507
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:35,760
it is we exist locally in something called the universe. Going back to the physics of existence,

2508
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:41,520
we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist. We can infer certain properties of

2509
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:46,000
the structure of where we exist locally. One of the properties that we've inferred in the past

2510
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:52,800
is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang. There's some signatures of our local environment

2511
01:50:52,800 --> 01:51:00,480
that indicate that there was a very low information event that started our universe. I think that's

2512
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:08,720
actually just an artifact of the structure of the assembly space that when you start losing

2513
01:51:08,720 --> 01:51:14,560
all the memory in the objects, it looks like what we call a Big Bang. I think it makes sense to talk

2514
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:20,160
about where you are locally. I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities,

2515
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:24,640
what could exist outside the universe, in the sense that they become part of our reasoning

2516
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:31,600
and therefore part of our causal chain of things that we can do. The multiverse in my mind exists,

2517
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:35,360
but it doesn't exist as a multiverse of possibility universe. It exists as an

2518
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:39,120
idea in our minds that allows us to reason about how physics works and then to do physics

2519
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:47,040
differently because we reason about it that way. I always like to recenter it on things exist,

2520
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:52,000
but they don't always exist like we think they exist. When we're thinking about things outside

2521
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,160
the universe, they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them, but they don't look like

2522
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:00,560
the projections in our mind. There's something else.

2523
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,800
Something you said just gave me an idea to go back to your question. If

2524
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:12,080
something caused the Big Bang, if there was some memory or some artifact of that,

2525
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:16,560
then of course, to answer your question, it's worth going back to that because that would imply

2526
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:20,720
there is something beyond that barrier, that filter. That's what you were saying, I guess.

2527
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,600
I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe. I just don't think that. I think the most

2528
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:30,960
interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more,

2529
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:36,960
like that optimism. I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask as being scientific ones because

2530
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:42,720
I find that that's where the most creative potential is to impact the future trajectory of

2531
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:47,040
what we're doing on this planet. The interesting thing about the Big Bang is basically from our

2532
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:52,640
current perspective of what we're able to detect, it's the time when things were forgotten.

2533
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:59,440
Yes. It's the time the reset from our limited perspective. The question is,

2534
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:06,960
is it useful to ever study the thing that was forgotten? Or should we focus just on the

2535
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,080
memories that are still there? The point I was trying to make about the experiment

2536
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:14,160
is I was trying to say both things. I think perhaps, yes, from the pot following point of view,

2537
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:20,080
if you could then imagine what was forgotten and then work forwards, you will have different

2538
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:25,440
consequences. Then it becomes testable. As long as we can find tests, then it's definitely worth

2539
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:29,440
thinking about. What I don't like is when physicists say, what happened before the Big

2540
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:37,120
Bang and before, before, before, without giving me any credible conjecture about how would we

2541
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:42,640
know the difference? The way you framed it is quite nice. I like that. It's like, what have we forgotten?

2542
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:48,240
Is there a room for God in assembly theory? Who's God?

2543
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,920
I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.

2544
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,160
What's a necessary being? Something that has to exist.

2545
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:02,080
Oh, I mean, you like the shortest path. Does God need-

2546
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:09,760
No, no, no. You can go back to Thomas Aquinas and arguments for the existence of God. I think

2547
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:14,800
most of the interesting theological arguments are always about whether something has to exist,

2548
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:19,200
or there was a first thing that had to exist. I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those

2549
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:28,400
kind of arguments. God here meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff.

2550
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,480
What I was trying to say earlier is that- Isn't that just the universe?

2551
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:39,440
Yeah, yeah. There's a difference between- I imagine a black box, like a machine.

2552
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:43,360
Yeah. Then I would be more comfortable calling that God,

2553
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:47,600
because it's a machine. You go into a room and there's a thing with a button.

2554
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,840
Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version.

2555
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:57,280
Yeah, but if it's more kind of- I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,

2556
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:06,160
if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God, that generates a bunch of stuff.

2557
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:13,600
But if there's a machine that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,

2558
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:20,960
then that feels like God. In terms of terminology. I wonder if there's a machine

2559
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,000
that's required to generate this universe. That's very important for running this in the lab.

2560
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,640
So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier that I can't remember the phrase,

2561
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:36,000
but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe? Yes. Where does God exist?

2562
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:43,760
God at least exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly people who have religious

2563
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:47,440
faith they believe in. But let's then take your- But you're talking a little bit more

2564
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:52,160
about generics. Say, well, is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God? I would

2565
01:55:52,160 --> 01:56:00,240
say God did not exist at the beginning, but he or she does now. Because I'm saying the

2566
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:05,680
mechanism- Well, you don't know if he didn't exist in the beginning. So this could be us

2567
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:12,480
in our minds trying to just listen to gravitational waves, detecting gravitational waves. It's the

2568
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:19,120
same thing. Us trying to go back further and further into our memories to try to understand

2569
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:28,320
the machines that make up us. And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of

2570
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:35,520
what kind of machines could create. There's always a tweet. There's always a tweet.

2571
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:41,040
If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it because computers need creators.

2572
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:48,480
There you go. And then Yoshibah replied, since there's something rather than nothing,

2573
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:56,320
perhaps existence is the default. If existence is the default that many computers exist,

2574
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:01,600
creator gods are necessary computers and necessarily computers too. I'm very confused by

2575
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:05,680
that. But that's an interesting idea that existence is a default versus non-existence.

2576
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:11,200
I agree with that, but the rest is- And then Lee responds, perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.

2577
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:17,600
That's how scientists talk trash each other on Twitter apparently. Which part don't you agree with?

2578
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:22,800
When he said if existence is a default, then many computers exist. This comes back to the

2579
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:29,040
inventor and discovery argument. I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable

2580
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:35,440
of computation because there wasn't enough technology, enough states. So what you're

2581
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:41,680
saying is if God is a mechanism, so I might actually agree, but then the thing is lots of

2582
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:47,600
people see God is more than a mechanism. For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory

2583
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:52,320
that creates all the stuff that the memories we know. And the fact that we can even relate to

2584
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:57,120
each other is because we have the same. We share that heritage and why we love each other or we

2585
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:05,440
like to see God in each other is it's just we know we have a shared existence. So if the

2586
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:10,560
God is the mechanism that created this whole thing, I think a lot of people see God in a

2587
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:18,080
religious sense as that mechanism also being able to communicate with the objects it creates.

2588
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:23,520
And if it's just the mechanism, we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates.

2589
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:30,960
It can only interact with the... Well, there's versions of God that create the universe and then

2590
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:40,000
left. Yeah, like spark. For some religions. The first spark. Yeah, but I think I liked your analogy

2591
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:48,800
of the machine and the rules. But I think part of the problem is we have this conception that we

2592
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:53,440
can disentangle the rules from the physical substrate and that's the whole thing about software

2593
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:58,480
and hardware being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws that they exist outside the universe.

2594
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,360
They're not actually a feature of the universe. They don't have to merge out of the universe

2595
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:08,480
itself. So I think if you merged your two views, then it gets back to the God as the universe.

2596
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:12,160
And then I think the deeper question is why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?

2597
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:18,000
And if I think about the features of the universe that give it the most meaning and purpose, those

2598
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,560
are what we would call the living components of the universe. So if you wanted to say,

2599
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,560
God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an emergent property of our minds,

2600
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:32,480
but I would just say the way the universe creates meaning and purpose, there is really a physics

2601
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:37,040
there. It's not like a illusory thing and that is just what the physics of life is.

2602
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:44,160
So is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?

2603
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:52,400
So basically, whatever God is that mechanism, we just leave parts of that behind.

2604
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:56,800
But the universe is constantly generating itself. So if God is that mechanism, it would be that

2605
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:05,040
that would still be active today. I'm agnostic, but if I would call the things I believe in God

2606
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:12,160
in the way that some people talk about God, I would say that God is like in the universe now.

2607
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:19,120
It's not an absent thing. So I think there's a mislabeling here, because you're, I mean,

2608
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:28,800
I mean, I'm a professional idiot, actually. But you should put that on your CV.

2609
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,720
Professionally, not recreationally or amateur, but professionally.

2610
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,360
I think so. I would say if you were talking about God, I mean, again, I'm way out,

2611
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:43,760
way out of my depth here, and I'm almost feeling, you know, I feel quite uncomfortable articulating,

2612
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:49,200
but I'll try. For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness of reasoning entity that

2613
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:56,080
actually has causal power. And you're human like intelligence. And so you're like,

2614
02:00:56,080 --> 02:01:00,000
then you're saying like gravity could be God or time could be God. I mean, I think for me,

2615
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:06,080
for my conception of time is probably as fundamental as God, because it gave rise to human

2616
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:10,160
intelligence and consciousness in which we can have this abstract notion of God.

2617
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:19,360
So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very mechanistic kind of unsophisticated sense,

2618
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,480
whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated and got all this, you know,

2619
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:28,480
feelings and love and, you know, and this abstracting ability. So is that what,

2620
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:34,080
or do you mean that? Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that decided to flick the universe

2621
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:44,640
into existence? Well, one of the features that God would have is the ability to flick the universe

2622
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:52,080
into existence. I, you know, like Windows 95, I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP

2623
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:58,000
or Windows 10. I don't know the full feature set. Okay. So the very least you have to flick

2624
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:05,040
the universe into existence. And then other features might include ability to interact with

2625
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:11,360
that universe in interesting ways. And then how do you interact with the universe in interesting

2626
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:16,320
ways? You have to be able to speak the language of its different components. So in order to interact

2627
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:25,920
with humans, you have to know how to act human like. So, so I don't, I don't know.

2628
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:38,240
But it seems like whatever mechanism created the universe might want to also generate

2629
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:44,000
local pockets of mechanisms that can interact with that. Like, inject.

2630
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:49,600
God was lonely. Yeah, it was long. I mean, it could be just a teenager and another

2631
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:54,400
just playing a video game. Yeah, maybe. Well, I was going to say, I mean, I, I don't,

2632
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:59,040
so this is referring to our origin of life engine. It's like, I, I don't believe in God,

2633
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:03,440
but that doesn't mean I don't want to be one. Right. Because I want to make a universe and

2634
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:07,440
make a life form. But that maybe, that may be rude to people who have, you know,

2635
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,440
dear religious beliefs. What I mean by that is,

2636
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:17,280
isn't it, if we are able to create an entirely new life form, different chemistry, different culture,

2637
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:23,120
what does it make up and makes us good? By that definition, it makes us gods, right?

2638
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:27,360
Well, there is. I mean, like when you have children, you're like one of the magical

2639
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,320
things of that is your kind of mini gods. I mean, first of all,

2640
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:34,480
from a child's perspective, parents are gods for quite a while.

2641
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:40,160
And then you, I mean, they're, in the positive sense, there's a magic to that. That's why I love

2642
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:44,240
robotics, is you instill life into something. And that makes you,

2643
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:51,520
feel God like, you know, sort of positive way. Being a creator is a positive thing.

2644
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:55,360
A creator. Yeah, exactly. And a small scale. And then God is, would be

2645
02:03:56,080 --> 02:04:02,800
a creator at the largest possible scale, I suppose. Okay. You mentioned offline the

2646
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,920
Assembletron. Assembletron?

2647
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:07,360
Assembletron. Yep.

2648
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:12,160
What's an assembly? These are the, this is an early idea of something you're thinking about.

2649
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:16,240
So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team are interested in

2650
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,600
using AI to understand life. My team is, and I'm, and I'm wondering if we could apply the

2651
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:29,680
principles of assembly theory, that is, the causal structure that you get with assembly theory,

2652
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:36,800
and hybridize it and make a new type of neuron, if you like. I mean, there are causal neural

2653
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:41,840
networks out there, but they are, they are not quite the architecture, like what I would like.

2654
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:47,520
I would like to associate memory bits with, basically, I'd like to make a,

2655
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:53,760
rather than having an ASIC for neural networks, I want to make an ASIC for assembly networks.

2656
02:04:54,320 --> 02:05:01,680
Right. And so can you say that again, assembly networks? So what, what is a,

2657
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:07,360
sort of like a thing with an input and output? And it's like a neural network type of thing.

2658
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,680
What does it do exactly? What's the input? What's the output?

2659
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:13,600
So in this case, so if you're talking about a general neural network, I mean,

2660
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:17,680
general neural network, you can train it on also any sort of data, right,

2661
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:25,200
depending on the framework, whether it's like text or, or image data or whatnot.

2662
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:31,440
And that's fine. But there's no causal structure associated with that data. Now,

2663
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:35,440
just imagine, rather than, you know, let's say we're in a classified difference between cat and

2664
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:40,400
the dog, right, classic cat and dog neural network. What about if the system understood

2665
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:48,080
the assembly space to create the cat and the dog? And rather than guessing what was happening and

2666
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:54,640
training on those images and not understanding those features, it, it, you almost like you could

2667
02:05:54,640 --> 02:06:00,880
imagine doing a, going back a step and doing an, and training, going back a step and doing a training,

2668
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:05,840
going back a step, back a step, back a step. And, and I wonder if that is actually the origin of

2669
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:11,680
intelligence or how we'll crack intelligence, because we need to, because we'll, we'll create

2670
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:18,640
the entire graph of events and, and be able to kind of look at cause and effect across those

2671
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:23,680
graphs. I'm explaining it really badly, but it's a, it's a gene of an idea. And I'm guessing

2672
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:27,920
very smart, very rich people in AI already doing this.

2673
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:34,960
Trying to not generate cats and dogs, but trying to generate things of high assembly index.

2674
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:41,360
Yeah. And I think, I think, and, and, and also using causal graphs in neural networks and machine

2675
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:45,200
learning and deep learning, maybe building a new architecture. I'm just wondering,

2676
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:48,720
is there something we can get out of assembly theory allows us to rebuild

2677
02:06:48,720 --> 02:06:55,040
current machine learning architectures to give more, give causation more cheaply? I mean,

2678
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:58,720
I don't know if that's what you're, we've been inventing this for a little while, but we're

2679
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:01,440
trying to finish the theory paper first before we do anything else.

2680
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:07,200
Yeah. You also want to have, say, goal directed behavior in neural networks. Then assembly theory

2681
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:10,880
is a good framework for doing that. Daniel's been thinking about that a lot. And I think it's a

2682
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:17,040
really interesting idea that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn to think about

2683
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:21,280
goal directed behavior as a learning process, that you're learning a specific goal. The

2684
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:25,120
universe is learning a goal when it generates a particular structure and that you can map that

2685
02:07:25,120 --> 02:07:29,680
physical structure in a neural network. How, what's the goal?

2686
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:38,320
Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal in, in biology. I mean, you know,

2687
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:41,680
people are not supposed to use teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,

2688
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:48,720
but because goals are real things, they're just post-selected. So you can talk about goals after

2689
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:54,640
the fact. You know, once a goal emerges in the universe, that physical entity has a goal.

2690
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:59,520
But Lee and I came up with a test for, like a Turing test for goal directed behavior

2691
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:03,920
based on the idea of assembly. Like, we have to formalize it still, but I would like to write

2692
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:09,360
a paper on it. But like, the basic idea is like, if you, like, if you had two systems that were

2693
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:15,920
completely equivalent, you know, like in the instantaneous, like physical experimental setup,

2694
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:20,160
so Lee has to figure out how to do this. But there was something that would be different in their

2695
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:25,200
future. And there was a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility,

2696
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:29,680
that future outcome, then you could say that that system had some representation of, of,

2697
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:35,120
of some kind of goal in mind about what it wanted to do in the future. And I, so, so goals are

2698
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:40,480
interesting because they don't exist as instantaneous things. They exist across time, which is one,

2699
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:46,480
one of the reasons that assembly theories may be more naturally able to account for the existence

2700
02:08:46,480 --> 02:08:54,080
of goals. So goals are the only existent time, or they manifest themselves in time

2701
02:08:55,120 --> 02:09:03,120
through, you said, symmetry breaking. So it's almost like, imagine, like, if representations in

2702
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:09,200
your mind are real, right? And you can imagine future possibilities, but imagine everything

2703
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:14,320
else is physically equivalent. And the only thing that you actually change your decision based on

2704
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:20,080
is what you model as being the future outcome. Then somehow that representation in your mind

2705
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:24,320
of the future outcome becomes causal to what you're doing now. So it's kind of like retrocausal effect.

2706
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:29,120
But it's not actually retrocausal. It's just that your, your assembly space is actually

2707
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:33,600
includes those possibilities as, as part of the structure. It's just you're not observing all

2708
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:37,600
the features, the assembly space in the current moment. Well, the possibilities exist, but they

2709
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:44,160
don't become a goal until they realize. So, so one of the features of assembly space that's

2710
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:49,760
super interesting, and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example, is if you're thinking

2711
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,000
about an assembly space, you can't observe the entire assembly space in any instant in time. So

2712
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,560
if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you want to look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos,

2713
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:02,800
you have to break the Legos apart. And then you look, and then you look at all the possible

2714
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:07,520
ways of building up the original object. So now you have in your mind the goal of building

2715
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:12,240
that object, and you have all the possible ways of doing it. And those are actual physical features

2716
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:16,960
of that object, but that object doesn't always exist. What exists is the possibility of generating

2717
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:22,720
it. And the possibilities are always infinite. Well, for that particular object, you know,

2718
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:26,720
like, you know, it has a well-defined assembly space. And I guess what I'm saying is that

2719
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:32,320
object is the assembly space, but you actually have to unpack that object across time to view that

2720
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:39,600
feature of it. It's only an observable across time. The term goal is such a important and

2721
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:45,680
difficult to explain concept, right? Because what you want is a way is like, I think only conscious

2722
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:52,720
beings can have conscious goals. Everything else is doing selection. And but selection does

2723
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:59,520
invent goals. And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past in the present

2724
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:06,240
is kind of helps you to understand there was a goal in the past now, right? It's kind of like

2725
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:14,720
goals only exist back in time. So first of all, only conscious beings can have

2726
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:22,720
conscious goals. I'm not even going to touch that one. Why? Go for it. Come on.

2727
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:30,960
The line between conscious goals and non-conscious goals, exactly. And also maybe just on top of that,

2728
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:38,960
you said a touring test for goal-directed behavior. What is a touring test potentially look like?

2729
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,800
So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this. So we actually got some funding to

2730
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:47,600
work together on two teams. So I'm trying to do, and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory

2731
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:51,520
and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory. And Sarah is trying to design experiments and I'm

2732
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:56,560
teaching experiments. Because I think it's really good for us to have that. So say, when would a,

2733
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,120
so that's good. I like this, this, I'm sure we use the Dan Dennett essay.

2734
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:06,240
Yeah. And I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a touring test after, but yeah. So Dan

2735
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:11,600
Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and free will inflation.

2736
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:13,840
The title is so brilliant.

2737
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,520
It's the actual title. I think so.

2738
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:18,000
Herding cats and free will inflation.

2739
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,640
Yeah. Something like that. I mean, it's not maybe not. And so,

2740
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:21,440
No, I think that's right.

2741
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:24,640
So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hillside.

2742
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:30,000
Okay. And it just happens to be a snowy hill. And let's just say you see an object go rolling

2743
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:35,600
down the hill. Or you, you, you, you, and the rock will go rolls downhill. The start goes to the end.

2744
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:40,160
How do you know objects had a goal? Now you unveil the object and you'll see it's actually

2745
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:46,640
a skier. And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom. Great. Then you look at the rock.

2746
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:50,320
Rock rolls down the hill and gets the bottom. How can you tell the difference between the two?

2747
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:55,440
So, and what Dan says is like, well, this, it's clear the skiers in control

2748
02:12:56,240 --> 02:13:00,480
and the, and because they're adjusting the trajectory system updating going on.

2749
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:03,520
Then the only way you can really do that is you have to put the skier back to the top of the hill

2750
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:08,720
again. They tend to start roughly in the same space and probably go to take all that complex

2751
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:12,880
set of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right? With plus or minus

2752
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,360
few meters. Whereas if it's just a random rock going down to random trajectory, that wouldn't

2753
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:22,240
happen. And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing when we were writing this grant, we're like,

2754
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:29,040
we need to somehow instantiate the skier and the rock in the experiment and then say, okay,

2755
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:34,480
when is the object, when it, so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update, it has to

2756
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:41,440
have some sensing and some kind of, you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment.

2757
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:46,160
And, and then we just have to iterate on that. And maybe Sarah, you can influence the cheering

2758
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:50,720
test part. Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was slightly different. So I get really

2759
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:55,440
frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most people do. You know, a lot of people are,

2760
02:13:56,080 --> 02:14:01,120
which is not necessarily related to, to free will directly or to this goal directed behavior. But I

2761
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:06,880
think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics here. But I think for me, I was, you know,

2762
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:11,520
everybody's always interested in explaining intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic

2763
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:16,240
experience. And there's all sorts of problems with that. Because you can never actually be

2764
02:14:16,240 --> 02:14:19,360
another physical system. So you can't know what it's like to be another physical system.

2765
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:24,960
So I always thought there must be some way of getting at this problem about if an agent or an

2766
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:29,920
entity is conscious, or at least has internal representations. And those are real physical

2767
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:38,160
things that there, it must have causal consequences. So the way I would ask the question of consciousness

2768
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:42,960
is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically? But if, if things have intrinsic experience,

2769
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:48,160
is there any observable difference from the outside about the kind of causation that that

2770
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:52,960
physical system would enact in? And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do is have

2771
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:58,080
imaginations. So like we can imagine rocket centuries before we build them, they become real

2772
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:02,400
physical things because we imagine them. And people might disentangle that from conscious

2773
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:06,880
experience. But I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do is actually a conscious process.

2774
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:13,680
So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems, and I said, one had an internal

2775
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:18,480
representation, which is slightly different than a conscious experience, obviously. So I'm entangling

2776
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:24,720
some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought experiments. Then how, and I, and I set them up

2777
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:30,800
in a physically equivalent situation, would it be the case that there would be

2778
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:37,360
experimental observables associated with it? And that, that became the idea of trying to

2779
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:41,840
actually measure for internal representation and consciousness. So Turing basically didn't want

2780
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:45,920
to do that. You just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior,

2781
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:51,760
but never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that. And I guess

2782
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:56,720
I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually test for

2783
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:02,720
that? For the imagination that led to the. That there was something internal going on,

2784
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:09,520
some kind of inner world, as people say, but I, or you could say, you know, like it actually is an

2785
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:14,800
agent, it's making decisions, it has an internal representation. And whether you say that's

2786
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,360
experience or not is a different thing. But at least the feature that there's some abstraction

2787
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:23,120
it's doing, that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates.

2788
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:26,480
Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing? One of the compelling things about the

2789
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:32,800
Turing test is that, you know, defining intelligent, defining any complicated concept as,

2790
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:40,400
as a thing, like observing it from the surface and not caring about what's going on deep inside,

2791
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:46,320
because how do you know? That's the point. So the idea is exactly that. So what we're trying to do,

2792
02:16:46,320 --> 02:16:51,040
the Turing test for goal directiveness is literally take some objects that clearly don't

2793
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:55,200
have an internal representation, grains of sand blowing on the beach or something, right?

2794
02:16:55,760 --> 02:17:01,200
And I know a crab wandering around on the beach. And then generating an experiment where we

2795
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:06,320
literally the experiment generates an entity that literally has no internal representation

2796
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:10,800
to sand, like a drop, these are oil droplets, actually, what got in mind, a robot that makes

2797
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:15,360
oil droplets. But then what we want to try and do is train the oil droplets to be like crabs.

2798
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,840
Give them an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information from the

2799
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:29,840
environment. So they understand, they remember the past, are in the present, and can imagine a

2800
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:35,680
future and a very limited way they're kind of game engine, their limited simulation of the world

2801
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:39,280
allows them to then make a decision. Your objects across time.

2802
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:44,560
So then you would run a bunch of crabs, like over and over and over and over.

2803
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:45,680
How many crabs, Lee?

2804
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:52,560
Because you have to have a large number of crabs. What does your theory say? Is there a mathematical?

2805
02:17:52,560 --> 02:17:54,160
We're working on it. I mean, this is literally-

2806
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:55,760
Limit, crab limit.

2807
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:56,960
There's literally a-

2808
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:57,520
Excellent.

2809
02:17:57,520 --> 02:17:58,560
There's literally-

2810
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:01,840
What's the herding cats have to do? Oh, that's random. Wait, what's cats?

2811
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:06,400
In the title by Daniel Dennett, Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation.

2812
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:10,800
What does herding cats mean? What does free will inflation mean?

2813
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:16,640
I love this essay, because it explained to me how I could live in a deterministic universe,

2814
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:26,720
but have- not free will, but have freedom, you know, and also helped me explain that

2815
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:30,800
time needed to be a real thing in this universe.

2816
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:36,640
So what basically Dan was saying here is like, these cats appear to just do what they want,

2817
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:42,560
right? And if you live in a deterministic universe, why do the cats do these things?

2818
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,800
You know, aren't they just- isn't this all obvious?

2819
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:48,640
And how does free will inflate the universe?

2820
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:53,680
And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay because my interpretation of the essay

2821
02:18:53,680 --> 02:19:01,520
in assembly theory makes complete sense, because you need an expanding universe in assembly theory

2822
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:08,960
to create novelty that you search for that then when you find something interesting

2823
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:12,080
and you keep doing it because it's cool and it gives you an advantage,

2824
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:15,360
then it appears in the past to be a goal.

2825
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:19,520
So what does in assembly theory, the expansion of the universe look like?

2826
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:26,480
What are we- what are we talking about? Why is- why- why does the expansion of the universe

2827
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:29,600
give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?

2828
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:34,080
So for me, I don't think about the universe in terms of big bang in space.

2829
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:38,960
I think about in terms of the big- the big memory expansion that you have one- you only have the

2830
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:42,800
ability to store one bit of information, so then you can't do very much.

2831
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:48,000
So what the universe has been doing since the- since forever, it's been creating more-

2832
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:50,880
it's been increasing the size of its RAM.

2833
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:57,440
Okay? So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte, three megabyte, four megabytes all the way up.

2834
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:03,360
And so the more RAM you have, the more you can remember about the past,

2835
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,040
then which allows you to do cooler things in the future.

2836
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:11,600
So if you can remember how to launch a rocket, then you might be able to imagine how to land a

2837
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:17,520
rocket and then relaunch, re-land and carry on because- and so the- the- the- you able- you're

2838
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:20,960
able to expand the space and remember the past.

2839
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:23,520
And so that's why I think it's very important.

2840
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:27,360
But not a perfect memory. It's- it's a- it's an interesting question whether

2841
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:29,600
there's some forgetting that happens and might increase.

2842
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:37,040
Is the expansion of the forgetting at some point accelerate faster than the- the remembering?

2843
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:41,120
I think that that's a very important thing that probably intelligence does and we're going to

2844
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,960
learn and machine learning about because you want machine learning right now or- or artificial

2845
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:50,160
intelligence right now doesn't have memory right, but you want the ability to- or not for- if you

2846
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:55,360
want to get to human-like consciousness, you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff

2847
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:59,440
and then to selectively forget stuff so you can re-remember it and compress it.

2848
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:02,000
Arguably the way that we come up with new physical laws-

2849
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,120
Do currency.

2850
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:05,360
Yeah, like- yeah, sorry, you were-

2851
02:21:05,360 --> 02:21:07,040
No, no, sorry, no, I just wanted to-

2852
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:15,840
I- I think that there is a- a great deal to be gained from having the ability to remember things,

2853
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:20,640
but then when you forget them, you can then have a- you can basically do the simulation again

2854
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:25,200
and work out if you get to that compressed representation so that it's in cycles.

2855
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:31,200
So cycles of memory- remembering and- and forgetting are probably important, but there

2856
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:34,320
shouldn't be excuse to have a met- universe of no memory in it.

2857
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:37,840
The universe is going to remember that it forgot, but just not tell you.

2858
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:44,640
I'm- I'm looking at the- this paper and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet

2859
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:48,160
controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet

2860
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,560
conceptually easy to understand, but physically impossible.

2861
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:51,600
It's physically impossible.

2862
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:53,520
It's predicting a fair coin toss.

2863
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:57,520
I don't know what he's talking about, but there's pictures of puppets controlling puppets.

2864
02:21:58,480 --> 02:22:03,840
Let me ask you- there's a- there's a few things I want to ask, but we brought up time quite a bit.

2865
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:06,720
You guys tweet about time quite a bit.

2866
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:10,640
What is time in all of this?

2867
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:11,920
We kind of mentioned it a bunch.

2868
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:16,800
Is it not important at all in terms of- is it just a word?

2869
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,800
Should we be talking about causality mostly?

2870
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:24,080
Like Sarah, what do you think is- we've talked about like memories.

2871
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:28,400
Is that the fundamental thing that we should be thinking about and- and time is just a useful

2872
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:30,480
measurement device or something like that?

2873
02:22:30,480 --> 02:22:32,320
Well, there's different concepts of time, right?

2874
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:35,760
So I think in assembly theory, when we're talking about time, we're talking about the ordering of

2875
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:38,160
things. So that's the causal graph part.

2876
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:42,080
And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a certain ordering

2877
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:44,560
and certain things can't happen until other things happen.

2878
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:49,760
But usually when we colloquially talk about time, we're talking about the flow of time.

2879
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,840
And I guess Lee and I were actually debating about this this morning.

2880
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:58,800
So in talking on it, walking on the river here, which is a very lovely spot for talking about time,

2881
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,840
but that the- you know, that when the universe is updating, it's transitioning between

2882
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,800
things that exist now and things that exist now.

2883
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:10,960
That's really the flow of time.

2884
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:15,600
So there's- there's- you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.

2885
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:19,200
And then there's also an arrow of time that people talk about in physics,

2886
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:22,720
which is that time doesn't appear to have a directionality in fundamental physics,

2887
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:25,040
but it does to us, right?

2888
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:26,720
Like we can't go backwards in time.

2889
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:29,760
And usually we- you know, that would be explained in physics in terms of,

2890
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:32,000
well, there's a cosmological arrow of time,

2891
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,720
but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time of increasing entropy.

2892
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:39,200
But what we would say in assembly theory is that there is a clear directionality.

2893
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:41,920
The universe only runs in one direction, which is why some things-

2894
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:45,360
it's easy to make- if the universe runs in one direction,

2895
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,520
it's easy to make processes look reversible.

2896
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,880
For example, if they have no memory, they're easy to run forward and backwards,

2897
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:54,080
which is why the laws of physics that we have now look the way they do,

2898
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:56,480
because they involve objects that have no memory.

2899
02:23:56,480 --> 02:24:00,480
But when you get to things like us, it becomes very clear that the universe has a directionality

2900
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:01,360
associated to it.

2901
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:02,960
So it's not reversible at all.

2902
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,240
It's the no man ever steps in the same river.

2903
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,320
I just have to bring that up because you won't go on the river.

2904
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:11,040
No man has ever steps in the same river twice,

2905
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:13,440
for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.

2906
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:16,160
So it's not reversible, any of the same.

2907
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:19,360
No, no, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?

2908
02:24:19,360 --> 02:24:22,000
So we think of the reversibility of laws as being fundamental

2909
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,840
and the irreversibility as being emergent.

2910
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:26,800
But I think what we would say from how we think about it,

2911
02:24:26,800 --> 02:24:29,520
and certainly it's easy to get the case for our perception of time,

2912
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,400
but also what's happening in biological evolution,

2913
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:37,120
you can make things reversible, but it requires work to do it.

2914
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:40,400
And it requires certain machines to run it forward and backward.

2915
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,640
And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas

2916
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:44,480
on a constructor theory related to that,

2917
02:24:44,480 --> 02:24:45,920
which is a totally different set of ideas.

2918
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,600
So you can travel back in time sometimes.

2919
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:54,000
Yes, you can't travel actually back in time,

2920
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,840
but you could reconstruct things that have existed in the past.

2921
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,640
You're always moving forward in time, but you can cycle through.

2922
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,360
Can I clarify what you just said?

2923
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:06,160
Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back?

2924
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:06,960
Yes.

2925
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:09,040
Thank you, that really clarified it.

2926
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:12,400
What Sarah is saying is you don't go back in time,

2927
02:25:12,400 --> 02:25:15,840
you recreate what happened in the past, in the future, and inspect it again.

2928
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:19,040
So in that local pocket of time, it's as if you travel back in time.

2929
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:22,160
So how's that not traveling back in time?

2930
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:24,720
Because you're not going back to your same self, back in time.

2931
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:27,200
You're creating that in the future.

2932
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:29,040
What else is the same as it was in the past?

2933
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:31,440
No, no, no, no.

2934
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:32,640
It's not in registry.

2935
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:34,080
I mean, it goes back to the big question.

2936
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:38,400
I'm saying, I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today

2937
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:42,000
when we first had this discussion and I was talking to Sarah on Skype.

2938
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,840
And I said, by the way, time is the fundamental thing in the universe.

2939
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:47,360
She almost hung up on me.

2940
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:50,960
Right, but you can even, I mean, if you want to make an analogy to computation,

2941
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,880
and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this,

2942
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:56,960
like about reversible computation and reversible Turing machines,

2943
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:00,560
in order to make it reversible, you have to store memory to run the process backwards.

2944
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:03,760
So time is always running forward in that.

2945
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:06,560
So you can't erase the memory.

2946
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:11,200
You can erase the memory, but the point, when you go back to zero, right?

2947
02:26:11,200 --> 02:26:17,280
But the whole point is that in order to have a process that even runs in both directions,

2948
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:21,600
you have to start talking about memory to store the information to run it backwards.

2949
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,080
I got it.

2950
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:26,880
So you can't really then, you can't have it exactly how it was in the past.

2951
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

2952
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,880
So you have extra stuff, extra baggage always.

2953
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:33,280
A really important thing I want to say on this,

2954
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:38,240
I think if I try and get it right, I just say that if you can think that the universe is expanding

2955
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:44,080
in terms of the number of boxes that it has to store states, right?

2956
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:48,880
And this is where the directionality of the universe comes from, everything comes from.

2957
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:53,840
You could erase what's in those boxes, but the fact you've now got so many boxes at time

2958
02:26:53,840 --> 02:26:58,000
now in this present, there's more of those boxes than there were in the past.

2959
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,160
But the boxes aren't physical boxes.

2960
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,360
It's not space or time.

2961
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:05,680
Why is the number of boxes always expanding?

2962
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:08,960
It's very hard to imagine this because we live in space.

2963
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:16,480
So what I'm saying, which is I think probably correct, is that we just let's just imagine for

2964
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:22,480
a second, there is a non-local situation, but there are these things called states

2965
02:27:23,360 --> 02:27:30,320
and that the universe, irrespective of whether you measure anything, there is a universal,

2966
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:32,720
let's call it a clock or a state creator.

2967
02:27:33,360 --> 02:27:37,840
Maybe we can call it, that's why maybe you can call it God, but let's call it a state creator

2968
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,880
where the universe is expanding and the number of states it has.

2969
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:43,200
Why are you saying it's expanding though?

2970
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:44,560
Is that obvious that it's expanding?

2971
02:27:44,640 --> 02:27:48,000
It's obvious because that's where the, because we...

2972
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,240
That's a source of novelty.

2973
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:54,800
It's a source of novelty and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.

2974
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:56,960
I didn't know it's not predictable.

2975
02:27:56,960 --> 02:27:57,600
Well, it's...

2976
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,120
I just like interrupting him.

2977
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:01,360
Sorry, it's fun because you're struggling.

2978
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:06,480
I'm struggling because I'm trying to be as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm insane.

2979
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:08,560
And I'm not insane.

2980
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:10,240
It's obvious because you...

2981
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:18,800
I'm a chemist, so as a chemist I grew into the world understanding irreversibility.

2982
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:20,880
Irreversibility is all I knew.

2983
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:27,200
And when people start telling me the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick.

2984
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,480
We can use time to do it.

2985
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:37,440
So what I mean is the second law is really the magical.

2986
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:39,920
But why does it need to be magical?

2987
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:41,440
The universe is just asymmetric.

2988
02:28:41,440 --> 02:28:44,560
All I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric in the state production.

2989
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:50,320
And we can erase those states, but we just have more computational power.

2990
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:55,440
So what I'm saying is that the universe is deterministic horizon.

2991
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:57,840
This is one of the reasons we can't live in a simulation, by the way.

2992
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,000
The irreversibility.

2993
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,040
You can't live in a simulation.

2994
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:02,400
The irreversibility.

2995
02:29:02,400 --> 02:29:02,880
Yeah, yeah.

2996
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:06,560
So basically every time you try and simulate the universe in this, you know,

2997
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:09,040
I live in a simulation, the universe is expanded in states.

2998
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,360
Like, oh, damn it, I need to make my computer bigger again.

2999
02:29:11,360 --> 02:29:14,480
And every time you try and contain the universe in the computation,

3000
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:16,560
because it's got bigger in number of states.

3001
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:22,720
And so I'm saying the fact the universe has novelty in it is going to turn out

3002
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:29,520
experimentally to be proof that time, as I've labeled it, is fundamental

3003
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:33,920
and exists as a physical thing that creates space.

3004
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:38,800
Okay, so if you can prove that novelty is always being created,

3005
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:43,920
you're saying that it's possible to also then prove that it's always expanding

3006
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:45,360
in the state space.

3007
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:48,080
Those are things that have to be proven.

3008
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:49,920
That's what working experiments for, yeah.

3009
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:53,440
And you're trying to, like by looking at the sliver of reality,

3010
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:56,320
show that there's always novelty being generated.

3011
02:29:56,320 --> 02:30:01,680
Yeah, because if we go live in a universe that the conventional physicist would live in,

3012
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:04,240
it's a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.

3013
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:12,160
I want to prove that that book doesn't exist, it's continuously being added pages on.

3014
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:15,280
So what I'm saying, if the universe is a book, we started,

3015
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:19,760
the universe at the beginning only had no pages or had one page, another page, another page,

3016
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:22,400
whereas the physicists would now say all the pages exist,

3017
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:24,640
and we could in principle access them.

3018
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:27,120
I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.

3019
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:29,200
Do you know what's written in this book?

3020
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:30,240
The free will question.

3021
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:40,640
Is there room for free will in this view of the universe is generating novelty

3022
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:46,000
and getting greater and greater assembly structures built, Sarah?

3023
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:47,040
Yes.

3024
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:48,880
Okay.

3025
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:49,120
Done.

3026
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:50,400
Next question.

3027
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:52,960
Why, what's the source of free will in this?

3028
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:57,440
Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but...

3029
02:30:58,240 --> 02:30:58,640
Yeah.

3030
02:30:58,640 --> 02:30:59,280
Well, please.

3031
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:05,520
I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is,

3032
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:09,840
do we have individual autonomy and agency?

3033
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:15,200
And when I do things, is it really me or is it my atoms that did it?

3034
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:19,120
And that's the part that's interesting to me.

3035
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:21,920
I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part.

3036
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:30,240
But the way I think about it is each of us are a thread or an assembly space through

3037
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:33,520
this giant possibility space.

3038
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:37,680
And it's like we're moving on our own trajectory through that space,

3039
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:39,520
and that is defined by our history.

3040
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:41,920
So we're causally contingent on our past,

3041
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:48,960
but also because of the intersection of novelty generation,

3042
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:51,280
it's not completely predetermined by the past.

3043
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:57,840
And so then you have the causal control of the determinism part,

3044
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:01,440
that you are your causal history and there's some determinism from that past,

3045
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:04,320
but there's also room for creativity.

3046
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:08,640
And I think it's actually necessary that something like free will exist

3047
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:11,280
if the universe is going to be as creative as possible.

3048
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:17,280
Because if I were all intelligent being, inventing a universe,

3049
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,400
and I wanted it to have maximal number of interesting things happen,

3050
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:24,640
again, we should come up with the metric of interesting.

3051
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:33,680
But generating maximal possibilities, then I would want the agents to have free will

3052
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,920
because it means that they're more individual.

3053
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:42,320
Each entity actually is a different causal force in the universe.

3054
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:46,480
And it's intrinsic and local property of that system.

3055
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:49,760
There's a greater number of distributed agents.

3056
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:53,520
Like are you always creating more and more individuality?

3057
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:58,880
Kind of. I would say you're creating more causal power, but...

3058
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,600
So causal power, the word consciousness,

3059
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,120
is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?

3060
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,680
I mean, that's why I have this conception of consciousness

3061
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:09,040
being related to imagination.

3062
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,200
Because the more that we can imagine can happen.

3063
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:14,640
And the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind,

3064
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:16,240
the more you can actually implement.

3065
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:20,000
And somehow free will is also at the intersection of the counterfactual becoming the actual.

3066
02:33:21,360 --> 02:33:25,760
So can you elaborate on that a little bit, that consciousness is imagination?

3067
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,600
I don't know exactly how to articulate it.

3068
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:31,280
And I'm sure people will take aim at certain things I'm saying,

3069
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:33,040
but I think the language is really imprecise.

3070
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:34,800
So I'm not the best way to...

3071
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:36,240
It's really interesting.

3072
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:42,880
Like what is imagination and what role does it play in the human experience,

3073
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:44,560
in the experience of any agent?

3074
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:46,320
I love imagination.

3075
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:49,360
I think it's like the most amazing thing we do.

3076
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:51,360
But I guess one way I would think about it is,

3077
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:54,960
we talked about the transition to life being the universe acquiring memory.

3078
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:56,560
And life does something really interesting.

3079
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:58,560
Just think about biology generally.

3080
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:01,920
It remembers states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future.

3081
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:04,640
So the longer life has evolved on this planet,

3082
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,560
the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,

3083
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:08,720
the more kinds of organisms and things.

3084
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:12,640
But what human level intelligence has done is quite different.

3085
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:16,880
It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before,

3086
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:19,520
it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed,

3087
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,480
and we can actually make them come into existence.

3088
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:26,400
And I think that's the most unique feature about the transition

3089
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:30,160
to whatever we are from what life on this planet has been doing

3090
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:31,920
for the last four billion years.

3091
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:34,800
And I think it's deeply related to the phenomena we call consciousness.

3092
02:34:34,800 --> 02:34:36,240
Yeah, I was going to just agree with that.

3093
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:40,320
I think that consciousness is the ability to generate those counterfactuals.

3094
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:43,040
Now, whether you can say, you know, are there degrees of consciousness?

3095
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:49,920
I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals,

3096
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:53,360
although they do have some kind of, they are able to search a space and pathways.

3097
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:59,520
But I think that there is a very concrete, or concrete,

3098
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,040
there's a very specific property that humans have.

3099
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:05,040
And I don't know if it's unique to humans.

3100
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:08,880
I mean, maybe dogs can do it and birds can do it, right?

3101
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:11,600
And where they are basically solving a problem,

3102
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:16,320
because consciousness was invented, or this abstraction was invented by evolution

3103
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:17,840
for a specific reason.

3104
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:22,960
And so, look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion

3105
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:30,080
that time was fundamental was actually because Sarah and I had a completely different...

3106
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:32,400
The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.

3107
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:33,760
No, no, no, no, we had to...

3108
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,960
And which topic?

3109
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:37,520
No, it goes back to the free will thing.

3110
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:39,040
So I think the...

3111
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,800
Although I've changed my view a bit because there's some really interesting physicists out there

3112
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:48,080
who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space...

3113
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:50,320
I don't want to go there just now because I think I'll mess it up.

3114
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:54,720
But briefly, I could not see how the universe...

3115
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:55,920
How we could have free will.

3116
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:58,160
And I mean, this is really boring because this is like...

3117
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,080
This is a well trodden path, but I'll...

3118
02:36:00,080 --> 02:36:01,680
But I'm not so boring.

3119
02:36:01,680 --> 02:36:02,560
I suppose it's kind of...

3120
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:03,440
We just want to be precise.

3121
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,880
If the universe is deterministic, how can we have free will?

3122
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,080
So Sarah's a physicist.

3123
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:12,480
I think she believe...

3124
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:17,760
Not believe can show that most of the laws we have are deterministic to some degree,

3125
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:20,160
quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.

3126
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:22,320
And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will.

3127
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:26,800
I'm like, your belief system is broken here, right?

3128
02:36:26,800 --> 02:36:31,200
Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic universe.

3129
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:39,200
And then I realized that I agreed with her that I do think that free will is a thing

3130
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,360
because we are able to search for novelty.

3131
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:43,840
And then that's where I came to the conclusion that time

3132
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:46,320
the universe was expanding in terms of novelty.

3133
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:48,880
And it goes back to that Darren Dennett essay that we're talking about,

3134
02:36:48,880 --> 02:36:50,480
the free will inflation.

3135
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,520
So you have...

3136
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:54,320
So the past...

3137
02:36:55,520 --> 02:36:56,800
It did not exist in the past.

3138
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:58,640
The past exists in the present.

3139
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:01,520
What I mean is there was no past.

3140
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:02,560
There is only present.

3141
02:37:03,440 --> 02:37:05,120
So that means you are the sum total.

3142
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:08,880
Everything that occurs in the past is manifestly here in the present.

3143
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:13,360
And then you have this little echo state in your consciousness

3144
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:18,080
because you're able to imagine something without actualization.

3145
02:37:18,080 --> 02:37:21,600
But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons and potassium

3146
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:24,560
iron flows in your neural network, in your brain.

3147
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,320
Maybe consciousness is just the present.

3148
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:32,000
So somehow you imagine that and then by imagining, oh, that's good.

3149
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,240
I'm going to make a robot do this thing and program it.

3150
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:38,000
And then you physically then go and do it.

3151
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:40,800
So that changes the future.

3152
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:41,120
Sorry.

3153
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:42,960
What's imagination?

3154
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:45,920
Does it require the past?

3155
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:47,600
Does it require the future?

3156
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:48,800
Does it require memory?

3157
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:49,200
Does it...

3158
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:50,640
So imagination...

3159
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:53,040
Does it only exist in the moment?

3160
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:54,240
So imagination is...

3161
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:59,120
Well, yeah, probably it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on.

3162
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:03,520
You can maybe your subconscious brain has been generating all the bits for it.

3163
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:09,920
But no, imagination occurs when you, in your game engine, you remember the past

3164
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:14,320
and you integrate sensory the present and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.

3165
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:15,440
And then you go and make that happen.

3166
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:17,760
So the imagination is this...

3167
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:21,520
It's like asking what imagination is about asking what surfing is.

3168
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:26,240
You can surfboard, surf a wave coming in.

3169
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:31,120
When you're on that wave and you're surfing, that's where the imagination is.

3170
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:36,000
I think imagination is just accessing things that aren't the present moment in the present moment.

3171
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,600
So I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table and I can imagine the river and things

3172
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:42,560
or whatever it was.

3173
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:50,000
And so it seems to be that it's our ability to access things that aren't present.

3174
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:57,280
But to conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin to something that happened to you recently.

3175
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:00,640
Right, but they don't have to be things that actually happened in your past.

3176
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:02,480
And I think this gets back to assembly theory.

3177
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:07,200
Like the way I would think about imagination from an assembly theoretic standpoint is I'm

3178
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:13,760
a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment as a particular configuration of Sarah.

3179
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:16,720
But there's a lot of...

3180
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:18,480
I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.

3181
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:22,240
I have that whole causal history and I can access parts of it.

3182
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:26,080
Now, when you talk about getting to something as complex as us, having as large an assembly

3183
02:39:26,080 --> 02:39:27,840
space as us, there's ways of...

3184
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:33,440
Like there's a lot of things in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed

3185
02:39:33,440 --> 02:39:37,120
in the past history of the universe because like the universe got big enough to contain

3186
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:40,320
the three of us in this room in time.

3187
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:48,400
But not all the features of each one of us individually have come into existence as physical

3188
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:50,320
objects we would recognize as individual objects.

3189
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:55,360
This goes back to your point that we actually have to explain why things actually even look

3190
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:58,320
like objects and aren't just a smear of mass.

3191
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:03,920
And just on the free will and physics thing, when you were talking...

3192
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:07,120
I just want to bring this up because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint that

3193
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:12,080
Nicholas Jisen has that we want to use the laws of physics and then say you can't have

3194
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:12,560
free will.

3195
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:17,040
And his point is you have to have free will in order to even choose to set up an experiment

3196
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:18,160
to test the laws of physics.

3197
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:22,400
So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental than physics is because to even

3198
02:40:22,400 --> 02:40:28,240
do science, there's some assumption that the agents have free will.

3199
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:34,080
And I always thought it was really perplexing that physics wants to remove agency because

3200
02:40:34,080 --> 02:40:37,520
the idea that I could do an experiment here on this part of earth and then I can move

3201
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:42,400
somewhere else and prepare an identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again

3202
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:47,120
seems to imply something about the structure of our universe that is not encoded in the laws

3203
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:48,400
that we're testing in those experiments.

3204
02:40:49,760 --> 02:40:53,520
So this kind of dream of physics that you can do multiple experiments, different locations

3205
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:58,560
and then validate each other, you're saying that's an illusion?

3206
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:03,440
No, I'm saying that requires decision making and free will to be a real thing, I think.

3207
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:09,040
I think the fact that we can do science is not arbitrary and I think people,

3208
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:13,280
the standard canon in physics would be, well, you could trace all of that back to the initial

3209
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:17,600
condition of the universe, but the whole point of science is I can imagine doing the experiment

3210
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:19,600
and I can do it and then I can do it again and again and again.

3211
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:26,480
To your imagination, somehow fundamentally generative of novelty, so it's not like the

3212
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:28,560
universe could have predicted the things you imagined.

3213
02:41:30,080 --> 02:41:33,360
So coming back to novelty, I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,

3214
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:35,680
but it supercharges it. It's another transition, I think.

3215
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:40,640
I mean, this may be a boring statement, but I would say the fact that, sorry?

3216
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:42,640
I'm not sure. These are hard questions.

3217
02:41:42,640 --> 02:41:46,320
Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist is yet another proof that

3218
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:49,840
time is fundamental and novelty exists, right?

3219
02:41:50,400 --> 02:41:54,480
Because I think, again, if you ask the physicists to write down the infinite

3220
02:41:54,480 --> 02:42:01,520
Bible of the universe, let's call it the Bible, the mathematical universe,

3221
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:04,720
whether you're on Max Teckmark or Sean Carroll or Frank Wilczek

3222
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:10,320
or Stephen Wolfram, okay?

3223
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:12,160
I like that book.

3224
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:14,400
Yeah, I love it too. There's lots of pretty pictures.

3225
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:19,760
It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity of the universe by saying, well,

3226
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:22,000
it's all there mathematics, it all exists, right?

3227
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:26,800
And I would say that that's why I'm excited about the future of the universe because it,

3228
02:42:27,760 --> 02:42:35,200
although it is somehow dependent upon the past, it is not constrained just by the past,

3229
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:37,920
which is kind of mad.

3230
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:42,400
Yeah, that's what free will is. It's not constrained by the past.

3231
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:46,320
It's dependent on the past. This moment, it's not just dependent.

3232
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:52,800
This moment is the past, and yet it has the capacity to generate a totally unpredictable future.

3233
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:56,240
I mean, the other thing I would say is super important for human beings, right?

3234
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:59,840
Human beings have actually very little cause or control in the future.

3235
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:02,000
I realize this the other week.

3236
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,360
Oh, then we have future in the future.

3237
02:43:03,360 --> 02:43:06,160
Yeah, yeah. So what happened? So this is what I think it is.

3238
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:11,280
The way, by reinterpreting your past, I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive,

3239
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:17,120
psychological cognitive point of view, by reinterpreting your past in your current mind,

3240
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:20,480
you can actually help you shape your future again.

3241
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:26,720
So you, but you have much more freedom to interpret your past, to act in the present,

3242
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:30,160
to change your future than you do to change your future. I may sound weird,

3243
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:33,760
so I'm saying to everybody, imagine your past, think about your past,

3244
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:39,200
reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can, then imagine what you can do next,

3245
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:41,840
or imagine your past in a more negative way and what you do next.

3246
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:44,400
And look at those two counterfactuals, they're different.

3247
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:47,040
Yeah, it's fast. I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this,

3248
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:50,960
that most of our life is lived in our memories. And it's interesting because you can

3249
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:56,240
essentially, in imagination, choose the life you live. So maybe free will exists in imagination.

3250
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:03,600
Choices are made in your imagination. And that results in you basically able to control

3251
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:10,000
how the future unfolds. Because you're like, imagining, like reinterpreting constantly,

3252
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,360
the things that happen to you.

3253
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:15,200
Exactly. So if you want to increase your amount of free will,

3254
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:18,560
those people that have most, I don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency,

3255
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:25,920
because of our sad constraints, whether you know, happenstance, health, economic,

3256
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:33,040
born in a certain place, right? But those of us that have the ability to go back and

3257
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:40,880
reinterpret our past, and use that to change the future, are the ones that exert most agency

3258
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:47,920
in the present. And I want to achieve higher degrees of agency and enable

3259
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:51,840
everyone else to do that as well, to have more fun in the universe.

3260
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:54,320
Then we'll hit that peak, maximum fun point.

3261
02:44:54,320 --> 02:44:57,280
I don't think there's ever going to be a maximum, I think it's,

3262
02:44:57,280 --> 02:44:59,840
the wonderful thing about the future is there's always going to be more fun.

3263
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:05,440
Yeah, you, I think, again, go back to Twitter, I think,

3264
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:09,760
you lead tweeted something about being a life maximalist that you want to maximize the number

3265
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:15,920
of life, the amount of life in the universe. So, and, you know, that's the more general

3266
02:45:16,640 --> 02:45:21,520
version of that goal is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe, because life is a subset

3267
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:26,240
of fun. They're all kinds of, I suppose they're either correlated or exactly equal, I don't know.

3268
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:30,640
Anyway, speaking of fun, let me ask you about alien sightings.

3269
02:45:32,160 --> 02:45:35,040
So there's been quite a bit of UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff.

3270
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:46,240
What do you think would be the first time when humans sight aliens, see aliens in a sort of

3271
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:52,400
unquestionable way, this extremely strong and arguable way

3272
02:45:54,160 --> 02:46:00,960
we've made contact with aliens, Sarah, what would it look like? Obviously, the space of

3273
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:07,120
possibility is huge here, but if you were to kind of look into the future, what would that look like?

3274
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:15,040
Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there that slowly unravel the mystery, or would it be like

3275
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:22,400
an obvious overwhelming signal? So I think we have an obsession with making contact with events.

3276
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:28,800
So what do I mean by that is, you know, like people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.

3277
02:46:29,440 --> 02:46:36,880
And I always think, you know, what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now is not

3278
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:41,760
that I have a disbelief about what people are experiencing or feeling, but like the discussion

3279
02:46:41,760 --> 02:46:48,080
right now is sort of at the level of modern mythology. Aliens are our mythos in modern

3280
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:55,040
culture. And when you treat it like that, then I want to think about when do things that we

3281
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:59,760
traditionally only regularize through mythology actually become things that become standard

3282
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:04,480
knowledge? So, you know, like it used to be, you know, variations in the climate were described

3283
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:08,480
by some kind of gods or something. And now it's like, you know, our technology picks up an anomaly

3284
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:14,160
or someone sees something, we say it's aliens. And I think the real thing is it's not contact with

3285
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:19,920
events, but like first contact is actually contact with knowledge of the phenomena or the explanation.

3286
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:25,840
And so this is very subtle and very abstract, but when does it become something that we actually

3287
02:47:25,840 --> 02:47:29,840
understand what it is that we're talking about? That's first contact. It's not-

3288
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:35,040
Would you make the myth, would you give credit to the myth, the mythology as first contact?

3289
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:39,680
Because you- I think yes, I think it's the rudimentary that we have some understanding

3290
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:43,200
that there's a phenomena that we have to understand and regularize. So I think-

3291
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:45,520
Right, to understand that there is weather. Yes.

3292
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:48,400
You have to construct a pathology on that weather. Yes.

3293
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:54,640
It's something that's controllable. I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.

3294
02:47:56,160 --> 02:48:02,480
It could be that, you know, although there's lots of alien sight, so-called alien sightings,

3295
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:05,520
right? So there are a number of things you can do. You could just dismiss them and say they're

3296
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:09,600
not true. They're kind of made up. Or you say, well, there's something interesting here, right?

3297
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:13,600
We keep seeing a commonality, right? We see the same phenomena again and again and again.

3298
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:18,000
Also, there's this interesting thing about human imagination. Even if they are-

3299
02:48:18,960 --> 02:48:25,600
Let's not say made up, but misappropriated kind of other inputs. The fact that human consciousness

3300
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:30,800
is capable of imagining in contact with aliens, does that not tell us about something about

3301
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:33,520
where we are in our position, in our culture, in our technology?

3302
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,360
It tells us not where in time we are.

3303
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:39,680
Could it be that we're making contact with- Let's say that- So let's say,

3304
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:43,520
let's take the most miserable version. There are no aliens in the universe. Life is only on earth.

3305
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:48,480
That then, the interpretation of that is we're desperate to kind of understand why we're the

3306
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:52,720
only life in the universe, right? The other one is the other most extreme is that aliens are visiting

3307
02:48:52,720 --> 02:48:57,360
all the time and we just, you know, we're just not able to capture them coherently. Or there's a

3308
02:48:57,360 --> 02:49:02,720
big conspiracy and, you know, there's an area 51 and there are lizards everywhere and there's that.

3309
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:08,720
Or I'm kind of in favor of the idea that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea that we aren't

3310
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:14,240
alone in the universe and we're just running the simulation and we're seeing some evidence.

3311
02:49:14,240 --> 02:49:18,960
You know, we don't know what life is yet. We do have some anomalies out there.

3312
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:27,680
We can't explain everything. And over time, you know, we will start to unpack that.

3313
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:32,960
One very plausible thing we might do, which might be boring for the average alien

3314
02:49:32,960 --> 02:49:39,600
observer or believes that aliens are, as in intelligent aliens are visiting earth,

3315
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:44,800
it could be that we might go to the outer solar system and find a new type of life that has

3316
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:49,840
completely new chemistry. Bring these cells back to earth where you could say in my hand,

3317
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:55,920
on earth, here's RNA, DNA and proteins and look, cells self-replicating from Titan.

3318
02:49:55,920 --> 02:50:00,560
We have this new set of molecules, new set of cells and we feed it stuff and it grows.

3319
02:50:01,360 --> 02:50:08,640
That for me, if we were able to do that, which would be like the most, that would be my UFO

3320
02:50:08,640 --> 02:50:12,640
sign. That's a good test. So you feed it and it grows. Yeah.

3321
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:22,560
We've made, so not until you know how to feed the thing and it grows somehow.

3322
02:50:22,560 --> 02:50:26,000
We can make a comic book, you know, the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.

3323
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:34,640
What would you say is between the two of you is the biggest disagreement about alien life out there?

3324
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:41,840
Is it from the basic framework of thinking about what is life to maybe what aliens look like,

3325
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:46,560
to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings? What would you think?

3326
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:52,800
So I would say the biggest one is that the emergence of life does not have to be

3327
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:59,680
that it can't just happen once on the planet, that it could be two or more life forms present

3328
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:04,240
on the planet at once. And I think Sarah doesn't agree with that. I think that's like

3329
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:11,120
logically inconsistent. That's really polite. I'm really saying it's nonsense because you think.

3330
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:15,280
Oh, likely is that. So the idea that what does it look like? Let's imagine

3331
02:51:16,880 --> 02:51:21,200
two alien civilizations co-existing on a planet. What's that look like exactly?

3332
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:25,360
So I would say, I think I've got to get around your argument.

3333
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:31,040
Yeah, let's say that on this planet, there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry

3334
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:38,800
and one life form emerges based on carbon and interacts and there's an ecosystem based on carbon

3335
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:45,120
and there's an orthogonal. And so it's planetary phenomena, which is what you I think, right?

3336
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:50,320
But there's also one that goes on silicon. And because there's enough energy and there's enough

3337
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:55,360
stuff that these life forms might not actually necessarily compete

3338
02:51:56,560 --> 02:52:00,640
evolutionarily. Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all because they're going to be

3339
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:03,680
co-constructing each other's causal chains. I think that's what you just got me.

3340
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:10,080
So there's no overlap in terms of their causal chains or very limited overlap.

3341
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:14,000
Yeah. So I think the only way I can get away with that is to say, right, life could emerge on a planet

3342
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:18,640
underneath. The lizard people under the crust of the earth.

3343
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:24,800
I think, I think, let's go, I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree. So,

3344
02:52:24,800 --> 02:52:30,160
and I think Sarah actually has convinced me because of the life is a planetary phenomenon,

3345
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:35,600
the emotional life is a planetary phenomena. And actually, because of the way evolution

3346
02:52:35,600 --> 02:52:40,480
selection works, then nothing occurs in isolation, the causal chains interact. So there is a common,

3347
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:42,480
there's a consensus model for life on the earth.

3348
02:52:42,480 --> 02:52:48,240
But you don't think you can place aliens from elsewhere onto the, can't you just

3349
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:52,240
place multiple alien civilizations on one planet?

3350
02:52:52,240 --> 02:52:57,840
Right. But I think, so you can take two original life events that were independent

3351
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:01,520
and commingle them. But I don't think when you're talking about,

3352
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:09,280
when you look at the interaction of that structure, it's like the same idea as like

3353
02:53:09,360 --> 02:53:13,600
an experiment being an example of life, right? That's a really abstract and subtle concept.

3354
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:18,880
And I guess what I'm saying is life is information propagating through matter. So once you start

3355
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:26,000
having things interacting, they, in some sense, commingle and they become part of the same chain.

3356
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:29,840
This is, the commingling starts quickly. Yeah.

3357
02:53:29,840 --> 02:53:32,320
It proceeds, we proceed to commingle quickly.

3358
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:37,600
Right, right. So you, you could say, so the question is then, the more interesting question

3359
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:41,760
is, are there two distinct origins events? And I still think that there's reasons that

3360
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:46,880
on a single planet, you would have one origins event because of the time scales of cycling,

3361
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:52,480
of geochemistry on a planet. And also the fact that I don't think that the origin of life happens

3362
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:57,120
in a pool and like radiates outward through evolutionary processes. I think it's a multi-scale

3363
02:53:57,120 --> 02:54:01,520
phenomenon happens at the level of individual molecules interacting, collections of molecules

3364
02:54:01,520 --> 02:54:07,920
interacting in entire planetary scale cycles. So life as we know it has always been multi-scale.

3365
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:13,120
And there's, I'm brilliant examples of individual mutations at the genome level changing global

3366
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:18,560
climate, right? So there's a tight coupling between things that happen at, you know,

3367
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:24,080
the largest scale of our planetary scale and the smallest scale that life mediates.

3368
02:54:24,080 --> 02:54:29,680
But it still might be difficult within something you will call as a single civil alien civilization,

3369
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:32,800
you know, different, there's species and stuff. But I think what, yeah,

3370
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:36,560
they can't, might not be able to communicate. But you're asking about life, not species, right?

3371
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:44,480
So what's the difference between one living civilization? This is almost like a category

3372
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:50,800
question versus species, because it can be very different. The way evolution, because there's

3373
02:54:50,800 --> 02:54:55,600
like island, like literally islands that you can involve different kinds of turtles and stuff.

3374
02:54:55,760 --> 02:55:03,520
Yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is, if you look at the structure of two interacting living

3375
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:09,760
things, populations, and you look in their past and they have independent origins for their causal

3376
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:14,800
chain, then you would say one was alien, you know, they have different independent origins events.

3377
02:55:14,800 --> 02:55:19,040
But if you look at their future by virtue of the fact they're interacting, their causal chains have

3378
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:26,960
become commingled so that then in the future, they are not independent, right? So that's why

3379
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:32,400
you would even define them as aliens. So the structure across time is two examples of life

3380
02:55:32,400 --> 02:55:36,080
become one example of life because life is the entire structure across time.

3381
02:55:36,080 --> 02:55:39,280
Right. But there could be a lot of variation with this.

3382
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:44,640
Yeah. So the question we're all interested in is how many independent origins of a

3383
02:55:45,200 --> 02:55:47,840
complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?

3384
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:57,760
But the idea of origin is easy for you to define because like when the two, when the

3385
02:55:57,760 --> 02:56:06,160
species split in the evolutionary process, and you get like a dolphin versus a human

3386
02:56:06,160 --> 02:56:10,400
or Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens, isn't there?

3387
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:16,720
They make a distinction here quickly. So I think, sorry to interrupt. What we're saying,

3388
02:56:16,720 --> 02:56:21,120
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, Sarah, we won that argument because I think she's right,

3389
02:56:21,120 --> 02:56:25,440
that once the causal chains interact and going forward. So we're talking about a number of

3390
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:29,440
things. Let's go all the way back before origin of life, origin of life on Earth,

3391
02:56:30,320 --> 02:56:34,400
chemistry emerges. So there's all these, I would say there's probably mechanistically,

3392
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:39,520
the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way to get replicators, the ribosome kind of

3393
02:56:40,400 --> 02:56:42,880
was really rubbish at the beginning. And he just competed, competed, competed,

3394
02:56:42,880 --> 02:56:47,280
got better and better ribosome. And suddenly that was a technology. The ribosome is the

3395
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:53,600
technology that way, boom, allowed evolution to start. So what I was trying to, why I interrupted

3396
02:56:53,600 --> 02:57:00,240
you is say that once evolution has started using that technology, then you can speciate.

3397
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:04,960
And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said was convinced me of, because I was like,

3398
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:08,400
no, we can have lots of different chemistry, shadow, biosphere on Earth. And she's like,

3399
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:15,360
no, no, no, you have to have this, you have to get to this minimum evolutionary machine.

3400
02:57:16,160 --> 02:57:20,400
And then when that occurs, speciation occurs, exactly what it's like dolphins, humans,

3401
02:57:21,360 --> 02:57:27,680
everything on Earth. But when you're looking at aliens or alien life, there's not going to be

3402
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:31,600
two different types of chemistry, because they compete, they compete and interact and cooperate

3403
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:35,440
because the causal chains overlap, one might kill the other, one might combine with the other,

3404
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:40,720
and then you go on, and then you have this kind of this average, and sure, there might be

3405
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:45,520
respeciation. It might be have two types of emerging chemistry. It almost looks like the

3406
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:52,400
original life on Earth required two different pre-life forms, the peptide world and the RNA world,

3407
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:57,840
somehow they got together. And by combining, you got the ribosome. And that was the minimum

3408
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:04,480
competent entity for evolution. And would all alien civilizations have an evolutionary process?

3409
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:10,400
On a planet. So like, that's one of the almost, it's almost the definition of life,

3410
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:13,840
to create all those memories, you have to have something.

3411
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:15,280
Things have to change in time.

3412
02:58:15,280 --> 02:58:15,680
Yeah.

3413
02:58:15,680 --> 02:58:17,120
But there has to be selection.

3414
02:58:19,520 --> 02:58:22,160
That's like an efficient, there's no other way to do it.

3415
02:58:22,160 --> 02:58:24,880
No. Well, never say never, because soon I'll say that.

3416
02:58:24,880 --> 02:58:28,880
That's the part that depresses me though, going back to like, I don't know, the earlier

3417
02:58:28,880 --> 02:58:33,440
discussion on violence and things, like, and I don't know where somebody was tweeting about

3418
02:58:33,440 --> 02:58:38,080
this recently, but like, you know, how much stuff had to die. Maybe it was you.

3419
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:39,280
Yeah.

3420
02:58:39,280 --> 02:58:48,400
Yeah. So we were talking about life. And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.

3421
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:52,080
Right. So selection means things had to be weeded out, right?

3422
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:52,480
So.

3423
02:58:52,480 --> 02:58:55,360
Well, we can celebrate that. Death makes way for a tool.

3424
02:58:55,360 --> 02:59:00,160
Yeah. I mean, and also, you know, one of the most interesting features of major extinction

3425
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:05,840
events in the history of our planet is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?

3426
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:09,520
So, and of course, you know, a lot of people make arguments, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs

3427
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:16,480
didn't go extinct. So in some ways, we can attribute our existence to all of that.

3428
02:59:16,480 --> 02:59:21,600
But I guess I was just wondering sort of like, if I was going to build a universe myself,

3429
02:59:22,560 --> 02:59:24,960
in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?

3430
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:25,920
But it does seem to be a universe.

3431
02:59:25,920 --> 02:59:29,200
I think you have to. I mean, I think we're probably being over

3432
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:33,760
anthropomorphizing. I remember watching the blue, I think it was the blue planet,

3433
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:36,400
David Attenborough was showing these seals and because of climate change,

3434
02:59:36,400 --> 02:59:39,760
some seals were falling off a cliff and how tragic that was. I was like,

3435
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:44,240
I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool. Look at the, those ones down there,

3436
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:47,920
they've obviously got some kind of mutations, some and they're not doing that dark thing.

3437
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:54,640
And so that poor gene will be weeded out. Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.

3438
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:57,760
And of course, as human beings have the ability to abstract and we empathize,

3439
02:59:57,760 --> 03:00:01,360
we don't want to cause suffering on other human beings. And we should retain that.

3440
03:00:01,360 --> 03:00:07,520
But we shouldn't look back in time and say, you know, how many butterflies had to die?

3441
03:00:08,320 --> 03:00:14,080
I remember making, how many, if you think about the caterpillar, become the chrysalis,

3442
03:00:14,080 --> 03:00:18,720
and then the butterfly getting out, how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering,

3443
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:22,800
if that process of pruning had not occurred, we have no butterflies.

3444
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:26,640
So none of the butterfly beauty in the world without all that pruning.

3445
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:31,680
So pruning is required, but we shouldn't anthropomorphize and feel sorry for the biological

3446
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:36,800
entities. Because that's, that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.

3447
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:42,480
What we should do is project forward and maybe think about what values we have across our species

3448
03:00:42,480 --> 03:00:47,200
and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings. You know, you know, now that we know that animals

3449
03:00:47,200 --> 03:00:53,040
suffer at some level, think about humane farming. When we find that plants can in fact,

3450
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:58,480
are conscious and can think and have prane, then we'll do humane gardening.

3451
03:00:58,480 --> 03:01:06,240
Until that point, we won't do it, right? I like this. Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature

3452
03:01:06,240 --> 03:01:14,320
of murder. That's the title. I didn't say that, but okay. Well, I just insert it. I have a hard

3453
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:19,680
time with it, though. I think the way you put it, it's kind of... But it's the reality of,

3454
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:24,640
it's the reality of, it is beautiful. You know, there's an Instagram account called

3455
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:30,960
Nature's Metal. And I keep following it, I'm following it because I can't handle it for

3456
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:36,960
prolonged periods of time. We evolve together, you dialogue. Yeah. We evolve together, but you

3457
03:01:36,960 --> 03:01:43,200
die alone. You live alone too. It's a Gatsby thing. I don't know. We evolve together. Where's the

3458
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:48,960
together? The together is the murder and the sex and murder. I just tried like my romantic vision

3459
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:53,760
of it to try to make me happy, Sarah, instead of sad, Sarah. I talk in third person when I think

3460
03:01:53,760 --> 03:02:01,680
very abstractly, sorry, is this whole certain things can coexist so the universe is trying

3461
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:08,640
to maximize existence, but there's some things that just aren't the most productive trajectory

3462
03:02:08,640 --> 03:02:13,200
together, but it doesn't mean that they don't exist on another timeline or another chain

3463
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:18,320
somewhere else. And maybe you would call that then some kind of multiverse or things, but

3464
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:24,320
what am I saying? I think you can't go down a level. I'm just making stuff up to make it feel

3465
03:02:24,320 --> 03:02:29,520
better. No, you're not. I don't understand. Is it logical? And we need... No, I know, I know.

3466
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:34,320
If you look at bacteria, if you look at virus, I mean just the number of organisms that are

3467
03:02:34,320 --> 03:02:38,880
constantly looking at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop. It's like a slaughter. Right.

3468
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:42,080
So... Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God. I mean, there's a whole thing about

3469
03:02:42,240 --> 03:02:47,600
why is the universe unable to suffering? Individuals don't exist, right? So for this,

3470
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:53,600
I think if you think about life as an entity on earth, right? Let's just go back a second.

3471
03:02:53,600 --> 03:02:57,360
I mean, I like that. I'll be ludicrous for a second. I don't exist. You don't exist, right?

3472
03:02:58,720 --> 03:03:04,240
But the actions you do, the product of evolution exists, right? The objects you create exist

3473
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:10,400
quantitatively in the real world. If you then understand life on earth or alien life or any

3474
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:15,680
life in the universe, there's this integrated entity where you need cells in your body to

3475
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:20,800
die. Otherwise, you'd just get really big and you wouldn't be able to walk around, right? So,

3476
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:29,280
you do. Yeah. Yeah. So I think... It's the patterns that persist, not the physical things.

3477
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:34,480
And of course, we have... We place immense values on fellow human beings. And I'm

3478
03:03:35,680 --> 03:03:39,120
majestic professor, does like other individual human beings.

3479
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:41,760
Now you're talking in third person too. I know it happens, right?

3480
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:46,160
So death, would you say... I mean, because you said evolution is a fundamental part of

3481
03:03:47,360 --> 03:03:50,080
life. So death is a fundamental part of life. Yeah.

3482
03:03:52,160 --> 03:03:56,000
Right now, it might not be in the future. We might hack some aspects of death

3483
03:03:56,640 --> 03:04:02,080
and we'll evolve in different ways. But isn't there... I think Sarah mentioned this life density.

3484
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:11,200
Can't that become a problem? Like too much bureaucracy, too much baggage builds up.

3485
03:04:11,200 --> 03:04:16,720
Like you need to keep... I think it's okay that we dissipate. I don't think of it like...

3486
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:23,280
Disappear, yes. No, but I mean, we're so fixated on ourselves as individuals and agents. And we

3487
03:04:23,280 --> 03:04:28,800
were talking about this last night actually over dinner. But an individual persists for a certain

3488
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:33,680
amount of time. But what you want to do, like if you're really concerned with immortality, is not

3489
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:38,960
to live indefinitely as an individual, but maximize your causal impact. So what are the traces of you

3490
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:45,680
that are left? And you're still a real... I always think of Einstein. Like for a period of time,

3491
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:50,640
he was a real physical thing we would identify as a human. And now we just see echoes of that human

3492
03:04:50,640 --> 03:04:55,920
in all of the ways that we talk about his causal impact. Or frankly, right is another great example.

3493
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:59,120
How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future? Like, oh, I got you.

3494
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:05,920
So I guess the question is, how much do you want to control the localization of certain features

3495
03:05:06,560 --> 03:05:12,880
of, say, a packet of propagating information we might call person and keep them localized to

3496
03:05:12,880 --> 03:05:16,960
one individual physical structure? Or do you want to... Is there a time when that just becomes a

3497
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:23,040
dissipated feature of the society that it once existed in? And I'm okay with the dissipated

3498
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:27,120
feature because I just think that makes more room for more creativity in the future.

3499
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:34,400
So you mentioned engineering life in the lab. Let me take you to Computer Science World.

3500
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:44,400
What about robots? So is it possible to engineer... Because you're really talking about

3501
03:05:46,480 --> 03:05:51,600
like engineering life at the chemistry level. But do you think it's possible to engineer

3502
03:05:52,560 --> 03:06:01,040
life at the humanoid level, at the dog level? Or is that... At which level can we instill

3503
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:07,440
the magic of life into inanimate stuff? No, I think you could do it at every level. I just

3504
03:06:07,440 --> 03:06:13,520
think that we're particularly interested in chemistry because it's the origin life transition

3505
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:17,440
that presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it, is going to give you the most

3506
03:06:18,320 --> 03:06:25,360
and interesting or deepest insights into the physics. But presumably, everything that we do

3507
03:06:25,360 --> 03:06:29,520
and build is an example of life. And the question is just how much do you want to take from things

3508
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:36,080
that we have now and put them into examples of life and copy them into machines? I saw that there

3509
03:06:36,080 --> 03:06:40,800
was this tweet again. I think you were at the Mars conference and you were hanging out with a

3510
03:06:40,800 --> 03:06:46,640
humanoid robot. Yes. That was a fun time. Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.

3511
03:06:46,720 --> 03:06:52,000
Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot or did that accidentally happen?

3512
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:56,320
Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi. Toro voice, would that be the correct name for

3513
03:06:56,320 --> 03:07:02,560
the color? I think so. We didn't color coordinate our outfits. Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did.

3514
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:07,600
The robot probably did. Much more stylish. So for people who are just listening, there's a picture

3515
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:14,800
Sarah standing next to a humanoid robot. I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.

3516
03:07:14,800 --> 03:07:18,400
Actually, no, I just... I did that perfectly. There's a lighter.

3517
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:25,120
No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested. Sorry to interrupt. Was it manual control? Was

3518
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:31,520
it actually stabilizing itself? Oh, no, it was walking around. Oh, nice. Yeah. Nice. It was

3519
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:35,680
pretty impressive. I mean, actually, there's some videos online of Jeff Bezos walking with one of

3520
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:42,880
those across the lawn nearby there. Yeah. So... I wasn't invited.

3521
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:53,920
Yeah, but there you go. See? That's incredible, isn't it? Yeah.

3522
03:07:53,920 --> 03:07:58,400
See, you look at the walking robot. Where did the idea for walking come from? It was invented by

3523
03:07:58,400 --> 03:08:03,360
evolution, right? And us as human beings able to conceptualize and design and engineer.

3524
03:08:03,440 --> 03:08:08,560
The causal chain. So that robot is evidence of life. And so I think what's going to happen is

3525
03:08:11,120 --> 03:08:15,760
we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically. How can you literally go from

3526
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:21,360
sand to cells? So that's the first transition. I think there are a number of problems we want to do.

3527
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:26,480
Make life in the lab. Great. Then we want to make life in the lab and we want to suddenly start to

3528
03:08:26,480 --> 03:08:32,240
make intelligent life or life that can start to solve abstract problems. And then we want to make

3529
03:08:32,240 --> 03:08:39,600
life that is conscious. Okay. In that order. I think it has to happen that order. Getting

3530
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:43,600
towards this artificial general intelligence. I think that artificial general intelligence

3531
03:08:44,240 --> 03:08:48,480
can't exist in a vacuum. It has to have a causal chain all the way back to Luca, right?

3532
03:08:49,440 --> 03:08:52,320
And so the question I think I really like the question is to say,

3533
03:08:54,240 --> 03:09:00,880
how is our pursuit of more and more life like? I know you want to, you like robots,

3534
03:09:00,880 --> 03:09:05,520
you want to project into them, you want to interact with them. I think you would want,

3535
03:09:05,520 --> 03:09:08,560
if you have a robot dog and a robot dog does everything expected from a normal dog and you

3536
03:09:08,560 --> 03:09:12,560
can't tell a difference, you're not really going to ask the question anymore if it's a real dog

3537
03:09:12,560 --> 03:09:16,720
or not. Or you've got a personality, you're interacting with it. And so I think what would

3538
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:22,400
be interesting would be to kind of understand the computational architecture, how that evolves,

3539
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:26,560
because you could then, you know, teleport the personality from one object to the other and

3540
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:32,320
say, right, does it act the same? And I think that as we go along, we're going to get better and

3541
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:37,840
better at integrating our consciousness into machines.

3542
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:44,560
Well, let me ask you that question just to linger on it. I would call that a living

3543
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:52,800
conscious thing potentially, I as a human allegedly, but would you as a person try to define life?

3544
03:09:53,600 --> 03:09:56,160
If you pass the Turing test, are you a life form?

3545
03:09:56,800 --> 03:10:02,880
One of the reasons I walked up to the robot was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?

3546
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:11,200
So it felt like I was, and I base a lot of my interaction with reality on emotion and feeling,

3547
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:15,200
but like, how do you feel about an interaction? And I always love your point about like, is it

3548
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:19,520
enough to have that shared experience with a robot, right? So walking up to it, does it feel

3549
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:24,320
like you're interacting with a living thing? And it did to an extent. But in some degrees,

3550
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:28,720
it feels like you're interacting with a baby living thing. So I think our relationship with

3551
03:10:28,720 --> 03:10:34,560
technology in particular robots we build is really interesting because basically, they exist as

3552
03:10:34,560 --> 03:10:39,840
objects in our future in some sense, like we're much older evolutionary lineage than robots are,

3553
03:10:39,840 --> 03:10:46,320
but we're all part of the same causal chain. And presumably, you know, they're kind of in their

3554
03:10:46,320 --> 03:10:50,720
infancy. So it's almost like you're looking at the future of life when you're looking at them,

3555
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:56,880
but it hasn't really become life in a full manifestation of whatever it is that they're

3556
03:10:56,880 --> 03:11:04,160
going to become. And, you know, the more, the example of the walking robot was super interesting,

3557
03:11:04,160 --> 03:11:08,400
but they also had a dolphin that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,

3558
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:13,680
and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool. And, you know, it's in this kind

3559
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:19,680
of uncanny valley because, and I was having this conversation with a gentleman named Mutu,

3560
03:11:19,680 --> 03:11:24,160
who was super perceptive, but he was basically saying like, it made him feel really uncomfortable.

3561
03:11:25,680 --> 03:11:30,720
And I think, yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response. And I guess my point

3562
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:34,960
about it is, it is kind of interesting because you're basically trying to make a thing that you

3563
03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:40,400
think is nonliving mimic a living thing. And so, so the thought experiment I would want to run in

3564
03:11:40,480 --> 03:11:45,520
that case is, imagine we replaced every living thing on earth with a robot equivalent, like all

3565
03:11:45,520 --> 03:11:50,320
the dolphins and things. And in some sense, then you're making, if you think that the robots aren't

3566
03:11:50,320 --> 03:11:55,120
experiencing reality, for example, in the way that a biologically evolved thing would, you're

3567
03:11:55,120 --> 03:12:02,000
basically making the philosophical zombie argument become real and basically building

3568
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:07,200
reality into a simulation because you've made everything quote unquote fake in some sense.

3569
03:12:07,200 --> 03:12:10,880
You've replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.

3570
03:12:10,880 --> 03:12:17,920
So as opposed to being excited by the possibility of creating something new,

3571
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:22,240
you're terrified of humans being replaced.

3572
03:12:22,240 --> 03:12:26,080
I was just trying to run like, what would be the absolute, you know, thought experiment,

3573
03:12:26,080 --> 03:12:31,440
but I don't think that scenario would actually play out. I guess what I think is weird for

3574
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:36,320
why we feel this kind of uncanny valley interacting with something like the robot dolphin

3575
03:12:36,320 --> 03:12:40,000
is we're looking at an object we know is kind of in the future in the sense of like,

3576
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:44,080
if everything's ordered in time, but it's borrowing from a structure that we have common

3577
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:49,120
history with. And it's basically copying in a kind of superficial way things from one

3578
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:52,320
part of the causal chain to another. Yeah.

3579
03:12:53,120 --> 03:12:54,880
Well, that's, that's a video.

3580
03:12:55,680 --> 03:13:01,040
Everybody believed it was real. They look so real. And obviously,

3581
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:03,520
a technology was developed for movies. So

3582
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:08,000
Well, I think we're confusing our emotional response and understanding the causal chain

3583
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:12,400
of how we got there, right? Because the philosophical zombie argument thinks about

3584
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:17,600
objects just appearing, right, that you're facsimile in some way. Whereas there is

3585
03:13:17,600 --> 03:13:22,160
the cause of the chain of events that caused the dolphin to be built went for human being.

3586
03:13:22,160 --> 03:13:25,440
Yeah, would a philosophical zombies still have a high assembly index?

3587
03:13:25,520 --> 03:13:31,360
Yeah. Because it came it can't be philosophical zombies can't like like Boltzmann brains just

3588
03:13:31,360 --> 03:13:35,200
can't appear out of nowhere. Well, I guess my question would be in that that scenario where

3589
03:13:35,200 --> 03:13:38,560
you build all the robots and replace everything on earth with robots with the with the biosphere

3590
03:13:38,560 --> 03:13:44,320
be as creative under that scenario or not. And so are there are there quantitative differences

3591
03:13:44,320 --> 03:13:48,400
you would notice over time? And it's not obvious either way, right? It's not obvious right now

3592
03:13:48,400 --> 03:13:53,120
because we don't really we don't understand we haven't built into machines how we work.

3593
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:58,400
So that's I think that there are one of the big missing things that I think that we're both

3594
03:13:58,400 --> 03:14:03,680
looking for, right? It's a cute robot. But the point there is that the biosphere won't be as

3595
03:14:03,680 --> 03:14:12,240
creative if you did it right now. No, of course, but in the future, we will be able to solve the

3596
03:14:12,240 --> 03:14:20,480
problem of origin of life, intelligence and consciousness, because they exist in physical

3597
03:14:20,480 --> 03:14:26,160
substrates, we just don't understand enough about the material substrate and the causal chain.

3598
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:30,720
But I'm very confident we will get to an AGI, but it won't be what people think it won't be

3599
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:36,480
solution won't be a we'll get fooled a lot. And so GPT three is getting better at falling us and

3600
03:14:36,480 --> 03:14:43,920
GPT 153 might really fall us, but it won't have the magic we're looking for it won't be a creative.

3601
03:14:44,880 --> 03:14:51,120
But it will help us understand the differences between really though, because isn't that what

3602
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:58,960
love is being fooled? Like what why why are you not giving much value to the emotional connection

3603
03:14:58,960 --> 03:15:04,000
with objects with with robots with humans? Emotion is that thing which happens when you're

3604
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:10,480
when you're the the funk your expectation function is is dashed and something else happens.

3605
03:15:10,560 --> 03:15:14,880
Right. I mean, that's what emotion is. Is that what love is to you? Yeah.

3606
03:15:15,760 --> 03:15:20,800
You were expecting one thing and something else happened. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think that's

3607
03:15:20,800 --> 03:15:25,120
true either. Well, what is it then? I think no emotion. Look, I'm sorry emotion is that but

3608
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:30,400
but I think love is just fulfilling your purpose. No, but I'll can we look like look like whatever

3609
03:15:30,400 --> 03:15:34,560
that means. I mean, really? So yeah, okay. So when are you happiest is like when you're all right?

3610
03:15:34,560 --> 03:15:39,440
All right. Let me go back if you want to follow your bliss. Let me define love quickly. Okay,

3611
03:15:39,920 --> 03:15:45,040
in terms of assembly space, right? Excellent. I didn't think I'll be doing this today.

3612
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:49,760
I can't wait till assembly theory 101 is taught and the second lecture is assembly theory of love.

3613
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:59,760
It's being surprised. The expectation is being broken. I'm just I'm not an emotional being,

3614
03:15:59,760 --> 03:16:04,160
but I would say so let's talk. So we'll talk about emotion a bit, but love is more complex is love

3615
03:16:04,160 --> 03:16:09,440
is a very complex set of emotions together and logical stuff. But if you've got this thing,

3616
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:15,520
this person that's on this causal chain that has this empathy for this other thing, love is being

3617
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:20,960
able to project ahead in your assembly space and work out what you're the person you're in love with

3618
03:16:20,960 --> 03:16:27,360
has a need for and to do that for them without selflessly, right? Because you can project ahead

3619
03:16:27,360 --> 03:16:31,360
what they're going to need and they are there and maybe you can see someone is going to fall over

3620
03:16:31,440 --> 03:16:34,800
and you catch them before they fall over or maybe you can anticipate that someone's going to be

3621
03:16:34,800 --> 03:16:39,520
hungry and without helping you, you just help them. That just sounds like empathy.

3622
03:16:40,160 --> 03:16:44,640
But it's more complex than that, right? It's more complex. It's more about not just empathy,

3623
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:48,160
it's understanding. It's about kind of sharing that experience.

3624
03:16:48,160 --> 03:16:52,240
You have an expression of love though. That's not what it's like to feel love like feeling love is

3625
03:16:52,240 --> 03:16:58,560
like I like I think it's like when you're aligned with things that you feel like are your purpose

3626
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:06,160
or your reason for existing. So if you have those feelings towards a robot, why is that rope?

3627
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:12,800
Because you said the AGI will build an AGI but there'll be a fundamental difference in AGI.

3628
03:17:12,800 --> 03:17:15,040
I don't think we'll build it. It's going to merge from our technology.

3629
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:20,480
I think you guys all are doing the same thing. I just said that GPT, that we do not correctly

3630
03:17:20,480 --> 03:17:25,280
capture the causal chain that we have. Within GPT. Yeah, within AI.

3631
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:32,960
Don't you think it captures, because GPT-3 is fundamentally trained on a corpus of knowledge,

3632
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:38,960
you know, like the internet. Don't you think it gets better and better and better capturing

3633
03:17:38,960 --> 03:17:43,520
the memory of all of them? It will be better at falling you and at some point you won't care.

3634
03:17:44,400 --> 03:17:49,120
But when it comes, my guess, this is as quick as what I was getting to right before we got,

3635
03:17:49,120 --> 03:17:54,880
I got in the Love Trap. Love Trap, yeah. It was like Lee Cronin in the Love Trap, you know.

3636
03:17:57,040 --> 03:18:01,600
Sounds like a good band name. It makes it sad. Okay, it's sad. Assembly space is sad.

3637
03:18:01,600 --> 03:18:08,960
No, it's so short, but I think there are other features that allow, that we pull on innovation

3638
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:14,160
that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT-3. So if you're being fooled there.

3639
03:18:14,160 --> 03:18:19,120
So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability to be surprising and creative,

3640
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:28,160
whereas is it Dali, this thing, or if you take GPT-3 is not going to create a new verb. Shakespeare

3641
03:18:28,160 --> 03:18:35,200
created new verbs. You're like, wow. And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language

3642
03:18:35,200 --> 03:18:40,080
in a different domain. So I think having the connections across multiple domains is what

3643
03:18:40,080 --> 03:18:45,840
you need for AGI. Yeah, but I don't know if you need, I don't know if there's any limitations to

3644
03:18:46,720 --> 03:18:54,320
GPT and not being able to be cost domain. The number one problem is it's instantiated in a

3645
03:18:54,320 --> 03:19:02,320
resource-limited substrate that we don't use in silicon. The architecture is used for training,

3646
03:19:02,320 --> 03:19:08,720
for learning. It is about falling. It's not about understanding. And I think that there is some

3647
03:19:09,360 --> 03:19:13,760
understanding that we have that is not yet symbolically representable.

3648
03:19:13,760 --> 03:19:19,120
Language, learning language and using language seems to be fundamentally about fooling,

3649
03:19:19,120 --> 03:19:23,840
not understanding. Why do you use language exactly?

3650
03:19:23,840 --> 03:19:30,000
I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually. But I don't, I'm not sure I understand

3651
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:35,600
how I'll make a coherent argument for that. But my feeling is that there is, there are,

3652
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:44,880
there is comprehension in reality in our consciousness below language. And we use those

3653
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:48,960
for language for all sorts of expressions. And we don't yet understand that there's a gap.

3654
03:19:48,960 --> 03:19:52,880
We will get there. But I'm saying, wouldn't it be interesting? It's a bit like saying,

3655
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:59,600
could I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being, right? And let's just say I could copy

3656
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:04,880
all your atoms and the positions of all your atoms and electrons into this other person,

3657
03:20:04,880 --> 03:20:09,920
they would be you. The answer is no. And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory,

3658
03:20:09,920 --> 03:20:14,800
because actually the feature space that you have, that graph, the only way to copy you

3659
03:20:14,800 --> 03:20:18,560
is to create you on that graph. So everything that's happened to you in your past,

3660
03:20:18,560 --> 03:20:21,440
we have to have a faithful record for. If you want another copy of Lex,

3661
03:20:21,440 --> 03:20:24,560
you have to do the exact thing. One other copy of Sarah, one other copy of Lee,

3662
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:29,680
the exact past has to be replicated. Let me push back on that a little bit. That's maybe from an

3663
03:20:29,680 --> 03:20:36,080
assembly theory perspective, but I don't think it's that difficult to recreate a version of me,

3664
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:44,320
like a clone that would make everybody exactly equally as happy. Like they wouldn't care which

3665
03:20:44,320 --> 03:20:50,080
one. And like there's two of me, and then they get to pick which one, and they'll kill either one,

3666
03:20:50,080 --> 03:20:53,760
they'll be fine, as long as they're forced to kill. They'll be fine. But here's what will happen,

3667
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:58,640
is let's say we make artificial Lex. And it was like, wow, so cool, it looks the same interact.

3668
03:20:58,640 --> 03:21:02,160
Then there'll be this battle of like, right, we're going to tell the difference. We're going to

3669
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:09,520
basically keep nudging Lex and artificial Lex until we get in novelty from one and we'll kill

3670
03:21:09,520 --> 03:21:15,200
the other one. And I think thank God. We're not novelty is a fuzzy concept. That's the whole

3671
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:22,640
problem of novelty. So I will define novelty is not fuzzy. Novelty is the ability for you to create

3672
03:21:23,600 --> 03:21:30,320
architectures that are or create an architecture. So let's say you've got corpus of architectures

3673
03:21:30,320 --> 03:21:34,800
known, you can write down, you've got some distance measure. And then I create a new one,

3674
03:21:34,800 --> 03:21:39,920
and the distance measure so far away from what you'd expected is there's no linear algebra

3675
03:21:39,920 --> 03:21:47,360
we're going to get this, like that is creativity. And we don't know how to do that yet on any level.

3676
03:21:47,360 --> 03:21:50,640
Well, I was also thinking about like your argument about free will, like you wouldn't

3677
03:21:50,640 --> 03:21:55,280
be able to know it was it doesn't work instantaneously. It's not like a micro level thing,

3678
03:21:55,280 --> 03:21:59,840
but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories or longer term decisions. So

3679
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:06,000
if you think that the novelty manifests over those longer timescales, it might be the two Lexes

3680
03:22:06,800 --> 03:22:12,560
diverge quite a bit over certain timescales of their behavior, even though nobody would notice

3681
03:22:13,360 --> 03:22:20,160
the difference. They might not. And the universe, the earth won't notice the difference. The

3682
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:24,160
universe won't notice the universe would notice the difference. No, the universe doesn't know about

3683
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:28,880
its novelty. This being generated. That's the whole point of novelty. This is what selection is,

3684
03:22:28,880 --> 03:22:34,400
right? It's like taking nearly equivalent ones and then deciding like the universe selects,

3685
03:22:34,400 --> 03:22:38,880
right? So whatever selection is, select some things to persist in time. It's going to select

3686
03:22:38,880 --> 03:22:44,080
the artificial one. So it likes that one better. But you're mixing up two arguments here. So look,

3687
03:22:44,080 --> 03:22:48,880
let's go back a second. What are you basing this argument on? I'm just saying that I kind of

3688
03:22:49,600 --> 03:22:57,840
don't think, because at least said that it's not possible, like if you copy every single molecule

3689
03:22:57,840 --> 03:23:04,880
in a person's body, that's not going to be the same person. That they won't have the same assembly

3690
03:23:04,880 --> 03:23:10,480
index. It won't be the same person. And I just don't, I think copying, you can compress. Not only

3691
03:23:10,480 --> 03:23:16,560
do I disagree with that, I just, I think you can even compress a person down to some where you can

3692
03:23:16,560 --> 03:23:23,920
fool the universe. I'm saying, let me restate it. It is not possible to copy somebody on,

3693
03:23:23,920 --> 03:23:29,600
because you, unless you copy the causal history. Also, you can't have two identical. I mean,

3694
03:23:29,600 --> 03:23:33,040
actually, I really like the idea that everything in the universe is unique. So even if like,

3695
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:36,960
there were two lexes. I know you like that idea because you're human and you think you're unique.

3696
03:23:36,960 --> 03:23:41,040
Yeah, exactly. But also, I can make a logical argument for it that even if we could copy,

3697
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:44,560
you know, all of your molecules and all their positions, the other you would be there. And

3698
03:23:44,560 --> 03:23:49,520
you have a different position in space. You're distinguishable. Yeah, the other thing I was

3699
03:23:49,520 --> 03:23:53,840
going to add. How unique are you just by the position in space, really? Sure. But then,

3700
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:57,760
how much does that light translation of lex sitting there affect the future? That's not an

3701
03:23:57,760 --> 03:24:04,720
interesting, I see. But, but no, wait, wait a minute. Is part of the definition of something

3702
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:10,080
being interesting is how much it affects the future? Yes. Yes. But let me come back.

3703
03:24:10,640 --> 03:24:14,960
But let me come back to one point quickly that you were making. Sure. I think I probably agree.

3704
03:24:15,600 --> 03:24:19,600
There's two lexes, right? There's a robot lex that you just basically, it's a, it's a,

3705
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:26,320
it is a charade. It's a facsimile. It's just coded to emulate you.

3706
03:24:27,440 --> 03:24:32,160
Are you a robot lex? I wouldn't know, right? But let's get there. That's a very, very important

3707
03:24:32,160 --> 03:24:38,640
point here because he's ducking and diving between this eye. So, so if I facsimile you into a robot,

3708
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:43,760
then it would, your robot might be, would be a representation of you now, but fundamentally

3709
03:24:43,760 --> 03:24:47,600
be boring because you go and have other ideas. If however you built an architecture,

3710
03:24:47,600 --> 03:24:51,920
the itself was capable of generating novelty, you would diverge in your causal chain,

3711
03:24:51,920 --> 03:24:56,240
and you're both be equally interesting to interact with. We don't know that mechanism.

3712
03:24:56,240 --> 03:24:59,760
All I'm trying to say is we don't yet know that mechanism. We do not know the mechanism that

3713
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:07,120
generates novelty. And at the moment, in our AIs, we are emulating, we are not generating.

3714
03:25:07,120 --> 03:25:11,680
You don't think we're sneaking up on that? No, there is no ghost in the machine.

3715
03:25:13,440 --> 03:25:16,720
And I want there to be one. I want the same thing you want. Sorry, I was-

3716
03:25:16,720 --> 03:25:22,160
I know you want that as a human because everything you just said makes you feel more special.

3717
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:26,640
I want to be, no, no, no, screw my specialness. I just want to be surprised. If I-

3718
03:25:26,640 --> 03:25:30,640
You don't think a robot can surprise you? If I, if you can produce an algorithm in

3719
03:25:30,640 --> 03:25:36,560
instantiated and robot surprise me, I will, I will, I will, I will have one of those robots

3720
03:25:36,560 --> 03:25:42,640
to be brilliant, but they won't surprise me. But why, why is it a problem to think that humans

3721
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:49,360
are special? Maybe it's not the special, you're right. It's the better than. Yes. Because then

3722
03:25:49,360 --> 03:25:55,280
you start to not recognize the magic in other life forms that you either have created or you have

3723
03:25:55,280 --> 03:26:02,480
observed because I just think there is magic in legged robots moving about and they are full

3724
03:26:02,480 --> 03:26:10,480
of surprises. Yeah. So this is- Infectionality. Yeah. So I'm a little- I know why you like cellular

3725
03:26:10,480 --> 03:26:17,440
automata, right? But the, the specialness in your robot comes from the roboticist that built it.

3726
03:26:19,200 --> 03:26:23,200
Yeah. It's part of the lineage. Yeah. And so that's fine. I'm happy with that.

3727
03:26:23,200 --> 03:26:26,640
That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot was I was looking at 4 billion years of

3728
03:26:26,640 --> 03:26:31,760
evolution. Yeah. Right. If it wasn't, so I think I'm happy. I mean, I'm happy we're going to coexist.

3729
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:34,640
I'm just saying you're going to get more excitement. There's something missing in our

3730
03:26:34,640 --> 03:26:40,400
understanding of intelligence. Intelligence isn't just training. The way the neural network is

3731
03:26:40,400 --> 03:26:44,160
conceived right now is great and it's lovely and it'll be better and we will argue forever. But

3732
03:26:44,960 --> 03:26:49,520
you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said, look, I know how to invent an architecture

3733
03:26:49,520 --> 03:26:56,560
and I can give it a soul. And what I mean by a soul is some, I know for real that there is

3734
03:26:56,560 --> 03:27:01,920
internal reference. As soon as I'm not fake internal reference, and if we could generate

3735
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:05,280
that mechanism for internal reference, that's why our goal direct- That's why you have to-

3736
03:27:05,280 --> 03:27:08,800
We can do that. That's for goal directness. Yeah. Get that goal directness. You would love that

3737
03:27:08,800 --> 03:27:14,080
robot more than the one that's just made to look like it does because you'll have more fun with

3738
03:27:14,080 --> 03:27:19,360
it because you better generate other problems, get more novelty. Hell, you'd be able to fall

3739
03:27:19,360 --> 03:27:25,680
in love with that robot for real, but not the one that's faking it. What about fake it till you make

3740
03:27:25,680 --> 03:27:36,160
it? Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with fake humans. It's nice to fall in love

3741
03:27:36,160 --> 03:27:41,840
with something that's full of novelty, yes. I could imagine all kinds of robots that I would

3742
03:27:41,840 --> 03:27:46,480
want to have a close relationship with. And I don't mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy.

3743
03:27:47,200 --> 03:27:53,200
But I just don't think that novelty generation is such a special-

3744
03:27:56,080 --> 03:27:59,520
Okay, there's like mathematical novelty or something like that, and then there's just

3745
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:03,920
humans being surprised. I think we're easily surprised. That's fine, but that's-

3746
03:28:03,920 --> 03:28:07,200
But you don't think that's a good definition of novelty? No, that's good. I'm happy to be surprised,

3747
03:28:09,760 --> 03:28:13,440
but not globally surprised because of someone else, but I really want, I was one,

3748
03:28:13,440 --> 03:28:18,800
why I'm a scientist, I really want to be the first to be surprised about something and the

3749
03:28:18,800 --> 03:28:23,280
first thing in the first in the universe to create that novelty and to know for sure that

3750
03:28:23,280 --> 03:28:28,320
that novelty has never occurred anywhere else. That's a real buzz, right? That's a way to really

3751
03:28:28,320 --> 03:28:32,880
know that. You have to have a really big look up, David. Right. Yeah, you're never going to be

3752
03:28:32,880 --> 03:28:37,760
know for sure, right? That's one of the hard things about being a scientist searching for

3753
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:43,280
this type of novelty. Maybe that's why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery,

3754
03:28:43,280 --> 03:28:48,720
but actually they are creating, and then when they do create a new mathematical structure,

3755
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:54,960
that they can then, you can write code to work out whether that structure exists before. That's

3756
03:28:54,960 --> 03:29:00,400
almost why I would love to have been a mathematician from that regard, to invent new math that really,

3757
03:29:00,400 --> 03:29:04,640
I know pretty much for sure does not exist anywhere else in the universe because it's so

3758
03:29:04,640 --> 03:29:09,680
contingent. Right, but this gets into, you said a few times that I still really don't understand

3759
03:29:09,680 --> 03:29:14,080
how you actually plan to do this, to build an experiment that detects how the universe is

3760
03:29:14,080 --> 03:29:19,280
generating novelty or that time is the mechanism. The problem that we all have, which I think is

3761
03:29:19,280 --> 03:29:24,640
what Lex is pushing against, is if I build the experiment, you don't know what you put into it,

3762
03:29:24,640 --> 03:29:30,160
so you don't know what, unless you can quantify everything you put in, all of your agency,

3763
03:29:30,160 --> 03:29:36,160
all the boundary conditions, you don't know if you somehow biased it in some way. So,

3764
03:29:36,160 --> 03:29:40,160
is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment or to that robot, or is it something

3765
03:29:40,160 --> 03:29:44,000
you gave it, but you didn't realize? It's going to be, it's going to asymptote towards that,

3766
03:29:44,000 --> 03:29:48,000
right? You're never going to know for sure, but you can start to take out, you know, you can use

3767
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:53,600
good Bayesian approaches and just keep updating and updating and updating until you point to one

3768
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:58,080
sense of purposes. So you want to bound on how much novelty generation it could be. Yeah. Got it.

3769
03:29:58,960 --> 03:30:03,600
So the ability to generate novelty is correlated with high assembly index,

3770
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:09,200
with assembly index? Yeah, and yeah. Because the space of possibilities is bigger.

3771
03:30:11,440 --> 03:30:18,400
So that's the key, this could be a good, so we're running joke of like why Lex is single,

3772
03:30:18,400 --> 03:30:27,280
this could be a good part four. So what you're looking for in a robot partner is ability to

3773
03:30:27,280 --> 03:30:37,120
generate novelty. And that's, I suppose you would say it's a good definition of intelligence too.

3774
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:48,640
Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept. Is creativity better?

3775
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:55,920
Yeah, I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy. It's kind of the same. Maybe that's why aliens haven't come

3776
03:30:55,920 --> 03:31:00,640
yet is because we're not creating enough novelty. Like there's some kind of a hierarchy of novelty

3777
03:31:00,640 --> 03:31:05,120
in the universe. Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right? So it's a very passive

3778
03:31:05,120 --> 03:31:08,720
thing. But I guess I would remember by saying creativity is I think it's much more active,

3779
03:31:08,720 --> 03:31:13,680
like you think there's like a mechanism of like the things that exist or generating the creativity.

3780
03:31:13,680 --> 03:31:18,160
Novelty seems to be there's some spontaneous production and it's completely decoupled from

3781
03:31:18,160 --> 03:31:24,080
the things that exist. No, I understand. I think that creativity is the mechanism

3782
03:31:24,080 --> 03:31:30,000
and novelty is the observable. Yeah, novelty could just be surprise. Your model of the world

3783
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:34,880
was broken and not necessarily in a positive way. That's surprise. So there's three things now.

3784
03:31:34,880 --> 03:31:38,160
Let's go back to school. Right. Let's go. You've got surprise, which is basically,

3785
03:31:38,800 --> 03:31:42,400
I'm, I don't, I mean, I'm surprised all the time because I don't read very much. I'm pretty dumb.

3786
03:31:42,400 --> 03:31:47,520
I was like, Oh, wow. I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas. And I was really

3787
03:31:47,520 --> 03:31:51,040
surprised by that. And then when looking at literature properly, and it's there. So surprise,

3788
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:57,760
that's to the extent that you don't have full information. Creativity, the act of pushing

3789
03:31:58,640 --> 03:32:05,040
on that kind of on the causal structure and novelty, which is measuring that degree.

3790
03:32:05,760 --> 03:32:11,200
Right. So I think that's pretty well defined in that regard. So you want your robot, I mean,

3791
03:32:11,200 --> 03:32:15,760
and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet and the printing press share some,

3792
03:32:16,480 --> 03:32:20,000
I actually think creativity has dropped a bit since the create, since the internet,

3793
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:23,920
because everyone's just, just, you know, just regurgitating stuff. But of course,

3794
03:32:23,920 --> 03:32:28,080
now it's beginning to accelerate again, because everyone is using this tool to be creative.

3795
03:32:28,720 --> 03:32:33,520
And boom, it's exploding. I think that's what happens when you create these new technologies.

3796
03:32:34,560 --> 03:32:38,160
That's really, that's really helpful. There's a difference between novelty and surprise.

3797
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:42,960
Okay. I was, I think I was thinking about surprise. If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,

3798
03:32:42,960 --> 03:32:47,120
it'd be great. Robot surprises me, you know, experiment that surprises you. Yeah. I mean,

3799
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:51,280
that's why I love doing experiments because I'm, I can't. It's still exciting. Yeah. Surprise is

3800
03:32:51,280 --> 03:32:56,640
exciting. Yeah. Even negative surprise. Like some people love drama in relationships. Like,

3801
03:32:58,000 --> 03:33:03,600
it's like, why the hell, why, why'd you do this? That could be exciting. I could imagine companies

3802
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:08,640
selling updates to their companion robots that just basically generate negative surprise just to

3803
03:33:08,640 --> 03:33:13,360
just spice things up a bit. Yeah. It's the push and pull. That's, that's one of the components

3804
03:33:13,440 --> 03:33:18,720
of love. As you said, love is a complicated thing. Oh, beauty. I wanted to mention this because

3805
03:33:18,720 --> 03:33:22,960
you also tweeted, I think this was Sarah. No, it might have been Lee. I don't remember,

3806
03:33:22,960 --> 03:33:29,600
but it was a survey published in nature showing that scientists find, yeah. Anyway, there's a,

3807
03:33:29,600 --> 03:33:36,960
there's a plot published in nature of what scientists find beautiful in their work and it

3808
03:33:36,960 --> 03:33:42,880
separates biologists and physicists. It'd be nice if you showed the full plot and there's simplicity,

3809
03:33:42,960 --> 03:33:48,720
elegance, hidden order, interlogic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony, and so on.

3810
03:33:49,520 --> 03:33:55,120
Is there any interesting things that stand out to you? I think the fact that biologists like

3811
03:33:55,120 --> 03:34:01,680
complexity and pleasing colors. Oh, there's pleasing colors on there? Yeah. Yeah. Or shapes.

3812
03:34:01,680 --> 03:34:06,400
Or shapes. Pleasing colors. And then physicists obviously love simplicity above all else. Simplicity

3813
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:13,520
and elegance. Simplicity and elegance. Yeah. They love symmetry and the biologists love complexity

3814
03:34:14,640 --> 03:34:19,360
and, or they just love a little bit less. They love everything a little bit less,

3815
03:34:19,360 --> 03:34:24,000
but complexity a little bit more. A little bit more. That's so interesting. And pleasing colors

3816
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:28,640
or shapes. Do you think it's a useful, I forget what your tweet was that this is missing some of

3817
03:34:29,120 --> 03:34:36,640
something? No, I think it's because I think about how explanations become causal to our future. So

3818
03:34:37,520 --> 03:34:44,720
I have this whole philosophy that the theories we build and the way we describe reality should be

3819
03:34:45,680 --> 03:34:53,360
have the largest breadth of possibilities for the future of what we can accomplish. So in some

3820
03:34:53,360 --> 03:34:58,480
sense, it's not like Occam's razor is not for simplicity. It's for optimism or the kind of

3821
03:34:58,480 --> 03:35:04,480
future you can build. And so I think, I think you have to think this way when you're thinking about

3822
03:35:04,480 --> 03:35:09,120
life and alien life, because ultimately we're trying to build, I mean, science is just basically

3823
03:35:09,120 --> 03:35:13,600
our narratives about reality. And now you're building a narrative that is what we are as physical

3824
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:18,160
systems. It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible, because it's basically going to shape

3825
03:35:18,160 --> 03:35:21,600
the future trajectory where we're going. And we don't use that as a heuristic

3826
03:35:21,600 --> 03:35:27,440
in theory building, because we think theories are about predicting features of the world,

3827
03:35:27,440 --> 03:35:30,960
not causing them. But if you look at the history of all of the development of human

3828
03:35:30,960 --> 03:35:35,520
thought, it's caused the things that happen next. So it's not just about looking at the world and

3829
03:35:35,520 --> 03:35:42,960
observing it, it's about actually that feedback loop that's missing. And it's not in any of those

3830
03:35:42,960 --> 03:35:52,800
categories. What do you think is the most beautiful idea in the physics of life, in the

3831
03:35:52,800 --> 03:35:58,240
chemistry of life, in this, through all your exploration with assembly theory,

3832
03:36:00,480 --> 03:36:10,480
what is the thing that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful or potentially beautiful?

3833
03:36:10,480 --> 03:36:17,360
For me, it's that the universe is a creative place. I guess I want to think, and whether it's

3834
03:36:17,360 --> 03:36:24,800
true or not, is that we are special in some way, and it's not like an arbitrary added-on epiphenomenon

3835
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:28,720
or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist, but it's something deep and intrinsic to the

3836
03:36:28,720 --> 03:36:35,040
structure of reality. And to me, the most beautiful idea that come out of that is that the reason we

3837
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:41,600
exist is for the universe to generate more things and to think about itself and use that as a

3838
03:36:42,240 --> 03:36:52,000
mechanism for creating more stuff. That's for me. So the life that this however

3839
03:36:52,800 --> 03:36:59,840
common it is, is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part of this universe, at least that we live in.

3840
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:06,720
It's always interesting to me because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity, and

3841
03:37:06,720 --> 03:37:11,120
they're supposed to be our most fundamental theories right now. And they describe things

3842
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:16,160
like the interaction of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate, or all these kind of

3843
03:37:16,160 --> 03:37:21,200
features. And they're these really deep theories, and they tell us a lot about how reality works,

3844
03:37:21,200 --> 03:37:26,080
but they're completely agnostic to our existence. And I can't help but think that whatever

3845
03:37:26,080 --> 03:37:32,960
describes us has to be even deeper than that. And I think incorporating memory, I guess,

3846
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:38,480
of causality, whatever the term you want to use into the physics of the world might be.

3847
03:37:38,480 --> 03:37:43,120
That's the easiest way to do it. It's the cleanest- so here we go again with the physicists,

3848
03:37:43,120 --> 03:37:48,080
I'm a physicist. I was going to say the simplest, most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of

3849
03:37:48,080 --> 03:37:55,040
ways that we have these paradoxes associated with life when you- it's not that life is not

3850
03:37:56,400 --> 03:38:02,000
current physics is not incompatible with life, but it doesn't explain life. And then you want to

3851
03:38:02,000 --> 03:38:07,200
know where are the explanatory gaps. And this idea that we have an assembly, that time is

3852
03:38:07,200 --> 03:38:13,040
fundamental and objects actually are extended in time, and have physical extent in time is the

3853
03:38:13,040 --> 03:38:20,000
cleanest way of resolving a lot of the explanatory gaps. So I've been- I struggle with assembly theory

3854
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:27,600
for many years, because I could see this gap. And I think when I first met Sarah, and we realized

3855
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:34,480
we were kind of talking about the same problem, but we were- we understood none of the language,

3856
03:38:34,480 --> 03:38:37,680
it was quite hilarious actually, because it's like, look, I've no idea what you're talking about,

3857
03:38:37,680 --> 03:38:42,880
but I think it's- seems right. So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory is I

3858
03:38:42,880 --> 03:38:48,000
realized the assembly theory explains why the universe- why life is the universe developing a

3859
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:53,840
memory, but not only that poetically, I could actually go measure it. And I was like,

3860
03:38:54,880 --> 03:39:00,800
holy shit, we just- we physically measured this thing, this abstract thing, and we could measure

3861
03:39:00,800 --> 03:39:06,560
it. And not only could we measure it, but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.

3862
03:39:08,240 --> 03:39:14,800
And because, I mean, you know, I think as a kind of inventing this together with Sarah and her team,

3863
03:39:15,760 --> 03:39:20,640
you know, I thought there was a quite a high chance that, you know, we're doing science,

3864
03:39:20,640 --> 03:39:27,040
there's such a high probability we're wrong, you know, on this. And I remember kind of trying to go

3865
03:39:27,040 --> 03:39:36,160
to hard physicists, mathematicians, complexity theorists, and everyone just kind of giving

3866
03:39:36,160 --> 03:39:40,720
me such a hard time about it. And so, you know, this is kind of- this is- you've just done this,

3867
03:39:40,800 --> 03:39:47,120
you've just done that, you know, you've just recapitulated an old theory. And I was unable,

3868
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:53,200
I lacked the language to really explain, and I had to- it was a real struggle. So this realization

3869
03:39:53,200 --> 03:40:00,080
that life- what life does that physics cannot understand or chemistry is a universe develops

3870
03:40:00,080 --> 03:40:07,040
a memory that's causally actionable. And then we can measure it, but it isn't just one thing,

3871
03:40:07,040 --> 03:40:11,040
there is this intrinsic property of all the objects in the universe. Like I've said before,

3872
03:40:11,040 --> 03:40:15,360
but you know, me holding up this water bottle isn't any other water bottle, but it is a sum total

3873
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:22,560
of all the water bottles that have existed, right? And will likely change the future of water bottles

3874
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:29,040
and for other objects. So it's this kind of- so for me, assembly theory explains the soul

3875
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:35,680
in stuff. But it- The monology. But it is monology. It's not like Sheldrake's Morphic

3876
03:40:35,680 --> 03:40:41,200
Resonance, where we have this kind of wooey thing permeating the universe. It is the interaction of

3877
03:40:41,200 --> 03:40:47,760
objects with other objects. And some objects have more instantaneous causal power. That's life,

3878
03:40:48,480 --> 03:40:54,240
living things. And some objects are the instantaneous output of that causal power,

3879
03:40:54,240 --> 03:40:58,320
dead objects, but they're part of the lineage. And that for me is fascinating and really beautiful.

3880
03:40:58,880 --> 03:41:04,160
And I think that even if we're determined to be totally wrong, I think it will help us

3881
03:41:04,960 --> 03:41:09,520
help, hopefully understand what life is and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the lab.

3882
03:41:10,160 --> 03:41:13,520
How does that make you feel, by the way? Does it make you feel less special

3883
03:41:13,520 --> 03:41:18,080
that you're so deeply integrated, interconnected to the lineage?

3884
03:41:18,080 --> 03:41:22,000
I mean, I came on one level. I just wanted it in my life as a scientist. I wanted to have an

3885
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:26,800
interesting idea just once or an original idea. I mean, it was like, you know,

3886
03:41:28,320 --> 03:41:32,400
so I think that was cool that we had this idea and we were playing with it. And I think also that

3887
03:41:33,040 --> 03:41:38,640
I kind of, I mean, it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had the same kind of form,

3888
03:41:38,640 --> 03:41:41,600
coming towards the same formulation, just from a completely different point.

3889
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:47,120
But no, it makes me feel special. And it also makes me feel connected to the universe. It

3890
03:41:47,120 --> 03:41:53,440
also makes me feel not just humble about, you know, being a living object in the universe,

3891
03:41:53,440 --> 03:41:57,040
but the fact that it makes me really optimistic about what the universe is going to do in the

3892
03:41:57,040 --> 03:42:04,320
future, because we're not just isolated phenomena, we are connected. I will be able to have,

3893
03:42:04,320 --> 03:42:09,040
you know, one of my small objectives in life is to change the future of the universe in some

3894
03:42:09,600 --> 03:42:13,840
profound way just by existing. Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.

3895
03:42:19,200 --> 03:42:23,200
I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely, because I just realize I'm not like,

3896
03:42:23,200 --> 03:42:26,560
I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure, but I have so much overlap with the other

3897
03:42:26,560 --> 03:42:31,440
entities I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?

3898
03:42:31,440 --> 03:42:39,760
And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact on the, how this whole thing unrolls

3899
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:43,440
on the future of the world. As individuals, that's, yeah.

3900
03:42:43,440 --> 03:42:45,760
But I was going to say, local packets of agency.

3901
03:42:45,760 --> 03:42:49,920
I think we all have a profound impact on the future, some more than others, right? All human

3902
03:42:49,920 --> 03:42:54,880
beings, all life. And I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege in a way for, you know,

3903
03:42:54,880 --> 03:43:00,640
to say, to assert some degree of ego and agency, you know, I'm going to make a computer or make

3904
03:43:00,640 --> 03:43:04,960
an original life machine or do this thing. But actually, it's just like, you know, life's probably

3905
03:43:04,960 --> 03:43:09,760
living, if there is a God or there's a soul in everything, it's really laughing at us going,

3906
03:43:10,320 --> 03:43:15,120
I fool these guys by giving them ego. So they strive for this stuff and look what it does for,

3907
03:43:15,120 --> 03:43:17,840
you know, the assembly space of the universe.

3908
03:43:17,840 --> 03:43:22,160
And there's always a possibility that science can't answer all of it. So that part's challenging for

3909
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:29,680
me. There might be a limit to this thing. Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions,

3910
03:43:29,680 --> 03:43:36,160
and I demand relatively short answers. Ali, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

3911
03:43:40,960 --> 03:43:47,280
Or what's the scary thing that pops to mind? Giving lecture, giving seminars in front of

3912
03:43:47,280 --> 03:43:55,520
other scientists? Yeah, that is terrifying. If I had more time, I would ask you about the most

3913
03:43:55,520 --> 03:44:02,880
embarrassing, but we'll spare you. What about you, Sarah? Scariest thing up there? Some of the

3914
03:44:02,880 --> 03:44:09,120
scary things you've done? Actually, the scariest for me was deciding I wanted to get divorced,

3915
03:44:09,120 --> 03:44:13,840
because it was like a totally radical life. Life transformed me. Yeah, because we had been married

3916
03:44:13,840 --> 03:44:20,160
for a really long time. And I think it was just so much like, I realized so much of my

3917
03:44:20,160 --> 03:44:23,760
individual agency I didn't realize I had before, and that was just really scary,

3918
03:44:23,760 --> 03:44:29,200
like empowering scary, but terrifying. You were living in one way for your whole life,

3919
03:44:29,200 --> 03:44:33,680
and then you realized your life could be a different way. Yeah, there is a between humans.

3920
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:39,840
The beautiful thing about love is the connection you have, but it's also become the dependency

3921
03:44:39,840 --> 03:44:44,720
in breaking that, whether it's a mentor with your parents, your friends. It's almost like waking up,

3922
03:44:44,720 --> 03:44:50,000
like just there's a different reality. Yeah, that was scary. Reinventing yourself. Okay,

3923
03:44:50,000 --> 03:44:56,560
if you could, Lee, maybe I'll actually alternate. Sarah, if you could be someone else for a day,

3924
03:44:56,560 --> 03:45:02,880
someone alive today, who you haven't met yet, or maybe you could do one who you've met, who would

3925
03:45:02,880 --> 03:45:10,800
it be? Kim Kardashian. No joke. The woman's brilliant. I would just like to expere. I think

3926
03:45:10,800 --> 03:45:17,280
she's got such an interesting and very deep understanding of social reality. But you also

3927
03:45:17,280 --> 03:45:23,520
said you have appreciation of love for fashion. I do, but that's actually the same. I just think

3928
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:26,800
it's really interesting because we live in a social reality, which is completely artificially

3929
03:45:26,800 --> 03:45:30,640
constructed, and some people are really genius about moving through that, and I think she's

3930
03:45:30,640 --> 03:45:34,800
particularly good at it. I wonder if she's good at understanding her. I think it's very deeply

3931
03:45:34,800 --> 03:45:39,360
intrinsic to her. She's like surfing away. How much cognitive awareness she has of it,

3932
03:45:39,360 --> 03:45:42,960
or how strategic it is, but I think it's deeply fascinating. So I guess that's the first one

3933
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:48,640
that comes to mind. What about you, Lee, if you could be somebody for a day? Don't say Yosha Bach.

3934
03:45:49,600 --> 03:45:53,760
Don't say Kim Kardashian. Let's do off the table. Off the table.

3935
03:45:53,760 --> 03:45:59,040
No, I was going to say, I would like to be, I have to be here today. I was going to say I'd

3936
03:45:59,120 --> 03:46:06,720
like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be

3937
03:46:06,720 --> 03:46:11,440
the latest arm processor. I would like to understand, I would like to know what it feels like to

3938
03:46:11,440 --> 03:46:17,360
basically... You like being objects. I like being, I've always obsessed with being objects

3939
03:46:17,360 --> 03:46:21,360
ever since I was a kid. What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day? I mean,

3940
03:46:21,360 --> 03:46:25,840
I'd like to understand how I access my memory, what anticipates coming next in clock cycles.

3941
03:46:25,840 --> 03:46:30,080
What about how it feels like? Yeah, I wonder how it feels like to be...

3942
03:46:30,080 --> 03:46:33,520
Yeah, to be useful. Thanks for that.

3943
03:46:37,360 --> 03:46:43,920
All right. If, Lee, if everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left,

3944
03:46:43,920 --> 03:46:47,840
what would your days look like? What would you do? Nobody else left impressed?

3945
03:46:48,720 --> 03:46:54,880
Nobody, no, probably can't really do any real science at scale. What would you do with your

3946
03:46:54,880 --> 03:47:00,480
remaining days out there? Yeah, every possible tool I could and put it in my workshop and just

3947
03:47:00,480 --> 03:47:06,480
make stuff. So try to make stuff. Just try and make stuff. Make companions. I'm probably not making

3948
03:47:06,480 --> 03:47:12,400
companions, probably, yeah. Probably just in the physical space. Yeah. What about you, sir? What

3949
03:47:12,400 --> 03:47:17,040
would you, when you're just left alone on earth, you're the last one? Are there animals in this

3950
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:24,400
scenario? Nothing. No living beings. No plants? No plants. Oh, interesting. I was going to say,

3951
03:47:25,120 --> 03:47:28,160
I would try to walk the entire planet, at least all the landmass.

3952
03:47:28,800 --> 03:47:35,680
Well, that's true. So you probably don't know if there's stuff. You could be searching for plants

3953
03:47:35,680 --> 03:47:45,440
or other humans. What would I eat? You just have daily just allotment. No, but I would just walk

3954
03:47:45,440 --> 03:47:50,560
all the time. Of soylent. I don't know why I... Just walk. You're the explorer. I would just walk.

3955
03:47:51,280 --> 03:47:55,200
And I guess I would make a goal of covering all of the entire earth, because what else are you

3956
03:47:55,200 --> 03:47:59,920
going to do with your time? What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah, that you haven't done yet,

3957
03:47:59,920 --> 03:48:11,280
but you hope to do? Skydiving. Travel to space. I don't know. You know what's funny with my bucket

3958
03:48:11,280 --> 03:48:15,760
list? I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off. Always check it off. So your bucket

3959
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:21,680
list is like a fog. It's like a mystery. Yeah. Almost by doing it. Yeah. So it's very subconsciously

3960
03:48:21,680 --> 03:48:26,400
driven. So it's in your subconscious in there? I think so. You're bringing it to the surface.

3961
03:48:26,400 --> 03:48:29,760
I think most of the steering of our agency is in our subconscious anyway. So I just kind of go

3962
03:48:29,760 --> 03:48:36,000
with the flow. But I guess, no, seriously. Yeah, no, I get it. I don't know. I guess that, but I

3963
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:38,960
would like to go in a submarine, like to the bottom of the ocean. I think that'd be really cool.

3964
03:48:38,960 --> 03:48:43,840
To the bottom of the ocean. Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean? I am. Yeah.

3965
03:48:44,720 --> 03:48:51,120
Yeah. What about you, Lee? What item on your bucket list? I don't have a bucket list,

3966
03:48:51,120 --> 03:48:56,640
but I've just made one. I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars and make drugs off

3967
03:48:56,640 --> 03:49:02,480
world. Be the first chemist to make drugs off world. The first drug manufacturer in space?

3968
03:49:02,480 --> 03:49:06,400
Yeah. Why not? Drugs in space. Do they have to be somehow, like be able to

3969
03:49:06,400 --> 03:49:12,240
have a tape, like be able to survive on that particular space? Or like what's the connection

3970
03:49:12,320 --> 03:49:15,680
between being on Mars and do many things? I just would like to be that. I'd like to take

3971
03:49:16,800 --> 03:49:23,040
the ability to have command and control over chemicals programmatically off earth to somewhere

3972
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:27,600
else in the universe. That just seems like you like difficulty engineering problems.

3973
03:49:28,640 --> 03:49:32,480
Before I die, if I can do that, that's great. Would you travel to space? Yeah. Yeah, that's

3974
03:49:32,480 --> 03:49:36,720
what I'm saying. I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist. I want to take

3975
03:49:36,720 --> 03:49:40,480
scientific experiment in space and do a thing in space that's never been done before.

3976
03:49:41,200 --> 03:49:47,200
That's a real possibility. Yeah. So that's why there's no point in listing things I can't do.

3977
03:49:48,960 --> 03:49:54,640
All right. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget?

3978
03:49:56,240 --> 03:50:02,480
Small act of kindness, not big. Somebody was just kind to you. Somebody did something sweet.

3979
03:50:03,200 --> 03:50:13,360
When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out with... Basically, I needed a computer.

3980
03:50:13,360 --> 03:50:17,120
I needed some power, computation power, and someone took pity on me and helped me.

3981
03:50:18,240 --> 03:50:22,880
I was really touched. They didn't have to. They were actually quite a disabled scientist.

3982
03:50:22,880 --> 03:50:27,440
They had other things to do rather than help some random PhD student, gave me access,

3983
03:50:27,440 --> 03:50:31,600
taught me a little stuff. Yeah. Actually, when you're a grad student or when you're a student,

3984
03:50:31,600 --> 03:50:37,920
when you're a student, the younger it is, the better. The attention, the support,

3985
03:50:37,920 --> 03:50:42,480
the love you get from an older person, the teacher, something like that is super powerful.

3986
03:50:42,480 --> 03:50:47,120
It's fascinating. And from the perspective of the teacher, they might not realize the impact

3987
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:54,480
they have, but that little bit, those few words, a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.

3988
03:50:54,480 --> 03:50:59,280
What about you, Sarah? Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point.

3989
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:04,080
I love free Starbucks. I like it when you're in the line at Starbucks, and somebody buys

3990
03:51:04,080 --> 03:51:07,600
your coffee in front of you, and then you buy the next one. I love those, but that's not my

3991
03:51:07,600 --> 03:51:11,200
example. I love that too. Those are great. It makes me happy. And then my kids get all excited

3992
03:51:11,200 --> 03:51:20,000
when we do it, when we go in, for the first ones in line doing it. I guess I can use a similar

3993
03:51:20,000 --> 03:51:26,960
example about just being a student. Paul Davies is a very well-known theoretical physicist, and I

3994
03:51:29,280 --> 03:51:34,400
was generous enough with his time to take me on as a postdoc. But before I became his postdoc,

3995
03:51:34,400 --> 03:51:37,760
he invited me to a workshop at Arizona State University and the Beyond Center and

3996
03:51:38,960 --> 03:51:42,560
took a walk with me around campus just to talk about ideas after. And I think

3997
03:51:43,200 --> 03:51:50,400
there were two things that were completely generous about that. One is Paul's philosophy is

3998
03:51:50,400 --> 03:51:55,280
always interacting with young people. It's like you interact with a mind in the room. It doesn't

3999
03:51:55,280 --> 03:52:01,440
matter how well-known or whatever. It's like you evaluate the person for the person. But he also

4000
03:52:01,440 --> 03:52:07,040
gave me a book, The Urie Silence, that he had written, and he wrote in it. This is how EE gets

4001
03:52:07,040 --> 03:52:12,960
to ET, which was an anti-meric excess, which I worked on as a PhD student. It was the original

4002
03:52:12,960 --> 03:52:16,960
homochirality, all the way up to what the book was about, which was, are we alone in the university,

4003
03:52:16,960 --> 03:52:23,920
and is there an intelligent life out there? And it was just so much about the questions I wanted

4004
03:52:24,000 --> 03:52:29,040
to ask, because it was just everything about, it was just really, really kind.

4005
03:52:29,760 --> 03:52:34,320
Like that it's okay to ask these questions, and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.

4006
03:52:34,320 --> 03:52:38,400
I think a lot of my career is mostly his encouragement to ask deep questions. He gave

4007
03:52:38,400 --> 03:52:42,880
me the space to do it in ways that a lot of previous mentors had. I mean, I've had a good

4008
03:52:42,880 --> 03:52:47,200
experience with mentors, but it was like go off the deep end to ask the hardest questions.

4009
03:52:47,760 --> 03:52:49,760
And I think that's the best gift you can give somebody.

4010
03:52:50,400 --> 03:52:54,240
What would you, because you're both fascinating minds, and non, I would say,

4011
03:52:55,680 --> 03:53:02,960
non-standard in the best possible way. Is there advice you can give to young folks how to be

4012
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:06,960
non-standard, how to stand out, novelty, how to generate novelty?

4013
03:53:06,960 --> 03:53:09,280
That's what I want on my tombstone. I have one.

4014
03:53:10,160 --> 03:53:12,400
He generated novelty.

4015
03:53:12,400 --> 03:53:13,200
No, no, how to.

4016
03:53:13,760 --> 03:53:14,000
How to.

4017
03:53:14,960 --> 03:53:23,120
How still. I just love doing science. And so when I was younger, I was just wanted, I mean,

4018
03:53:23,120 --> 03:53:28,000
I'm still not sure I'm a real scientist, right? So I want to try. So my advice for the young people

4019
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:34,640
is just, if you love asking questions, then don't be afraid to ask the question, even if it pisses

4020
03:53:34,640 --> 03:53:39,040
people off, because if you piss people off, you're probably asking the right question.

4021
03:53:39,840 --> 03:53:43,760
What I would say, though, is don't do what I did, which is just piss everyone off.

4022
03:53:44,400 --> 03:53:51,440
Try and work out how to, you know, I think, if you're, if other people challenge by your questions,

4023
03:53:52,800 --> 03:53:58,320
you will get not only your respect, but people will give you, create space for you,

4024
03:53:58,320 --> 03:54:04,400
because you're doing something really new. I really try to create space in my academic career,

4025
03:54:04,960 --> 03:54:10,080
my team, really try and praise them and push them to do new things. So

4026
03:54:10,080 --> 03:54:16,080
my advice is try to do new things, get feedback, and the universe will help you.

4027
03:54:18,400 --> 03:54:19,840
Because the universe likes novelty.

4028
03:54:19,840 --> 03:54:21,600
I think so. I think so, right?

4029
03:54:21,600 --> 03:54:23,200
This one will keep them around.

4030
03:54:24,240 --> 03:54:29,360
What about you, Sarah? You two like to ask the really out there.

4031
03:54:29,840 --> 03:54:36,080
Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them. So I think it goes back to the love,

4032
03:54:36,080 --> 03:54:39,280
like if you're doing the thing you're supposed to be doing, you should really love it.

4033
03:54:40,400 --> 03:54:43,200
So I always tell people that they should do the thing they're most passionate about,

4034
03:54:43,200 --> 03:54:49,200
but I think a flip side of that is that's when you become in somebody, like not to sound cheesy,

4035
03:54:49,200 --> 03:54:54,000
but like your best version of yourself. So I guess, like for me, as I become more successful

4036
03:54:54,000 --> 03:54:58,560
in my career, I feel like I can be more myself as an individual. And so there's this, I've always

4037
03:54:58,560 --> 03:55:03,520
been following the questions I'm most interested in, which very early on I was discouraged from

4038
03:55:03,520 --> 03:55:07,360
knowing by many people because they thought they were unanswerable questions. And I always just

4039
03:55:07,360 --> 03:55:12,240
thought, well, if no one's even trying to answer them, of course they're going to be unanswerable.

4040
03:55:12,240 --> 03:55:16,720
And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint. But the more I found my way in that space,

4041
03:55:16,720 --> 03:55:21,760
the more I also made a space for myself as a person, because you're basically

4042
03:55:21,760 --> 03:55:29,280
generating the niche that you want to exist in. And so I think that's part of it,

4043
03:55:29,280 --> 03:55:34,320
is not just to follow your passion, but also think about like, who do you want to be and create that?

4044
03:55:35,600 --> 03:55:40,240
Yeah, who am I? Who do you want to be? I mean, I play temporarily with it.

4045
03:55:40,800 --> 03:55:44,480
Yeah, who am I now? Who do I want to be now? But who do I want to be in the future? They're not

4046
03:55:44,480 --> 03:55:52,800
decoupled. Yeah, I always wonder if that's like, if I become something, am I finding myself? Or am

4047
03:55:52,800 --> 03:55:59,120
I creating myself? Yeah. And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing. I do feel often

4048
03:55:59,120 --> 03:56:06,080
like that I was always meant to be this kind of thing. Yeah. But is that created or discovered?

4049
03:56:06,080 --> 03:56:11,600
I don't know. But basically go towards that direction. If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah.

4050
03:56:12,160 --> 03:56:19,200
Excellent. I'm waiting. They come find me. They're on a spaceship. And then they somehow figured

4051
03:56:19,200 --> 03:56:30,160
out the language you speak and ask you, what are you? What explain yourself? Not you, Sarah, but

4052
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:40,000
the species. Oh. What's life on earth? Like we don't have time or busy grad students from another

4053
03:56:40,640 --> 03:56:46,640
planet. I see. What's interesting about human civilization? What's interesting about you?

4054
03:56:47,600 --> 03:56:51,360
You specifically too. They could be very kind of personal and kind of pushy.

4055
03:56:53,440 --> 03:57:01,120
And yeah, how would you describe? Okay, I have one. Because, you know,

4056
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:05,680
obviously I self-identify as a scientist and a physicist, but intrinsically I feel more like

4057
03:57:05,680 --> 03:57:09,280
an artist. But it's almost like you're an artist that you don't know what you're painting yet.

4058
03:57:10,160 --> 03:57:17,040
And I guess I feel like that's humanity. Like in some sense, we're creating something I think

4059
03:57:17,040 --> 03:57:21,600
is profound and potentially very beautiful. Like it exists in the universe, but we're just so

4060
03:57:22,400 --> 03:57:28,240
night, like not night. We're just early. We're early. We're young. We don't know what we're doing yet.

4061
03:57:28,240 --> 03:57:32,480
Yeah. What's with the nuclear weapons? There's a big question too. Like what are you guys?

4062
03:57:32,480 --> 03:57:37,040
What are we doing with them? This creativity that you talk about. It sounds very nice, but it's

4063
03:57:37,680 --> 03:57:43,040
we're making things that are like very destructive and like the rockets. This seems very aggressive.

4064
03:57:43,680 --> 03:57:50,480
Yeah, I know. This is my blinders on. I don't know. I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation

4065
03:57:50,480 --> 03:57:55,360
about suffering. I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects of reality into what I want to

4066
03:57:55,920 --> 03:58:01,120
envision. And that's obviously problematic. But, you know, nuclear power has also given us a

4067
03:58:01,120 --> 03:58:09,040
lot of good things. So both human nature, both human beings and the technology we create has

4068
03:58:09,040 --> 03:58:12,560
the capacity for evil and the capacity for good. Yeah. And we can't all be good all the time.

4069
03:58:12,560 --> 03:58:17,600
I mean, there's like this huge misnomer that you need to be liked by everyone universally. And

4070
03:58:17,600 --> 03:58:22,560
obviously that's like an ideal, but it's physically impossible. Like you can't get a group of people

4071
03:58:22,560 --> 03:58:27,360
in the room and have everyone like each other all the time. So I think that kind of tension is

4072
03:58:27,360 --> 03:58:33,040
actually really important that we have different aesthetics, different goals,

4073
03:58:34,800 --> 03:58:42,080
and sometimes conflict comes out of that. Speaking of which, do you and Yosha Bach ever

4074
03:58:42,080 --> 03:58:47,200
say anything nice to each other? Or is it always conflict? We never have conflict. We argue,

4075
03:58:47,200 --> 03:58:52,160
but I don't think they argue. Arguments are bad. I mean, I think the problem I have,

4076
03:58:52,240 --> 03:58:56,000
not problem, I think. Here we go. And he's not here to defend himself.

4077
03:58:56,000 --> 03:59:01,520
No, I just, I don't necessarily understand the, the, I mean, he's just talking at such a high

4078
03:59:01,520 --> 03:59:07,280
level. You know, I'm a dimwit. So I'm like, I spend some, so I think a lot of our conflict,

4079
03:59:07,280 --> 03:59:10,960
it's not conflict, we actually, we actually have a, I think, I mean, I can't speak for Yosha,

4080
03:59:10,960 --> 03:59:16,240
I have a deep appreciation for him. He's brilliant. But I think I'm kind of frustrated and I'm trying

4081
03:59:16,240 --> 03:59:23,440
to, he thinks the universe is a computer and I want to turn the universe into a computer.

4082
03:59:23,440 --> 03:59:27,920
Yeah. That's, that's a small disagreement. So what would you, how would you defend your life

4083
03:59:27,920 --> 03:59:32,800
to an alien when you're being abducted? Would you focus on the specifics of your life?

4084
03:59:32,800 --> 03:59:37,040
No, no, no, I would be, I would try and be as random as possible and try and confuse them.

4085
03:59:37,040 --> 03:59:44,480
Oh, good. Good. Excellent. That might be the wiser choice.

4086
03:59:45,120 --> 03:59:47,680
The Easter eggs in reality? No, I mean, if aliens are abducted,

4087
03:59:47,680 --> 03:59:51,520
No, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible. I would try and do something that

4088
03:59:51,520 --> 03:59:54,720
would surprise the hell out of them, which I thought, I mean, they're probably risking,

4089
03:59:54,720 --> 03:59:56,720
they might kill me, but I think that might be funny.

4090
03:59:57,520 --> 04:00:00,320
Yeah, they might want to study you for prolonged periods of time.

4091
04:00:00,320 --> 04:00:04,960
My reasoning is if I wanted to stay alive, okay, so if the thing is I wasn't going back to Earth

4092
04:00:04,960 --> 04:00:08,800
and the job was to stay alive, if I could be as surprising as possible, they'd keep me around

4093
04:00:08,800 --> 04:00:14,560
like a pet, right? Pet Lee on the aliens. So you'd be okay being a pet?

4094
04:00:14,560 --> 04:00:19,520
Well, no, but I mean, the last human that survives would just be a pet to the alien.

4095
04:00:19,520 --> 04:00:24,960
I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun because then I might get some feedback

4096
04:00:24,960 --> 04:00:28,880
from their curiosity, but yeah. Let me ask you this question, given our

4097
04:00:28,880 --> 04:00:34,800
conversation has a very different meaning, more profoundly perhaps, but would you rather lose

4098
04:00:34,800 --> 04:00:39,040
all of your old memories or never be able to make new ones?

4099
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:46,480
I would have to lose all my old memories.

4100
04:00:47,520 --> 04:00:52,240
Again, it's the novelty. What about you, Sarah?

4101
04:00:52,240 --> 04:00:57,120
I'm the same because I don't think like it's about the future experience, right? And in some sense,

4102
04:00:57,760 --> 04:01:02,080
like you were saying earlier, most of our lived experience is actually in our memories. So if

4103
04:01:02,080 --> 04:01:05,360
you can't generate new memories, it's like you're not alive anymore.

4104
04:01:07,920 --> 04:01:13,040
What comforts you on bad days? When you look at human civilization, when you look at your own

4105
04:01:13,040 --> 04:01:19,600
life, what gives you hope? What makes you feel good about what we're doing about life at the

4106
04:01:19,600 --> 04:01:24,720
small scale of you as a human and at the big scale of us as a human civilization, maybe the

4107
04:01:24,720 --> 04:01:32,880
big scale of the universe? Children, my kids, but I also mean that in like a grand sense of like,

4108
04:01:33,680 --> 04:01:40,320
not a grand, but like, like future minds in some sense. So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,

4109
04:01:40,320 --> 04:01:44,320
you know, people worry about apocalyptic things like AI existential risk and climate change,

4110
04:01:44,320 --> 04:01:48,480
which children of men, you know, the whole premise of the movie was there can be no

4111
04:01:48,480 --> 04:01:53,520
children born on the entire planet. And the youngest person on the planet is like 18 years old or

4112
04:01:53,520 --> 04:01:59,200
something. Like, can you imagine a world without children? It's just, it's harrowing. That's the

4113
04:01:59,200 --> 04:02:07,760
scariest thing. So I think what gives me hope is always youth and the hope of children and the,

4114
04:02:07,760 --> 04:02:11,760
you know, the possibilities of the future they see. And they grow up in a completely different

4115
04:02:11,760 --> 04:02:19,440
reality than adults do. And I think we have a hard time seeing what their reality actually looks like.

4116
04:02:19,440 --> 04:02:23,040
But I think, I think most of the time it's super interesting.

4117
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:28,960
Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination, they have this kind of excitement. So it's so

4118
04:02:28,960 --> 04:02:36,560
cool. So fun to watch. And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way of all that

4119
04:02:37,840 --> 04:02:43,440
imagination. What about you, what gives you hope? So when I go back to my eight year old self,

4120
04:02:44,480 --> 04:02:48,800
the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year old self was this world in which technology became

4121
04:02:48,800 --> 04:02:54,320
programmable and there was internet and I get information. And I would expand my consciousness

4122
04:02:54,320 --> 04:03:01,760
by just, you know, getting access to everything that was going on. And this happened in my lifetime.

4123
04:03:01,760 --> 04:03:05,360
I mean, really do have that. I mean, okay, there's some bad things, you know, there's TikTok,

4124
04:03:05,360 --> 04:03:09,120
everyone just don't whatever, all the bad things about social media. But I think,

4125
04:03:12,320 --> 04:03:17,520
I mean, I can't quite believe my luck being born now. So amazing.

4126
04:03:18,080 --> 04:03:20,240
Be able to program reality in some way.

4127
04:03:20,240 --> 04:03:23,760
Yeah. And the thing that I really find fascinating about human beings

4128
04:03:24,720 --> 04:03:30,080
is that just how ingenious they are. I'm, you know, whether it's from my kids,

4129
04:03:31,040 --> 04:03:38,960
my research group, my peers, other companies, just how ingenious everyone is. And I'm pretty

4130
04:03:38,960 --> 04:03:44,640
sure humanity has a, or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital part in the future

4131
04:03:45,360 --> 04:03:48,880
is going to have a lot of fun. And I'm just, yeah, it's just, it's just mind blowing,

4132
04:03:48,880 --> 04:03:55,120
just to watch. And you know, so humans are ingenious. And I hope to help them be more

4133
04:03:55,120 --> 04:04:01,360
ingenious if I can. Well, what gives me hope, what makes me feel good on bad days is the existence

4134
04:04:01,360 --> 04:04:08,240
of wild minds like yours, novelty generators, assembly structures that generate novelty

4135
04:04:08,880 --> 04:04:11,520
and do so beautifully. And then tweet about it.

4136
04:04:12,480 --> 04:04:16,720
Sarah, this, I really, really enjoyed talking to you. I enjoy following you. I'm a huge fan.

4137
04:04:17,440 --> 04:04:21,600
Sarah Lee, I hope, I hope to talk to you many times in the future, maybe with your Shabak.

4138
04:04:21,600 --> 04:04:24,880
You're just incredible people. Thank you for everything you do. You're awesome.

4139
04:04:24,880 --> 04:04:26,560
Thank you for talking today. I really, really appreciate it.

4140
04:04:26,560 --> 04:04:27,360
Just relax. Thanks.

4141
04:04:27,360 --> 04:04:28,640
Yeah, I'm brilliant to be here.

4142
04:04:29,680 --> 04:04:34,320
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin. To support this podcast,

4143
04:04:34,320 --> 04:04:39,200
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

4144
04:04:39,200 --> 04:04:47,760
Arthur C. Clarke. Two possibilities exist. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.

4145
04:04:48,800 --> 04:04:57,360
Both are equally terrifying. And let me, if I may, add to that by saying that both possibilities,

4146
04:04:57,360 --> 04:05:02,960
at least to me, are both terrifying and exciting. And keeping these two feelings in my heart

4147
04:05:02,960 --> 04:05:09,280
is a fun way to explore, to wander, to think, and to live always a little bit on the edge of madness.

4148
04:05:10,080 --> 04:05:18,880
Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
