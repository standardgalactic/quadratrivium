00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
I hope with my books, I'm saying this isn't a how-to guide, but this is somebody you can walk

00:07.520 --> 00:15.600
alongside. You can see Einstein growing up Jewish in Germany. You can see Jennifer Doudna

00:15.600 --> 00:24.480
growing up or as an outsider, Leonardo da Vinci or Elon Musk in really violent South Africa

00:24.480 --> 00:30.720
with a psychologically difficult father and getting off the train when he goes to anti-apartheid

00:30.720 --> 00:37.200
concert with his brother and there's a man with a knife sticking out of his head and they step

00:37.200 --> 00:45.040
into the pool of blood and it's sticky on their souls. This causes, you know, scars that last

00:45.040 --> 00:52.240
the rest of your life and the question is not, how do you avoid getting scarred? It's, you know,

00:52.240 --> 00:59.440
how do you deal with it? The following is a conversation with Walter Isaacson,

00:59.440 --> 01:05.840
one of the greatest biography writers ever, having written incredible books on Albert Einstein, Steve

01:05.840 --> 01:13.360
Jobs, Leonardo da Vinci, Jennifer Doudna, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger, and now a new one on

01:13.360 --> 01:20.880
Elon Musk. We talked for hours on and off the mic. I'm sure we'll talk many more times. Walter is a

01:20.960 --> 01:28.000
truly special writer, thinker, observer, and human being. I highly recommend people read his

01:28.000 --> 01:34.960
new book on Elon. I'm sure there will be short term controversy, but in the long term, I think it

01:34.960 --> 01:40.320
will inspire millions of young people, especially with difficult childhoods, with hardship in their

01:40.320 --> 01:46.400
surroundings or in their own minds to take on the hardest problems in the world and to build solutions

01:46.400 --> 01:53.360
to those problems, no matter how impossible the odds. In this conversation, Walter and I cover

01:53.360 --> 01:58.880
all of his books and use personal stories from them to speak to the bigger principles of striving

01:58.880 --> 02:06.640
for greatness in science, in tech, engineering, art, politics, and life. There are many things

02:06.640 --> 02:12.480
in the new Elon book that I felt are best saved for when I speak to Elon directly again on this

02:12.480 --> 02:19.600
podcast, which will be soon enough. Perhaps it's also good to mention here that my friendships,

02:19.600 --> 02:26.800
like with Elon, nor any other influence like money, access, fame, power will ever result

02:26.800 --> 02:32.800
in me sacrificing my integrity, ever. I do like to celebrate the good in people,

02:32.800 --> 02:38.720
to empathize and to understand, but I also like to call people out on their bullshit

02:39.360 --> 02:47.120
with respect and with compassion. If I fail, I fail due to a lack of skill, not a lack of integrity.

02:47.120 --> 02:53.200
I'll work hard to improve. This is the Lex Rudin podcast. To support it, please check

02:53.200 --> 02:58.960
out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Walter Isaacson.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.520
What is the role of a difficult childhood in the lives of great men and women, great minds?

03:05.520 --> 03:10.960
Is that a requirement? Is it a catalyst, or is it just a simple coincidence of fate?

03:10.960 --> 03:15.360
Well, it's not a requirement. Some people with happy childhoods do quite well,

03:16.160 --> 03:23.440
but it certainly is true that a lot of really driven people are driven because they're harnessing

03:23.440 --> 03:29.280
the demons of their childhood. Even Barack Obama's sentence in his memoirs, which is,

03:29.280 --> 03:34.640
I think, every successful man is either trying to live up to the expectations of his father or

03:34.640 --> 03:40.080
live down the sins of his father. And for Elon, it's especially true because he had

03:40.080 --> 03:45.520
both a violent and difficult childhood and a very psychologically problematic father.

03:46.240 --> 03:54.400
He's got those demons dancing around in his head, and by harnessing them, it's part of the reason

03:55.040 --> 04:01.360
that he does riskier, more adventurous, wilder things than maybe I would ever do.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.360
You've written that Elon talked about his father and that at times it felt like mental torture,

04:10.480 --> 04:15.600
the interaction with him during his childhood. Can you describe some of the things you've learned?

04:16.080 --> 04:25.200
Yeah, well, Elon and Kimball would tell me that, for example, when Elon got bullied on the playground

04:25.200 --> 04:30.560
and one day was pushed down some concrete steps and had his face pummeled so badly that Kimball

04:30.560 --> 04:35.040
said, I couldn't really recognize him. I mean, he was in the hospital for almost a week, but when

04:35.040 --> 04:42.240
he came home, Elon had to stand in front of his father, and his father berated him for more than

04:42.240 --> 04:48.320
an hour and said he was stupid and took the side of the person who had beaten him.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.520
That's probably one of the more traumatic events of Elon's life.

04:51.520 --> 04:57.520
Yes, and there's also Veld School, which is a sort of power military camp that young South

04:57.520 --> 05:06.160
African boys got sent to. At one point, he was scrawny. He has very bad at picking up social cues

05:06.160 --> 05:13.760
and emotional cues. He talks about being Asperger's. He gets traumatized at a camp like that.

05:13.760 --> 05:18.400
But the second time he went, he'd gotten bigger. He had shot up to almost six feet and he'd learned

05:18.400 --> 05:24.400
a little bit of judo. He realized that if he was getting beaten up, it might hurt him, but

05:24.400 --> 05:30.000
he would just punch the person in the nose as hard as possible, so that sense of always

05:30.000 --> 05:36.240
punching back has also been ingrained in Elon. I spent a lot of time talking to Errol Musk,

05:36.240 --> 05:42.320
his father. Elon didn't talk to Errol Musk anymore, his father, nor does Kimball. It's been years,

05:42.880 --> 05:49.920
and Errol doesn't even have Errol's email. A lot of times, Errol would be sending me emails,

05:50.480 --> 05:58.960
and Errol had one of those Jekyll and Hyde personalities. He was a great mind of engineering,

05:58.960 --> 06:06.640
and especially material science. I knew how to build a wilderness camp in South Africa using

06:06.640 --> 06:13.600
mica and how it would not conduct the heat. But he also would go into these dark periods

06:13.600 --> 06:22.480
in which he would just be psychologically abusive. Of course, Maymosk says to me, his mother, who

06:22.480 --> 06:30.240
divorced Errol early on, said, the danger for Elon is that he becomes his father. Every now

06:30.240 --> 06:35.840
and then, you've been with him so much, Lex, and you know him well. He'll even talk to you

06:35.840 --> 06:41.760
about the demons, about Diablo dancing in his head. He gets it, he's self-aware,

06:41.760 --> 06:48.880
but you've probably seen him at times where those demons take over, and he goes really dark and

06:48.880 --> 06:57.840
really quiet. Grimes says, I can tell a minute or two in advance when demon mode is about to

06:57.840 --> 07:03.440
happen, and he'll go a bit dark. I was here at Austin, wanted dinner with a group,

07:04.160 --> 07:09.280
and you could tell suddenly something had triggered him, and he was going to go dark.

07:09.280 --> 07:15.680
I've watched it in meetings where somebody will say, we can't make that part for less than $200,

07:15.680 --> 07:22.800
or no, that's wrong, and he'll berate them, and then he snaps out of it. As you know that too,

07:22.800 --> 07:27.760
the huge snap out where suddenly he's showing you a Monty Python sketch on his phone and he's

07:27.760 --> 07:33.520
joking about things. I think coming out of the childhood, there were just many facets,

07:33.520 --> 07:39.440
maybe even many personalities, the engineering mode, the silly mode, the charismatic mode,

07:39.440 --> 07:45.440
the visionary mode, but also the demon in dark mode. A quote you cited about Elon really stood

07:45.440 --> 07:52.080
out to me. I forget who it was from, but inside the man, he's still there as a child, the child

07:52.080 --> 08:00.000
standing in front of his dad. That was Tallulah, his second wife, and she's great. She's an English

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
actress. They've been married twice, actually. Tallulah said that's just him from his childhood.

08:06.000 --> 08:14.160
He's a drama addict. Kimball says that as well. I asked why, and Tallulah said,

08:16.000 --> 08:24.400
for him, love and family are associated with those psychological torments, and in many ways,

08:24.400 --> 08:31.280
he'll channel. Tallulah would be with him in 2008 when the company was going back,

08:31.280 --> 08:37.200
whatever it may have been or later, and he would be so stressed he would vomit,

08:37.840 --> 08:43.360
and then he would channel things that his father had said, use phrases his father had said to him,

08:44.160 --> 08:50.720
and so she told me deep inside the man is this man child still standing in front of his father.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.400
To what degree is that true for many of us, do you think?

08:55.200 --> 09:01.920
I think it's true, but in many different ways. I'll say something personal, which is I was

09:01.920 --> 09:07.280
blessed, and perhaps it's a bit of a downside too, with the fact that I had the greatest father

09:07.280 --> 09:11.840
you could ever imagine and mother. They were the kindest people you'd ever want to meet. I grew

09:11.840 --> 09:17.520
up in a magical place in New Orleans. My dad was an engineer, an electrical engineer, and

09:18.400 --> 09:28.400
he was always kind. Perhaps I'm not quite as driven or as crazed. I don't have to prove things,

09:28.400 --> 09:35.600
so I get to write about Elon Musk. I get to write about Einstein or Steve Jobs or Leonardo da Vinci,

09:35.600 --> 09:41.520
who, as you know, was totally torn by demons and had different difficult childhood situations,

09:41.520 --> 09:49.280
not even legitimized by his father. Sometimes those of us who are lucky enough to have

09:49.280 --> 09:56.960
really gentle, sweet childhood, we grow up with fewer demons, but we grow up with fewer drives,

09:56.960 --> 10:05.600
and we end up maybe being Boswell and not being Dr. Johnson. We end up being the observer,

10:05.600 --> 10:12.960
not being the doer, and so I always respect those who are in the arena. I don't, you know-

10:12.960 --> 10:15.920
You don't see yourself as a man in the arena.

10:15.920 --> 10:23.600
I've had a gentle, sweet career, and I've got to cover really interesting people,

10:23.600 --> 10:28.800
but I've never shot off a rocket that might someday get to Mars. I've never moved us into

10:28.800 --> 10:33.440
the air of electric vehicles. I've never stayed up all night on the factory floor.

10:34.400 --> 10:47.680
I don't have quite those either the drives or the addiction to risk. I mean, Elon's addicted to

10:47.680 --> 10:55.680
risk. He's addicted to adventure. Me, if I see something that's risky, I spend some time calculating,

10:56.000 --> 11:04.720
upside-downside here, but that's another reason that people like Elon Musk get stuff done,

11:05.600 --> 11:08.560
and people like me write about the Elon Musk's.

11:09.360 --> 11:15.840
One other aspect of this, given a difficult childhood, whether it's Elon or Da Vinci,

11:15.920 --> 11:24.240
I wonder if there's some wisdom, some advice almost that you can draw,

11:25.360 --> 11:28.480
that you can give to people with difficult childhoods.

11:29.120 --> 11:35.440
I think all of us have demons, even those of us who grew up in a magical part of New Orleans

11:35.440 --> 11:44.960
with sweet parents, and we all have demons, and rule one in life is harness your demons.

11:44.960 --> 11:50.960
Know that you're ambitious or not ambitious or you're lazy or whatever. Leonardo Da Vinci knew

11:50.960 --> 12:01.520
he was a procrastinator. I think it's useful to know what's eating at you, know how to harness it,

12:04.080 --> 12:11.440
also know what you're good at. I'll take Musk as another example. I'm a little bit more like

12:11.440 --> 12:18.960
Kimball Musk than Elon. I maybe got over-endowed with the empathy gene. What does that mean?

12:20.240 --> 12:26.560
It means that I was okay when I ran Time Magazine. It was a group of about 150 people on the editorial

12:26.560 --> 12:34.080
floors, and I knew them all, and we had a jolly time. When I went to CNN, I was not very good

12:34.080 --> 12:40.960
at being a manager or an executive of an organization. I cared a little bit too much

12:40.960 --> 12:49.680
that people didn't get annoyed at me or mad at me. Elon said that about John McNeil, for example,

12:49.680 --> 12:54.160
who was president of Tesla. It's in the book. I talked to John McNeil a long time,

12:54.720 --> 13:03.040
and he says, Elon just would fire people. We're really rough on people. He didn't have the empathy

13:03.040 --> 13:09.040
for the people in front of him. Elon says, yeah, that's right. John McNeil couldn't fire people.

13:09.040 --> 13:14.880
He cared more about pleasing the people in front of him than pleasing the entire enterprise or

13:14.880 --> 13:21.840
getting things done. Being over-endowed with the desire to please people can make you less tough

13:21.840 --> 13:29.200
of a manager. That doesn't mean there aren't great people who are over-endowed. Ben Franklin,

13:29.200 --> 13:35.520
over-endowed with the desire to please people. The worst criticism of him from John Adams and

13:35.520 --> 13:43.680
others was that he was insinuating, which meant he was always trying to get people to like him.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.480
But that turned out to be a good thing. When they can't figure out the big state, little

13:48.480 --> 13:52.880
state issue at the Constitutional Convention, when they can't figure out the Treaty of Paris,

13:52.880 --> 14:01.200
whatever it is, he brings people together, and that is his superpower. To get back to the lessons

14:01.280 --> 14:08.640
you asked, and the first was harness your demons. The second is to know your strengths and your

14:08.640 --> 14:16.080
superpower. My superpower is definitely not being a tough manager. After running CNN for a while,

14:16.080 --> 14:21.040
I said, okay, I think I've proven I don't really enjoy this or know how to do this well.

14:24.160 --> 14:28.720
Do I have other talents? Yeah, I think I have the talent to observe people really closely,

14:29.440 --> 14:35.520
to write about it in a straight, but I hope interesting narrative style. That's a power.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.160
It's totally different from running an organization. It took me until three years of

14:40.160 --> 14:48.880
running CNN that I realized I'm not cut to be an executive in a really high-intense

14:50.320 --> 14:58.160
situation. Elon Musk is cut to be an executive in a highly intense situation, so much so that when

14:58.160 --> 15:04.880
things get less intense, when they actually are making enough cars and rockets are going up and

15:04.880 --> 15:10.480
landing, he thinks of something else, so he can surge and have more intensity. He's addicted to

15:10.480 --> 15:17.840
intensity, and that's his superpower, which is a lot greater than the superpower of being a good

15:17.840 --> 15:27.600
observer. I think also to build on that, it's not just addiction to risk and drama. There's always

15:27.600 --> 15:38.240
a big mission above it. I would say it's an empathy towards people in the big picture.

15:39.040 --> 15:45.040
It's an empathy towards humanity more than the empathy towards the three or four humans who

15:45.040 --> 15:51.120
might be sitting in the conference room with you. That's a big deal. You see that in a lot of people.

15:51.120 --> 16:01.920
You see it, Bill Gates, Larry Summers, Elon Musk. They always have empathy for these great

16:01.920 --> 16:09.200
goals of humanity, and at times they can be clueless about the emotions of the people

16:09.200 --> 16:16.160
in front of them, or callous sometimes. Musk, as you said, is driven by mission more than any

16:16.160 --> 16:25.200
person I've ever seen. His only mission is like cosmic missions, meaning he's got three really

16:25.200 --> 16:34.720
big missions. One is to make humans a space-faring civilization, make us multi-planetary, or get

16:34.720 --> 16:41.440
us to Mars. Number two is to bring us into the era of sustainable energy, to bring us into the

16:41.440 --> 16:49.120
era of electric vehicles and solar roofs and battery packs. Third is to make sure that

16:49.120 --> 16:56.160
artificial intelligence is safe and is aligned with human values. Every now and then I'd talk to

16:56.160 --> 17:02.720
him and we'd be talking about Starlink satellites or whatever, or he would be pushing the people

17:02.720 --> 17:07.760
in front of him in SpaceX and saying, if you do this, we'll never get to Mars in our lifetime.

17:07.760 --> 17:12.640
Then he would give the lecture how important it was for human consciousness to get to Mars

17:12.640 --> 17:18.560
in our lifetime. I'm thinking, okay, this is the pep talk of somebody trying to inspire a team,

17:18.560 --> 17:26.000
or maybe it's the type of pontification you do on a podcast, but on the 20th time I watched him,

17:26.000 --> 17:31.200
I realized, okay, I believe it. He actually is driven by this.

17:31.520 --> 17:38.480
He is frustrated and angry that because of this particular minor engineering decision,

17:39.760 --> 17:43.920
the big mission is not going to be accomplished. It's not a pep talk. It's a literal frustration.

17:44.720 --> 17:54.960
An impatience, a frustration, and it's also just probably the most deeply ingrained thing in him

17:55.600 --> 18:02.640
is his mission. He joked at one point to me about how much he loved reading comics as a kid,

18:03.280 --> 18:07.360
and he said, all the people in the comic books, they're trying to save the world,

18:07.360 --> 18:11.760
but they're wearing their underpants on the outside and they look ridiculous. Then he paused and

18:11.760 --> 18:19.440
said, but they are trying to save the world. Whether it's Starlink in Ukraine or Starship going

18:19.440 --> 18:29.280
to Mars or trying to get a global new Tesla, I think he's got this epic sense of the role he's

18:29.280 --> 18:39.280
going to play in helping humanity on big things. Like the characters in the comic books, it's

18:39.280 --> 18:45.200
sometimes ridiculous, but it also is sometimes true. When I was reading this part of the book,

18:45.280 --> 18:53.040
I was thinking of all the young people who are struggling in this way, and I think a lot of

18:53.040 --> 18:57.520
people are in different ways, whether they grow up without a father, whether they grow up with

18:57.520 --> 19:03.360
physical, emotional, mental abuse, or demons of any kind, as you talked about, and it's really

19:03.360 --> 19:13.280
painful to read, but also really damn inspiring that if you sort of walk side by side with those

19:13.280 --> 19:20.720
demons, if you don't let that pain break you or somehow channel it, if you can put it this way,

19:20.720 --> 19:23.520
that you can achieve, you can do great things in this world.

19:23.520 --> 19:30.960
Well, that's an epic view of why we write biography, which is more epic than I had even

19:30.960 --> 19:37.040
thought of. So I say thank you because in some ways what you're trying to do is say, okay,

19:38.000 --> 19:44.160
I mean, Leonardo, you talked about being a misfit, he's born illegitimate in the village of

19:44.160 --> 19:51.520
Venti, and he's gay, and he's left-handed, and he's distracted, and his father won't legitimize him,

19:52.320 --> 20:00.480
and then he wanders off to the town of Florence, and he becomes the greatest artist and engineer

20:01.120 --> 20:07.280
of the early Renaissance, of that part of the Renaissance. I hope this book inspires Jennifer

20:07.280 --> 20:15.680
Doudna, the gene editing pioneer who helps discover CRISPR, gene editing tool, which my book, The

20:15.680 --> 20:22.960
Code Breaker, she grew up feeling like a misfit in Hawaii, in a Polynesian village being the only

20:22.960 --> 20:29.520
white person, and also trying to live up to a father who pushed her. So if people can read the

20:29.600 --> 20:35.680
books, and I should have said about Jennifer Doudna, my point was that she was told by her

20:35.680 --> 20:40.240
school guidance counselor, no, girls don't do science. Science is not for girls. You're not

20:40.240 --> 20:47.120
going to do math or science. And so it pushes her to say, all right, I'm going to do math and science.

20:47.120 --> 20:52.160
Just to interrupt real quick, but Jennifer Doudna, you've written an amazing book about her,

20:53.040 --> 20:57.120
Nobel Prize winner, CRISPR developer, just incredible, one of the great scientists in

20:57.120 --> 21:02.960
the 21st century. Right. And I'm talking about when Jennifer Doudna was young, and she felt

21:02.960 --> 21:08.720
really, really out of place, like you and me and a lot of people when they fill in that way,

21:08.720 --> 21:13.920
they read books, they go into, they curl up with the book. So her father drops a book on her bed

21:13.920 --> 21:20.800
called The Double Helix, the book by James Watson on the discovery of the structure of DNA by him

21:20.880 --> 21:29.200
in Rosalind Franklin and Francis Crick. And she realizes, oh my God, girls can become scientists.

21:29.200 --> 21:39.360
My school guidance counselor is wrong. So I think books, like she read this book, and even if it's

21:39.360 --> 21:47.360
a comic book, like Elon Musk read, books can sometimes inspire you. And every one of my books

21:47.360 --> 21:53.440
is about people who are totally innovative, who weren't just smart, because none of us are going

21:53.440 --> 22:01.120
to be able to match Einstein and mental processing power. But we can be as curious as he was and

22:01.120 --> 22:06.240
creative and think out of the box the way he did, or Steve Jobs put it, think different.

22:06.960 --> 22:14.560
And so I hope with my books, I'm saying this isn't a how to guide, but this is somebody

22:14.560 --> 22:22.160
you can walk alongside. You can see Einstein growing up Jewish in Germany. You can see

22:22.160 --> 22:30.800
Jennifer Doudna growing up or as an outsider or Leonardo da Vinci or Elon Musk in really violent

22:30.800 --> 22:37.280
South Africa with a psychologically difficult father. And getting off the train when he goes

22:37.280 --> 22:43.600
to anti-apartheid concert with his brother, and there's a man with a knife sticking out of his

22:43.600 --> 22:49.280
head, and they step into the pool of blood and it's sticking on their souls. This causes

22:50.800 --> 22:58.480
scars that last the rest of your life. And the question is not, how do you avoid getting scarred?

22:59.920 --> 23:08.080
How do you deal with it? Einstein, too, one of my, it's hard to pick my favorite of your

23:09.040 --> 23:15.760
biographies, but Einstein, I mean, you really paint a picture of another, I don't want to call him a

23:15.760 --> 23:22.800
misfit, but a person who doesn't necessarily have a standard trajectory through life of success.

23:23.760 --> 23:31.840
So, and that's extremely inspiring. I don't know exactly what question to ask. There's a million.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.440
Well, I'll talk about the misfit for a second because, you know, we talked about Leonardo

23:35.520 --> 23:41.440
being that way. You know, Einstein is Jewish in Germany at a time when it starts getting difficult.

23:42.320 --> 23:47.520
He's slow in learning how to talk and he's a visual thinker, so he's always daydreaming and

23:47.520 --> 23:54.240
imagining things. The first time he applies to the Zurich Polytech because he runs away from the

23:54.240 --> 24:00.880
German education system because it's too much learning by rote, he gets rejected by the Zurich

24:00.880 --> 24:05.680
Polytech. Now, it's the second best school in Zurich and they're rejecting Einstein. I tried to

24:05.680 --> 24:11.120
find but couldn't the name of the admissions counselor at the Zurich Polytech, like you

24:11.120 --> 24:17.760
rejected Einstein. And then he doesn't finish in the top half of his class and once he does

24:18.320 --> 24:24.400
and he goes to graduate school, they don't accept his dissertation, so he can't get a job. He's not

24:24.400 --> 24:31.120
teaching it. He even tries about 14 different high schools or gymnasium to get a job and they

24:31.120 --> 24:38.240
won't take him. So he's a third class examiner in the Swiss Patent Office in 1905. Third class because

24:38.240 --> 24:44.160
they've rejected his doctoral dissertation and so he can't be second class or first class because

24:44.160 --> 24:48.640
he doesn't have a doctoral degree. And yet he's sitting there in the stool in the Patent Office

24:48.640 --> 24:57.760
in 1905 and writes three papers that totally transform science. And if you're thinking about

24:57.760 --> 25:05.200
being misunderstood or unappreciated, in 1906 he's still a third class patent. In 1907 he still is.

25:05.200 --> 25:11.520
It takes until 1909 before people realize that this notion of the theory of relativity might be

25:11.520 --> 25:18.320
correct and it might upend all of Newtonian physics. How is it possible for three of the greatest

25:18.320 --> 25:22.880
papers in the history of science to be written in one year by this one person? Is there some

25:23.760 --> 25:30.000
insights, wisdoms you draw? Plus he had a day job as a patent examiner. And there's really three

25:30.000 --> 25:35.200
papers but there's also an addendum because once you figure out quantum theory and then you figure

25:35.280 --> 25:40.080
out relativity and you're understanding Maxwell's equations and the speed of light,

25:41.520 --> 25:48.000
he does a little addendum. That's the most famous equation in all of physics which is E equals mc

25:48.000 --> 25:55.280
squared. So it's a pretty good year. It partly starts because he's a visual thinker and I think

25:55.280 --> 26:02.080
it was helpful that he was at the Patent Office rather than being the acolyte of some professor

26:02.080 --> 26:07.440
at the academy where he was supposed to follow the rules. And so the Patent Office said doing

26:07.440 --> 26:12.720
devices to synchronize clocks because the Swiss have just gone on standard time zones and Swiss

26:12.720 --> 26:18.400
people, as you know, tend to be rather, you know, Swiss. They care if it strikes the hour in bozzle,

26:18.400 --> 26:23.200
it should do the same and burn if the exact answer. So you have to send a light signal between two

26:23.200 --> 26:30.080
distant clocks and he's visualizing what it'll look like to ride alongside a light beam. He says,

26:30.080 --> 26:34.480
well, if you catch up with that, if you go almost as fast, it'll look stationary but Maxwell's

26:34.480 --> 26:40.800
equations don't allow for that. And he said, he's making my palm sweat that I was so worried.

26:40.800 --> 26:45.920
And so he finally figures out because he's looking at these devices to synchronize clocks

26:45.920 --> 26:51.840
that if you're traveling really, really fast, what looks synchronous to you or synchronized to

26:51.840 --> 26:57.440
you is different than for somebody traveling really fast in the other direction and he makes

26:57.440 --> 27:03.280
a mental leap that time, that the speed of light is always constant, but time is relative

27:03.280 --> 27:08.720
depending on your state of motion. So it was that type of out of the box thinking, those leaps

27:09.360 --> 27:18.000
that made 1905 his miracle year, likewise with Musk. I mean, after General Motors and Ford,

27:18.000 --> 27:24.880
everybody gives up on electric vehicles to just say, I know how we're going to have a path

27:25.440 --> 27:30.640
to change the entire trajectory of the world into the era of electric vehicles.

27:31.200 --> 27:35.680
And then when he comes back from Russia where he tried to buy a little rocket ship so he could

27:35.680 --> 27:42.960
send a experimental greenhouse to Mars and they were poking fun of him and actually spit on him

27:42.960 --> 27:49.440
at one point in a drunken lunch. This is very fortuitous because on the ride back home, on the

27:49.760 --> 27:55.200
plane, on the Delta Airlines flight, he's like doing the calculations of how much

27:55.200 --> 28:02.560
materials, how much metal, how much fuel, how much wood it really costs. And so he's visualizing

28:02.560 --> 28:10.880
things that other people would just say is impossible. It's what Steve Jobs' friends

28:10.880 --> 28:17.200
called the reality distortion field and it drove people crazy. It drove them mad, but it also drove

28:17.280 --> 28:22.320
them to do things they didn't think they would be able to do. You said visual thinking. I wonder

28:22.320 --> 28:33.440
if you've seen parallels of the different styles and kinds of thinking that operate the minds of

28:33.440 --> 28:41.040
these people. So is there parallels you see between Elon, Steve Jobs, Einstein, Da Vinci,

28:41.040 --> 28:46.400
specifically in how they think? I think they were all visual thinkers,

28:46.400 --> 28:52.640
perhaps coming from slight handicaps as children, meaning Leonardo was left-handed and a little

28:52.640 --> 29:00.640
bit dyslexic, I think. And certainly Einstein had a colleague, he would repeat things, he was

29:00.640 --> 29:10.160
slow in learning to talk. So I think visualizing helps a lot. And with Musk, I see it all the time

29:10.160 --> 29:17.280
when I'm walking the factory lines with him or in product development, where he'll look at, say,

29:17.280 --> 29:24.880
the heat shield under the raptor engine of a starship booster. And he'll say, why does it have

29:24.880 --> 29:30.160
to be this way? Couldn't we trim it this way or make it or even get rid of this part of it?

29:30.720 --> 29:37.040
And he can visualize the material science. There's a small anecdote in my book, but at one point

29:37.040 --> 29:43.680
he's on the Tesla line and they're trying to get 5,000 cars a week in 2018. It's a life or death

29:43.680 --> 29:49.760
situation. And he's looking at the machines that are bolting something to the chassis.

29:50.480 --> 29:57.680
And he insists that Lars Morrowie, one of his great lieutenants, come and they have to summon

29:57.680 --> 30:05.440
him. And he says, why are there six bolts here? And Lars and others explain, well, for the crash

30:05.440 --> 30:10.400
test or anything else, the pressure would be in this way. So you have to and they were blah,

30:10.400 --> 30:16.400
blah, blah, blah. And he said, no, if you visualize it, you'll see if there's a crash,

30:16.960 --> 30:22.880
it would, the force would go this way and that way. And it could be done with four bolts.

30:23.840 --> 30:28.720
Now that sounds risky. And they go test it in the engineer, but it turns out to be right.

30:28.720 --> 30:34.320
I know that seems minor, but I could give you 500 of those where in any given day,

30:35.040 --> 30:44.000
he's visualizing the physics of an engineering or manufacturing problem. That sounds pretty mundane.

30:44.800 --> 30:50.960
But for me, if you say what makes him special, there's a mission driven thing, I give you a lot

30:51.040 --> 30:59.040
of reasons. But one of the reasons is he cares not just about the design of the product, but

30:59.040 --> 31:05.040
visualizing the manufacturing and of the product, the machine that makes the machine.

31:05.040 --> 31:09.600
And that's what we failed to do in America for the past 40 years. We outsource so much

31:09.600 --> 31:15.680
manufacturing. I don't think you can be a good innovator if you don't know how to make the stuff

31:15.760 --> 31:22.400
you're designing. And that's why Musk puts his designer's desk right next to the assembly lines

31:22.400 --> 31:30.000
and the factories so that they have to visualize what they drew as it becomes the physical object.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.280
So understanding everything from the physics all the way up to the software, so like end to end?

31:35.280 --> 31:42.080
Well, having an end to end control is important. Certainly with Steve Jobs. I'm looking at my

31:42.080 --> 31:48.640
iPhone here. It's a big deal. That hardware only works with Apple software. And for a while,

31:48.640 --> 31:55.280
the iTunes Store, not only what works, so he has an end to end that makes it like

31:55.280 --> 32:02.800
a Zen garden in Kyoto. Very carefully curated, but a thing of beauty. For Musk, when he first

32:02.800 --> 32:09.520
was at Tesla and before he was the CEO, when he was just the executive chairman and basically the

32:09.520 --> 32:15.200
finance person funding it, they were outsourcing everything. They're making the batteries in

32:15.200 --> 32:20.640
Japan and the battery pack would be at some barbecue shop in Thailand. And that sent to

32:20.640 --> 32:28.720
the Lotus factory in England to be put into a Lotus Elise chassis and then that was a nightmare.

32:28.720 --> 32:34.480
You did not have end to end control of the manufacturing process. So he goes to the other

32:34.480 --> 32:41.280
extreme. He gets a factory in Fremont from Toyota and he wants to do everything in-house,

32:41.280 --> 32:50.640
the software, in-house, the painting, in-house, the battery. He makes his own batteries.

32:51.520 --> 32:56.640
And I think that end to end control is part of his personality. I mean, there's a...

32:57.600 --> 33:03.120
But it also would allow Tesla to be innovative.

33:03.680 --> 33:13.120
Yeah, I got to see and understand in detail one example of that, which is the development of the

33:13.120 --> 33:20.800
brain of the car in autopilot going from Mobileye to in-house building the autopilot system to

33:21.680 --> 33:31.040
basically getting rid of all sensors that are not rich in data to make it AI friendly,

33:31.680 --> 33:36.720
sort of saying that we can do it all with vision. And like you said, removing some of the bolts.

33:36.720 --> 33:41.680
So sometimes it's small things, but sometimes it's really big things like getting rid of radar.

33:41.680 --> 33:47.120
Well, vision only, getting rid of radar is huge. And everybody's against it. Everybody...

33:47.120 --> 33:52.800
And still fighting it a bit. They're still trying to do in next generation some form of radar.

33:52.800 --> 33:58.160
But it gets back to the first principles. We're talking about visualizing. Well, he starts

33:59.600 --> 34:06.080
with the first principles. And the first principles of physics involve things like, well, humans drive

34:06.080 --> 34:11.440
with only visual input. They don't have radar. They don't have LiDAR. They don't have Sonar.

34:12.080 --> 34:20.480
And so there is no reason in the laws of physics that make it so that vision only won't be

34:20.480 --> 34:27.040
successful in creating self-driving. Now, that becomes an article of faith to him. And he gets

34:27.040 --> 34:34.400
a lot of pushback. But now... And he's, by the way, not been that successful in meeting his deadlines

34:34.400 --> 34:42.320
of getting self-driving. He's way too optimistic. But it was that first principles of get rid

34:42.320 --> 34:47.920
of unnecessary things. Now, you would think LiDAR, why not use it? Like why not use across?

34:47.920 --> 34:52.480
Just like, yeah, we can do things vision only. But when I look at the stars at night, I'll use

34:52.480 --> 34:59.200
a telescope too. Well, you could use LiDAR, but you can't do millions of cars that way at scale.

34:59.200 --> 35:05.120
At a certain point, you have to make it not only a good product, but a product that goes to scale.

35:05.120 --> 35:09.040
And you can't make it based on maps, like Google Maps, because it'll never be able to,

35:09.600 --> 35:16.240
you know, then drive from New Orleans to Slidell, where I want to go when it's too hot in New Orleans.

35:17.200 --> 35:24.000
Take, for example, full self-drive. He has been obsessed with what he calls the robo-taxi.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.120
We're going to build the next generation car without a steering wheel,

35:28.080 --> 35:32.080
without pedals, because it's going to be full self-drive. You just summon it,

35:32.080 --> 35:37.040
you won't need to drive it. Well, over and over again, all these people I've told you about,

35:37.040 --> 35:41.600
you know, Lars Maravi and Drew Baglino and others, they're saying, okay, fine, that sounds really

35:41.600 --> 35:50.080
good, but, you know, it ain't happened yet. We need to build a $25,000 mass market global car

35:50.080 --> 35:57.120
that's just normal with a steering wheel. And yeah, he finally turned around a few months ago

35:57.120 --> 36:02.240
and said, let's do it. And then he starts focusing on how's the assembly line going to work,

36:02.240 --> 36:06.640
how are we going to do it, and make it the same platform for robo-taxi, so you can have the same

36:06.640 --> 36:13.440
assembly line. Likewise, for full self-drive, they were doing it by coding hundreds of thousands

36:13.440 --> 36:18.800
of lines of code that would say things like, if you see a red light, stop. If there's a blinking

36:18.800 --> 36:24.240
light, if the two yellow lines do this, if there's a bike lane, do this. If there's a crosswalk, do

36:24.240 --> 36:30.400
that. Well, that's really hard to do. Now he's doing it through artificial intelligence and

36:30.400 --> 36:39.440
machine learning only. FSD12 will be based on the billion or so frames from Tesla each week of

36:39.440 --> 36:44.480
Tesla drivers and saying, what happened when a human was in this situation? What did the human do?

36:44.480 --> 36:49.360
And let's only pick the best humans, the five-star drivers or the Uber drivers, as Elon says.

36:50.000 --> 36:58.160
And so that's him changing his mind and going to first principles, but saying, all right,

36:58.160 --> 37:04.640
I'm even going to change full self-driving so there's not rules-based. It becomes AI-based,

37:04.640 --> 37:10.880
just like ChatGPT doesn't try to answer your question, who are the five best popes or something

37:11.440 --> 37:22.160
by study? ChatGPT does it by having ingested billions of pieces of writing that people have

37:22.160 --> 37:27.840
done. This will be AI, but real world done by ingesting video. Sometimes it feels like

37:28.960 --> 37:34.880
he and others, they're building things in this world successfully, are basically

37:34.880 --> 37:41.520
confidently exploring a dark room with a very confident, ambitious vision of what

37:41.520 --> 37:48.240
that room actually looks like. They're just walking straight into the darkness.

37:49.040 --> 37:54.160
There's no painful toys or Legos on the ground. I'm just going to walk. I know exactly how far

37:54.160 --> 38:01.120
the wall is. And then very quickly willing to adjust as they run into, they step on the Lego

38:01.120 --> 38:07.600
and their body is filled with a lot of pain. What I mean by that is there's this kind of evolution

38:07.600 --> 38:14.320
that seems to happen where you discover really good ideas along the way that allow you to pivot.

38:14.320 --> 38:24.480
Like to me, since a few years ago, when you could see with Andrea Carpathi, the software 2.0

38:24.480 --> 38:29.600
evolution of autopilot, it became obvious to me that this is not about the car.

38:30.320 --> 38:37.120
This is about Optimus, the robot. This is like, if we look back 100 years from now,

38:38.160 --> 38:44.160
the car will be remembered as a cool car, nice transportation, but the autopilot won't be the

38:44.160 --> 38:51.280
thing that controls the car. It will be the thing that allows embodied AI systems to understand the

38:51.280 --> 39:00.560
world. So broadly, that kind of approach, and you stumble into it, will Tesla be a car company?

39:01.200 --> 39:06.720
Will it be an AI company? Will it be a robotics company? Will it be a home robotics company?

39:06.720 --> 39:16.000
Will it be an energy company? And you slowly discover this as you confidently push forward

39:16.080 --> 39:21.680
with a vision. It's interesting to watch that kind of evolution as long as it's backed by this

39:21.680 --> 39:27.200
confidence. There are a couple of things that are required for that. One is being adventurous.

39:27.200 --> 39:32.400
One doesn't enter a dark room without a flashlight and a map unless you're a risk taker, unless you're

39:32.400 --> 39:39.440
adventurous. The second is to have iterative brain cycles where you can process information

39:40.080 --> 39:47.760
and do a feedback loop and make it work. The third, and this is what we fail to do a lot in

39:47.760 --> 39:55.200
the United States and perhaps around the world, is when you take risks, you have to realize you're

39:55.200 --> 40:04.320
going to blow things up. First three rockets, the Falcon rockets that Musk does, they blow up.

40:04.320 --> 40:08.000
Even Starship, three and a half minutes, but then it blows up the first time.

40:08.640 --> 40:15.760
So I think Boeing and NASA and others have become unwilling to enter your dark room

40:15.760 --> 40:20.960
without knowing exactly where the exit is and the lighted path to the exit.

40:21.760 --> 40:29.600
And the people who created America, whenever they came over, whether the Mayflower is refugees

40:29.600 --> 40:39.040
from the Nazis, they took a lot of risks to get here. And now I think we have more referees than

40:39.040 --> 40:47.920
we have risk takers, more lawyers and regulators and others saying you can't do that, that's too risky

40:47.920 --> 40:53.760
than people willing to innovate. And you need both. I think you're also right on

40:54.560 --> 41:01.920
50-100 years from now, what Musk will be most remembered for besides space travel

41:02.800 --> 41:10.480
is real-world AI. Not just Optimus the Robot, but Optimus the Robot and the self-driving car,

41:11.840 --> 41:19.600
they're pretty much the same. They're using, you know, GPU clusters or dojo chips or whatever it

41:19.600 --> 41:26.320
may be to process real-world data. We all got, and you did on your podcast, quite excited about

41:26.320 --> 41:34.400
large language model, you know, generative, predictive text AI. That's fine, especially if

41:34.400 --> 41:41.200
you want to chat with your chatbot. But the Holy Grail is artificial general intelligence.

41:41.200 --> 41:47.840
And the tough part of that is real-world AI. And that's where Optimus the Robot or

41:48.800 --> 41:56.160
full self-drive are, I think, far ahead of anybody else.

41:57.360 --> 42:05.200
Well, I like how you said chitchat. I would say for one of the greatest writers ever,

42:05.200 --> 42:11.760
it's funny that you spoke about language and the mastery of languages as merely chitchat.

42:11.760 --> 42:16.640
You know, people have fallen in love over some words. People have gone to wars over some words.

42:16.640 --> 42:21.840
I think words have a lot of power. It's actually an interesting question where the wisdom of the

42:21.840 --> 42:28.400
world, the wisdom of humanity is in the words or is it in visual, is it in the physical? I don't

42:28.400 --> 42:32.880
really... It's in mathematics. Maybe it all boils down to math. And in the end,

42:32.880 --> 42:39.120
this kind of discussion about real-world AI versus language is all the same, maybe. I've

42:40.560 --> 42:45.280
gotten a chance to hang out quite a bit in the metaverse with Mr. Mark Zuckerberg recently.

42:45.840 --> 42:54.960
And boy is the realism in there. The thing that's coming up in the future is incredible.

42:54.960 --> 43:03.200
I got scanned in Pittsburgh for 10 hours into the metaverse. And there's a

43:04.800 --> 43:08.560
virtual version of me. And I got to hang out with that virtual version.

43:09.200 --> 43:12.800
Do you like yourself? Well, I never like myself.

43:13.840 --> 43:19.840
But it was easier to like that other guy. That was interesting. If you like you,

43:21.200 --> 43:24.880
he didn't seem to care much. Actually lack of the empathy.

43:26.880 --> 43:32.640
But that was, you know, it made me start to question even more than before, like,

43:33.200 --> 43:40.640
well, how important is this physical reality? Because I got to see, you know, myself and other

43:40.640 --> 43:50.160
people in that metaverse, like the details of the face, all the things that you think, maybe if

43:50.160 --> 43:54.800
you look yourself in the mirror or imperfections, all this kind of stuff. When I was looking at

43:54.800 --> 44:02.080
myself and others, all those things were beautiful. And it was real. And it was intense.

44:03.200 --> 44:07.600
It was scary because you're like, well, are you allowed to murder people in the metaverse?

44:08.320 --> 44:13.520
Because like, are you allowed to, because what are you allowed to do? Because you can replicate

44:13.520 --> 44:18.720
a lot of those things. And it's, you start to question what are the fundamental things that

44:18.720 --> 44:24.480
make life worth living here as we know it's humans. Have you talked to Elon about his views of

44:24.480 --> 44:28.160
what living in the simulation may be and how you would figure out if that's true?

44:28.720 --> 44:35.680
Yes, there's a constant lighthearted, but also a serious sense that this is all a bit of a game.

44:36.240 --> 44:42.400
One of my theories on Elon, a minor theory, is that he read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

44:42.400 --> 44:51.600
once too often. And as you know, there's a scene in there that says that there's a theory about

44:51.600 --> 44:57.200
the universe that if anybody ever discovers the secrets of meanings of the universe,

44:57.200 --> 45:02.800
it will be replaced by an even more complex universe. And then the next line Douglas Adams

45:02.800 --> 45:08.240
writes is, and there's another theory that this has already happened. So I'm gonna try to get

45:08.240 --> 45:13.760
my head around that, but I know that Elon Musk tries to. Well, there's a humor to that.

45:13.760 --> 45:19.200
There's an enormous humor to Hitchhiker's Guide. I really think that helped Musk out of the darkest

45:19.200 --> 45:24.880
of his periods to have sort of the sense of fun of figuring out what life is all about.

45:24.880 --> 45:29.760
I wonder if there's a small aside we could say, just having gone to know Elon very well,

45:31.440 --> 45:37.600
the silliness, the willingness to engage in the absurdity of it all and have fun.

45:38.800 --> 45:44.400
What is that? Is that just a quirk of personality or is that a fundamental

45:44.400 --> 45:49.760
aspect of a human who's running six plus companies? Well, it's a relief valve,

45:49.840 --> 45:54.560
just like video games and Polytopia and Elden Ring or release valves for him.

45:55.920 --> 46:03.360
And he does have an explosive sense of humor, as you know. And the weird thing is when he makes the

46:03.360 --> 46:10.400
abrupt transition from dark demon mode and you're in the conference room and he is really

46:10.400 --> 46:16.320
become upset about something. And not only they're dark vibes, but there's dark words emanating and

46:16.320 --> 46:24.960
he's saying your resignation will be accepted, et cetera. And then something pops and he pulls

46:24.960 --> 46:32.400
out his phone and pulls up a Bonnie Python skit, like the School of Silly Walks or whichever

46:32.400 --> 46:40.800
John Cleese it was. And he starts laughing again and things break. So it's almost as if he has

46:40.800 --> 46:48.480
different modes, the emulation of human mode, the engineering mode, the dark and demon mode,

46:48.480 --> 46:51.040
and certainly there is the silly and giddy mode.

46:53.360 --> 46:59.040
Yeah, you've actually opened the Elon book with the quotes from Elon and from Steve Jobs.

46:59.680 --> 47:04.960
So Elon's quote is, to anyone I've offended, I just want to say this on SNL. I just want to

47:04.960 --> 47:10.640
say I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you also

47:10.640 --> 47:15.360
think I was going to be a chill normal dude? And then the quote from Steve Jobs, of course, is

47:15.360 --> 47:20.560
the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

47:21.200 --> 47:28.960
So what do you think is the role of the old madness and genius? What do you think is the

47:28.960 --> 47:35.520
role of crazy in this? Well, first of all, let's both stipulate that Musk is crazy at times.

47:36.480 --> 47:43.280
And then let's figure out, and I try to do it through storytelling, not through

47:44.160 --> 47:52.080
highfalutin preaching, where that craziness works. Give me a story. Tell me an anecdote.

47:52.080 --> 48:01.040
Tell me where he's crazy. And the almost final example, AI, but him shooting off Starship

48:01.040 --> 48:07.200
for the first time in between an aborted countdown in the shootoff, he goes to Miami

48:07.200 --> 48:11.520
to an air sales conference and meets Linda Yaccarino for the first time, makes her the CEO.

48:11.520 --> 48:17.440
I mean, there's a very impulsiveness to him. Then he flies back, they launch Starship and

48:19.040 --> 48:25.360
you realize that there's a drive and they're demons and there's also craziness. And

48:26.240 --> 48:32.880
you sometimes want to pull those out. You want to take away his phone so he doesn't tweet at 3 a.m.

48:32.880 --> 48:40.640
You want to say quit being so crazy. But then you realize there's a wonderful line of Shakespeare

48:40.640 --> 48:46.960
and measure from measure at the very end. He says, even the best are molded out of faults.

48:46.960 --> 48:54.160
And so you take the faults of Musk, for example, which includes a craziness that can be

48:54.880 --> 49:04.400
endearing, but also craziness that's just like effing crazy, as well as this drive and demon mode.

49:05.760 --> 49:11.120
I don't know that you can take that strand out of the fabric and the fabric remains whole.

49:12.800 --> 49:19.760
I wonder sometimes it saddens me that we live in a society that doesn't celebrate even the

49:19.760 --> 49:26.160
darker aspects of crazy in acknowledging that it all comes in one package. It's the man in

49:26.160 --> 49:31.920
the arena versus the critic. And the man in the arena versus the regulator and to make it more prosaic.

49:35.360 --> 49:38.880
Well, let me ask about not just the crazy, but the cruelty. So in

49:40.480 --> 49:45.760
you've written when reporting on Steve Jobs, Was told you that the big question to ask was,

49:45.760 --> 49:53.600
did he have to be so mean, so rough and cruel, so drama addicted? What is this answer for Steve

49:53.600 --> 50:00.000
Jobs? Did he have to be so cruel? For Jobs, I asked Was at the end of my reporting,

50:00.000 --> 50:07.120
because that's what he said at the beginning. We're doing the launch of, I think, the iPad 2,

50:07.120 --> 50:13.920
it may have been. Steve is emaciated because he's been sick. And so I say to Was,

50:13.920 --> 50:17.280
what's the answer to your question? And he said, well, if I had been running Apple,

50:18.000 --> 50:22.320
I would have been nicer to everybody. Everybody got stock options. We've been like a family.

50:22.320 --> 50:26.640
And then I don't know if you know Was. We're like a teddy bear. He paused. He smiled and he said,

50:26.640 --> 50:32.400
but if I had been running Apple, I don't think we would have done the Macintosh or the iPhone.

50:32.400 --> 50:43.280
So yeah, you have to sometimes be rough. And Jobs said the same thing that must said to me,

50:43.360 --> 50:49.040
which is he said, people like you love wearing velvet gloves. Now, I don't know that I've worn

50:49.040 --> 50:53.920
velvet gloves often, but you like people to like you. You like to sweet talk things. You

50:53.920 --> 51:00.880
sugarcoat things. He says, I'm just a working class kid. And I don't have that luxury. If

51:00.880 --> 51:05.120
something sucks, I got to tell people it sucks. Or I got a team of B players. Well,

51:05.120 --> 51:10.000
Musk is that way as well. And it gets back to what I said earlier, which is, yeah,

51:10.960 --> 51:15.360
I probably would wear velvet gloves if I could find them at my haberdasher.

51:16.480 --> 51:24.000
And I do try to sugarcoat things. But when I was running CNN, it needed to be reshaped.

51:24.000 --> 51:29.120
It needed to be broken. It needed to have certain things blown up. And I didn't do it.

51:30.320 --> 51:36.080
So bad on me. But it made me realize, okay, I'll just write about the people who can do it.

51:36.080 --> 51:40.720
Well, that thing of saying, I think probably both of them, but Elon certainly

51:40.720 --> 51:43.280
saying things like that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

51:44.720 --> 51:50.240
By the way, I've heard Jeff Bezos say that. I've heard Bill Gates say that. I've heard Steve Jobs

51:50.240 --> 51:54.640
say it. I've heard Steve Jobs say it about a smoothie. They were making it a whole footage

51:54.640 --> 52:00.240
or something. I mean, people, they use the word stupid really often. And you know who else used

52:00.240 --> 52:05.280
it? Errol Musk. He kept baking Elon's stand in front of him and saying, that's the stupidest

52:05.280 --> 52:08.240
thing. You're the stupidest person. You'll never amount to anything.

52:11.200 --> 52:18.800
I don't know. As John McNeil, the president of Tesla said, do you have to be that way?

52:19.440 --> 52:31.120
Probably not. There are a lot of successful people who are much kinder. But it's sometimes

52:31.200 --> 52:39.120
necessary to be much more brutal and honest, brutally honest, I would say, than people like

52:41.440 --> 52:48.960
when boss of the year trophies. Well, as you said, this kind of idea did also send a signal.

52:48.960 --> 52:52.640
This idea of Steve Jobs of A Players, it did send a signal to everybody.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.720
It was a kind of encouragement to the people that are all in.

52:57.360 --> 53:02.080
Right. And that happened to Twitter. When we went to Twitter headquarters the day before

53:02.080 --> 53:09.040
the takeover, he was having Andrew and James as to young cousins and other people

53:09.040 --> 53:14.480
from the autopilot team going over lines of code and Musk himself said there was a laptop on the

53:14.480 --> 53:19.440
second floor of the building, looking at the lines of code that had been written by Twitter

53:19.440 --> 53:26.160
engineers. And they decided they were going to fire 85% of them because they had to be all in.

53:26.160 --> 53:32.720
And this notion of psychological safety and mental days off and working remotely, he said either

53:33.360 --> 53:41.280
and then it came up actually one of his, I think it was one of the cousins or maybe Ross Nordin

53:41.280 --> 53:47.680
came up with the idea of let's not be so rough and just fire all these people. Let's ask them,

53:47.680 --> 53:52.080
do you really want to be all in? Because this is going to be hardcore. It's going to be intense.

53:52.080 --> 53:57.920
You get to choose. But by midnight tonight, we want you to check the box. I'm hardcore all in.

53:57.920 --> 54:03.600
I'll be there in person. I'll work, you know, or that's not for me. I've got a family. I've got

54:03.600 --> 54:09.600
work balance and you got different type of people that way and different stages of their life. I

54:09.600 --> 54:16.160
was a little bit more hardcore and all in when I was in my 20s and when I was, you know, in my 50s.

54:16.160 --> 54:22.240
Yeah. And you write about this. It's a really nice idea actually that there's two camps and you

54:22.240 --> 54:28.320
find out, I don't, I wonder how true this is. It rings true. You can just ask people, which camp

54:28.320 --> 54:35.040
are you in? Are you the kind of person that prides themselves and enjoy staying up to 2am

54:35.040 --> 54:39.840
programming or whatever? Or do you see the value of quote unquote, you know,

54:40.080 --> 54:44.720
about life, work-life balance, all this kind of stuff. And it's interesting. I mean,

54:46.080 --> 54:51.200
like you could, people probably divide themselves in different stages of life and you can just ask

54:51.200 --> 54:56.880
them and it makes sense for certain companies at certain stages of their development to be like,

54:56.880 --> 55:00.160
we all want hardcore. Or certain teams. It doesn't even have to be a whole company.

55:00.160 --> 55:06.320
And you're right. Goes back to what I was saying about rule. The first secret is sort of know

55:06.320 --> 55:11.600
thyself. Obviously comes from Plato and everything comes from Plato and Socrates.

55:14.640 --> 55:22.240
And decide, in this stage in my life, am I, do I want to be a hackathon all in all night

55:22.800 --> 55:28.320
and change the world? Or do I want to bring wisdom and stability but also have balance?

55:29.040 --> 55:35.280
I think it's good to have different companies with different styles. The problem was Twitter

55:35.280 --> 55:43.280
was at almost one extreme with yoga studios and mental health days off and enshrining psychological

55:43.280 --> 55:49.600
safety as one of the mantras that people should never feel psychologically threatened. And he,

55:49.600 --> 55:53.760
I remember the bitter laugh he unleashed when he kept hearing that word. He said,

55:53.760 --> 56:02.400
no, I like the words hardcore. I like intensity. I like a intense sense of urgency as our operating

56:02.400 --> 56:07.600
principle. Well, yeah, there are people that way as well. And so know who you are and know what type

56:07.600 --> 56:13.840
of team you want to build. Versus psychological safety and too many birds everywhere. Oh, yeah.

56:13.840 --> 56:19.680
A lot of times Musk did things and I go, what the hell? And among them was changing the name

56:19.680 --> 56:24.960
Twitter and getting rid of the birds. Hey, man, it's a lot invested in that brand. But when I

56:24.960 --> 56:30.640
watched him, he thought, okay, these sweet little chirpy birds tweeting away in the name Twitter,

56:31.440 --> 56:39.920
it's not hardcore. It's not intense. And so for better and for worse, I think he's taking acts

56:41.040 --> 56:49.280
into the hardcore realm with people who post hardcore things with people with hardcore views.

56:50.080 --> 57:04.880
It's not a polite playpen for the blue checked, anointed elite. And I thought, okay, this is

57:04.880 --> 57:08.400
going to be bad. The whole thing is going to fall apart. Well, it has had problems,

57:09.040 --> 57:14.800
but the hardcore intensity of it has also meant that there's new things happening there. So it's

57:14.800 --> 57:22.080
very Elon Musk to not like this sweetness of birds chirping and tweeting and saying,

57:22.080 --> 57:30.320
I want something more hardcore. As you've written in referring to the previous Twitter CEO,

57:30.320 --> 57:36.960
Elon said Twitter needs a fire-breathing dragon. I think this is a good opportunity to

57:38.080 --> 57:42.720
maybe go through some of the memorable moments of the Twitter saga, as you've written about

57:42.800 --> 57:49.760
extensively in your book, from the early days of considering the acquisition to how it went

57:49.760 --> 57:53.040
through to the details of, like you mentioned, the engineering teams.

57:53.600 --> 58:00.880
Well, at the beginning of 2022, he was riding high. But as we say, he's a drama addict. He

58:00.880 --> 58:07.520
doesn't like to coast. And Tesla told a million vehicles, I think 33 boosters,

58:08.400 --> 58:14.000
you know, Falcon 9's have been shot up and landed safely in the past few months.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.160
And he was the richest person on earth and times person of the year. And yet,

58:23.280 --> 58:29.200
he'd said, I still want to put all my chips back on the table. I want to keep taking risks. I

58:29.200 --> 58:35.680
don't want to savor things. He had told all of his houses. So he started secretly buying shares

58:35.680 --> 58:42.480
of Twitter, January, February, March, becomes public at a certain point. He has to declare it.

58:43.440 --> 58:50.720
And we were here in Austin at Gigafactory on the mezzanine, and he was trying to figure out,

58:50.720 --> 58:56.720
well, where do I go from here? And at that time, this early April, they were going to offer him

58:56.720 --> 59:02.320
a board seat, and he was going to do a standstill agreement and stop at 10% or something. Now,

59:02.320 --> 59:08.160
remember, you know, we were standing around. It was Luke Nozick, whom you know well, Ken Halry,

59:08.160 --> 59:13.840
some of his friends on that mezzanine here. And all afternoon and then late into the evening at

59:13.840 --> 59:20.480
dinner is like, should we do this? And I didn't say anything. I'm just the observer. But everybody

59:20.480 --> 59:27.280
else is saying, excuse me, why do you want to own Twitter? And Griffin, his son, joined at dinner

59:27.280 --> 59:33.040
in May, for some reason, was in town. And like everybody says, no, we don't use Twitter. Why

59:33.040 --> 59:39.120
would you do that? And May said, well, I use Twitter. And it's almost like, okay, the demographics

59:39.120 --> 59:44.960
are people my age or May's age. And so it looked like he wasn't going to pursue it.

59:45.520 --> 59:55.920
They offered him a board seat. And then he went off to Hawaii, to Larry Ellison's house,

59:56.480 --> 01:00:03.280
which he sometimes uses. He was meeting a friend, Angela Bassett, an actress. And instead of enjoying

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:10.720
three days of vacation, he just became supercharged and started firing off text messages,

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:16.000
including the fire, breathing dragon, Lundy, I think, you know, he used that phrase a few times

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.920
that Parag wasn't the person who was going to take Twitter to a new level. And then by the

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.680
time he gets to Vancouver, where Grimes meets him, they stay up all night playing Elden Ring.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:34.720
He was doing a TED talk. And then at 530, he finishes playing Elden Ring and sends out that

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:41.200
I've made an offer. Even when he comes back, people are trying to intervene and say, excuse me,

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:48.720
why are you doing it? And so it was a rocky period between late April and October when

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.600
the deal closes. And people ask me all the time, well, did he want to get out of the deal? I said,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.000
which Ilana, you're talking about at what time of day? Because there'll be times in the morning

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.600
when he'd say, oh, the Delaware court's going to force me to do it. It's horrible. Talk to

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:09.360
his lawyers. You can win this case. Get me out of it. He met here in Austin with three or four

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:16.720
investment bankers, Blair Efron at Centerview, Bob Steele at Pirella Weinberg, and they offered

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.000
him options. Do you want to get out? Do you want to stay in? Do you want to reduce the price?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:27.520
And I think he was mercurial. There were times he would text me or say to me, this is going to be

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:33.520
great. It's going to be the accelerant to do x.com the way we thought about 20 years ago.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.840
And so it's not until they finally tell him at the beginning of October, right when Optimus

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:47.120
the Robot is being unveiled in California, actually, that the lawyers say, you're not going to

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.160
probably win this case, but better go through with the deal. And by then, he's not only made

01:01:54.160 --> 01:02:00.720
his peace with it, he's kind of happy with it at that time. Eventually, the deal is going to close

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:08.960
on, I think, a Friday morning. I have it in the book. And we're there on Thursday and he's wandering

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:15.840
around looking at the Stay Woke t-shirts and psychological safety lingo they're all using.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:24.800
And he and his lawyers and bankers hatched a plan to do a flash close. And the reason for that was

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:33.680
if they closed the deal after the markets had closed for the day, and he could send a letter

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:39.200
to Parag and two others firing them, quote, for cause. And this will be something the courts

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:45.200
will have to figure out. Then he could save $200 million or so. And it was both the money,

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.200
but for him a matter, I won't say a principle, but of, hey, they misled me about the numbers.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:59.440
I got forced into doing it. So I'm going to try this jiu-jitsu maneuver and be able to get some

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:06.720
money out of them. Then when he takes over, it's kind of a wild scene. Him trying to decide in

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:12.800
three different rounds how to get the staff down to 15% of what it was. Him deciding on Christmas

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:18.720
Eve after he'd been at a meeting where they told him, we can't get rid of that Sacramento

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:25.200
server farm because it's need of a redundancy. And he says, no, it's not. And he's flying here to

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.320
Austin and young James says, why don't we just do it ourselves? He turns the plane around,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.040
they land in Sacramento and he pulls them out himself. So it was a manic period.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:42.720
We should also say that underneath of that, there was a running desire to or consideration to

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:48.560
perhaps start a new company to build the social media company from scratch.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.040
Well, Kimball wanted to do that. And Kimball here at a wonderful restaurant in Austin at

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:58.320
lunch is like, hey, why are you buying Twitter? Let's start one from scratch and do it on the

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:03.040
blockchain. Now it took him a while, and you can argue it one way or the other,

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.680
to come to the conclusion that the blockchain was not fast enough and responsive time enough

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:16.320
to be able to handle a billion tweets in a day or so. He gets mad when they keep trying to get

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.200
him to talk to Sam Bankman-Free, who's trying to say, I'll invest, but we have to do it on the

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:28.800
blockchain. Kimball is still in favor of starting a new one and doing it on blockchain-based.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.000
In retrospect, I think starting a new media company would have been better. He wouldn't have

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:44.000
had the baggage or the legacy that he's breaking now in breaking the way Twitter had been.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:52.400
But it's hard to have millions and millions, hundreds of millions of true users, not just trolls,

01:04:53.120 --> 01:05:00.320
and start from scratch, as others have found, as Macedon and Blue Sky and threads, and threads

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:07.360
even had a base. So it would have been hard. Yeah. And to do that in the way he did requires

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.920
another part that you write about with the three musketeers and the whole engineering,

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:18.080
the firing and the bringing in the engineers to try to sort of go hardcore. So there's a lot

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:23.680
interesting sort of questions to ask there, but the high level, can you just comment about that

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:31.040
part of the saga, which is bringing in the engineers and seeing what can we do here?

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:38.560
Right. He brought in the engineers and figured that the amount of people doing Tesla, full

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:45.200
self-driving autopilot and all the software there was about one-tenth of what was doing

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:51.760
software for Twitter. And he said, this can't be the case. And he fired 85% in three different

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:58.960
rounds. The first was just firing people because they looked at the coding and they had a team of

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:06.000
people from Tesla's autopilot team grading the codes of all that was written in the past year or so.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:14.320
Then he fired people who didn't seem to be totally all in or loyal and then another round of layoffs.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:22.960
At each step of the way, almost everybody said, that's enough. It's going to destroy things.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:30.480
From Alex Spiro, his lawyer to Jared Burchell, he's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. And even Andrew and

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.360
James, the young cousins who are tasked with making a list and figuring out who's good or bad,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:41.280
saying, we've done enough. We're going to be in real trouble. And they were partly right.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:49.520
I mean, there was degradation of the service sum, but not as much as half the services I use half

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:57.200
the time. And I wake up each morning and hit the app and, okay, still there.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.480
What do you think? Was that too much?

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:04.080
I think that he has an algorithm that we mentioned earlier that begins with question

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:10.400
every requirement. What's up to is delete, delete, delete, delete every party. And then

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.880
a corollary to that is if you don't end up adding back 20% of what you deleted,

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:20.240
then you didn't delete enough in the first round because you were too timid.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:28.800
Well, so he asked me, did he overdo it? He probably overdid it by 20%, which is his formula.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.800
And they're probably trying to hire people now to keep things going.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:39.120
But it sends a strong signal to people that are hired back or the people that are still there,

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:44.320
the A-player idea. Yeah. And what Steve Jobs and many other great leaders felt and certainly Bezos

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:51.360
and certainly in the early days of Microsoft Bill Gates, it was hardcore only A-players.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:57.920
So how much of Elon's success would you say? Elon's, Steve Jobs' success is the hiring and

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.280
managing of great teams. When I asked Steve Jobs at one point, what was the best product you ever

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:11.840
created? I thought he'd say maybe the Macintosh or maybe the iPhone. He said, no, those products are

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:18.960
hard. The best thing I ever created was the team that made those products. And that's the hard part

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:25.760
is creating a team. And he did, you know, from Johnny Ive to Tim Cook and Eddie Q and Phil Schiller.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:34.720
Elon has done a good job bringing in people. Gwen Shotwell, obviously, Linda Giacorino,

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:44.720
she's, you know, can navigate through the current crises. Certainly stellar people at SpaceX like

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:52.480
Mark Jankosa and then at Tesla like Drew Baglino and Lars Marvy and Tom Zhu and many others.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:09:01.760
He's not as much of a team collaborator as, say, Benjamin Franklin, who, by the way, that's the

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.800
best team ever created, which is the founders. And you had to have really smart people like

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:12.720
Jefferson and Madison and really passionate people like John Adams and his cousin Samuel and really

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.480
a guy of high rectitude like Washington. But you also needed a Ben Franklin who could bring

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.440
everybody together and forge a team out of them and make them compromise with each other.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:30.480
Musk is a magnet for awesome talent. Magnet. Interesting. But there's the

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:37.840
priorities of hiring based on excellence, trustworthiness and drive. These are things

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:47.680
you've described throughout the book. I mean, there's a pretty concrete and rigorous set of

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:52.240
ideas based on which the hiring is done. Oh, yeah. And he has a very good,

01:09:53.040 --> 01:10:01.360
spidey, intuitive sense just looking at people who could, I mean, not looking at them, but studying

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:12.160
them who could be good. One of his ways of operating is what he calls a skip level meeting.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.760
And let's take a very specific thing like the Raptor engine, which is powering the starship.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.760
And it wasn't going well. It looked like a spaghetti bush and it was going to be hard

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:28.240
to manufacture. And he got rid of the people who were in charge of that team. And I remember

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:34.560
that he spent a couple of months doing what he calls skip level, which means instead of meeting

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:42.240
with his direct reports on the Raptor team, he would meet with the people one level below them.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:50.080
And so he would skip a level and meet with them. And I just asked them what they're doing and I

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:55.200
drilled them with questions. And he said, and this is how I figure out who's going to emerge.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.880
He said it was particularly difficult. I was sitting in those meetings because people were

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:04.640
wearing masks. It was during the height of COVID. And he said it made it a little bit harder for him

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:13.520
because he has to get the input. But I watched as a young kid, Dreadlocks named Jacob McKenzie,

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:20.080
he's in the book, is sitting there and he's a bit like you. Engineering mindset speaks in a bit

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.520
of a monotone. Musk would ask a question and he would give an answer. And the answer would be

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:32.480
very straightforward and he didn't get rattled. He was like this. And Musk said one day, called him

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.200
up at 3 a.m. Well, I won't say 3 a.m. But after midnight, he said, you're still around. And

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.360
Jake said, yeah, I'm still at work. And he said, okay, I'm going to make you in charge of

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:49.440
the team building Raptor. And that was like a big surprise. But Jacob McKenzie has now gotten a

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.360
version of Raptor and when they're building them at least one a week and they're pretty awesome.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:12:03.760
And that's where his talent, Musk's talent for finding the right person and promoting them.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:10.560
That's where it is. And promoting it in a way where it's like, here's the ball, here catch.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:18.080
And you run with it. I've interacted with quite a few folks from you and just the Model X,

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:24.560
all throughout, where people on paper don't seem like they would be able to run the thing and

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:28.880
they run it extremely successfully. And he does it wrong. Sometimes he's had a horrible track

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:35.440
record with the Solar Roof division. Wonderful guy named Brian Dow. I really liked him.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:42.400
And when they were doing the Battery Factory Surge in Nevada, Musk got rid of two or three people

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.440
and there's Brian Dow, can do, can do, can do. He stays up all night and he gets promoted and

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.560
runs it. And so finally, Musk goes through two or three people running the Solar Roof division,

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.000
finally calls up Brian Dow. I was sitting in Musk's house in Boca Chica, that little tiny

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:06.960
two bedroom he has. And he offers Brian Dow the job of running Solar Roof. And Brian there,

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:14.800
okay, can do, can do. And two or three times Musk insisted that they install a Solar Roof

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.760
in one of those houses in Boca Chica. This is this tiny village at the south end of Texas.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.640
And late at night, I mean, I'd have to climb up to the top of the roof on these

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:31.680
ladders and stand on this peaked roof as Musk is there saying, why do we need four screws to

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:38.960
put in this single leg? And Brian was just sweating and doing everything. But then after a couple of

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:46.000
months, it wasn't going well and boom, Musk just fired him. So I always try to learn,

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:53.200
what is it that makes those who stay thrive? What's the lesson that? What do you think?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:58.240
Well, I think it's self-knowledge like an Andy Krebs or others, they say,

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.480
I am hardcore. I really want to get a rocket to Mars and that's more important than anything else.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:11.760
One of the people, I think it's Tim Zaman, I hope when he hears this, I'm getting him

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.840
the right person, who took time, it was working for Tesla autopilot. And it was just so intense,

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:23.760
he took some time off and then went to another company. He said, I was burned out at Tesla,

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.720
but then I was bored at the next place. So I called, I think it was Ashok at Tesla,

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.520
said, can I come back? He said, sure. He said, I've learned about myself. I'd rather be burned

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:41.440
out than bored. That's a good line. Well, can you just linger on one of the three that seem

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.680
interesting to you in terms of excellence, trustworthiness and drive? Which one do you think

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.400
is the most important and the hardest to get at? The trustworthiness is an interesting one.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.840
Like, are you ride or die kind of thing? Yeah, I think that especially when it came

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.480
to taking over Twitter, he thought half the people there were disloyal. And he was wrong.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.560
About two thirds were disloyal, not just half. And it was, how do we weed out those? And he did

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:13.520
something and made the firing squad, I call it, or the musketeers, I think is my nickname for them,

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.360
which is the young cousins and two or three other people. He made them look at the Slack messages.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.400
These people had posted, everybody at Twitter had posted. And they went through hundreds of Slack

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:32.320
messages. So if anybody posted on the internal Slack, that jerky Elon Musk is going to take over

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:40.160
and I'm afraid that he's a maniac or something, they would be on the list because they want

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:47.040
all in loyal. They did not look at private Slack messages. And I guess people who are

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:52.800
posting on a corporate Slack board should be aware that your company can look at them.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.600
But that's more than I would have done or most people would have done. And so that was to figure

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:05.200
out who's deeply committed and loyal. I think that was mainly the case at Twitter. He doesn't sit

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:16.400
around at SpaceX saying who's loyal to me. At other places, it's excellence, but that's pretty

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:23.760
well a given. Everybody is like a Mark Jankosa, just whip smart. It's all you hardcore and all in,

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:30.160
especially if you have to move to this bit of a town in the south tip of Texas called Boca Chica,

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:38.240
you got to be all in. Yeah. And that's the drive, the last piece. So you, in terms of

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.200
collaborating, one of the great teams of all time, Ben Franklin, I like that. I thought it was the

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.080
Beatles, but Ben Franklin is pretty good. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Sorry to offend you. So

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.920
read the constitution and read Abbey Road. Listen, Abbey Road, they're both good,

01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.560
but they're in a different league. Yeah, a different league. Okay. So one of the many

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:03.760
things that comes to mind with Ben Franklin is incredible time management. Is there something

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:12.080
you could say about Ben Franklin and about Steve Jobs? I think interesting with Elon is that he,

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:18.560
as you write, runs six companies, seven companies. It depends how you count. Starlink is its own

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:24.720
thing. I don't know. What can you say about these people in terms of time management?

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:30.880
Well, Musk is in a league of his own and the way he does it. First of all,

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:39.440
Steve Jobs had to run Pixar and Apple for a while. But Musk, every couple of hours,

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:45.600
is switching his mindset from how to implant the neural link chip and what will the robot

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:51.840
that implants it in the brain look like and how fast can we make it move, and then the heat

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:59.040
shield on the raptor or switching to human imitation machine learning full self drive.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:07.440
On the night that the Twitter board agreed to the deal, this is huge around the world. I'm

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:12.800
sure you remember, like Musk buys Twitter. It wasn't when the deal closed. It was when

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:21.440
the Twitter accepted his offer. And I thought, okay, but then he went to Boca Chica to South Texas

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:31.520
and spent time fixating, if I remember correctly, a valve in the raptor engine that had a methane

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:40.160
leak issue. And what were the possible ways to fix it? And all the engineers in that room,

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.360
all that I assume are thinking about, this guy just bought Twitter, should we say something?

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:54.800
And then he goes with Kimball to a roadside joint in Brownsville and just sits in the front

01:18:54.800 --> 01:19:01.040
and listens to music with nobody noticing really him being there. One of the things that one of

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:12.000
his strengths and weaknesses in a way is in a given day, he'll focus serially, sequentially,

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:22.560
on many different things. He will worry about uploading video onto x.com or the payment system,

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:30.640
and then immediately switch over to some issue with the FAA giving a permit for starship or

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:37.520
with how to deal with Starlink and the CIA. And when he's focused on any of these things,

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.200
you cannot distract him. It's not like he's also thinking about dealing with Starlink,

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:52.400
but I've got to also worry about the Tesla decision on the new $25,000 car. Now, he'll,

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:59.280
in between these sessions, process information then let off steam. And for better or worse,

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:07.520
he lets off steam by either playing a friend in Polytopia or fire off some tweets, which

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:16.240
is often not a healthy thing, but it's a release for him. I once said he was a great multitasker,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:22.320
and that was a mistake. People corrected me. He's a serial tasker, which means

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:29.840
focuses intensely on a task for an hour, almost has a, what do they call it at restaurants where

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:36.560
they give you a pallet cleanser. He does some pallet cleanser with Polytopia, and then focuses

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.920
on the next task. I mean, is there some wisdom about time management that you can draw from that?

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.720
There's some things that these people do, and you say, okay, I can be that way. I can be more

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:56.000
curious. I can question every rule and regulation. I just don't think anybody should try to emulate

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.600
Musk's time management style, because it takes a certain set of teams, you know,

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:09.360
how to deal with everything else other than the thing he's focusing on, and a certain mind that

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:16.400
can shift, just like his moods can shift. You and I go through transitions, and also, if I'm

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:21.040
thinking about what I'm going to say on this podcast, I'm also thinking about the email my

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.560
daughter just sent about a house that she's looking at, you know, and I'm multitasking.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:33.520
He doesn't actually do that. He singled tasks sequentially. With a focus, that's hard core.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.840
I don't know. I think there's wisdom to draw from that. First of all, he makes me,

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:44.000
very frankly, makes me feel that way, that there's a lot of hours in the day. There's a lot of minutes

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.080
in the day. Like, there's no excuse not to get a lot done, and that requires just an extreme focus,

01:21:51.200 --> 01:22:02.080
an extreme focus and like an urgency. I think the fierce urgency that drives him is important,

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:08.320
and it's sometimes ginned up. Like I say, the fierce urgency of getting to Mars.

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:16.160
And on a Friday night at the launch pad in Boca Chica at 10 p.m., there are only a few people

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.840
working because it's a Friday night. They're not supposed to launch for another eight months.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:26.160
And he orders a surge. He says, I want 200 people here by tomorrow working on this pad.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:30.800
We have to have a fierce sense of urgency or we will never get to Mars.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:43.200
That sense of urgency is also a vibrancy that's really taking on life fully. To me,

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:50.560
this lesson is like, even the mundane can be full of this just richness and you just have to

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:59.040
really take it in intensely. So the switching enables that kind of intensity because most

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.760
of us can't hold that intensity in any one task for a prolonged period of time. Maybe that's also

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:10.560
a lesson. Right. And I guess it goes back to also know who you are, meaning there are people who

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:16.480
can focus intensely and there are people who can see patterns across many things.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:25.040
Look, Leonardo da Vinci, he was not all that focused. He was easily distracted. It's why he

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:32.080
has more unfinished paintings and finished paintings in his canon. But his ability to

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:40.480
see patterns across nature and to in some ways process, procrastinate, be distracted,

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:49.760
that helped him some. But Musk is not that way. And every few months, there's a new

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.000
surge. You don't know where it'll be, but you'll be on solar roofs and all of a sudden

01:23:54.080 --> 01:24:00.240
we'll have a surge and there has to be 100 solar roofs built or this has to be done by tomorrow

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:08.560
or make a starship dome by dawn and surge and do it. And there are people who are built that way.

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:16.640
It is inspiring, but also let's appreciate that there are people who can be really good,

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:29.840
but also can savor the success, savor the moment, savor the quiet sometimes. Musk's big

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:38.880
failing is he can't savor the moment or success. And that's the flip side of hardcore intensity.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:45.520
In Innovators, another book of yours that I love, you write about individuals and about groups.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:52.480
So one of the questions the book addresses is individuals or is it groups that turn the

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:59.840
tides of history? When Henry Kissinger was on the shuttle missions for the Middle East piece,

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:07.200
is the first book I ever wrote, he said, when I was a professor at Harvard, I thought that

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:14.080
history was determined by great forces and groups of people. But when I see it up close,

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.000
I see what a difference an individual can make. He's talking about Sadat and Golda Mayer,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.960
probably talking about himself too, or at least in his mind. And we biographers have this dirty

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.800
secret that we know we distort history a bit by making the narrative too driven by an individual.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.960
But sometimes it is driven by an individual. Musk is a case like that. And sometimes, as I did with

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:45.520
the Innovators, there's teams and people who build on each other. And Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce,

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.640
then getting Andy Grove and doing the microchip, which then comes out and Wozniak and Jobs find it

01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:02.720
at some electronics store and they decide to build the Apple. And so sometimes there are flows of

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:10.000
forces and groups of people. I guess I err a little bit on the side of looking at

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:18.640
what Steve Jobs and Elon Musk and Albert Einstein can do. And I also try to figure out if they hadn't

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.120
been around with the forces of history and the groups of people have done it without them.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:30.000
That's a good historical question as somebody loves history. And you think about special

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:37.760
relativity, one of the 1905 papers. Even after he writes it, it's four years before people truly

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:43.280
get what he's saying, which is it's not just how you observe time as relative, it's time itself

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.360
as relative. And on the general theory, which he does a decade later, I'm not sure we would

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:56.400
gotten that yet. What about moving us into the era of an iPhone in which it's so beautiful that you

01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:04.160
can't live without a thousand songs in your pocket, email and the internet in your pocket and a phone?

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.120
There are a lot of brain dead people from Panasonic to Motorola who didn't get that,

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.240
and it may have been a while. I certainly think it's true of the era of electric vehicles.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:22.240
Jim and Ford, all the great people there, they crossed the boat. And I mean that literally,

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:28.480
they ended up smashing them because they decided to discontinue it. Likewise, nobody was setting

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:37.840
up rockets. Our space shuttle was about to be grounded 12 years ago. And so Musk does things,

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.920
and there'll be people who say and read the book, they'll see the full story, but they'll say it

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:49.840
wasn't Musk who did, Tesla, it was Mark Navihard or Mark Tarpett. No, no, no. There were people who

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:57.520
had helped create the shells of companies and other things, and they were all deserved to be

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.520
called co-founders. But the guy who actually gets us to a million electric vehicles a year

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:13.440
is Elon Musk and without him, I don't think we... Look, if anybody five years from now buys a car

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:20.480
that's gasoline powered, we'll think that's quaint, you know, that's odd. I mean,

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.120
suddenly we've changed. We're not going to do it. 90% of that is Elon Musk.

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:32.720
We're all mortal. When and how do you think Elon will retire from the insanely productive

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:39.360
schedule he's on now? I would think that he would hate to retire. I think that he can't live

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:52.640
without the pressure, the drama, the all-in feeling. It's never been anything that seemed to have

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:59.040
crossed his mind. He's never said, maybe I love Larry Ellison's house on the beach in Hawaii,

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:05.200
maybe I should spend time in doing. Instead, he says things like, I learned early on that vacations

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:11.120
will kill you. He gets malaria when he goes on one vacation. I mean, he goes on vacation at one

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.840
point and they oust him from PayPal. And then he goes to Africa one way. He gets malaria. He says,

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:20.000
I've learned, vacations kill you. Lesson learned. Well, it's interesting because the projects are

01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.120
hundred plus year projects. Many of these. One of the weird things

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:33.120
is watching him think incredibly long term. One of the meetings every week

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.280
early on when I was watching him was Mars colonizer. And we did through a two-hour

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:47.520
meeting about what would the governance structure be on Mars? What would people wear?

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:56.560
How would the robots work? And would there be democracy or should there be a different form of

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:02.800
governance? I'm sitting there saying, what are they doing? What are they talking about?

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.720
They're trying to build rocket ships and everything else. They are worrying about the

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:14.240
governance structure of Mars. And likewise, whenever he's in a tense moment, like there's

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:19.920
a rocket, it's about to be launched, he'll start asking people something in the way future, like

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:26.320
the new lead engine or something. If we're going to build that, do we have enough materials ready

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:35.600
to order? Or, I don't know, he'll just ask questions like when he's building robot taxi,

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:42.320
the global car, the $25,000 inexpensive global car. That's not a total passion. He was talked into

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:48.880
doing that. His passion is robot taxis. But his passion is, how are we going to make this factory

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:56.000
to do a million cars a year? So even the robot taxi is a longer range vision. I mean,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.680
he's been touting it since 2016, but we're not. I don't know, robot taxis, I mean, there's,

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:08.960
Waymo may be doing a little experiments, but there's not cars being manufactured

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.240
without steering wheels that are going to take over the highways.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.040
Yet, so he's always looking way into the future, is my point.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:23.520
I just hope that there's a lot of Da Vinci's and Steve Jobs' and

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:28.640
Einstein's and Elon Musk's that carry the flame forward.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:34.400
That's one of the reasons you write books about these people is so that if you're a young woman

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:38.800
in a school where you're not being told to do science and you read the Code Breaker

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:46.800
about Jennifer Doudna, you say, okay, I can be that. And when you say, oh, maybe I'll be a regulator

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:52.880
or you say, oh, no, maybe I'll be the person who pushes the boundaries, who pushes the lines,

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.760
who pushes, as Steve Jobs said, the human race.

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:03.440
Let me ask you about your mind, your genius, your process.

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.600
I'll give you two out of three.

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:10.800
All right. Take me through your process of writing a biography. I mean, the full of it.

01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:19.440
And I'm not just writing a biography, but understanding deeply, which your books have done

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.800
for the human story and the bigger ideas underline the human story.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:29.520
So you've written biographies, both of individuals, which are hardly individuals.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:39.760
It's a really big, complex picture. And biographies of ideas that involve individuals.

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:43.280
Well, step one for me is trying to figure out how the mind works.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.160
What causes Einstein to make that leap?

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:54.480
Elon Musk to say stainless steel while he's looking at a carbon fiber rocket.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:56.800
Or how do you make the mental leap?

01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.280
Because I write about smart people.

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:02.400
The smart people are a dime a dozen. They don't usually amount to much.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:06.080
You have to be creative, imaginative, to think different, as Jobs would say.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:11.440
And so what makes people creative? What makes them take imaginative leaps?

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.320
That's the key question you've got to ask.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.960
You also ask the questions like you've asked earlier,

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:22.160
which is what demons are jangling in their head and how do they harness them into drives?

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:28.480
So you look at all that and you try to observe really carefully the person.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:40.000
One of the more mundane things I do is a lot of writers try to give you a lot of their opinions

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:45.760
and preach or whatever. As I said, this mentor said,

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.480
two people, types come out, preachers, storytellers. Be a storyteller.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:34:01.920
I try whenever I'm trying to convey a thought, there's six magic words that I almost should have

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.400
written on a card penned above my desk, which is, let me tell you a story.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:15.520
So if somebody says, how does Elon Musk figure out good talent?

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.200
As you did, I think, well, let me tell you the story. I'll tell you the story of Jake McKenzie.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.880
Or this is not something I invented. I mean, this is the way the good Lord does it in the

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:32.800
Bible. I mean, has the best opening lead sentence ever in the beginning, comma,

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:38.560
and then it's stories. And secondly, to pick up on that lead sentence in the beginning,

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:48.320
make it chronological. Everybody in the 40th year of their life has grown from the 39th year

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:55.920
and the 38th year. And so you want to show how people evolve and grow. I had the greatest of all

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:02.160
nonfiction narrative editors, Alice Mayhew at Simon Schuster, who among other things created

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:07.200
all the present men with Woodward and Burnsey. But she had a note she'd put in the margins of

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:14.160
my books that was a tigta. And it meant all things in good time. Keep it chronological.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:16.800
If it's good enough in the Bible, it's good enough for you.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.840
Interesting. To me, that's a small note. But to you, it's extremely important.

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:26.240
Because it's a framework for how you structure things, but also how you understand things,

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:34.640
which is if you keep it a chronological narrative, then you're showing how a person has grown

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:43.040
from one experience you've talked about to the next one. And that moral growth, creative growth,

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:52.880
risk-taking growth, wisdom, that's the essence of creativity. But you can't do it. There's a

01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:00.400
term, building's Roman, which is a book that carries a narrative and tells how people learn

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:08.480
something. I'm a big believer in narrative. If you're an academic, sometimes not today,

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:14.240
but in like 20 years ago, 30 years ago, there were two things you thought were bad. One was

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:21.680
having a great person theory of history in which you decided to do biography. I had a great

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:27.120
professor when I was in college. Her name was Doris Kearns. She later married Dick Goodwin.

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:35.120
She, when she was going for tenure at the university, wrote a biography of Lyndon Johnson

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.920
and the American Dream. They denied her tenure because it was beneath the dignity of the academy

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:49.600
to write history through one person. That's great. It opened up the field of biography

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:59.600
to us non-academics, starting with David McCullough, Bob Caro, but maybe John Meacham and myself are

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:05.440
in a new generation and certainly there's a generation coming after us. But the second thing,

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:14.800
besides telling it through people, which is the academy tended to disdain what they called

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:20.320
imposing a narrative and what you made it storytelling. Because that meant you were

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:29.440
leaving things out and making it into a narrative. Well, that's how we form our views of the world.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.640
Well, let me ask you this question. In terms of gathering an understanding,

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:43.040
how much of it is one observing and how much of it is interviews?

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:49.600
Yeah. Obviously, it depends on the subject. I mean, with a Ben Franklin, it's all based on

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:55.280
archives. Of course, we have 40 volumes of letters he wrote. That was a good old days,

01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.520
when every day you'd write 20 letters. The Musk book is based much more on observation

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:08.000
than almost any of my books because he opened up in a way that was breathtaking to me.

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.520
You know, even when he'd be sitting playing

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:18.560
polytopia or seething at other people, he'd have me just sitting there watching.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.320
I mean, I spent a lot of time with Jennifer Dowden at her side. I went to her lab and edited

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:33.920
a human gene with a pipette and a test tube. But I would say I spent 30 hours with her. I can't

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:44.720
count 100 hours and more just observing Musk. I'm not sure that any biographer,

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:53.440
perhaps since Boswell took on Dr. Johnson, has ever had quite as much up close,

01:38:53.440 --> 01:39:02.400
meaning five feet away at all times, access. Because of that, I'll go back to what I said

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:08.640
a moment ago. I try to get out of the way of the story. It's not about me. I try to just say,

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.480
okay, here's what happened. Here's this story. Here's what happened the night he came in to

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:19.440
Twitter for the first time and let you form your own judgment. What about the interviews?

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:26.640
You've had a lot of conversations. You give acknowledgement to the people you've done interviews

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:35.440
with. Well, one, I have to ask as an aspiring interviewer myself, how?

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:42.960
People love to talk. People just love, you know that. And I've had 140, maybe 150 people,

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.760
they're all listed in the back. One of the little things that people won't notice,

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:52.880
but I'll say it now, is all of them are on the record. Getting them to talk is easy.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.560
They all want to talk about Musk. But then at a certain point, say,

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:03.440
I don't put anonymous quotes in my book. I cite things. I say, if you're tough enough,

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:08.880
and you've gone through this, and a lot of times it takes two or three calls back.

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.400
Somebody will tell me a story, say, oh, no, no, no, I don't enjoy it. But I think it's important to

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:20.640
know where everything came from. And with Musk, it's, you know, I had that from the very beginning

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.600
because I was a Time Magazine reporter. I'd worked reporter for the Times-Pikion on New Orleans.

01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:32.400
I, first day on the job, I had to go cover a murder and phoned in the story from a pay phone.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:37.200
And my editor, you know, the city editor said, well, did you talk to the family? I went, no,

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:42.480
Billy. I mean, the family, you know, the daughter just got, he said, go knock on the door. I knocked

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.720
on the door. An hour later, they were still talking. They were bringing out her yearbook.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.480
Lesson one, I learned. People want to talk if you're willing to just listen.

01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:58.080
And whether it be Henry Kissinger, you just push the button and say Kissinger, and people tell

01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:04.000
you the stories all the way through Elon Musk, everybody talked. Everybody in his family,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.880
everybody he fired, everybody. I mean, I think it's important to listen to people.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.680
And the other thing I learned as a reporter, back when I was covering politics in New Hampshire

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:19.680
in the early campaigns, I learned from two or three great reporters, a guy named David Broder

01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:25.120
and Tim Russert, the late NBC guy. They do what was called door knocking. You just walk in a

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.480
neighborhood knock on a door and ask people about the election. But they said, here's the secret.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.800
Don't ask any leading questions. Don't have any premise. Just say, hey, I'm trying to figure

01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:43.200
out this election, what's going on? What do you think? And then stay silent. With Musk,

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:51.040
a third secret, you know this well. He'll go silent at times. Sometimes a minute, two minutes,

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:57.280
four minutes, don't try to fill the silences. If you're a listener, you got to learn,

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:02.880
okay, he's not saying anything for four minutes. I can outlast him.

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.960
It's tough. As humans, it's very tough. Respecting the silence is really, really difficult.

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:13.200
I'm speaking of demons. When there's silence, all the demons show up in my head.

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.600
The fear, I think, is if I don't say anything, it's boring. And if I say something, it's going to

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:26.240
be stupid. That the basic engine that just keeps running, not on the podcast, but also

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:31.200
in human interaction. And so I think there's that nervous energy when interacting with people.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:39.040
You can never go wrong by staying silent, if there's nothing you have to say. Not something

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:49.600
I've mastered, but I do when I'm a reporter, try to master that, which is don't ask complex

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:57.120
questions, don't interject. And when somebody hasn't fully answered the question, don't say,

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.520
well, let me just stay silent. And then they'll keep talking.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.400
Just give them a chance to keep talking. Even if they've kind of finished, you're still.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:13.120
Sometimes they haven't given you enough. Instead of following up, I'll just nod and keep waiting.

01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:18.080
You're making it sound simple. Is there a secret to getting people to open up more?

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:26.320
I'm somewhat lucky because I started off working for a daily newspaper. And people back then

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.240
they wouldn't talk to the newspaper reporter. But you also have a way about you. I feel like

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:40.960
you have a cowboy and a saloon. You just kind of want to talk. I don't know what it is. Maybe

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:44.880
this, I don't know if it's developer, you're born with it, but it feels like I want to tell

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:56.400
you a story of some sort. A couple of things. I did learn to be more quiet. I'm sure I know

01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:05.840
when I was younger or even I'll see videos of me at news things where I'm always trying to

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:13.360
interject a question. And so you learn to be quieter sometimes. I haven't mastered it. I haven't

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:21.760
learned it enough. You learn to be naturally curious. Many reporters today, when they ask a

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.880
question, are either trying to play gotcha or trying to get a news scoop or trying to

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:39.360
gig something that can make a lead. And if you actually are curious and you really want to

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:46.080
know the answer to a question, then people can tell that you asked it because you want the answer,

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:52.240
not because you're playing a game with them. I'm sure some of them off the record, some of

01:44:52.240 --> 01:45:00.000
them on the record you had, maybe just some incredible conversations. I was going to say

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.840
some of the greatest conversations ever, but who knows. Some of the best conversations ever are

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:08.720
probably somewhere in South America between two drunk people that we never get to hear.

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:16.960
So I don't know. But is there advice you can give from what you've learned to somebody like me

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:20.800
on how to have good conversation, especially when it's recorded?

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:26.080
Well, to be actually curious. I mean, every question you've asked me is because I think

01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:32.480
you actually want to know the answer and you've done your homework to be open and not to have an

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:39.920
agenda. I mean, we all suffer from there being too many agendas in the world today.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:46.800
Yeah, so that's just genuine curiosity. But there's something when you talk about just one-on-one

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:56.160
interaction, whether it's Elon or Steve Jobs, there's something beautiful about that person's

01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:07.200
mind. And it feels like it's possible to reveal that, to discover that together efficiently.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:14.640
And that's kind of the goal of a conversation. Well, I mean, look, you're amongst the top

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:21.360
podcasters and interviewers in the world today. You have an earnestness to you.

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:30.240
Ben Franklin is the person who taught me, I mean, by reading him, the most about

01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:35.120
on conversation. He wrote a wonderful essay on that. It includes on silence.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:47.840
But it includes trying to ask sincere questions rather than get a point across.

01:46:48.720 --> 01:47:01.360
I mean, it's somewhat socratic. But whenever he wanted to start a fireman's core in Philadelphia,

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:05.600
he would go to his group that he called the Leather Apron Club

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:12.160
and they would pose a question, why don't we have it? What would it take? What would be good?

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:17.600
And then the second part is to make sure that you listen. And if somebody has even just

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:25.920
the germ of an idea, give them credit for it. Like, as Joe said, the real problem is this.

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:37.040
And I do think that if I'm in situations, and I just mean even at dinner or something,

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:46.720
and I'm with somebody, I'm usually curious and the conversation will proceed with questions.

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.560
And I guess it's also because I'm pretty interested in what anybody's doing,

01:47:52.560 --> 01:48:00.160
whoever I happen to be with. And that's a talent you have, which is you're pretty

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:07.600
genuine in your interests. There are people like Benjamin Franklin, like the, I'll say,

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.640
Charlie Rose, even though he's in disfavor, who are interested in a huge number of subjects.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:20.080
And I think that helps as well to be interested in basketball and opera and physics and metaphysics.

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.240
That was a Ben Franklin, that was a Leonardo trick, which is they wanted to know everything

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:32.320
you could possibly know about every subject knowable. But there's a different aspect of this,

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:38.480
which is that I would love to hear how you've solved it, or if you've faced it,

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:44.480
that you're certainly disarming. See, I'm like peppering you with compliments here,

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:48.560
trying to get you over. That's a very disarming method. Yeah. I've recently talked to Benjamin

01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.360
and Yahoo. We'll talk again. We're unfortunate because the scheduling and complexities only

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:59.440
had one hour, which is very difficult, very difficult with a charismatic politician.

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:04.800
I understand this, but he's also a charismatic talker, which is very difficult to break through

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:11.680
in one hour. But there are people have built up walls, whether it's because of demons or because

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.600
of their politicians. And so they have agendas and narratives and so on. And so to break through

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.480
those, I wonder if there's some advice, some wisdom you've learned on how to

01:49:24.480 --> 01:49:33.040
sort of wear down through water or whatever method the walls that we've built up as individuals.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.240
I mean, you call it disarming, which I don't know that I am, but disarming basically means

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.600
you're taking down their shields also. And you know, when people have a shield,

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:52.320
and you try to give them comfort, I had zero of that problem with Elon Musk. I mean, it was like

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:57.840
disarming to me, which is, I kept waiting to say, okay, he's not going to always,

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:12.880
they've got a shell or he won't do that. But he was almost crazily open and did not seem to

01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:24.000
want to be spinning or hiding or faking things. And I've been lucky. Doudna was that way.

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:31.840
Steve Jobs was that way. But you have to put in time too. In other words, you can't say,

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:37.280
okay, there's a one hour interview and I'm going to break down every wall. It's like on your fifth

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.520
visit. Yes. Well, actually, that's one of the things in my situation, you learn

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.280
fifth visit is very nice, but sometimes you don't get a fifth visit. Sometimes it's just the first

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:54.400
date. And I think what it boils down to, and we said disarming, but there's something about this

01:50:54.400 --> 01:51:03.280
person that you trust. I think a lot of it just boils down to trust in some deep human way. And I

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:10.400
think with many other people I've spoken with, sometimes the trust happens after the interview,

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:15.760
which is really sad because it's like, oh man. I've never been in your situation where I have a

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:25.600
show. I usually have mint packs at the wheel. I'm not a first date person. Yeah. Well, you know.

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:30.240
But then I'm lucky. I mean, I say lucky, but I'm in print. I understand.

01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:35.680
Print is a couple thousand-year-old medium, but they're those of us who love it.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.880
Well, the nature of the podcast medium is that I'm a one-night stand kind of girl.

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:48.560
Let me ask you about objectivity. You followed Elon and you followed DJ. I mean,

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.240
I don't even know if you would say you're front. You have to be careful with words like that,

01:51:52.640 --> 01:52:01.280
there's an intimacy. And how do you remain objective? Do you want to remain objective

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:07.360
while telling a deeply human story? Yeah. I mean, I want to be honest, which I think is

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:18.400
akin to being objective. I try to keep in mind who am I writing for? I'm not writing for Elon Musk,

01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:23.920
as I say. I haven't sent him the book. I don't know if I don't think he's read it yet.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:36.720
I've got one person I'm writing for, the open-minded reader. And if I can put in a story and say,

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:41.920
well, that will piss off the subject or that will really make the subject happy,

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:49.360
that's irrelevant. Or I try to make that a minor consideration. Will the reader

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:54.960
have a better understanding because I've put this story in the book?

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:07.280
I'm a bit of a romantic. So to me, even your Einstein book had lessons on romance and relationships.

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:13.040
Oh, dear. So how important are romantic relationships to the success of great men,

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:20.240
great women, great minds? Well, sometimes people who affect the course of humanity

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:25.520
have better relationships with humanity than they do with the humans sitting around them.

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:33.760
Einstein had two interesting relationships with wives. You know,

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.800
Maleva, his first wife, was a sounding board and helped with the mathematics of the special

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:48.640
relativity paper in particular. But he didn't treat her well. I mean, he made her sign a letter

01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:55.200
that she wouldn't interrupt him. And finally, when she wanted a divorce, he couldn't afford it

01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:01.920
because he was still a patent clerk. And so he offered her a deal, which is, I think,

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:06.960
totally amazing. He said, one of these days, one of those papers from 1905

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:13.840
is going to win the Nobel Prize. If we get a divorce, I'll give you the money.

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.120
There was a lot of money back then, like a million dollars now or something.

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:24.800
And she's smart. She's a scientist. She consults with a few other scientists. And after a week or

01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:30.880
so, she takes the bet. Is that until, what, 1919 that he wins his Nobel Prize?

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:37.360
And she gets all the money. She buys three apartment buildings in Zurich.

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:45.520
With his second life, Elsa, it was more a partnership of convenience. It was not

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:53.280
a romantic love, but he knew. And that's sometimes what people need in life. He's just a partner.

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:56.000
I mean, somebody who's going to handle the stuff you're not going to handle.

01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:05.360
So I guess if you look at my books, they're not great inspiring guides to personal relationships.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.760
Let me ask you about actually the process of writing itself. When you've observed, when you've

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:17.440
listened, when you've collected all the information, what's maybe even just the silly

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:22.720
mundane question of what do you eat for breakfast before you start writing?

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.400
When do you write? First of all, breakfast is not my favorite meal.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.320
And those people who tell you that you have to start with a hearty breakfast, I

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:36.720
look askance. Yes. And morning is not my favorite day part. It's all right at night.

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:45.120
And because I love narrative, it's easy to structure a book, which I can make a

01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:53.520
outline that if I printed it out or notes would be 100 pages, but everything's in order.

01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:02.080
In other words, if there's a burning man and he's coming back from Grimes and then there's

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:10.880
a solar roof thing and then there's something, I put it all in order day by day as an outline.

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.360
And that disciplines me when I'm starting to write to follow the mantra from Alice Mayhew,

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:22.400
my first editor, which is all things in good time. Don't get ahead of the story, don't have to flash

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:29.760
back. And then after you get it so that it's all chronological, you know, then you have to do

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:36.800
some clustering. You know, you have to say, okay, we're going to do the decision to do starship

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:44.160
or to build a factory in Texas or to whatever. And then you sometimes have the organizational

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:50.240
problem of, yeah, and that gets us all the way up to here. Do I keep that in this, that chapter,

01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:56.320
or do I wait until later when it's better chronologically? But those are easy.

01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.080
Well, what about the actual process of telling the story?

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:09.680
Well, that's the mantra I mentioned earlier, which is whenever I get pause or I don't know how to

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:16.800
say something, I just say, let me tell you a story. And then I find the actual anecdote,

01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:24.240
the story, the tale that encompasses what I'm trying to convey. And then I don't say what I'm

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:30.560
trying to convey. I don't have a transition sentence that says, you know, Elon sometimes changes

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:36.000
mind so often he couldn't remember whether he had changed his mind. You know, you don't need

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.160
transition sentences. You just say, all right, here's the point I need to make next. And so

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:49.600
you start with a sentence that says, you know, one day in January in the factory in Texas, comma.

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:58.640
Well, one of the things that I'd love to ask you is for advice for young people. To me,

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:08.080
first advice would be to read biographies in a sense, because they help you understand of all

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:13.920
the different ways you can live a life well lived. But from having written biographies,

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:20.960
having studied so many great men and women, what advice could you give to people of how to live

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:28.000
this life? Well, I keep going back to the classics and Plato and Aristotle and Socrates.

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:33.520
And I guess it's Plato's maxim, but he may be quoting Socrates,

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:40.400
that the unexamined life is not worth living. And it gets back to the know thyself and nothings,

01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:46.720
which is you don't have to figure out what is the big meaning of it all. But you have to figure out

01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:55.920
why you're doing what you're doing. And that requires something that I did not have enough

01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:05.280
of when I was young, which is self-awareness and examining every motive, everything I do.

01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:17.680
Where does the examination lead you? Is it to a shift in life trajectory?

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:24.320
I mean, it's not for me sort of, all right, I've now decided having been a journalist,

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:30.960
I'll run a think tank or I'll run a network or I'll write a bio. It is actually something

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:38.320
that's more useful on an hourly basis. Like, why am I about to say that to somebody? Or why

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:50.640
am I going to do this particular act? What's my true motive here? And also, in the broader sense,

01:59:50.640 --> 02:00:00.000
to learn, as I did after a couple years at CNN, my examination of my life is that I'm not great

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:07.680
at running complex organizations. I'm not great as a manager. Given the choice, I'd rather somebody

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:13.840
else have to manage me than me have to manage people. But it took me a while to figure that out.

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:20.720
And I was probably too ambitious when I was young and at time magazine. That was when I was green

02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:29.200
and, oh well, that was when I was in my salad days in green and judgment. And it was like chasing

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:36.000
the next level at time and corporate at whatever it might be. And then one day,

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.480
I caught the brass ring and I became an editor and then the top editor. And after a while, I realized

02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:50.400
that wasn't really totally what I'm suited to be, especially when I got put in charge of CNN.

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:56.400
I mean, all young people are almost by definition in their salad days in green and judgment.

02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:04.480
But you learn what's motivating you and then you learn to ask,

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:10.160
but is that really what I want? Should I be careful of what I'm wishing for?

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:20.240
One of the big examinations you can do is the fact that you and everybody dies one day.

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:26.160
How much do you, Walter Isaacson, think about death? Are you afraid of it?

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:30.720
No, and I don't think about it a lot, but I do think about Steve Jobs's, let me tell your story,

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:37.200
you know, which is the wonderful Steve Jobs story of, I think after he was diagnosed but before

02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:44.720
it was public. And he gave both a stand for talk but other things in which he said, the fact that

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.960
we are going to die gives you focus and gives you meaning. If you're going to live, and Elon

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:56.560
Musk has said that to me, which is a lot of the tech grows out in the Silicon Valley that looking

02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:05.120
for ways to live forever. I can think, Musk says, of nothing worse. We read the myth of Sisyphus and

02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:15.600
we know how bad it is to be condemned to eternal life. So there was an ancient Greece, the person

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:22.000
who walked behind the king and said, Momento Mori, remember you're going to die? And it kept

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:33.680
people from losing it a bit. Do you think about legacy? The lucky thing about being a biographer

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:39.120
is that you kind of know what your legacy is. There's going to be a shelf and it'll be of

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:47.360
interesting people. And you will have inspired a 17-year-old biology student somewhere to be

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:55.600
the next great biochemist or somebody to start a company like Elon Musk.

02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:04.720
And what I think more about, I won't say giving back, that's such a trite thing,

02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:12.560
I moved back to New Orleans for a reason. First of all, the hurricane hit. And after Katrina,

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:19.200
I was asked to be vice chair of the recovery authority. And I realized everything I've got

02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:28.320
going for me, it all comes from this beautiful gem of a troubled city. The wonderful high school I

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:36.640
went to, the wonderful streets where I learned to ride a bike, and it's got challenges. I'm never

02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:44.960
going to solve challenges at the grand global level, but I can go back home and say part of my

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:52.080
legacy is going to be I tried to pay it back to my hometown, even by teaching at Tulane,

02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:56.800
which I don't do as a favor. I mean, I enjoy the hell out of it, but it's like, all right,

02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:02.160
I'm part of a community. And I think we lose that in America because people who are lonely

02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:06.160
are lonely because they're not part of a community. But I've got all my high school kids,

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:11.360
they're friends, they're all still in New Orleans. I've got my family, but I also have Tulane,

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:16.880
institutions in New Orleans that have been there forever. And if I can get involved in helping

02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:22.640
the school system in New Orleans, of helping the youth empowerment programs, of helping the

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:28.000
innovation center at Tulane, I was even on the city planning commission, which worries about

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:34.960
zoning ordinances for short term rentals, go figure. But it was like, no, immerse myself in

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:41.920
my community because my community was just so awesomely good at allowing me to become who I

02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:52.240
became and has trouble year by year, hurricane by hurricane, making sure that each new generation

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:57.760
can be creative. And it's a city of creativity from jazz to the food to the architecture.

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:04.640
So when I think of, I won't say legacy, but what am I going to do to pay it forward, which is a

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:12.000
lower level way of saying legacy, I pay it forward by going back to the place where I began and

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:19.600
trying to know it for the first time. That was a rip off of a TS Eliot line. I don't want you to

02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:25.840
think I thought of that one. Always cite your sources, I appreciate it. TS Eliot, if you ever

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:32.160
need to figure it out, the four quartets, that part at the end, which is we shall not see some

02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:37.600
exploration and the end of all of our exploring will be to return to the place where we started

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.960
and know it for the first time. They're the unknown but half remembered gate. It's just

02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:54.640
beautiful. And that's been an inspiration of what do you do in, I guess if it's a Shakespeare play,

02:05:54.640 --> 02:06:02.720
you call it act five. Well, you go back to the place where you came and don't sit there

02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:07.520
worrying about legacy, but you'll sit there saying, how do I make sure that somebody else can have

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:16.640
a magical trajectory starting in New Orleans? Well, to me, you're one of the greatest storytellers

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:22.240
of all time. I've been a huge fan. Definitely not true, but it's so sweet of you. See, you can be

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:33.680
rudely interrupting. I think probably Ben Franklin, so for I don't know how many years, 15 years,

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:39.840
Einstein, all the way through today has been a huge fan of yours. And you're one of the people

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:46.640
that I thought surely would not lower themselves to appear and have a conversation with me.

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:53.280
And it's just a giant gift to me. Hey, I flew into Austin for this because I am a big fan,

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:58.160
and especially a big fan because you take people seriously and you care.

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:03.520
Thank you a thousand times. Thank you for expecting me and for inspiring just millions of

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:08.400
people with your stories. Again, an incredible storyteller, incredible human. And thank you for

02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:13.680
talking today. Thank you, Alex. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Walter Isaacson.

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:18.640
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:21.760
let me leave you with one of my favorite quotes from Carl Jung.

02:07:22.880 --> 02:07:28.720
People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls.

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:34.800
One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:40.880
conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
