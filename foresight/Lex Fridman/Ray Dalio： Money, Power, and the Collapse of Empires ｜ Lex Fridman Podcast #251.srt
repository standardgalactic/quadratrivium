00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio, his second time on the podcast.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:10,280
He is a legendary investor, founder of Bridgewater Associates, author of a book

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,120
I highly recommend called Principles, and also a new book called Principles

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,080
for Dealing with a Changing World Order that looks at the geopolitics of the day,

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,800
especially U.S. and China, to the lens of history, providing a fascinating

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,880
model for the rise and fall of empires that can be applied to the analysis

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,160
of our world today.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,040
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,120
And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,920
When you look at the history of the world, as you have done in your new book,

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order, what is more important,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,160
more impactful, money or power?

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,920
They go hand in hand.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,240
They support each other and they compete with each other.

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,160
Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,520
That power has to do with all that they can buy, but it also has the ability

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,200
to influence those with political power.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,440
So, and so you see this throughout history, this symbiotic relationship.

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:32,640
You know, for example, between the royal families, the nobility and the church.

21
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,400
So, you see that group of people supporting each other in various ways and

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,360
then wrestling around with each other for the money and power among that group.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,200
So, the dynamic that's quite classic is you could look at the parties in power.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,720
Back in, you know, the 16th, 17th centuries, you would look at royal families,

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,120
nobles and the church, if you're in Europe.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,640
And then you would look at agricultural land and there was a certain dynamic.

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,000
And that varies over time.

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,400
It changes as those people get thrown out and technology changes.

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:26,400
So, when we evolved, when the society evolved, so that it would produce goods

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,360
and services and you have something like the industrial revolution, the first

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,200
industrial revolution, they have machines and you have the talent of people

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,240
that are off the farms and then you have a struggling for power.

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,000
You see that power mix change.

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,480
And so, we don't see that same power mix anymore, but you still see the same dynamic.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:01,200
You see those with money dealing with those who have political power around

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,720
those assets that are considered most valuable to particularly the productive

37
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
assets that produce money.

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,480
And political power is usually centered around nation state.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,320
So, the major locus is the powers, the nations.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes.

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:29,680
In 1668, after 30 years of war, there was the development of nation states.

42
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,120
Before then, we had, it was really the development of the countries as we know

43
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,640
it, that there were borders and that within those borders, those who had

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,480
control got to control it and there would not to be intrusions in those

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,960
borders and that's how we established the nation state.

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,720
And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,480
There is a central level and then there is a typically a province or state

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,920
level down below and then there's a municipal level.

49
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,560
So, they each have different levels of power and it's the coordination of those

50
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,720
that determines how the country is run.

51
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,160
You write that the quote archetypal big cycle governs the rising and declining

52
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,800
empires and influences everything about them, including their currencies and markets.

53
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,600
The most important three cycles are the ones you mentioned in the introduction.

54
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,160
The long-term debt and capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle

55
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,200
and the external order and disorder cycle.

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,160
Can you describe this big cycle?

57
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,480
There are two orders.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,680
There is an order by a order, I mean a system, how the system works.

59
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,480
So, there's an internal order that is the internal governance system and that's

60
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,040
usually set out in a constitution or some agreements and then there's the world

61
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,600
order, how the world system.

62
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,480
So, for example, in 1945, at the end of a war, which is basically a fight for

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,760
determining the world order, the winners of the fight got together and created

64
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,960
the world system as we now know it.

65
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,240
44, they created the Brenton Woods monetary system that determined the money

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,040
pretty much and because the United States won and had 80% of the world's money,

67
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
gold was money then and has 80% of the world's gold and it was half the world

68
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,760
economy and it was the great military power.

69
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,480
The order was built around an American world order so that the United

70
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,160
nations was in New York, the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington and they

71
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
built that new order.

72
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,200
So, classically, you have a war to determine whose rules were following and then you

73
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,640
have the new order being constructed.

74
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,720
After that, there is usually period of extended peace and prosperity.

75
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,160
Peace suits prosperity and so there's not, and the reason you have the peace is

76
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,760
because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.

77
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,120
You know you're going to lose, you've surrendered, there's been the surrendering.

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
They carve up the world, they say what it's going to look like, who's going to

79
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:47,040
control what and then you come into that period of peace and then prosperity where

80
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,600
then there's a working together.

81
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,880
Usually, at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt, you've wiped out a

82
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,400
lot of the issues, the class warfare and so on and then there's good working

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,400
together so those great periods, such as the industrial revolution in the late

84
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,160
1800s or what we've experienced in the post-World War II period are peaceful and

85
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
prosperous periods led largely by the dominant world power.

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:32,480
Over a period of time, since really 1500 and maybe before, but really 1500 when the

87
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,520
Dutch invented capitalism and what I mean by that, they invented the first

88
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,720
capital markets, the first stocks and the first stock market, that since then

89
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,440
capitalism has been an effective tool for building wealth because it got resources

90
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
into the hands of inventive people.

91
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,800
That's when we move from agriculture to the importance of inventiveness of people.

92
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,800
They got resources and then they built that prosperity.

93
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,600
In that process of doing that, they create wealth gaps naturally.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,840
Those who make a lot of money make a lot more and then those that don't.

95
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:24,120
And it also produces opportunity gaps because, for example, those who earn a

96
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,520
lot of money have that wealth, they have the power to educate their children in a

97
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,920
way that others don't and the gaps grow and also the debts grow at that time.

98
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:46,040
When they go around the world with their competitiveness, they earn a lot of money.

99
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,760
So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire, learned how to build ships and that

100
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,920
would go around the world.

101
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,120
A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle is the improvement of education.

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,920
And by education, I mean the skills that come from education, but also civility,

103
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,280
the ability to deal with wealth together.

104
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,360
So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world and they had military

105
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,040
power, but they were also very inventive society.

106
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,880
25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch.

107
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,640
And so as they went around the world, they also brought their currency and they

108
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,720
brought their military.

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,720
They needed the currency, they paid for things and that currency.

110
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,960
And then the more that happens, the more that becomes a reserve currency and then

111
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,160
they have their military.

112
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,040
So they need their military strength.

113
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,400
And so you see it evolve in all of those ways.

114
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,160
But over a period of time, as they become more successful and more expensive, they

115
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:01,760
become, they become more expensive and newer countries come along, like the UK,

116
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,000
then be, learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch and could do that less

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,600
expensively and also when they become more expensive, so less competitive.

118
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,600
And also the work ethic begins to change.

119
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,560
They believe that since they're richer, they can enjoy life more.

120
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,680
They don't have to work quite as hard.

121
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,400
And so you start to see the tilt.

122
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,720
Now you start to see the development of the top.

123
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,000
And when you have a world reserve currency, that allows you to borrow a lot of

124
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,880
money because those who want to save want to hold your money.

125
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,040
And that means that they'll lend you money.

126
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,560
And so those countries get deeper into debt.

127
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,240
So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness and they get themselves

128
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,760
into financial circumstances, which are not good.

129
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,120
And they have large wealth gaps, which set the stage for downturns.

130
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,000
And when they have downturns, the first question is, do they have enough money?

131
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,720
And traditionally, you know, money is, is resources.

132
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,600
So you classically see that the coffers are bare, that they're spending more money

133
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,280
than they're, than they are earning and they run out of money in the coffers.

134
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,720
And their granaries are empty rather than stocked so that they give them the buffer.

135
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,800
And as that deteriorates, that's that worsens conditions.

136
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,360
And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them, they see greater

137
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,000
internal conflict over wealth.

138
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,840
And then they have the problems internally and the problems externally, which usually

139
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,280
results in an internal war or an external war that leads to the change

140
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,800
in the, to the new world order.

141
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,200
And to you, the Dutch empire is a good example of that.

142
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,240
The British, what are some of the key examples that you think about in the book

143
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,480
of this process that follow the big cycle?

144
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Well, the leading reserve currency empires, but it applies to all the empires,

145
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,600
were the, the Dutch, the British, the American and the Chinese.

146
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,640
But you could follow the same pattern.

147
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,960
In the book, it was very important for me to not just use words and concepts

148
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
because that's subjective.

149
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,280
It was very important for me to use actual measurements.

150
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,400
So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.

151
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,720
You can see, where's the education level?

152
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,240
What is the military power, each one of those.

153
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,720
And you could see them back going over the 500 years.

154
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,880
And so you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs.

155
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,320
And what you see is really in most countries and most dynasties, you can see that.

156
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,960
But you also can see through those numbers, the health of those countries.

157
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,280
Today, there are, there are statistics that you could, that are in the book that show

158
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,120
what is the level of education?

159
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,240
What is the level of economic output?

160
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,120
What is the level of military strength?

161
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,520
What is the level of a number of different measures of strength so that you can then compare that?

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
And I think that because they're objective measures of strength that you could see change,

163
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,680
that shows the picture of where we are today.

164
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,080
And I think one of the most important things about the book is that it allows people to monitor

165
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,000
how those things are transpiring.

166
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,600
I think for policymakers, you know, are your policymakers doing a good job?

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,640
And there's so much subjectivity in that.

168
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
But I think it's very simple.

169
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,640
If those lines on the chart are improving, if your health index is improving,

170
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,200
then you're moving toward a better life.

171
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,280
So that's what the book works like.

172
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,520
Also, it was used to create a model for the future.

173
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,480
In other words, there are cause-effect relationships.

174
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,320
Everything that happens has reasons, causes that preceded it, that made it happen.

175
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,960
And so by having all those in numbers, one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.

176
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,720
So that's what you see in the book.

177
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,880
It's not just, you know, raise interpretation.

178
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,400
I didn't want to make it raise interpretation because I don't know if I'm right.

179
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,080
Yeah.

180
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,120
So one of the fascinating things in the book, see, I've listed these 18 measures and there's

181
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,320
like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today.

182
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,960
So let's say US, China and Europe and what it was 20 years ago and looking at the change

183
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,640
from 20 years ago, and that's another indicator to change itself to see where things are headed.

184
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,560
Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective, how is US and China doing?

185
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,400
And in the 18 measures, what are some measures that stand out to you as particularly important

186
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,320
to think about today for the United States, for China?

187
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,240
Well, there are a number.

188
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:44,760
Financially, what you see in the United States is that we're borrowing a lot more money,

189
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,520
creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,840
And our capacity to do that is very much is limited, first of all, because when you,

191
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,400
when there's a sale of a bond, when the government borrows more than it borrows money

192
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,520
because it spends more than it takes in, you have to sell a bond.

193
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,240
And the world right now has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds because as the world's reserve

194
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:24,320
currency, they sell, so on them, and they have very bad returns, negative real returns,

195
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
negative real returns significantly and so on.

196
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:36,000
So that means that more bonds has to be sold than are bought.

197
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,600
And that means that the Federal Reserve has, is faced with the choice of having to raise

198
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,920
the interest rate to curtail borrowing, which slows the economy and hurts the markets,

199
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:58,080
or by filling that difference and producing money, the debt monetization, which produces

200
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,800
an inflation in goods, services, and financial assets.

201
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,760
So in that regard, that's our, the United States' position.

202
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,840
In China's case, its balance of payments is better.

203
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,440
China has displaced the United States as the world's largest trading country,

204
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,240
in other words, more exports to other countries.

205
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:32,080
And as a result, it's economically competitive, but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.

206
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,600
It's a real blessing.

207
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,240
So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency, but it is risking it because of this

208
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,080
imbalance. So if you look at history, you see that those go slowly, but when they go

209
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,920
eventually, they go quickly. So there's a risk of that financially.

210
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,760
Then there's the issue of internal order.

211
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
So I'm just giving you the major ones, but I'll get into some of the other ones too.

212
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,920
Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict in the United States,

213
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,040
which affects how well it works.

214
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,640
In China, there's less internal conflict because it's a more autocratic state,

215
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:29,680
but also they've created this bifurcation of what is political and what is economic

216
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,400
in terms of producing that prosperity. So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,

217
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:43,040
and then you're seeing entrepreneurship, you're seeing the finances of new businesses,

218
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:51,200
and so on. And so that internal working, that's subject to different people's interpretations,

219
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,320
whether they like it or not, but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds of measures

220
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,080
is less. Sorry to pause on that for a second.

221
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:07,760
So these measures, I guess you don't want to romanticize anyone measure or something like that,

222
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:17,040
overinterpret anyone measure, but is internal conflict always a bad thing? Is it a complicated

223
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,280
calculation, or do you kind of, the way we think about these measures that you've presented,

224
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,960
we should be thinking like the higher, the better, the lower, the worse, or of course,

225
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,120
depending on the... Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces the revolution

226
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:43,200
produces revolutionary changes that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.

227
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:52,160
And so their short-term, a short-term civil war is a hellacious experience,

228
00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:01,840
and at the same time, it can be the transition to a new beginning. Also, there are different types

229
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:13,440
of conflict. Competition, which makes everything better, is a productive conflict, whereas

230
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:23,520
destructive conflicts are not good over the short time. So that's how those go.

231
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,480
So within each measure, the story is complicated?

232
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,520
Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear, meaning how much political conflict, how much

233
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,840
social conflict. In other words, you can measure conflict, you can measure fighting,

234
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:50,480
you can measure crime rates, you can measure lots of different ways of conflict. So the measures

235
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,880
are a composite of different types of internal conflict.

236
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,880
What are some other interesting measures, maybe you can also mention that for me in particular,

237
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,960
interest is education and innovation. Yes. The classic cycle, the most important

238
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:15,360
leading indicator is the quality of education. Most importantly, broad-based education,

239
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,880
drawn from the largest population, because you can never tell who the talent is going to be,

240
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,960
where they're going to come from. So for example, if you look at the great Chinese

241
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:38,400
dynasties and the Confucian approach, it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams

242
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,000
and so on, broad base of drawing in the populations. And you see that if you go across societies,

243
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:53,760
because that draws on the largest number of population to get education. And that creates

244
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:03,040
a reality and a perception that the system is fairer, equal opportunity, not just one of privilege.

245
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:13,440
And that helps to create social stability. But education is not just education in understanding

246
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,640
facts and so on. It is education in civility of how to behave together. And so if they're smart,

247
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,280
they understand how to be productive, because they work well together and they're productive.

248
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,560
And then that leads to the next stage. You could see in the lines in the charts,

249
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,920
I plotted these, so that you could see in a typical cycle, you could see that education is the long

250
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:47,600
leading indicator. And then you could see, as you mentioned, that what you see is inventiveness

251
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:55,040
and technology measures then follow. And you see then also competitiveness and world markets

252
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:02,880
follows. For example, in the early stages of a cycle, the industries that they go into tend to

253
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:10,080
be very basic industry, because they have cheap labor, something like textiles and simple manufactured

254
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:18,000
goods and so on. But as the education rises, then they move up the value chain to greater

255
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,840
technologies and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity. So yes, those, and as you say,

256
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,720
there are 18 different measures like that, but education and then civility and the inventiveness.

257
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:41,120
So you see it reflected in who's inventing what. And that corresponds then who's trading with,

258
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,680
who's a big trading country, and where's the value of economic output and what are per capita incomes.

259
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,680
They all follow those arcs. Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,

260
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,920
so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots. Yeah, you could see it.

261
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,360
So it's not just your opinion. It's kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like,

262
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,400
but you're just giving a lot of your own insights along with the numbers.

263
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,640
If you were to look at the American nation, the American empire, and the trajectories looking

264
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:25,920
into the future, given these measures, what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse of

265
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,800
the American empire based on these measures? What are the concerning indicators? And if

266
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:40,720
those break down further, what does that look like? Well, all of those indicators are concerning,

267
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:52,000
maybe except for one, which is technology, the technology niche, although even in that area

268
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,880
the United States is improving at a slower rate than is China for various advantages that they

269
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,240
have there. They put out about eight times as many computer engineers, they have free data,

270
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,920
and so on. But if you look at them, so the financial is a concern, the internal order,

271
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,720
disorder is a concern. Then if you look at education levels, the United States

272
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,800
is in many ways, is losing its educational advantage. If you were to look at, compare it with China,

273
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,840
if you take general public education in the United States, it's deteriorated tremendously,

274
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,720
even in comparison to developed countries. There are scores, pieces scores, and so on,

275
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,520
and it's something like 38th in the world or something, and that was a big plunge,

276
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,720
average public education. If you look at the best universities in the world,

277
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,680
the United States is unique in having the best universities in the world, so there are these

278
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:09,120
privileged spots that are excellent, uniquely excellent. So when you look at the comparison,

279
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:19,040
education in China is improving rapidly, and the quantity is a quantity of educated people

280
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:25,200
in the areas that they're moving in are, is greater, and the resources that they're putting

281
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:33,680
behind it is greater, and so you see the results are greater. But it's sort of a long line that

282
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm dealing with. If you were to follow through in terms of actual productions, I think you know

283
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,440
in terms of technologies, there are some areas that the United States is in a lead. At the moment,

284
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,680
there's some areas that China's in a lead, but China's gaining very quickly. When I first went

285
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:04,880
to China, 1984, I would bring $10 calculators, and I gave them away as gifts to high-ranking people,

286
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:13,200
and they thought they were miracle devices. Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing,

287
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:23,120
and AI, and you know, many areas, you have a race going on, and so if you take the trajectory

288
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,480
of the competitiveness, not just look at the current level, you have a situation where they're

289
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,720
improving at a much faster rate. This is all good for the world if the world can get along.

290
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,960
And the main thing I think is, in just how do you have a healthy world, and how do you have a

291
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,280
strong economy, and how do you have a strong situation, is be strong. The United States's

292
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,120
war is with itself. That's the main war. You know, it's very simple in history.

293
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:08,880
Be financially sound, earn more than you spend, and be strong in these ways, and pretty much

294
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,960
everything will take care of itself. But you make it sound simple, of course,

295
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,240
because there's a momentum when things degrade. When the education system degrades, when you

296
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,600
start borrowing, when, I mean, all of these indicators, once they start going down,

297
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,080
there's a momentum to it, right? So it's hard to reverse it.

298
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,840
Right, and there are circumstances that you're then in. For example, indebtedness,

299
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,520
you know, it's politically desirable for those to borrow money and spend, because their

300
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,840
constituencies only look at what they get. And when they get a lot, they don't pay attention

301
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,000
to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books. So it's always better to borrow, spend,

302
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:06,160
and then leave the cleanup to the next guy. And so you inherit a lot. You inherit it as

303
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,040
a new president enters in, or new legislators. They have a lot of debt. They have a broken down

304
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:23,440
infrastructure. They don't have enough money to fix that. And so that's the lay of the land that

305
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:32,320
the prior generations put you in, and there you are. And so that's right. It's difficult,

306
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,840
because when you start to think, okay, what's healthy? Well, spend, earn more than you spend.

307
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Well, that's not so easy, because, you know, what does that mean? Go earn more? I mean,

308
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,960
okay, that's not so easy. Spend less? That isn't going to work. So now what do you do? Okay,

309
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,800
you have this debt that you then monetize, and that's why it's classic. So yes, that's why these

310
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,360
cycles occur, because what has created before, what happened before created the lay of the land

311
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,120
that is then increasingly difficult to deal with. So what can great leaders do in this moment? I mean,

312
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,320
maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here. So for example, to do very large projects that

313
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:24,080
invest in the education system, that sort of try to fix the fundamentals, or maybe invest more and

314
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,320
more into the innovation and the development of new technologies and so on. It feels like that

315
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,840
just doesn't happen organically. So you have to have strong leaders that

316
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,480
convince the populace of the importance of these ideas.

317
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Well, I completely agree with your list. What we have is a situation where everybody

318
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,000
has their opinions, and they have to sort of get them exactly right, and they all fight with

319
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,440
each other about whether their opinions. So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan

320
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,280
so that we don't, and we get over our differences. I would have a bipartisan cabinet. I would draw upon

321
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,120
both members of both parties, the moderates, who are going to be able to work together.

322
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:29,200
So as then we have one country, and then we deal with those in a means that works for the majority

323
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,160
of the people in the middle, rather than the polarity. I think our greatest risk is in not

324
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:44,080
being able to do that. So I would say that's a paramount importance because we have the resources,

325
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,680
wealth, real wealth, and science, and everything has never been better than it is.

326
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,720
But the notion is that it has to work for the majority of people, and we have to keep it

327
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:07,440
being productive. So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably work together so that they

328
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,000
increase the size of the pie, and they create broad-based prosperity. So that is a paramount

329
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,240
importance. Whatever they do, if they do it that way, I can say I'm happy about because that other

330
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:33,920
alternative is the really scary alternative. The scary alternative, the different ways it has

331
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:41,840
evolved throughout history, some of it has led to wars. What are the future trajectories that

332
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,160
lead to a potential war with China? Cold war or hot war? Is this something you think about?

333
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,960
Is this something you're worried about? Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars. So the war

334
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:00,240
with China, as I say, there are five kinds of wars. There's a trade war technology war,

335
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:10,640
geopolitical influence war, capital war, and military war. As far as military war goes,

336
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:18,160
I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue, and we could talk about that for a minute.

337
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,720
But those others, they'll be rough competitions, and we'll have that type of evolution over a

338
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,840
period of time. That's what that war looks like. Taiwan has been, for a long time,

339
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:45,760
a sovereignty issue to China, and it has its roots in what's called 100 years of humiliation.

340
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:55,600
From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in, took advantage of China. They had the Opium

341
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:06,880
Wars in such times, and that represented the 100 years of humiliation. Taiwan represents

342
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,480
their sovereignty and their important thing. And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,

343
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:23,600
there was an agreement that there is one China, and Taiwan is part of China, and that there would be

344
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:32,160
peaceful reunification. The peaceful reunification hasn't happened, and in their view,

345
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,680
that's a very big issue. And so it's a big contentious issue, and that could produce a

346
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:46,960
military war, could produce a military accident, it's a very tense situation. And if we had a

347
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:55,680
military war, God help us because of the capacity in all different new ways to inflict harm on each

348
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:03,360
other. But anyway, that's that. If you don't have that military war, you'll have the competition

349
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:10,320
between those other kinds of wars, and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.

350
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,840
Where do you put cyber war within the five?

351
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,040
Well, cyber war is a military war. I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're

352
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,920
referring to is that which it's used to inflict pain on the other party through cyber. So cyber wars,

353
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,000
you'll see cyber war, you could see space war, you can see drone warfare,

354
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,920
you, new types of warfare, not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare,

355
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,920
but you could see any of the above.

356
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,560
What are the defining characteristics? What are the interesting things about

357
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,880
Xi Jinping, the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?

358
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,760
His father was a early leader. He was himself

359
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:15,600
in the Cultural Revolution in times, treated brutally. And during that period of time,

360
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:24,880
it was very, very difficult. And he came up through the ranks and is a very intelligent man.

361
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,760
When he first came to power, as you know, they have two five-year terms, and we're now coming to

362
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,240
the end of the second of those five-year terms. When he first came to power, he felt that there

363
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:48,560
should be a lot of reform, and reform meant moving to much more of a market and open economy.

364
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:57,520
When that happened in him coming in, I had some contact with economic policymakers, but in the

365
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:05,120
circumstances then, were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises and local governments

366
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:12,080
with implied government guarantees. And so there was not control of that and the movement to aim

367
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:19,200
more of a market economy. And the development of markets was a primary. And also the dealing

368
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,280
with the corruption issue. There was a lot of corruption prior to that, and that was viewed

369
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:33,680
as an existential threat to the system. So that became the primary objective. And then as time

370
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:42,800
progressed over those 10 years, there was a lot of changing in the world, their financial

371
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,120
circumstances, opening many, many other markets. They particularly getting money to small and

372
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,280
medium-sized enterprises and developing a lending system and then establishing controls on it.

373
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:07,760
So right now, there's a vibrant capital markets. You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,

374
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,840
you can become a billionaire in the capital markets. And they developed the markets to be

375
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:22,560
the second largest capital markets. At the same time, they had to deal with their rising debt issue,

376
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:32,640
which they began to deal with really about four years ago, when the second term began.

377
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:46,800
And then Lou Ha became the vice premier responsible for that and to deal with those issues. So

378
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,040
you see right now that what's happening is the dealing with the real estate bubble.

379
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,360
There was a development in real estate, a bubble, which produced a lot of unproductive lending.

380
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,840
And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in, not to speculate on. And so that was wasteful.

381
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,800
So they established what they call three red lines, which are financial ratios,

382
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,080
that the property developers had to live within. And that is then causing the adjustments that are

383
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:29,360
going on now, which in my view are very healthy because whenever there's bankruptcies and so on,

384
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:35,200
the most in the public think, okay, that's a problem. It's in many cases really a cleaning

385
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,560
up of bad debts and bad practices. And so that's what's going on. So that's, let's say economically.

386
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,920
At the same time, there is the changing relationships, the changing world order,

387
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,280
the changing relationships with the United States and other countries, which is becoming

388
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:04,240
much less cooperative and much more warlike, much more confrontational. Those two things,

389
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:12,000
the domestic debt problem and the domestic has led to what's called core, what they call core

390
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:22,080
leadership, which means a leadership more around him that is less challenging because they believe

391
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:29,760
in history that during very difficult times, a more centrally controlled decision making process

392
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,400
lends itself better than to a more fragmented political contentious project. And that's basically

393
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:46,480
what's going on now. You said it very eloquently, but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

394
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:55,360
and there's a lot of centralized control. That characterization is much more black and white

395
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,520
than it really is. But it leans towards that direction.

396
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,280
Like, for example, of the standing members of the Politburo, four are more alleged,

397
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,560
allowed him, three are less so. You have to understand that it's kind of a collective

398
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,120
leadership at the top. And then, of course, there's just jockeying for power in a highly

399
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:29,280
political sense at the top. But no one leader can be successful against all those powers at

400
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,800
the top. So it's very politically negotiating. It's very much more like, if you put in the

401
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,360
United States, the Democrats and the Republicans, and they had to be in the same government and

402
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:47,840
they work it out, it's kind of something like that. And so that's that struggle, but it's an

403
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:53,760
internal struggle. Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas at the founding of the

404
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,920
United States when then, now we're talking about that at the context of China, the freedom of

405
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,920
speech freedoms. What China is doing with the central management of a lot of things, it's

406
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,840
enabling a lot of growth, but it's also limiting people on the very basic level in terms of freedom,

407
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,600
the kind of freedom that I think can lead to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,

408
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,480
to having big dreams and chasing those dreams, and then creating totally new things in whatever

409
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:32,480
the space, maybe in technology, in business and whatever. How important is that as a metric for

410
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:40,320
society? Well, they have a view which is the idea of a dialectic, which means that two things are

411
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,080
that everything comes with pros and cons, and two opposites exist. And you want the benefits of

412
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:55,600
those two opposites, and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites? So let's say

413
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:02,160
you want the capital markets because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs who are

414
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,120
motivated, they build fortunes, and that drives an economy to do very well. And at the same time,

415
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:16,800
it produces the other problems, the wealth gaps, the other problems, then the debt cycle that we're

416
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:26,000
talking about and so on. And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism and the market economy

417
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,680
and the capital markets? And he famously said, and it doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a

418
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,920
black cat, just as long as it catches mice. In other words, if it works in making the country richer,

419
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,200
then that becomes the objective, and then they move that along. So there are these conflicts,

420
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,840
and one of the leaders described it to me as follows, because it's confusion and it goes back

421
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,200
over a period of time. There's a hierarchy, and it's an extension of the family he described it.

422
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,000
And he said, the United States is a country of individuals and individualism,

423
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:18,560
and that is its vibrancy that we see. The individual rights to speak up, the individual

424
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,880
protection of the individual, individual property rights, and all of those things

425
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,360
is of paramount importance. And we build our organization. That's why democracy is from the

426
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:37,680
bottom up, or even a company will get together and we'll be partners to prosper together. That

427
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:46,240
is the American approach. He was describing that in China, it's an extension of the Confucian family,

428
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:54,800
essentially. And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy. And so what they think about is

429
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:02,320
the common good, not the individualism. So for example, if they want a high-speed rail to go

430
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:08,880
from one place to another, and that's best in the common good, then the individual protections that

431
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:17,120
would stand in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern. So that notion of controlling.

432
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:28,160
So for example, what they're doing with video games, they control what type of video games

433
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:37,200
and how many hours a day kids can be on video games operating in that way, because they believe

434
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,120
that that's good for the society and that's very controlling. In the United States, I think probably

435
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,960
most parents would say, leave it to me, and it's a matter between me and my kids. The same thing

436
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:56,080
has to do with data. In other words, in the United States, who controls the data? Does the company

437
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:02,960
control the data? Do you individually control the data? And so the inclination would be to figure

438
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,080
that out, but nobody would say that the government is going to control the data because of our

439
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,320
inclination of really anti-government control. In China, it would be that the government will

440
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,240
control the data because that's going to be best for the society and it depends who you trust.

441
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:31,120
So that difference in philosophy is very much at the heart of that. As far as your question in terms

442
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:39,120
of effectiveness, it really is, in China's case, it's how you balance the things. So what they're

443
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:48,000
attempting to do is to create a lot of freedom and creativity in areas that are not political, let's

444
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:56,640
say. And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship, you see a lot of product development, you see a lot

445
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:04,880
of creativity happening in that way. So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening

446
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,880
is an old stereotype. There's a lot of creativity certainly happening and the system can work well

447
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,720
if they can achieve that kind of balance. It's proven to work well. Since I started going there

448
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:28,160
in 1984, real per capita income has increased by 26 times. The longevity rate has increased by 10

449
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:36,400
years. The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1% in terms of basics like starvation

450
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:44,480
and things. And if you read history, Plato's Republic, he talks about the cycles, democracy

451
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:53,360
and autocratic and the benevolent despot and all of that. Each has their own vulnerability. The

452
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:59,920
vulnerability of democracy, which has been a remarkable, remarkable system and I don't have

453
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:10,480
to extol the benefits of it. But the vulnerability of it has always been the internal conflict that

454
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:21,680
produces itself as anarchy. In World War II, four democracies chose to be autocracies

455
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:30,080
because there was internal disorder and there was the belief will somebody bring about order

456
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:37,120
and get control of the situation. That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.

457
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:45,360
They were parliamentary systems that turned themselves over to that. So, both systems

458
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:54,720
have vulnerabilities. I think the main thing that we need to think about is those vulnerabilities.

459
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:03,360
Democracy is an amazing system because the adherence to the rules and the system

460
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:09,440
and the checks and balances is quite amazing and it gives it a flexibility to change without

461
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,960
civil wars. But there has to be the respect of the rules. And when you see something like

462
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:27,840
they will not accept elections or they will not accept rules, history has shown when the causes

463
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,400
that people are behind are more important to them than the system. The system is in jeopardy.

464
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,760
So, we have a situation that's very much like that in terms of, let's say, the 2024 elections.

465
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:51,280
I believe that there's a very high chance that neither side will accept losing, for example.

466
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:00,240
And so, we have that kind of a situation. So, one would hope that one could rise above the

467
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:09,200
disagreements and rely on the system for resolving disagreements because if that doesn't happen,

468
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:16,160
then we have our own chaos. So, the kind of the trend that started in 2020,

469
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:24,960
or I suppose it's been growing. One representation of this internal disorder has been

470
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,880
the growing trend of being skeptical about the results of the election.

471
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,920
Well, it started before that. There was the emergence of population

472
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:43,680
before President Trump was elected. He was basically elected as a populist because there

473
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,000
was a large percentage of the population that felt that the system didn't work for them,

474
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:57,600
and he tapped into that, and he was largely elected as a populist leader, first populist leader

475
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:06,880
in a developed country. And so, populism began then, and that was a battle of one group against

476
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,280
the other group. And so, since then, it's been like that, and it continued to grow.

477
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,720
You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy, the internal disorder is the

478
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,400
vulnerability of democracy. What's the vulnerability of a system like China? Maybe one way to

479
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,880
say is put China aside and look at history, look at Soviet Union.

480
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,960
What's the vulnerability of a communist-type system?

481
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:48,960
Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic, depending on how much autocracy,

482
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:58,720
is that it lacks flexibility. It lacks the ability, but I should deal with them differently.

483
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,600
In other words, there's the economic system. The economic system threatens motivation

484
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:15,440
and productivity. So, communism or socialism has to be done in a way where you can threaten

485
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:24,000
productivity. Capitalism has, and what I mean by that, I mean free markets and capital markets.

486
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:32,480
I've been an effective way of allocating resources and also creating the incentives

487
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,400
and the resources, providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas. And so,

488
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:46,000
if I compare that, what the Chinese have done, to a large extent, is to recognize that and have made

489
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:53,920
a move, that's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict between those two things exist. But

490
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:03,360
anyway, that's it. As far as an autocratic system, rather than one man, one vote from the population

491
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:11,040
up, the risks of the autocratic system is that there's enough discontent that arises,

492
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:20,080
that the system doesn't have the flexibility, and that rather than bending, it breaks.

493
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:29,440
That's the big risk. The notion of trying to control a population, if there's that, rather

494
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:36,000
than giving it the flexibility. So, that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.

495
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,120
What's the human, because you mentioned like the top gets bigger with the empires,

496
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,600
and you start taking things for granted, is some of this just human nature. So, the concern with

497
00:53:49,600 --> 00:54:00,400
China, with autocratic nations, the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union, was that

498
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:07,600
fundamentally, at the individual level, the humans involved at the top, they start becoming,

499
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:13,920
they're starting to lose touch with the reality, in a way that no longer makes them. I guess that's

500
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,120
the representation of the flexibility that you're referring to. Well, I mean, in a democracy,

501
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:25,680
you could change. You can go as far left or as far right. You can change the leaders easily,

502
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,800
and so the people don't become, they pretty much only have themselves to blame.

503
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:41,440
One of the problems of that is they may not choose the best leaders, but they have that

504
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,960
flexibility. So, vote and you get what you wanted. In the case of the autocratic, let's say, leaders,

505
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:57,360
and then the movement from democracies to autocracies, what you see normally, that movement,

506
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,360
is that one of the systems is not working. Let's say the democracy is not effectively. Everybody's

507
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,080
arguing with each other, and nobody's getting anything done, and you know, like Mussolini,

508
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:13,840
the trains are not running on time, and that would be the example. Geez, this place has gotten

509
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:21,520
chaotic. Well, somebody gets to control, and then you get the autocratic, and then he's

510
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,680
autocratic enough to boss people around, and then you follow those kinds of orders, and it's like

511
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,920
maybe a CEO in a powerful company ordering around, and that could work well or it could work badly.

512
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:46,400
Most companies are run as like autocracies, in a sense. There's the hierarchy and the command

513
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:56,320
economy and that kind of thing, and that can work well or not, but then quite often when you get the

514
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:04,480
populist autocratic, their personality is something that they want to fight, and they become more

515
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:12,240
nationalistic, and they tend to become more militaristic, and human nature at that stage

516
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:19,680
lends itself to fighting. There's an arc here that when we think of a country,

517
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:27,840
and we say we, and we think of a country, it's not true, it's not like that. There are individuals

518
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:34,720
who change. One generation dies, and another generation comes along, and one of those arcs

519
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:44,320
is that the ones who have been through war don't want to go to war and are more happily willing to

520
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,520
abide by whatever the rules are. As you get farther along into that cycle, and you get a new

521
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:59,440
generation, and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight,

522
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:07,040
and so you're seeing right now the emerging of fight for right, and what that means is you see

523
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:15,760
it internally. Fight, where are you in fight for that thing, and they mean fight, and then

524
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,760
externally, fight, are you going to be the strong one who will fight and win,

525
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,160
and that develops on both sides, this fight and win, and they side is cheering each other on

526
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:35,680
into a war, but that comes by those who really have not experienced war because it comes

527
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,840
in their part of their lifetime. Humans are fascinating.

528
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:48,160
Humans are fascinating, and by the way, human nature has not changed over the thousands of years,

529
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,000
so it's so interesting because like in doing this study, and it comes across in the study,

530
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,040
it's like watching the same movie over and over again. You see the arc, and you see it happen

531
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,080
over and over again. The only things that seem to change are the clothes people wear and the

532
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:13,680
technologies they use. Yeah, and then somebody probably will disagree with you about the clothes,

533
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:19,280
maybe there's also cycles within fashions. Maybe we're not even creative there. What do you

534
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,320
make of Russia and Vladimir Putin? What do you think about Putin as a leader,

535
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:32,960
as a human being on this world stage, within the context of the cycles of empires that you think about?

536
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:42,560
Well, Putin came to power at the failure of Russia's last order, so there was the end of

537
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:49,920
communism, and there was the development of the market economy, the collapse of the Soviet Union,

538
00:58:51,760 --> 00:59:01,200
and at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin who was an alcoholic and had problems

539
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:09,600
managing and was put into power. The conditions in the Russian, there was anarchy,

540
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,560
there was no money. It had the classic end of cycle ingredients. It was broke,

541
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,320
it was people fighting with each other, it was the anarchy, and that's when he came to power.

542
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:31,280
And there were not institutions, the whole thing had collapsed. It was not effective ministry of

543
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:41,120
education, ministry of anything. And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability,

544
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:47,280
and they needed a democracy, and they needed the improvement of capital markets.

545
00:59:47,280 --> 01:00:00,000
So he's been in that position as a, I guess I would call him a semi-autocratic leader in that,

546
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:09,040
from all indications, he would respect the democracy, and he's very popular. He's won

547
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:16,720
democratic elections because he's been a strong leader, and he's brought peace and stability

548
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:27,280
to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. And he's a strong leader in pursuit of

549
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:39,840
the country's interests in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power,

550
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:50,400
but it is a significant military power. So the issues, and then there's a strong alliance between

551
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:59,440
Russia and China now. So that's kind of the lay of the land. And then there are sensitivities. The

552
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:08,320
Ukraine issue is a sensitivity because there are a lot of Russians who live in the Ukraine,

553
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:15,520
and there's also the issue of NATO on their border. So there are those kinds of things,

554
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:23,040
and he has military power, and he has a strong alliance with China. And I guess that's my best

555
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:35,280
summary of what his position is. Strong leader, popular. These are not subjective interpretations.

556
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,960
These are objective interpretations. Yeah, it's interesting. Just in this conversation,

557
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,840
you're not sort of doing the usual criticism of any one particular system. You're looking

558
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:53,760
at these systems from the perspective of history. You're just describing how they work. It's often

559
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,960
times when you talk about what Russia is today, or what the Soviet Union was, or what China is

560
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,240
today, is you start to criticize. Well, they do this kind of censorship, or they do this kind

561
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,000
of they limit freedoms in this kind of way. But you're just kind of describing this as a nation

562
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,760
with ideas, what they think is right. This is how they hope to get it to work. This is why

563
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,520
it's working. This is what's not working. Here's metrics that show that it's not working. I think

564
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,920
that's a refreshing way to think about it. It's easy though. I mean, you got some criticism

565
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,680
saying that I think China is a strict parent.

566
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:39,840
You know, some people criticize these countries for violating human rights. I suppose there's some

567
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,200
people that criticize the United States for violating human rights. But what are your thoughts

568
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:55,680
on the world stage today about some of the behaviors it has governed in terms of respecting

569
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:02,880
the rights, the basic rights of human beings? You described accurately how I just tried to look

570
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:13,600
at things in a non, I don't want to impute my values on anybody. I mean, there are intolerable

571
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:19,040
things, so I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things. But one of the great things of being an

572
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:25,760
American here is that I grew up with all different nationalities, having all different points of

573
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:33,040
view and all different religions and all different ways of operating. And I've come to treasure the

574
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:40,480
fact that what's their business is their business. And then the question is, where do you cross the

575
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,960
line under what circumstances that others have got to do it my way? And then when you do it

576
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:55,120
internationally, the issue of what is a sovereign state, you know, which as I say in the piece of

577
01:03:55,120 --> 01:04:02,560
Westphalia, and you have borders, and then when do you cross the line, that my way of doing things

578
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:07,360
has got to be their way of doing things or what are the various rights? And so that's a very

579
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:15,600
delicate question or a very difficult question. And we all have responsibilities to different

580
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:21,360
parties, and we all have different levels of knowledge about those particular things. So

581
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,000
for example, as an international investor, I have a responsibility to my investors.

582
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:34,960
Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs of how do they run that. So if you're

583
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:44,320
taking Nike or Sinkers and so on, and Americans can decide whether they want to buy Chinese products

584
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,560
or not buy Chinese products, we are all faced with those types of choices. So you have what do

585
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:56,240
you want to do in your constituency, and you have your choices. And then beyond that, in many cases,

586
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:02,480
the issues are quite complex, like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it. So

587
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:09,600
and then I believe that if you disconnect it, if all those

588
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:17,760
if entities like myself, the businesses doing business with China disconnected,

589
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:23,360
I think that that would be disastrous, economically disastrous. And it would also be

590
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:31,360
reduce the understanding that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.

591
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:39,520
And so these are all complicated. So what we do is and who makes it my opinion matters the most.

592
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:44,800
Why should it be my opinion that matters the most in making that decision? So I largely look at

593
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:50,720
the government guidance that I get not only from my own government, but from the other governments.

594
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:57,200
And I follow the rules. I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries. And we want to do that in the best

595
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:03,520
way to provide the diversified portfolio. And we sort of need that. Every one of those countries

596
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:10,800
has similar complexities. There are always one issue or another. And there's only so much

597
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:16,000
that we really understand about all of those issues. So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.

598
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,080
Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect to the culture, the place, the way things are done.

599
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:31,440
You don't necessarily, the way you heal relationships between nations is like you said,

600
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:41,040
you work together. And that requires kind of to listen maybe more than you talk. And I think people

601
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:47,520
in the public sphere talk a lot about China without really listening, without understanding much

602
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:52,080
about China, without one of the things that makes me really sad because I know how to speak Russian

603
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:59,920
and I can, I know how much is lost in translation. It makes me sad that I'll never really get to

604
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:05,520
know the Chinese culture because like I'll never really get to know the language, the literature,

605
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,560
the just talk to regular people. It's not just the government or officials or scientists,

606
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,480
just regular folks get the culture. I think if you don't understand the culture,

607
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:22,240
just the basics of the human nature of what people love about their country, about their

608
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,040
family, what the kind of hopes they have, what kind of values they have without that,

609
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:35,760
you're not going to be able to fully connect with them. And you have to do that first,

610
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,160
to have a chance of building a good world. I couldn't agree with you more. I was very lucky

611
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:49,440
because as I say, since 1984, so for more than half of my life, I've been going there and the

612
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:55,200
common people and all sorts of people and I've got to meet them. I don't speak the language,

613
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:02,880
but a combination of through translators or them speaking English and being in situations,

614
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:10,720
I had my son go to school, a local school and we developed those kinds of understandings.

615
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:21,040
I think that but the not wanting to know the other perspective is the thing that's most

616
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:31,120
scary. Like I'm right now in the middle and all I want to try to do is to help a mutual understanding.

617
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:38,000
You're right. If there were questions probing me, asking me, what is it? I'm not on one side

618
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,920
or another. I don't want to be on one side or another. I believe that each has their right

619
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,560
within there to approach their different culture in their own way. So many ways you gave an example.

620
01:08:49,040 --> 01:09:03,200
If they're not doing harm to others, but that issue of trying to understand is so much better.

621
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:13,520
That doesn't mean agree with. If you are wanting to out-clever and out-compete somebody, it still

622
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:20,400
pays to understand what they're thinking. So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,

623
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,560
even if you want to go to war with them, that understanding is the best thing to have.

624
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:33,360
What we have now is a situation in which there's an enemy mentality. That means that anything

625
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:41,760
that seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding seems to mistakenly create the

626
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:50,080
notion of I'm on their side in a war. That's a dangerous thing because there's a momentum here

627
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:56,880
to fight. Henry Kissinger praises your new book and you thank him in it in the dedication.

628
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,320
What's your relationship like with him? What makes him interesting? Maybe what makes him

629
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,440
controversial? What makes him such a central figure in history? First, most importantly,

630
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,200
he's unique about seeing things through all the other's eyes.

631
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:23,360
It's like there's a chess game. I think geopolitics is like a chess game, but with

632
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:30,320
multiple chess players playing the same game. So imagine there are six people around playing

633
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:37,120
the chess game and he could sit in each seat and he could know how they see it

634
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:45,520
and see it in a calm way of how they see it. He's unique in that way. He's 98 years old

635
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:53,120
and he's equally able to do that. He has a background in which he's a historian, so he

636
01:10:53,120 --> 01:11:01,920
really understands history super terrifically. He doesn't understand economic history as much,

637
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,440
so that's why, to some extent, we enjoy having a conversation because he's interested in the

638
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,680
economic piece he doesn't know and I'm so interested in the geopolitical piece that I

639
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:20,400
don't know as well. But anyway, he's able to do that, but not only a historian, but a practitioner.

640
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:31,200
So when you go from an academic to a practitioner who has that talent to see things through other's

641
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:38,400
eyes in an objective way and to be strategic rather than just tactical, that's a very special

642
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,320
person and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person. Yeah, he's lived a fascinating

643
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:51,600
life. Just all of the world events he's been involved in is fascinating and, like you said,

644
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:57,120
that's such an interesting skill to have to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,

645
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,560
the fears of all the people at the table. What are they thinking? I find that people don't,

646
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,920
once again, don't do that enough when it's the obvious thing you should be doing, whether it's

647
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,320
business deals or political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation. I'm often surprised

648
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:24,560
again, sorry, to go to the Russian thing because I hear Putin talk in Russian and you start to

649
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:31,520
infer certain intentions, not the trivial stuff, like the human being. What is that human being

650
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,640
hoping for himself, for his country, for his close in a circle, for the bigger,

651
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,840
and I just see that that's often just lost in translation. I just see American leaders

652
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:51,360
talking to Putin and there's not a connection. Absolutely. I know exactly what you're talking

653
01:12:51,360 --> 01:13:00,400
about. It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation or even reading a speech

654
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:08,960
or, and you see then it reported. Inevitably, the reporter picks some

655
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,240
headline characterization that has very little to do with what was really happening,

656
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:22,800
but might be a headline grabber that's at some kind of distortion and there's a lack of understanding

657
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:28,560
of really what's going on. If it's okay, let me ask you a couple of questions about cryptocurrency.

658
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,800
You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years. What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today?

659
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:40,560
Its role in the global financial system and just in human society in general?

660
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:47,040
Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years is one of the things that has

661
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:58,320
influenced changes in my view. It has proven itself. Something like 10, 11 years ago, imagine

662
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,160
the programming of this and here's the, you throw it out and that's the idea. It has not been hacked.

663
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:14,720
It has operated, it has built, it has come an amazing way over that 11 years to be

664
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:24,800
maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people and has been used and is now

665
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:34,560
has obtained the status of having imputed value. At the same time, it is one of those assets

666
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:42,400
that is an alternative money. I think we're entering an era where there's going to be a

667
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:53,280
competition of monies because of the printing of fiat money and the depreciated value. There will

668
01:14:53,280 --> 01:15:01,120
be a competition of monies and Bitcoin is part of that competition, but there'll be many monies,

669
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:08,000
not just crypto monies, but there'll be central bank crypto monies, but there'll be different

670
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:16,960
kinds of monies. Even monies are things that you buy and sell. NFTs can become a money,

671
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,880
a type of money. You own it and it's an investment and you could say, I'd rather own it than own

672
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,520
Bitcoin. Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs? Not yet.

673
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:38,160
But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs to just experience them. I think I should

674
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:45,040
produce one. I should have asked that. Have you minted an NFT? You probably should just to know

675
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:51,280
what it's like. Yeah, that's right. This stuff is happening. This stuff is real and how it operates,

676
01:15:51,840 --> 01:16:01,360
but like all new real things, some are going to go and it's like in the internet in the year 2000,

677
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,560
pets.com could have been a great, but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows. That's

678
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,520
the beauty of the competitive system that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured and some

679
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:22,880
things will be trashed. But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment of what is an

680
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,400
alternative money. Money has two purposes, a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth.

681
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:37,760
We are looking for and it's portable and it's best if it's recognized in other countries.

682
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:48,400
Gold is one of those. I look at it as an alternative gold, but I look at a number of things as an

683
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:57,440
alternative gold. Gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities. For example,

684
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,640
you can't trace it. In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it, where it's going and so on. Governments

685
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,720
can have that ability to trace it and so on. A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.

686
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:16,960
I think not connected has benefits, particularly in a world where maybe connections can be more

687
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:28,320
risky. Gold has been, for many thousands of years, universally recognized as a source of money

688
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,800
and central banks. It's the third largest source of money in central bank reserves.

689
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,240
I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve those types of purposes and so on. For various reasons,

690
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,240
I prefer gold to the other, but it's a little bit part of my mix.

691
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:53,120
But then you look at it, it hit I think 69,000 this year is the high Bitcoin hit. Do you think

692
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:59,760
it's possible? You mentioned gold. Do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers like

693
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:06,000
one million that some people talk about? I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it

694
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:19,520
is there's a certain amount of it and there's a certain amount of gold. I'll use gold as a benchmark.

695
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:29,520
The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion. Total crypto is about $2.2 trillion,

696
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:36,960
but let's say Bitcoin. It's $1 trillion. If you take the amount of money that is in

697
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:45,840
gold that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks, and I assume

698
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:52,880
Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes, that amount in gold is

699
01:18:52,880 --> 01:19:01,280
about $5 trillion. Right now, if you were to have a portfolio that has gold and crypto,

700
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:09,120
gold and Bitcoin, it's worth about 20% of the value of gold. Do I think it's going to be

701
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,800
worth more than gold in terms of that mix? I don't think it'll be worth more than gold,

702
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:24,160
but let's say it became worth as much as gold. I don't believe it will be. I think the 20%

703
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:30,320
sounds kind of about right. I really don't know what the right answer is. Then there's the question

704
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:37,280
of what is all of that pool of money that let's say gold and gold equivalents relative to everything

705
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:46,000
else. Does it go from let's call it $6, $7, $8 trillion to $16 trillion? Maybe it could double.

706
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,360
It depends what it is in the world environment, but basically, if you use gold as a measure,

707
01:19:54,160 --> 01:20:01,600
it just makes no sense that it's going to be used that much more. Am I sure about that?

708
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:09,280
I'm not sure about anything, but logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation on its price

709
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,000
in relationship to other things that are like it.

710
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,960
Let me ask for your deep financial analysis on a very important issue. I just talked a couple

711
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,160
days ago with Elon Musk. He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon. What are your

712
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:33,040
thoughts about Dogecoin? Do you think it'll be the official currency? Maybe reserve currency on

713
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:41,520
the moon and on Mars? My reaction is, that's cute. I remember Elon when he first got his money from

714
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:49,200
PayPal. I think he said to me, he got $180 million, $90 million. He decided to say,

715
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:57,680
why aren't we going to outer space? He wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified

716
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:12,720
using Russian technology to put a plant and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it

717
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:25,200
was. He said, first life on Mars or first life on that as an inspiring notion. Then,

718
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:32,560
there's always what's behind it. I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability to do other things

719
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:41,040
behind it. I would take that as symbolic and I'd be asking him, what's behind it? What's next?

720
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,720
I'm also just on the topic of Dogecoin and Memecoin. There's some aspect of humor and

721
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:53,520
lightheartedness that's really interesting about the way we communicate, what ideas become viral,

722
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:59,920
how to captivate people with ideas. There's something about taking things too seriously

723
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,640
that somehow slows it all down. It's interesting. You're right. That's part of human nature

724
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:13,200
somehow. Humor is part of this whole thing. You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down

725
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:20,960
and you have- Principles in particular. Principles. You have this really nice thing in your book where

726
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:31,920
you actually, I think there's such a brilliant way of highlighting which parts are extra important

727
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,880
and you make them bold. That's a brilliant idea. Let me just ask the high level question of what's

728
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:46,480
a good system for taking notes? Well, I find that almost everything happens over and over again.

729
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:56,480
We're in the blizzard of these things happening. What I found is that if I'm making a decision

730
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:07,680
that after I make the decision usually or right at the time, if I pause and reflect and I write my

731
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:16,480
principle down, in other words, principle is sort of a recipe, how would I make that decision

732
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:22,560
and what are the criteria around it? I find that I make it much more clear. It becomes clear

733
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:28,880
and it applies to the next thing that comes along. It'll be that way because everything

734
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:35,120
happens over and over and over again. I think people make the mistake of looking at just the

735
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:40,880
one like it's the first one. I don't know. They have the first problem of this sort of the first

736
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:46,560
child or whatever it is. This has been happening plenty of times. If you have the principles,

737
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:53,040
I found that that helped me think more clearly about it and it helped me communicate better

738
01:23:53,040 --> 01:24:01,280
like why. Over the years, over the last 30 years or so, that's what I've done. I did it originally

739
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:07,760
to communicate very well with the people I work with. I set up my company and it was very important

740
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:13,360
to have good communication. Then we could debate the principles. That's the process.

741
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:21,520
I urge people to do that. There are many excellent decision makers and I just wish that

742
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:29,600
they wrote down their principles when this set. For example, we're talking about Henry Kissinger

743
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:36,240
and his new book is going to come out with a book on leadership. Don't just describe the leaders.

744
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:43,040
Describe then what about them were the essential elements to make a good leader under what

745
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:52,480
circumstances. If we think about that, then you begin to think in a principled way. Then

746
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:58,960
when you start to think in a principled way, life becomes so much easier to make decisions and it's

747
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:06,400
so much less confusing because it's like coming up on a species and you say, okay, well, what

748
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:13,680
species is it? Not just another, it's a thing. What species is it and how do I deal with that

749
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:20,720
species effectively? That's what that is. I encourage people to write it down. I wish

750
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,840
anybody who's successful wrote down their principles or their recipes for making those

751
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:33,360
types of decisions. The events of interest here happens over and over and over in similar ways.

752
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:38,720
As you're looking for the patterns and you're defining the process, that's right to respond

753
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:45,520
to those patterns and you call that the principles. That allows you to deal with the

754
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:51,440
future effectively. That codifies the lessons from the past to be able to deal with the future.

755
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:58,800
What advice do you have for young folks today in high school, in college, thinking about how to live,

756
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,720
have a career they can be proud of or maybe have a life they can be proud of?

757
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:11,680
Know yourself, follow your passion. Make your work and passion the same thing

758
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:18,880
while considering the money part because money will get you freedom and choice and be able to

759
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:31,360
beg that. If you know yourself, feel the pull and pursue that passion. Along those lines,

760
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:38,640
by the way, I found that using personality profile tests has been very helpful. I've used

761
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:44,000
those for about 25 years for people to help to understand themselves and understand each other.

762
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I created a free one that is called Principles You. It's online. It's had remarkable,

763
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:01,120
loving people who've taken it learn about themselves, but also you can put in somebody else

764
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:06,720
and it'll tell you about your relationship with them. That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,

765
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:11,920
but the main thing is to understand on your journey, your hero's journey,

766
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:23,440
that you will have mistakes and you will have weaknesses and to understand those,

767
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:30,960
not fight those because by understanding mistakes, you will learn not to make mistakes again.

768
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:40,400
I have a principle which is pain plus reflection equals progress. That reflection is important to

769
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:47,120
know yourself, know your pulls, know your weaknesses. When you also know your weaknesses and the

770
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:52,960
strengths of other people, there are people who have strengths where you're weak and you have

771
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:58,800
strengths where they're weak. To be able to work well together is the most effective way of

772
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:08,800
achieving success. It's that journey and there's a life arc and there's a journey and you want to

773
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:17,600
make it the best that you can make it. It's like a video game. It has the challenges and the

774
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:25,600
obstacles and the learning experiences and the temptations and all of that. The maximizing

775
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,680
learning to go where you want to go to achieve the life you want is the most important. That's

776
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:40,320
kind of maybe a long-winded way of seeing it. I'll try to say it simply. There's a five-step

777
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:49,840
process. Step one is know your goals. Know what you're going after. You could have almost anything

778
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,400
you want, but you can't have everything you want. You have to prioritize and you move in

779
01:28:54,400 --> 01:29:00,080
that direction. On the way to your goals, you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.

780
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:08,480
Step two is understanding your problems and your obstacles. Identify them. Step three

781
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:16,400
is to diagnose them to get at the root cause of the problem. That could be many root causes,

782
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,520
but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others, but you have to be objective about them.

783
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:28,960
Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four, which is to design a way to get around them.

784
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:37,440
Then, after you have that design, you implement that design. You have to follow through and do it.

785
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:46,720
That will then produce its new results, which should be better results. I call this the looping

786
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:54,320
process. It's the evolutionary looping process. You just keep doing that and you learn over a

787
01:29:54,320 --> 01:30:00,080
period of time and you move in the direction that you want. Last question, and you only have one

788
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:08,080
minute to answer it. You dedicate the book, quote, to my grandchildren and those of their generation,

789
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:15,040
who will be participants in the continuation of the story. May the force of evolution be with you.

790
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:22,400
Let me ask, where is this force of evolution taking human civilization and what in this story

791
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:30,320
that evolution is writing gives you hope? Evolution is a direction toward improvement.

792
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:42,160
The greatest force is man's capacity to adapt and invent. You see in the charts in the book,

793
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:54,000
you see that this upward movement, life expectancy, health, all the things that we

794
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,400
think are better, there's a chart and it shows that over a period of time. You barely see

795
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:09,600
the downturns from depressions and wars in that. That is the greatest power. Man's ability to

796
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:16,400
invent and adapt is evolution and that's the greatest power and that is what

797
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:23,120
gives me justifiable hope. A continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,

798
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,640
maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species. Not only will we keep creating amazing things here

799
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:35,120
on earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos. My time horizon isn't going to have me

800
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:42,080
analyzing that yet, but I hope so and I agree that that would be in the natural.

801
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:46,480
So I'm not going to ask you for the best financial system on Mars. I think we'll

802
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:51,120
focus on earth for now. Thank you so much for your brilliance, for the books you've written,

803
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:57,040
for the works you've done, for the inspiration of millions. And thank you for spending your valuable

804
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:02,560
time here with me today. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.

805
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,160
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

806
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:12,960
And now, let me leave you with some words from Ray Dalio himself. Every time you confront something

807
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:18,240
painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life. You have the opportunity

808
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:24,320
to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.

809
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:29,280
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
