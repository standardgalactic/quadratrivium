0	2800	I don't know what it's like to be an alien, I would like to know.
3040	7040	Two alien civilizations co-existent on a planet, what's that look like exactly?
7040	11360	When you see them and they see you, you're assuming they have vision,
11360	14400	they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time.
14400	16400	There's a lot of assumptions they're making.
16400	19600	What human level intelligence has done is quite different.
19600	23840	It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before,
23840	26560	it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed
26560	29120	and we can actually make them come into existence.
29120	32480	So you can travel back in time sometimes?
32480	32960	Yes.
32960	34960	You travel forward in time to travel back?
34960	35280	Yes.
38800	42560	The following is a conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.
42560	46160	They have each been on this podcast once before individually
46160	49280	and now for their second time they're here together.
49840	55360	Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, Lee is a chemist,
55360	60720	and if I may say so, the real life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.
61440	65280	They both are interested in how life originates and develops
65280	68480	both life here on earth and alien life,
68480	72400	including intelligent alien civilizations out there in the cosmos.
73120	76640	They are colleagues and friends who love to explore,
76640	80080	disagree and debate nuanced points about alien life.
80080	83680	And so we're calling this an alien debate.
84480	88880	Very few questions to me are as fascinating as what do aliens look like?
88880	90480	How do we recognize them?
90480	92080	How do we talk to them?
92080	94800	And how do we make sense of life here on earth
94800	97760	in the context of all possible life forms that are out there?
98560	102720	Treating these questions with the seriousness and rigor they deserve
102720	107120	so that I hope to do with this conversation and future ones like it.
108080	110240	Our world is shrouded in mystery.
110240	112560	We must first be humbled to acknowledge this
112640	116400	and then be bold in diving in and trying to figure things out anyway.
117280	119280	This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
119280	122160	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
122800	127440	And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.
128480	130080	First of all, welcome back, Sarah.
130080	130960	Welcome back, Lee.
130960	132480	You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.
132480	133520	You're incredible people.
133520	137120	I should say thank you to Sarah for wearing really awesome boots.
137120	139520	We'll probably overlay a picture later on,
139520	141600	but why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?
141840	143120	This is me dressed up.
143120	145200	You were saying that you're pink.
145200	146800	That your thing is pink.
146800	149360	My thing is black and white, the simplicity of it.
150080	151040	Where's the pink?
151040	154080	When did it hit you that pink is your color?
154080	160480	I became pink about, I don't know, actually, maybe 2017?
161360	162720	Did you know me when you first-
162720	163920	I think I met you pre-pink.
163920	164400	Yeah, yeah.
164400	167920	So about 2017, I think, I just decided I was boring
168800	170240	and I needed to make a statement.
170240	172960	And red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.
173680	175200	Well, I think you were always pink.
175200	177280	You just found yourself in 2017.
178880	180400	There's an amazing photo of him
180400	182160	where there's like everybody in their black gown
182160	183440	and he's just wearing the pink pants.
183440	185120	Well, that wasn't a wagon in university.
185120	186160	It's totally nuts.
186160	188640	100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary
188640	190640	and they didn't find the outfit for me.
190640	192960	So they were all wearing these silly hats and these gowns
192960	194240	and there was me dressed up in pink,
194240	195840	looking like a complete idiot.
195840	197920	We're definitely going to have to find that picture
198000	201520	and overlay a big full-screen slow motion.
202080	203600	All right, let's talk about aliens.
203600	205760	We'll find places we disagree
205760	206720	and places we agree.
208160	210720	Life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.
211360	214880	Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson
215440	218720	stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.
219600	219920	Quote,
220480	223920	How egocentric of us to think that space aliens
223920	227520	who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy
227520	230560	would give, pardon the French,
231600	234000	would give a shit about humans on Earth.
234720	237920	So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,
237920	239600	observing, communicating with humans?
240320	242160	Let's take a perspective of aliens.
242160	246240	Maybe Sarah, first, are we interesting
246240	249760	in the whole spectrum of life in the universe?
250960	253680	I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now
253680	255360	we're the most interesting thing in the universe.
256320	262240	So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity that we have
262880	266640	and how much I think that's deeply related to the physics of what we are
266640	269920	that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out
269920	274320	examples of the phenomena they are to understand themselves better.
274320	277120	And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.
277120	279600	And I don't think there's any kind of judgment on
280240	281920	it being a lesser being or not.
281920	284320	It's like saying you have nothing to learn by talking to a baby.
285040	288320	You have lots to learn, probably more than you do talking to somebody that's 90.
288320	291280	So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.
291280	294400	So whatever the phenomena is that is human,
295280	297600	there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomenon
297600	300000	within alien species and they will be seeking that same.
300720	303520	I think there's got to be some features of us that are universal.
303520	306400	And I think the ones that are most interesting,
306400	308560	and I hope I live in an interesting universe,
308560	313920	are the ones that are driven by our curiosity
313920	318480	and the fact that our intelligence allows us to do things
318480	321280	that the universe wouldn't be able to do without things like us existing.
322640	324160	We're going to define a lot of terms.
324160	325440	One of them is interesting.
326000	326800	Yes.
326800	328880	That's a very interesting term to try to define.
329920	332560	What do you think are humans interesting for aliens?
333360	334720	Well, let's take it from our perspective.
334720	336960	We want to go find aliens as a species quite desperately.
337680	340720	So if we put the shoe on the other foot, of course we're interesting.
341280	346000	But I'm wondering, and assuming that we're at the right technological capability
346000	349040	to go searching for aliens, then that's interesting.
349040	353040	So what I mean is, if there needs to be a massive leap in technology
353040	358720	that we don't have, how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?
358720	362400	But I do think that they would come and find us,
362400	364160	because they'd want to find out about our culture,
364800	367600	what things are universal, what about, I mean, I'm a chemist,
367600	369440	so I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?
370080	373680	Are the creatures that we're going to find making all this commotion,
373680	375120	are they made of the same stuff?
377440	378960	What does their science look like?
380320	382000	Are they off-planet yet?
383920	387520	I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson is being slightly pessimistic
387520	393280	and maybe trying to play the tune that the universe is vast
393280	395280	and it's not worth them coming here.
395280	400320	I don't think that, but I just worry that maybe we don't have the ability
400320	402400	to talk to them, we don't have the universal translator,
402400	403600	we don't have the right physics.
403600	405280	But sure, they should come.
405280	406160	We are interesting.
406160	407520	I want to know if they exist.
407520	409040	It would make it easy if they just came.
410720	416240	So again, I'm going to use your tweets like it's Shakespeare and analyze it.
416240	420960	So Sarah tweeted, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.
421760	426320	So how much do you think aliens are thinking about other aliens,
426320	427680	including humans?
427680	435280	So you said we humans want to visit, we're longing to connect with aliens.
435280	435920	Why is that?
435920	436800	Can you introspect that?
436800	438480	Is that an obvious thing that we should be?
438480	441760	Like, what are we hoping to understand by meeting aliens?
442400	442960	Exactly.
443600	446720	Asking as an introvert is like, I ask myself this all the time,
446720	449600	why go out on a Friday night to meet people?
450240	451120	What are you hoping to find?
451120	453680	I think the curiosity, so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,
453680	455680	I think I answered it actually as well, which was,
456640	458880	we are thinking about trying to make contact.
458880	463440	So they almost certainly are, but maybe there's a number of classes.
463440	468240	There are those aliens that have not yet made contact with other aliens, like us.
468960	471680	Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien,
471680	473440	and maybe it's an anti-climax and slime.
474960	478720	And aliens that have made contact with not just one set of intelligent species,
478720	481120	but several, that must be amazing actually.
481120	483280	Literally, there is some place in the universe,
483280	486400	there must be one alien civilization to not make contact with, not one,
487120	489440	but two other intelligent civilizations.
490560	492080	So they must be thinking about it.
492080	496480	There must be entire degree courses on aliens,
496480	500560	thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.
501440	503120	Do you think they will survive the meeting?
504400	508480	And by the way, Lee did respond saying that's all the universe wants.
508480	511280	So Sarah said, thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.
511840	514400	Lee said, that's all the universe wants.
514400	517760	And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.
518640	522160	So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,
522160	524880	all of which we'll try to define mathematically.
524880	527040	Cheeky might be harder than interesting.
527040	528560	Because there's humor in that too.
528560	529360	Yes.
529360	531360	I think there's a mathematical definition of humor,
531360	532480	but we'll talk about that in a bit.
532480	533360	Oh, interesting.
533360	534560	Yeah, it surely is, yeah.
534560	539840	So if you're a graduate student alien looking at multiple alien civilizations,
540640	542240	do you think they survive the encounters?
543440	545680	I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize.
546480	550080	A lot of the discussions about alien life, which is a really big challenge.
550080	553040	So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems,
553040	556400	I don't try to think about us as humans,
556400	560080	but us as an example of phenomena that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.
560800	567520	And it doesn't seem to be the case that if I think about the features,
567520	570400	I would argue are most universal about that phenomena,
570400	574960	that there's any reason to think that a first encounter with another lineage
574960	578560	or example of life would be antagonistic.
580400	582000	I think, yeah.
582560	585040	And I think there's this kind of assumption.
585840	589200	I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote,
589200	592000	I mean, it kind of bothers me because I'm a physicist,
592000	596160	so I know we have a lot of egos about how much we can describe the world,
596160	599600	but that there's this like, because we understand fundamental physics so well,
599600	602640	we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate,
602640	603760	and I just think that we don't.
604480	609840	And the quest there is really to understand something totally new about the universe,
609840	611600	and that thing just happens to be us.
611600	612160	I agree.
612160	612560	I agree.
612560	613840	There's something else more profound.
613840	617120	I think Neil was just being, again, he's just trying to stir the pot.
617760	621280	I would say from a contingency point of view,
621280	625360	I want to know how many ways does the universe build structures, build memories, right?
626320	630000	And then I want to know if those memories can interact with each other.
630000	634640	And if you have two different origins of life and then origins of intelligence,
634640	636000	and then these things become conscious,
636720	641760	surely you want to go and talk to them and figure out what commonalities you share.
641760	644800	And it might be that we're just unable to conceive of what they're going to look like.
644800	647760	They're just going to be completely different, you know, infrastructure.
648400	650320	But surely we'll want to go and find out a map.
650320	654960	And surely curiosity is a property that evolution has made on Earth,
654960	659520	and I can't see any reason that won't happen elsewhere because curiosity
659520	663600	probably exists because we want to find innovations in the environment.
663600	667840	We want to use that information to help our technology.
668560	670720	And also curiosity is like planning for the future.
670720	672000	Are they going to fight us?
672000	674560	Are they, are we going to be able to trade with them?
675120	679280	So I think that Neil's just, I don't know, maybe, you know, I mean, give a shit.
679280	681840	That's really, I think that's really down on Earth, right?
682560	684560	How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?
686080	688080	How would we, so let's put it the other way around.
688080	689120	Slime category.
689120	693200	Maybe, no, no, no, we, maybe we could, they think it's a bit odd, right?
693200	696800	Look at Instagram, Twitter, all these people taking selfies.
696800	700000	I mean, does the universe is the ultimate state of consciousness,
700800	703760	thinking beings that take photographs themselves and upload them to an
703760	706960	internet with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos?
706960	709440	So I think that they will be.
709440	710240	What's wrong with that?
711040	713520	Yeah, I did not say there was anything wrong with it.
713520	716400	It's consciousness manifested at scale.
716400	716800	Yeah.
716800	717600	Selfies.
717600	720000	Yeah, it's like the mirror test at scale.
720000	725360	Yeah, I do think that curiosity is really the driving force of why we have our technology,
725360	725920	right?
725920	727920	If we weren't curious, we wouldn't go out left the cave.
728480	734320	So I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact.
734320	736400	Actually, of course, they'd want to come here.
736400	737840	It doesn't mean they are coming here.
737840	739360	We've seen evidence for that.
739360	741360	I guess we can argue about that, right?
741920	746160	But I think that we want, I desperately, and I know that Sarah does too,
746160	747520	but I won't speak for you when you're here.
747520	752480	You can, I desperately want to have missions to look for life in the solar system right now.
752480	754720	I want to map life over the solar system.
754720	758240	And then I want to understand how we can go and find life as quickly as possible
758240	762480	at the nearest stars and also at the same time do it in the lab just to compensate,
763200	763520	you know?
764320	764960	So, sure.
765600	767360	Yeah, I just want to point on this.
767360	772240	If you think about sort of what's driven the most like features of our own evolution
772240	774960	as a species and try to map that to alien species,
774960	777920	I always think like optimism is what's going to get us furthest.
777920	781760	And so I think a lot of people always think that it's like war and conflict
781760	786000	is going to be the way that alien species will expand out into the cosmos.
786000	789360	But if you just look at how we're doing it and how we talk about it,
789360	794240	it's always our future in space is always built from narratives of optimism.
794240	798560	And so it seems to me that if intelligence does get out in the universe,
798560	802160	that it's going to be more optimism and curiosity driving it than war and conflict
802160	804080	because those things end up crushing you.
805360	806960	So there might be some selective filter.
807920	809360	Of course, this is me being an optimist.
809360	811840	I'm a half full kind of person, but...
811840	815360	Is it obvious that curiosity, not obvious,
815360	818960	but what do you think is curiosity a more powerful force in the universe than
819680	822400	violence and the will to power?
823200	829920	So, because you said you frame curiosity as a way to also plan on how to avoid violence,
829920	832320	which is an interesting frame of curiosity.
832320	837120	But I could also argue that violence is a pretty productive way
838080	841040	to operate in the world, which is like...
841040	842480	That's one way to protect yourself.
842480	843840	The best defense is offense.
845680	847840	I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.
847840	849040	I think violence...
849040	850480	That's not what violence...
850480	852000	That's the summary of this podcast.
853920	855600	Yeah, but maybe I would...
855600	857680	Let's not call it violence, but I call it erasure.
857680	860400	So if you think about the way evolution works all the way...
862080	864240	Obviously call it assembly theory, but I won't...
864240	869120	So if you say curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?
869120	876080	So new features you can play, what the ability to erase those things allows you to start again,
876080	877360	and do some pruning.
877360	879760	So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.
879760	881680	Curiosity gets you rockets at land.
881680	883760	It gets you robots that can make drugs.
883760	888480	It gets you poetry and art and communication.
888480	893280	And then I often think, wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy to have another world war,
893280	894720	not literally a world war now.
894720	897120	Please, no world war, but the equivalent.
897120	900640	So we get remove all the admin bureaucracy, all the admin violence,
900640	901920	get rid of it and start again.
901920	902640	Do you know what I mean?
903120	906160	Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.
906160	909200	So actually a reset, let's not call it violence,
909200	916400	a reset in some aspects of our culture and our technology allows us to then
917840	919680	build more important things without the...
919680	922160	Because how many cookies do I have to click on?
922160	927520	How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life that I could remove
927520	933040	and that a bit of a reset would allow us to start again?
933040	937040	And maybe that's how I suppose our encounter with aliens will be.
937040	938240	Maybe they will fight with us and say,
939200	941040	we're not as excited by you as we thought.
941040	941840	We'll just get rid of you.
942400	944000	Or they might want to reset Earth.
944000	944880	Yeah, why not?
944880	947280	To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.
947280	951600	This seems like there's nothing new happening here.
951600	952880	They're observing for a while.
952880	953920	This is just not...
953920	955760	Let's keep it more fun.
955760	956960	Let's start with a fish again.
959040	963520	I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.
964080	965680	I suppose that's the kind of violence.
966240	970000	And this is this modern world where words are violence, resetting cookies.
970000	971040	I don't know where that came from.
971040	971760	I'm completely...
971760	972080	Yeah.
972080	973680	That's poetic, really.
974240	976240	Okay, so let's talk about life.
977520	978640	What is life?
979200	980880	What is non-life?
980880	983440	What is the line between life and non-life?
983440	986960	And maybe at any point we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.
987760	989920	Like how do we start to try to define life?
989920	992000	And for people listening,
992000	995280	so Sarah identifies as a physicist
995280	997760	and Lee identifies as a chemist.
997760	1002160	Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature in general.
1002160	1005520	But, so what is life?
1006480	1007040	Yeah.
1009040	1011920	I love asking that question because it's so absurdly big.
1011920	1012800	I know, I love it.
1013840	1015840	It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.
1016800	1019200	So I think I have three ways of describing it right now.
1020400	1021600	And I like to say all three of them
1021600	1023840	because people latch on to different facets of them.
1023840	1026960	And so the whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on
1026960	1028240	is not to try to define life,
1028240	1030000	but to try to find a more fundamental theory
1030000	1032320	that explains what the phenomena we call life.
1032320	1034000	And then it should explain certain attributes.
1034080	1035840	And you end up having a really different framing
1035840	1037200	than the way people usually talk.
1037200	1039360	So the way I talk about it, three different ways.
1040640	1043840	Life is how information structures matter across space and time.
1045200	1049360	Life is, I don't know, this one's from you.
1049360	1052000	Actually, simple machines constructing more complex machines.
1052880	1056480	And the other one is the physics of existence, so to speak,
1056480	1059600	which is life is the mechanism the universe has
1059600	1061280	to explore the space of what's possible.
1062480	1063200	That's my favorite.
1063760	1066640	So can I add on to that?
1066640	1068160	Okay, can you say the physics one again?
1069360	1070960	Physics of existence.
1070960	1072160	Yeah, the physics of existence.
1072160	1073280	I don't know what to call it.
1073280	1075600	You know, if you think of all the things that could exist,
1075600	1077120	only certain things do exist.
1077120	1081200	And I think life is basically the universe's mechanism
1081200	1084160	of bringing things into physically existing in the moment now.
1086720	1088400	And what's another one?
1088400	1089680	We were debating this the other day.
1089680	1093360	So if you think about a universe that has nothing in it,
1094240	1096000	that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?
1096000	1098240	Because this is where physicists really go wrong.
1098240	1099920	They think of a universe with nothing in it.
1099920	1100400	They can't.
1100400	1102800	The non-existence is really hard to think of.
1102800	1103520	Non-existent, yeah.
1103520	1105520	And then you think of a universe with everything in it.
1106800	1107920	That's really hard.
1107920	1110160	And you just have this white blob, right?
1110160	1111440	This is everything.
1111440	1114560	But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe beyond,
1114560	1115200	say, planets.
1115200	1118480	So you've got star, space, planet stuff, right?
1118480	1119280	The boring stuff.
1120400	1123040	Well, I would define life or say that life is where
1124480	1127120	there are architectures, any architectures,
1127120	1130960	and we should stop fixating on what is building
1130960	1132160	the architectures to start with.
1132160	1135200	And the fact that the universe has discrete things
1135200	1137200	and it is completely mind-blowing.
1137760	1140240	If you think about it for one second,
1140880	1142880	the fact there's any objects at all,
1143600	1147680	and there's, because for me, the object is a proxy
1147680	1150480	for a machine that built it.
1150480	1154160	Some information being moved around,
1154800	1157840	actuation, sensing, getting resource,
1158640	1160080	and building these objects.
1160080	1162480	So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine.
1163440	1165520	But I'm like, forget the machine.
1165520	1166560	Let's see the objects.
1167360	1169520	And I think in a way that assembly theory,
1170160	1173360	we realized maybe a few months ago that assembly theory
1173360	1176160	actually does account for the soul in the objects,
1176160	1177760	not mystically like, say,
1177760	1181520	Sheldrecht's morphic resonance or Leibniz's monodology
1181520	1182800	seeing souls in things.
1182800	1185600	But when you see an object, and I've said this before,
1185600	1188160	but this object is evidence of thought,
1189120	1191200	and then there's a lineage of those objects.
1191200	1195280	So I think what is fascinating is that you put it much more
1195280	1198400	elegantly, but the barrier between life and non-life
1198400	1200880	is accruing enough memories to then actuate.
1202720	1204720	What that means is there are contingency,
1204720	1206640	there are things that happen in the universe get trapped.
1206640	1209440	These memories then have a causal effect on the future.
1210000	1212400	And then when you get those concentrated in a machine,
1212400	1215040	and you're actually able in real time, able to integrate
1216160	1219760	the past, the present, with the future, and do stuff,
1219760	1221280	that's when you are most alive.
1222560	1223760	You being the machine.
1223760	1224400	Yes.
1224400	1225200	Wait a minute.
1225200	1228560	Why is the object, so one of the ways to define life,
1229200	1233280	that Sarah said, is simple machines creating complex machines.
1234160	1237280	So there's a million questions there.
1237280	1240560	So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?
1241120	1241840	By mutation.
1242720	1244160	So this is what we were talking about at the beginning,
1244160	1246080	is you have a minimum replicator, so a molecule.
1246080	1247600	So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah
1247600	1249680	of the mechanism get there years ago, I think,
1249680	1251280	but then you've been building on it and saying,
1252480	1254880	you have a molecule that can copy itself,
1255680	1258240	but then there has to be some variability,
1258240	1260240	otherwise it's not going to get more functional.
1260240	1262080	So you need to add bits on.
1262080	1264560	So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself,
1264560	1267120	but then it can add bits on, and that can be copied as well,
1267120	1269680	and those add-ons can give you additional function
1272400	1275040	to be able to acquire more stuff to exist.
1275680	1280240	So existence is weird, but the fact that there is existence
1280240	1281120	is why there is life.
1281120	1284400	And that's why I realized a few days ago that there must be,
1284400	1286480	that's why alien life must be everywhere,
1287200	1288720	because there is existence.
1288720	1293680	Is there a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?
1293680	1296880	So how can you keep injecting more complex things?
1298880	1301760	Doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be
1302560	1307280	as or more powerful than the things it creates?
1308320	1310800	So how can you get complexity from simplicity?
1311760	1314880	So the way you get complexity from simplicity
1314880	1317520	is that you, I'm just making this up,
1317600	1319840	but this is kind of my notion that you have a large volume of stuff.
1320400	1325600	So you're able to get seeds if you like random cues from the environment.
1325600	1329760	So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape,
1329760	1330960	ones and zeros, whatever.
1331760	1337680	And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay?
1337680	1339600	But it has a low assembliness,
1339600	1341280	but even though it has a high assembly number,
1341280	1342480	we can talk about that.
1342480	1344640	But then when you start to then integrate that all
1344640	1347120	into a smaller volume as over time,
1348640	1352320	and you become more autonomous, you then make the transition.
1352880	1354720	I don't know what you think about that.
1354720	1358800	I think the easiest way to think about it is actually,
1358800	1360000	which I know is a concept you hate,
1360000	1361520	but I also hate it, which is entropy,
1361520	1363200	but people are more familiar with entropy
1363200	1364720	than what we talk about in assembly theory.
1365680	1369360	And also the idea that, like say physics as we know it,
1370080	1372720	involves objects that don't exist across time,
1372720	1374560	or as we would say low memory objects.
1375600	1378400	So one of the key distinctions that is-
1378400	1379680	Low memory objects.
1379680	1380160	Yeah.
1380160	1381040	So physics is all-
1381040	1383440	Well, physicists are low memory objects.
1383440	1384000	Quick clip.
1384000	1388000	But physicists are creators of low memory objects
1388000	1390160	or manipulators of low memory objects.
1390160	1390640	Absolutely.
1390640	1391600	That's a very nice way.
1393200	1393840	Okay, sorry, I got it.
1393840	1394480	Yeah, I know, sorry.
1394480	1395360	Sorry to interrupt you.
1395360	1396720	No, no, no, it's fine.
1396720	1397360	I like it too.
1397360	1398000	It's very funny.
1398720	1400320	But I think it's a good way of phrasing it,
1400320	1402000	because I think this kind of idea
1402000	1403360	we have in assembly theory is that,
1404640	1406240	you know, physics as we know it
1406240	1408240	has basically removed time as being
1408240	1411360	a physical observable of an object.
1411360	1413520	And the argument I would make is that
1413520	1415280	when you look at things like water bottles or us,
1416080	1418240	we're actually things that exist
1418240	1420880	that have a large extent in time.
1420880	1424400	So we actually have a physical size in time,
1424400	1426320	and we measure that with something
1426320	1429440	called the assembly index in molecules,
1429440	1431360	but presumably everyone should have
1431360	1434880	sort of a, do you want to explain what assembly?
1434880	1436320	Yeah, let's, you know what?
1436320	1439520	Let's step back and start at the beginning.
1439520	1440960	What is assembly theory?
1440960	1442080	Please send me some slides.
1442080	1444880	There's a big sexy paper coming out,
1444880	1447360	probably, maybe, I don't know.
1447360	1448320	We've not finished it.
1450160	1451440	Almost, almost finished it.
1451440	1453520	That's also a summary of science.
1453520	1454720	We're almost done.
1454720	1455040	Yes.
1455040	1456320	Well, no, no, we're almost done.
1456320	1458880	I think we're, we are ready to start
1458880	1461120	an interesting discussion with our peers.
1462320	1464160	You're at the machine that created the object,
1464160	1466080	and we'll see what the object takes us.
1466080	1468480	All right, so what is assembly theory?
1469040	1470720	Yeah, well, I think the easiest way
1470720	1471600	for people to understand it
1471600	1474960	is to think about assembly in molecules,
1474960	1476480	although the theory is very general.
1476480	1478080	It doesn't just apply to molecules.
1478080	1479360	And this was really leased in sight,
1479360	1481440	so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it, but.
1482320	1483280	I'll mark you.
1483280	1484320	Okay, all right.
1484320	1485120	I'm ready, I'm ready.
1485120	1485520	I'm ready.
1485520	1487600	You can tell me where I get the check mark minus, but.
1487600	1488480	It's your theory as well.
1488480	1489360	Yeah, I know.
1489360	1493200	But imagine a molecule, and then you can, you know,
1493200	1495680	break the molecule apart into elementary building blocks.
1495680	1496960	They happen to be bonds.
1496960	1498480	And then you can think of all the ways
1498480	1499680	for molecular assembly theory.
1499680	1500720	You can think of all the ways
1500720	1502240	of building up the original molecules.
1502240	1504880	So there's all these paths that you can assemble it,
1504880	1506640	and the sort of rules or assemblies
1506640	1508720	you can use pieces that have been generated already.
1509280	1511360	So it has this kind of recursive property to it.
1512080	1513440	And so that's where kind of memory
1513440	1515040	comes into assembly theory.
1515040	1518640	And then the assembly index is the shortest path
1518720	1519280	in that space.
1519280	1521680	So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history
1521680	1523200	that the universe has to undergo
1523200	1525440	in order to assemble that particular object.
1525440	1527200	And the reason that this is significant
1527200	1529200	is we figured out how to measure that
1530480	1533200	with a mass spec in the lab.
1533200	1536800	And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps
1536800	1539120	was sufficiently large, it would indicate
1539120	1541600	that you required a machine or a system that had information
1541600	1543280	about how to assemble that specific object
1543280	1545040	because the combinatorial space of possibilities
1545040	1547200	is getting exponentially large
1547200	1548960	as the assembly index is increasing.
1548960	1551520	So just sorry to interrupt, but so that means
1551520	1554480	there's a sufficiently high assembly index
1555760	1560480	that if observed in an object is an indicator
1560480	1564240	that something lifelike created it,
1564240	1566240	or is the object itself lifelike?
1567360	1567680	Both.
1568400	1569920	But you might want to make the distinction
1569920	1571840	that a water bottle is not life,
1572480	1574560	but it would still be a signature
1574560	1575920	that you were in that domain of physics.
1576560	1577600	And I might be alive.
1578400	1582000	So there will be potentially a lot of arguments
1582000	1585280	about where the line at which assembly index
1586800	1588800	does interesting stuff start to happen.
1588800	1590480	The point is we can make all the arguments,
1590480	1592160	but it should be experimentally observable.
1592160	1594080	And Lee can talk more about that part of it.
1594080	1595920	But the point I want to make about it
1595920	1599040	is there was always this intuition that I had
1599040	1601200	that there should be some complexity threshold
1601200	1603920	in the universe above which you would start to say
1603920	1606880	whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.
1606880	1607920	And I think about it a little bit,
1607920	1609280	like we have Planck's constant,
1610320	1612320	and we have the fine structure constant.
1612320	1614560	And then this sort of assembly threshold
1614560	1619760	is basically another sort of potentially constant of nature.
1619760	1622000	It might depend on specific features of the system,
1622880	1624480	which we debate about sometimes.
1624480	1627680	But then when you're past that,
1627680	1629920	you have to have some other explanation
1629920	1631520	than the current explanations we have in physics
1631520	1632720	because now you're in high memory.
1634880	1638320	The things actually require time for them to exist,
1638320	1639840	and time becomes a physical variable.
1639840	1643600	So the path to the creation of the object is the memory.
1643600	1644960	So you need to consider that.
1645600	1648800	Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.
1649440	1653120	So when I think of all the things in this room,
1654400	1657360	we see the projection of them as a water bottle,
1657360	1659760	but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph
1659760	1661680	of all the ways the universe can create this thing.
1661680	1663280	That's what it is as an object.
1663360	1665520	And we're all interacting a causal graph.
1665520	1667360	And most of the creativity in the biosphere
1667360	1669920	is because a lot of the objects that exist now
1669920	1672480	are huge in their structure across time,
1672480	1674240	four billion years of evolution to get to us.
1675280	1679600	Is it possible to look at me and infer the history
1679600	1682800	that led to me as a human?
1682800	1684880	You as an individual might be hard.
1684880	1688400	You as a representative of a population
1688400	1690080	of objects that have high assembly
1690080	1692160	with similar causal history and structure
1692160	1694560	that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans,
1694560	1695680	you can infer a lot probably.
1695680	1696880	Yeah, also with them.
1696880	1698240	Which we do genomically even.
1698240	1700880	I mean, it's not like we have a lot of information in us.
1700880	1703360	We can reconstruct histories from assembly
1703360	1704480	saying something slightly deeper.
1704480	1705440	Yeah, one thing to add.
1705440	1706800	I mean, it's not just about the object,
1706800	1708000	but the objects that occur.
1708000	1710160	And not just objects with a high assembly number,
1710160	1712000	because you can have random things
1712000	1712960	that have a high assembly number,
1712960	1716320	they must be a number of identical copies.
1716320	1718720	So you know you're getting away from the random,
1718720	1720000	because you could take a snapshot.
1720000	1721760	This is why I hate entropy.
1722160	1724240	I love entropy when used correctly.
1724240	1726160	But it's about the problem of entropy.
1726160	1727680	You have to have a labeler.
1727680	1730560	And so you can label the beginning and the end
1730560	1731520	to start on the finish.
1731520	1733760	You know, what you can do in assembly is say,
1733760	1736400	oh, I have a number of objects in abundance.
1736400	1738160	They all have these features.
1738160	1739200	And then you can infer.
1739920	1741760	And one of the things that we debated a lot,
1741760	1742880	particularly during lockdown,
1742880	1744800	because I almost went insane trying to crush
1744800	1746800	the produce the assembly equations.
1746800	1748400	So we came up with the assembly equation.
1748400	1749920	I had, just imagine this.
1749920	1752960	So you have this string where, oh,
1753760	1755920	actually it makes me sick trying to remember it.
1755920	1758480	It was so, it did my head in for a long time.
1758480	1759280	It's dramatic.
1759280	1760880	Yeah, because I couldn't,
1761600	1763840	so if you just have a string of say words,
1763840	1766960	say, you know, series of words, series of letters.
1766960	1769840	So you just have A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D.
1769840	1772480	And you find that object and you just have four A's,
1772480	1774560	four B's, four C's, four D's together.
1774560	1775360	Boom.
1775360	1777920	Then, and that you measured that.
1778000	1780000	So you physically measured that string of letters.
1780640	1782080	Then what you could do is you can infer
1782800	1786560	subgraphs of maybe the four A's, the four B's,
1786560	1787600	the four C's and the four C's,
1787600	1789920	but you don't see them in the real world.
1789920	1791280	You just infer them.
1791280	1793760	And I really got stuck with that
1793760	1795600	because there's a problem to try and work out
1795600	1796960	what's the difference between a long,
1797600	1801280	you know, physical object and the assembly space of the objects
1801280	1805200	so that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.
1805680	1808080	So although we can't infer your entire history,
1808080	1810320	we know at some point the four A's were made,
1810320	1812480	the four B's were made, the four C's were made,
1812480	1815440	and four D's were made, and they all got added together.
1815440	1817440	And that's one really interesting thing
1817440	1818960	that's come out of the theory.
1818960	1821600	But the killer, when we knew we were going beyond
1824080	1826240	beyond standard complexity theories,
1826240	1829840	it was incredibly successful is that we realized
1829840	1832800	we could start to measure these things for real across domains.
1833360	1836560	So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property
1836560	1840320	of all stuff that you can break into components,
1841600	1842880	particularly molecules are good
1842880	1845600	because you can break them up into smaller molecules,
1845600	1846400	into atoms.
1847200	1849760	The challenge will be making that more general
1849760	1850560	across all the domains,
1850560	1851680	but we're working on it right now
1851680	1852880	and I think the theory will do that.
1852880	1857280	So components, domains, so you're talking about basically
1857280	1859520	measuring the complexity of an object
1860160	1863120	in what, biology, chemistry, physics,
1863120	1864400	that's what you mean by domains.
1865680	1866720	Complexity of tests,
1866720	1870160	sociology, computers, complexity of memes, you know.
1870160	1870960	Memes, yep.
1871600	1873200	What is that, ideas?
1873200	1875120	Yeah, I mean, so one of them.
1875120	1876960	Ideas are objects in the assembly theory though.
1876960	1877920	Yeah, they are.
1877920	1878880	They're physical things,
1878880	1880320	they're just features of the causal graph.
1880320	1882080	I mean, the fact I can talk to you right now
1882080	1884560	is because we're exchanging structure of our assembly space.
1884880	1893200	So conversation is the exchanging structures in assembly space.
1893200	1894320	What is assembly space?
1895040	1896720	When I started working on Origins of Life,
1896720	1899600	I was writing about something called top-down causation,
1899600	1902160	which a lot of philosophers are interested in
1902160	1904000	and people that worry about the mind-body problem.
1904000	1909280	But the whole idea is, if we have the microscopic world of physics
1909840	1910960	is causally complete,
1910960	1913360	it seems like there's no room for higher-level causes.
1914160	1916480	Our thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.
1916480	1921440	And that seems problematic when you get to studying life and mind
1921440	1924400	because it does seem that quote-unquote emergent properties
1924400	1925360	do matter to matter.
1928960	1931120	And then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation
1931120	1933040	where information looks like it's disembodied.
1933040	1934320	So we talk about information,
1934320	1936240	like it can just move from any physical system
1936240	1937680	to any other physical system.
1937680	1938960	And it doesn't require,
1940400	1942720	like you don't have to specify anything about the substrate
1942720	1944240	to talk about information.
1944240	1947440	And then there's also the way we talk about mathematics
1947440	1951200	is also disembodied, like the platonic world of forms.
1951200	1955040	And I think all of those things are hinging
1955040	1957200	that we really don't know how to think about abstractions
1957200	1958240	as physical things.
1959760	1964000	And really, I think what Assembly Theory is pointing to
1964000	1966320	is what we're missing there is the dimension of time.
1967040	1970640	And if you actually look at an object being extended across time,
1971440	1974320	what we call information and the things that look abstract
1974320	1977440	are things that are entangled in the histories of those objects.
1977440	1980000	They're features of the overlapping assembly space.
1980000	1985360	So they look abstract because they're not part of the current structure,
1985360	1987520	but they're part of the structure if you thought about it
1987520	1989920	as like the philosophical concept of a hyper object,
1989920	1993120	an object that's too big in time for us to actually resolve.
1993840	1995920	And so I think information is physical.
1995920	1997760	It's just physical in time, not in space.
1998000	2002320	Too hyper object, too difficult for us to resolve.
2002320	2005440	So we're supposed to think about of life
2006160	2008240	as this thing that stretches through time
2008240	2010960	and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.
2012320	2014480	And then you're trying to measure something
2014480	2016880	with the assembly index about properties of that.
2016880	2018480	The assembly index is the ordering,
2020160	2021840	you could think of it as like a partial ordering
2021840	2023120	of all the things that can happen.
2023840	2026880	So in thermodynamics, we coarse-grain things
2026880	2028160	by temperature and pressure.
2028160	2030560	In assembly theory, we coarse-grain
2030560	2033280	by the number of copies of an object and the assembly index,
2033280	2036240	which is basically, if you think of the space of all possible things,
2036240	2038400	it's like a depth of how far you've gone into that space
2038400	2040480	and how much time was required to get there.
2040480	2042240	In the shortest possible version.
2042240	2042960	The shortest possible version.
2042960	2047520	Not average, because can't you just 3D print?
2047520	2049200	You're going to kill me with that question.
2049200	2053440	Oh, not 3D, can't you always 3D print the thing?
2053440	2054960	That's like cabin in the heart.
2054960	2056640	No, because I had such fights.
2056640	2059520	So Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper at the moment.
2059520	2063120	And I think we kind of share the, at the beginning,
2063120	2064080	you were like, no, that's not right.
2064080	2064800	Oh, yes, right.
2064800	2066160	And we're doing this for a bit.
2066160	2067760	And then the problem is when you build a theory
2067760	2071600	and build the intuition, there's some certain features, right?
2071600	2075200	Of the theory that almost felt like I was being religious about,
2075200	2076960	say, right, you have to do this.
2076960	2080320	A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.
2080320	2084320	And Sarah's postdoc Daniel and my postdoc, Abhishek,
2084400	2085760	and they were both brilliant.
2085760	2086560	They're brilliant.
2086560	2089360	But they were like, no, we don't, we don't buy that.
2089360	2093440	And I was like, it is, they were like, well, Lee, actually,
2094240	2096560	I thought you're the first to say that, you know, you can't,
2096560	2098000	if you can't explain it, it doesn't,
2098000	2100160	and you can't do an experiment that doesn't exist.
2100160	2100800	And that saved me.
2100800	2103280	And I said to Abhishek, Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow,
2103280	2106080	Daniel is Sarah's postdoc in ASU.
2106080	2108880	I was like, I have the experimental data.
2108880	2110960	So when I basically take the molecules
2110960	2112640	and chop them up in the mass spec,
2112720	2114400	the assembly number is never the average.
2114400	2115680	It's always the shortest.
2115680	2116800	It's an intrinsic property.
2116800	2118960	And then the penny drop for Abhishek said, okay,
2118960	2122640	because I had these things that we had to believe to start with
2122640	2123200	or to trust.
2123200	2124640	And then we've done the math and it comes out
2124640	2126560	and they now have the shortest path.
2126560	2129120	Actually, it's up that explains why the shortest path.
2129120	2131440	Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.
2132640	2134640	The shortest path needs you to identify
2134640	2138000	when the universe is basically got a memory, not an average.
2138000	2139520	So what you want to be able to do is to say,
2140240	2143680	what is the minimum number of features
2143680	2145440	that I want to be able to see in the universe?
2145440	2148240	When I find those features, I know the universe
2148240	2152560	has had a coherent memory and is basically alive.
2153440	2156880	And so that gives you the lower bound.
2156880	2159440	So that's like, of course, there's going to be other paths.
2159440	2161040	We can be more ridiculous, right?
2161040	2163360	We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.
2163360	2166000	So probabilistically, at the beginning,
2166000	2168560	because assembly theory was built as a measure
2168560	2171120	for biosignatures, I needed to go there.
2171760	2173600	And then I realized it was intrinsic.
2173600	2175600	And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic
2175600	2176800	and these hyperobjects were coming.
2176800	2179200	And we were kind of fusing that notions together.
2179760	2183760	And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy
2183760	2186960	and I have enough resources, I might not take the shortest path.
2186960	2187920	I might go a bit longer.
2187920	2189840	I might take a really long path
2189840	2193040	because it allows me then to do something else.
2193040	2195440	So what you do is, let's say I've got two different objects,
2196000	2200240	A and B, and they both have different shortest paths to get them.
2200240	2203040	But then if you want to make A and B together,
2203760	2204720	they will have a compromise.
2204720	2208480	So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average,
2208480	2212160	but actually it's the shortest way you can make both A and B
2212160	2214640	with a minimum amount of resource in time.
2214640	2216720	So suddenly you then layer these things up.
2216720	2219680	And so the average becomes not important,
2219680	2223600	but as you literally overlap those sets,
2223600	2225280	you get a new shortest path.
2225280	2227120	And so what we realized time and time again
2227120	2230080	when we're doing the math, the shortest path is intrinsic,
2230080	2234160	is fundamental, and is measurable, which is kind of mind-blowing.
2234160	2237280	So what we're talking about, some basic ingredients,
2237280	2240960	maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic ingredients could be
2240960	2243760	and how many steps, when you say shortest path,
2243760	2248320	how many steps it takes to turn those basic ingredients
2248320	2250800	into the final meal.
2252080	2254720	So how to make a, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?
2255520	2257120	For a pie, an apple pie.
2257120	2258480	An apple pie, that's right.
2258480	2260240	And the pizza and a pie together.
2260240	2261040	For a scratch.
2261040	2261680	Yeah.
2261680	2262960	So there's a lot of ways.
2264880	2268880	There's the shortest way, and you take the full spectrum of ways,
2268880	2275200	and there's probably an average duration for a noob to make an apple pie.
2276320	2278240	Is the average interesting still?
2278240	2282960	If you measure the average length of the path to assemble a thing,
2283600	2286960	does that tell you something about the way nature usually does it?
2288720	2293840	Versus something fundamental about the object,
2293840	2296400	which I think is what you're aiming at with the assembly index.
2296400	2299360	Yeah. I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.
2299360	2301040	The minimum path gives you the lower bounds,
2301040	2302240	so you know you're detecting something,
2302240	2304000	you know you're inferring something.
2304000	2308080	The average tells you about really how the objects are existing
2308080	2310160	in the ecosystem or the technology.
2310960	2314800	And there has to be more paths explored,
2314800	2319920	because then you can happen upon other memories,
2319920	2321360	and then condense them down.
2321360	2322400	I'm not making too much sense,
2322400	2324640	but if you look at, say, let's just say,
2324640	2327200	I mean, maybe we're going to get to alien civilizations later, right?
2327200	2331040	But I would argue very strongly that alien civilization A
2331040	2335520	and alien civilization B, they're different assembly spaces.
2335520	2337040	So they're kind of going to be a bit messed up
2337040	2338960	if they happen to come one another.
2338960	2342160	Only when they find some joint overlap in their technology,
2342160	2344160	because if aliens come to us and we,
2344160	2346560	they don't share any of the causal graph we've shared,
2346560	2348400	but hopefully they share the periodic table
2349200	2351280	and some other and bonds and things,
2351280	2353920	so we're going to have to really think about the language
2353920	2356720	to talk to us aliens by inferring,
2356720	2361600	by using assembly theory to infer their language,
2361600	2363120	their technology, and other bits and bobs.
2363680	2366000	And the shortest path will help you do that quickly.
2366000	2369440	All right, so all aliens in the causality graphs
2369440	2372160	have a common ancestor in the-
2372160	2373840	If the building blocks are the same,
2373840	2375600	which means they live in the same universe as us.
2375600	2376240	So in this-
2376240	2378400	It depends on how far back in time you go, though.
2378400	2382000	But the universe has all the same building blocks.
2382000	2382640	Yeah.
2382640	2384320	And we have to assume that.
2385760	2392960	So there's not different classes of causality graphs, right?
2392960	2393440	No.
2393440	2394640	The universe doesn't just say,
2395440	2399360	here, you get the red causality graph and you get the blue one.
2399360	2402640	These basic ingredients and they're geographically constrained
2402640	2405440	or constrained in space or time or something like that.
2406000	2410000	They're constrained in time because only by the virtue of the fact that
2411280	2414480	you need enough time to have passed for some things to exist.
2414480	2417040	So the universe has to be big enough in time for some things.
2417040	2419680	So just a one point on the shortest path versus the average path,
2419680	2422800	which I think we'll get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it.
2422800	2425120	It's like the minimal compression is the shortest path
2425120	2426480	for the universe to produce that.
2426480	2429840	But it's also like the first time in the ordering of events
2429840	2431520	that you might expect to see that object.
2432400	2438000	But the average path tells you something about the actual steps
2438000	2440880	that were realized and that becomes an emergent property
2440880	2443600	of that object's interaction with other objects.
2443600	2445440	So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object.
2445440	2447680	It's a feature of the interactions with other things.
2447680	2449840	And so one of the nice features of assembly
2449840	2451200	is you basically gotten rid of-
2451200	2452640	you just look at the things that exist
2452640	2455600	and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms for constructing them
2455600	2457280	in some sense, like the machines or not,
2459280	2462560	as important in the current construction of the theory,
2462560	2466240	although I would like to bridge it to some ideas about constructors.
2467920	2472400	But then you could only communicate with things as Lee was saying
2472400	2474960	if you have some overlap in the past history.
2474960	2478640	So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap,
2478640	2480320	then there would be no means of communication.
2481200	2485200	But as we progress further and further in time
2485200	2486720	and more things become possible
2486720	2489360	because the assembly spaces are larger-
2489360	2492640	because you can have a larger assembly space in terms of index
2492640	2494080	and also just the size of the space
2494080	2495280	because it's exponentially growing,
2496240	2498160	then more things can happen in the future.
2498160	2499920	And the example I like to give is actually
2500480	2502960	when we made first contact with gravitational waves
2503680	2507120	because that's an alien phenomena that's been permeating our plate,
2507120	2508640	not alien in life phenomena,
2508640	2511840	but alien like something we had never knew existed.
2511840	2513760	It's been, you know, like we're, you know,
2513760	2516160	there's gravitational waves rippling through this room right now.
2517280	2520800	But we had to advance to the level of Einstein writing down
2521840	2525760	his theory of relativity and then 100 years of technological development
2525760	2527760	to even quote-unquote see that phenomena.
2528400	2531440	So the, okay, to see that phenomena,
2532080	2535920	our causal graph have to start intersecting.
2535920	2537840	Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first,
2537840	2538880	the abstraction, right?
2538880	2540480	And then we had to build the technology
2540480	2543600	that could actually observe features of that abstraction.
2543600	2545760	So the nice promising thing is
2545760	2547440	over time the graph can grow,
2547440	2549440	so we can start overlapping eventually.
2549440	2551760	Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph is
2551760	2552800	there was an event, you know,
2552800	2555760	1.4 billion years away of a black hole merger
2555760	2558400	that we detected on our detector.
2558400	2561440	And, you know, now suddenly we're connected
2561440	2562880	through this communication channel
2562880	2564960	with this distant event in our universe
2565040	2567920	that, you know, if you think about 1.4 billion years ago
2567920	2569200	what was happening on this planet
2569200	2570720	or even further back in time,
2571920	2573760	that, you know, there is common physics
2573760	2574960	underlying all those events,
2574960	2576880	but even for those two events to communicate with them.
2576880	2578720	Oh, I understand what you were going on about the other week.
2578720	2581280	Yeah, I'm sorry, this is a really abstract example, but,
2582320	2583040	but it's sort of-
2583040	2584560	Your causal graphs are not overlapping.
2584560	2586800	Yeah, so, well, let's just say
2586800	2589520	now our causal graphs are overlapping in the deep past.
2590240	2591680	No, I like it, so you made it-
2591680	2592320	I totally missed it.
2592320	2593280	Oh, all of the 1.6 billion.
2593280	2593680	Yeah.
2593680	2594640	You made a connection with it.
2594640	2595440	No, I do like that.
2595440	2597440	You know, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.
2597440	2598320	This is good.
2598320	2599120	Because I was-
2599120	2601920	And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.
2602720	2603680	Oh, I get it now.
2605040	2605760	No, it's all right.
2605760	2607200	The joke came two minutes ago.
2607200	2608560	Our flow on the uptake here.
2608560	2610560	I wasn't able to comprehend what you were talking about
2610560	2612720	when saying the channel communicating to the past,
2612720	2613600	but what you're saying is
2614640	2619200	we were able to infer what happened 1.4 billion years ago.
2620160	2621600	We detected the gravity wave.
2621600	2623120	I mean, I think it's amazing that, you know,
2623120	2624480	at that time we weren't even-
2624480	2626240	We were just becoming multicellular, right?
2626720	2628320	It's like insane.
2628320	2631760	And then we progressed the multicellularity
2631760	2635280	through to technology and built the detector,
2635280	2638000	and then we just extrapolate backwards.
2638000	2642080	So although we didn't do anything back to the graph back in time,
2642080	2644400	we understood there's existence then overlapped going forward.
2644400	2644800	And that-
2644800	2646560	Well, that's because our graphs are larger.
2646560	2649040	Yeah, but that means that has a consequence.
2649040	2652880	One of the things I was trying to say is I think
2653680	2656800	I don't know, Sarah might be, she can correct me, information first.
2656800	2659520	And I'm an object first kind of guy.
2659520	2661680	So I mean, as things that get constructed,
2661680	2665200	there has to be this transition in random constructions.
2665200	2667200	So when the construct,
2667200	2669920	the object that's being constructed by the process
2670720	2671840	bakes in that memory,
2671840	2674640	and those memories then add on and add on and add on.
2675520	2677520	So as it becomes more competent,
2677520	2679920	and life is about taking those memories
2679920	2682160	and compressing them, increasing their autonomy.
2682880	2687040	And so I think that like the cell that we have in biology on Earth
2687040	2688080	is our way of doing that,
2688080	2692400	that really the maximum ability to take memories and to act on the future.
2692960	2694160	Oh, I think that's mathematics.
2695600	2698320	No, mathematics doesn't exist.
2698320	2699360	No, but that's the point.
2699360	2701760	The point is that abstractions do exist.
2701760	2703040	They're real physical things.
2703040	2705600	We call them abstractions.
2705600	2708640	But the point about mathematics that I think is-
2708720	2710640	So I don't disagree.
2710640	2712640	I think you're object first and I'm information first,
2712640	2715120	but I think I'm only information first
2715120	2717360	in the sense that I think the thing that we need to explain
2718000	2722000	is what abstractions are and what they are as physical things.
2722000	2723680	Because of all of human history,
2723680	2727920	we've thought that there were these properties that are disembodied,
2727920	2729520	exist outside of the universe.
2729520	2732400	And really, they do exist in the universe,
2732400	2734800	and we just don't understand what their physics is.
2734800	2736720	So I think mathematics is a really good example.
2736720	2739280	We do theoretical physics with math,
2739280	2741920	but imagine doing physics of math,
2742480	2744720	and then thinking about math as a physical object.
2744720	2746240	And math is super interesting.
2746240	2748640	I think this is why we think it describes reality so well,
2748640	2750800	because it's the most copyable kind of information.
2750800	2754080	It retains its properties when you move it between physical media,
2754080	2756160	which means that it's very deep.
2756160	2759040	And so it seems to describe the universe really well,
2759040	2761920	but it probably is because it's information that's very deep in our past.
2761920	2766400	And it's just we invented a way of communicating it
2766400	2767760	very effectively between us.
2768960	2771120	Isn't math more fundamental?
2771120	2773280	Isn't the assembly of the graph,
2773280	2775200	isn't basically, I'm going to say,
2775200	2776160	I sound completely boring.
2776160	2779280	It's like math, assembly theory invented math, but it did.
2779920	2780720	It has to be.
2780720	2780960	Okay.
2783760	2788880	So what is math exactly?
2788960	2793360	It's a nice simplification,
2794880	2798000	a simple description of what?
2798000	2800480	So we have a computer scientist, a physicist, and a chemist here.
2801200	2802000	Walking to a bar.
2802000	2803680	I think the chemist is going to define math,
2803680	2804880	and you guys can correct me.
2805520	2806080	Go for it.
2807280	2808160	Let's lay in honestly.
2809440	2810000	We're ready.
2810800	2817280	I think the ability to label objects and place them into classes
2817280	2819680	and then do operations on the objects is what math is.
2820960	2826240	So on that point, what does it mean to be object first versus information first?
2826880	2829520	So what's the difference between object and information
2829520	2831920	when you get to that low fundamental level?
2831920	2833920	Well, I might change my view.
2833920	2835600	So I'm stuff first, the stuff.
2836400	2840560	And then when stuff becomes objects, it has to invent information.
2841440	2844720	And then the information acts on more stuff and becomes more objects.
2844720	2846960	So I think there is a transition to information.
2847600	2849440	That occurs when you go from stuff to object.
2849440	2850560	Just mean time though.
2850560	2850960	Yeah.
2850960	2853440	Information is emergent.
2853440	2854400	Not emergent.
2854400	2859520	Information is actionable memories from the universe.
2860320	2863760	So when memories become actionable, that's information.
2864720	2867600	But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.
2868240	2868480	Yeah.
2868480	2869680	And then it's not information.
2869680	2869920	Great.
2869920	2872240	And actionable is what you can create.
2872240	2872960	You can use it.
2873600	2875680	If you can't use it, then it's not information.
2875680	2879280	If you can't transmit it, if it doesn't have any causal consequence.
2879280	2880400	It falls in the forest.
2880400	2881600	I don't understand.
2881600	2882880	Why is that not information?
2883440	2884320	It's not information.
2884320	2887200	It's stuff.
2887200	2890160	It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.
2890160	2891600	Yeah, yeah, we can.
2891600	2892000	This is cool.
2892000	2892800	It's happening.
2892800	2893200	No, no.
2893200	2895120	The happening requires information.
2895120	2896800	No, no, no, no.
2896800	2898240	Stuff is always happening.
2898240	2898720	No.
2898720	2901680	This is where the physicists and the mathematicians get themselves in a loop
2901680	2903600	because I think the universe, I mean,
2904560	2909200	I think, say, Max Teckmark and is very playful and say like the universe,
2909200	2910080	universe is just math.
2910080	2911280	Well, the universe is just math.
2911280	2914000	Then we might as well not bother having any conversation
2914000	2915040	because the conversation will be written.
2915040	2916160	We just might as well go to the future and say,
2916160	2917520	can you just give us the conversations?
2917520	2918640	It's happened already.
2918640	2923520	So I think the problem is that mathematicians are so successful at labeling stuff
2923520	2926240	and so successful understanding of stuff through those labels.
2926240	2929440	They forget that actually those labels had to emerge
2929440	2932880	and that information had to be built on those memories.
2932880	2936560	So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph,
2936560	2939600	when they become actionable and the graph can loop back on itself
2939600	2942160	or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,
2942800	2945840	those memories become actionable and therefore their information.
2945840	2949760	And I think you just changed my mind on something pretty big,
2949760	2951520	but I don't have a pen so I can't write.
2951520	2952400	I'm going to write it down later.
2952400	2958000	But roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs of objects of stuff.
2958640	2961520	They have memories and then when they intersect
2962320	2964400	and then they can act on each other,
2964400	2966880	that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then,
2967440	2969200	so then you can then abstract.
2969200	2972240	So when one graph can then build another graph and say,
2972240	2974720	hey, you don't have to go through the nonsense we had to go through.
2974720	2976080	Here's literally the way to do it.
2976080	2977680	Stuff always comes first,
2977680	2979360	but then when stuff builds the abstraction,
2979360	2981600	the abstraction can be then teleported onto other stuff.
2981600	2983840	And the abstraction is the looping back power.
2984960	2985600	Okay.
2985600	2987680	Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck.
2987680	2990880	Yeah, so first a God made stuff.
2992240	2996320	And after that, when you start to be able to form abstractions,
2996320	2996880	that's when the-
2996880	2999520	God is the memory the universe can remember.
3000400	3002320	God is the memory the universe can remember.
3002880	3003760	Otherwise there's no-
3003760	3006320	I'm just deciphering that statement hundreds of years from now.
3006320	3007760	What the hell does that mean?
3007760	3009200	What does that mean by this?
3009200	3012480	Hey, look, don't diss my one-liners.
3012480	3014080	No, no, I wasn't dissing it.
3014080	3016560	It took me 15 seconds to come up with that.
3016560	3017600	I don't know what it means.
3017600	3018240	What does it mean?
3018560	3021760	Okay, wait, we need to-
3021760	3022960	Well, how do we get onto this?
3024400	3030560	We were time causality mathematics.
3030560	3034160	So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff,
3035760	3041840	objects, memory, and information?
3042800	3044880	Is, what is that, is mathematics?
3044880	3046880	It's the most efficient labeling scheme
3046880	3049040	that you can apply to lots of different graphs.
3049040	3052320	Well, the labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.
3052320	3053280	Can I try?
3053280	3054560	Yep, sure, please.
3054560	3056640	Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?
3056640	3057280	I'm shocked.
3057760	3059120	Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
3059120	3059920	But it's correct.
3061120	3062000	Go ahead, sorry.
3062000	3062640	Excellent.
3063360	3066320	No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right?
3066320	3068480	Because we can't not be us.
3068480	3070160	Like, we're stuck in the shells we are,
3070160	3071360	and we're trying to observe the world.
3071360	3073680	And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties.
3073680	3076080	And I guess the thought experiment I find is useful
3076080	3078960	is to try to imagine, if you were outside of us
3078960	3082240	looking at us as physical systems using mathematics,
3082240	3084800	what would be the specific features you associate
3084800	3088720	to the property of understanding mathematics
3088720	3092000	and being able to implement it in the universe, right?
3092000	3094240	And when you do that,
3094240	3096800	mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties
3096800	3099040	relative to other kinds of abstraction
3099040	3102240	we might talk about, like language or artistic expression.
3102960	3105040	One of those properties is the one I mentioned already
3105040	3108000	that is really easy to copy between physical media.
3108000	3110240	So if I give you a mathematical statement,
3110240	3111840	you almost immediately know what I mean.
3111840	3113920	If I tell you the sky is blue, you might say,
3113920	3114800	is it gold ball blue?
3114800	3115520	Is it your blue?
3115520	3116720	What color blue do you mean?
3116720	3120160	And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.
3120160	3121840	So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it
3121840	3123360	when it's copied between physical systems.
3123360	3125440	It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.
3126800	3130080	And then the second one is it retains its property
3130080	3133760	of actually what it can do in the universe when it's copied.
3133760	3136000	So the example I like to give there
3136000	3138160	is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.
3139440	3142000	It's actually, it's a compressed regularity
3142000	3145360	of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe.
3145360	3148560	But then that information actually is a causal in a sense
3148560	3150400	that it allows us to do things we wouldn't be able to do
3150400	3151840	without that particular knowledge
3151840	3153280	and that particular abstraction.
3153280	3155040	And in this case, like launch satellites to space
3155040	3156640	or send people to Mars or whatever it is.
3158080	3160800	So if you look at us from the outside
3160800	3162640	and you say, what is it for physical systems
3162640	3164720	to invent a thing called mathematics?
3164720	3171200	And then to use and then it to become a physical observable,
3171200	3173680	mathematics is kind of like the universally
3173680	3178320	copyable information that allows new possibility spaces
3178320	3179200	to be opened in the future
3179200	3181280	because it allows this kind of ability
3181280	3182960	to map one physical system to another
3182960	3185600	and actually understand the general principles.
3185600	3190480	So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then?
3190480	3190560	Yes.
3190560	3191440	By mapping.
3191440	3194000	Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is
3194000	3195920	in terms of the physical theory of assembly
3195920	3198080	would be some feature of the structure
3198080	3200560	of the assembly spaces of causal graphs
3200560	3202080	and their relationship to each other.
3202080	3204560	So for example, and I mean,
3204560	3206080	this is things that we're going to have to work out
3206080	3207040	over the next few years.
3207040	3209680	I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory here.
3210800	3214400	But as is usual, diving off the deep end.
3215200	3217920	But I would expect that we would be able to come up
3217920	3220640	with a theory of like, why is it that some physical systems
3220640	3223920	can communicate with each other, like language?
3223920	3225600	Language is basically because
3225600	3227120	we're objects extended over time
3227120	3229760	and some of the history of that assembly space
3229760	3230960	actually overlaps.
3230960	3232080	And when we communicate,
3232080	3233680	it's because we actually have shared structure
3233680	3234880	in our causal history.
3234880	3236400	Let me have another quick go at this, right?
3236400	3237360	So I think we all agree.
3237360	3241360	So I think we take mathematics for granted
3241360	3242800	because we've gone through this chain, right?
3242800	3246320	Of, you know, we all share a language now, okay?
3246320	3247600	And we can, well, we share,
3247600	3250480	so we have languages that we can make interoperable.
3251440	3254880	And so whether you're speaking, I don't know,
3254880	3257440	all the different dialects of Chinese,
3257440	3260720	all the different dialects of English at French, German,
3260720	3262640	whatever, you can interconvert them.
3262640	3264240	The interesting thing about mathematics now
3264240	3266480	is that everybody on planet Earth, every human being
3266480	3269760	and computers share that common language.
3269760	3273280	That language was constructed by a process in time.
3273280	3275360	So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math
3275360	3279040	is those right from the, you know, mathematics didn't occur,
3279120	3283440	didn't exist before life, abstraction was invented by life,
3283440	3284000	right?
3284000	3286000	That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable
3286000	3287200	of mathematical things.
3287200	3287840	Wait, wait a minute.
3287840	3290640	Can we just ask that, that old famous question,
3290640	3292640	is math invented or discovered?
3292640	3296320	So when you say assembly invented or whatever,
3297680	3298800	you, it means it's just-
3298800	3299280	Well, if someone makes this for an assembly,
3299280	3300640	it's a mathematical theory, but sorry.
3301440	3301840	Right.
3301840	3302320	Are we arguing?
3302320	3302960	Exactly.
3302960	3303760	Are we arguing now?
3303760	3304960	That's what it sounds like.
3304960	3306880	Are we discovering mathematics?
3306880	3307360	No.
3307360	3308400	Well, yes and no.
3308480	3309520	I would say-
3309520	3311280	And you call mathematics a language.
3311840	3311920	I would say that-
3311920	3312960	So it's developing.
3312960	3317360	Look, I'm pretty sure that there are some very common seeds
3317360	3319120	of mathematics in the universe, right?
3319680	3323040	But actually not the mathematics that we are finding now
3323840	3326400	is not discovered, it's invented.
3327200	3329040	And but even though, I think there's two terms,
3329040	3331920	are very triggering and I don't think they're necessarily useful
3331920	3335120	because I think that what people do, the mathematicians that say,
3335120	3339520	oh, mathematics was discovered because they live in a universe
3339520	3341600	where there is no time and it just all exists.
3342400	3346080	But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way you can create,
3346080	3349280	let's say I'm going to go and create and make a piece of art.
3351280	3355120	Did I make that piece of art or did I discover it?
3355920	3357360	Like inventing the airplane.
3357360	3358560	Did I invent the airplane?
3358560	3359440	Let's stick with the airplane.
3359440	3360160	The airplane is a good one.
3360160	3363040	I, let's say I'm, did I discover the airplane?
3363040	3364720	Well, in a way, the universe discovered the airplane
3364720	3366160	because it's just chucked a load of atoms together
3366160	3368800	and a load of random human beings want to do stuff and they,
3368800	3372080	we, we discovered the airplane in the space of possibilities.
3372080	3373280	But here's the thing.
3373280	3379440	When the space of possibilities is so vast, infinite almost,
3380000	3382960	and you're able to actualize one of those in an object,
3382960	3384480	then you are inventing it.
3384480	3387760	So in mathematics, because there are infinite number of theorems,
3387760	3389280	the fact you're actually pulling,
3389280	3392880	there's no difference between inventing a mathematical structure
3392880	3394160	and inventing the airplane.
3394160	3395280	They're the same thing.
3395280	3398400	But that doesn't mean that now the airplane exists in the universe.
3398400	3401120	It's something weird about the universe that, you know,
3401120	3404800	so I think that the more, this is the thing that you probably,
3404800	3410240	the more memory required for the object, the more invented it is.
3410240	3412080	So when a mathematical theorem has a,
3412800	3416640	has a, needs more bytes to store it, the more invented it is,
3416640	3419360	and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.
3419920	3422000	But everything then is invented.
3422000	3423600	It's just more or less invented.
3423680	3424320	Absolutely.
3424960	3427200	The universe has to generate everything as it goes.
3427760	3428000	Yeah.
3429520	3430960	And it wasn't there in the beginning.
3430960	3432720	And the way we're thinking it,
3432720	3434960	when you're thinking about the difference between invented and
3434960	3437760	discovered is because we're throwing away all the memory.
3437760	3438400	Yeah.
3438400	3441440	So if you start to think in terms of causality and time,
3442160	3443680	then those things become the same.
3443680	3444640	Everything is invented.
3445840	3448160	And the idea is to make everything intrinsic to the universe.
3448160	3450560	So I think one of the features of assembly theory
3450560	3452400	is we don't want to have external observers.
3452400	3454560	There's been this long tradition in physics of trying to describe
3454560	3456320	the universe from the outside and not the inside.
3457440	3460000	And the universe has to generate everything itself
3460000	3460960	if you do it from the inside.
3460960	3464240	Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.
3466400	3469760	They'll take you 15 seconds to say that and do it to come up with that also.
3469760	3471200	No, I've thought about that before.
3471200	3472560	Okay, good line.
3473520	3474800	Are you making fun again?
3474800	3475760	No, I'm not making fun.
3475760	3476400	I'm having fun.
3476400	3477200	There's a difference.
3477200	3477840	Oh, that's good.
3477840	3478880	All right, I'm you.
3478880	3479840	She's inventing fun.
3479840	3481120	I'm not all intimidated.
3482560	3484800	And there's a causal history to that fun.
3486160	3489600	You mentioned that there's no way to communicate with aliens
3489600	3492400	until there's overlap in the causal graph.
3494080	3497440	Communication includes being able to see them.
3498560	3501600	And like what are we, this is the question is,
3503680	3506240	is communication any kind of detection?
3506240	3509680	And if so, what do aliens look like
3509680	3512960	as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?
3512960	3518000	You're assuming, let's assume that so when you see them and they see you,
3518960	3520640	you're assuming they have vision,
3520640	3523760	they have the ability to construct in 3D and in time,
3523760	3525680	there's a lot of assumptions we're making.
3525680	3526400	What detection?
3526400	3527440	All right, let's step back.
3527440	3529120	So yes, okay, you're right.
3529120	3532080	So when in the English language, when we say the word C,
3532080	3534720	we mean visually, they show up to a party and it's like,
3534720	3536160	oh, wow, that's an alien.
3536160	3536880	That's visual.
3536880	3537680	That's 3D.
3537680	3539040	That's okay.
3539840	3545520	And that's also assuming spatial scale of something that's visible to you.
3545520	3548240	So it can't be microscopic or it can't be so big
3548240	3550720	that you don't even realize that's an entity.
3550720	3550960	Okay.
3551920	3554000	But other kinds of detection too.
3554000	3555600	I would make it more abstract and go down.
3555600	3558400	I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite
3558400	3562960	the Arecibo message in assembly theory and also to abandon binary.
3562960	3566080	Because I don't think aliens necessarily, why should they have binary?
3567040	3572080	Well, they have some basic elements with which to do information exchange.
3572720	3577040	Well, let's make it more fundamental or more universal.
3577040	3580080	So we need to think about what is the universal way of making a memory
3580080	3582400	and then we should re-encode Arecibo in that way.
3583360	3585600	What's more basic than 0's and 1's?
3585600	3588800	Well, it's really difficult to get out of that causal chain because we're so...
3588800	3591600	So let's raise the idea of 0 for a moment.
3591600	3594320	It took human beings a long time to come up with the idea of 0.
3594880	3595920	Now you've got the idea of 0.
3595920	3596720	You can't throw it away.
3596720	3597360	It's so useful.
3597360	3599040	To discover the idea of 0.
3599040	3600000	To discover or invent.
3600640	3601360	I don't know.
3601360	3604320	But it took a long time so it was invented.
3604320	3604880	That's right.
3604880	3605120	Yeah.
3605120	3606960	I think 0 was invented.
3606960	3607680	It's exactly.
3607680	3610160	So it's not given that aliens know what 0 is.
3610880	3613440	It's a massive assumption.
3613440	3616000	It's a useful discovery.
3616000	3618000	You're saying if you break the causal chain,
3618000	3620400	there might be some other more efficient way of representing...
3620400	3623920	That's why I want to meet him and ask him for a shortcut.
3624320	3627600	But you won't be able to ask him until...
3627600	3629840	So I interrupted you and I think you're making good point.
3629840	3630960	I was just going to say, well look.
3630960	3632000	Thank you.
3632000	3632400	Sorry.
3634240	3634880	Rather than saying...
3634880	3635600	Please internet.
3635600	3637600	Tweet at him for the rude interruptions.
3637600	3638240	Oh, go ahead.
3638240	3638800	I'm sorry.
3638800	3639440	No, it's okay.
3640000	3641200	Maybe it's change.
3641200	3642400	How do we say...
3644160	3645840	I don't know what it's like to be an alien.
3645840	3646720	I would like to know.
3647360	3652000	What is the full spectrum of what aliens might look like to us?
3652960	3657200	Now that we've laid this all on the table of like,
3657200	3659520	all right, so there has to be some overlap
3659520	3662880	and this causal chain that led to them.
3663680	3665520	What are we looking for?
3665520	3666880	What do you think we should be looking for?
3666880	3670400	So you mentioned mass spec measuring certain objects
3670400	3673440	that aliens could create or are aliens themselves.
3674960	3677440	We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet
3677440	3680240	or maybe what the hell is the basic object
3680320	3682880	we're trying to measure the assembly index of?
3682880	3683840	Let's cut ourselves a break.
3683840	3687440	Let's assume that they're metabolized.
3687440	3691680	They've got an energy source and there are a size
3691680	3692800	that we can recognize.
3692800	3694000	Let's give our cut ourselves a break
3694000	3696240	because there could be aliens that are so big
3696240	3697920	we won't recognize we're seeing them.
3697920	3699200	There might be aliens that are so small
3699200	3700800	we don't yet have the ability to...
3700800	3703920	We don't have microscopes that can see far enough away
3703920	3705200	that just won't be able to see them.
3705200	3706320	So what's a good range?
3706320	3707760	So let's just make a range...
3707760	3710400	Let's just be very anthropocentric and say
3710400	3712320	we're going to look for aliens roughly our size
3712320	3713760	and technology our size
3713760	3716240	because we know it's possible on Earth, right?
3716240	3719280	I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be to find exoplanets
3719280	3722480	that in the same zone as Earth in terms of heat and stuff
3723040	3726240	and then say, hey, if there's that same kind of gravity,
3726240	3729120	same kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume
3729760	3732880	that the alien life there might use
3732880	3736640	a similar kind of physical infrastructure and then we're good.
3736640	3739440	So then your question becomes really relevant.
3739440	3741840	Say, right, let's use vision, sound, touch.
3743680	3744800	So okay, that's really nice.
3744800	3746960	So if there's a lot of aliens out there,
3748880	3752400	there's a good likelihood if you match to the planet
3752400	3756960	that they're going to be in the same spatial and temporal...
3756960	3760320	Operating in the same spatial temporal domain as humans.
3760320	3766320	Okay, within that, what did they look like?
3767200	3768800	Visually, what do they sound like?
3770000	3770640	What are they?
3770640	3772000	Oh, God, this sounds creepy.
3772000	3773760	Tastes like, what are they?
3774800	3776320	Oh, smell like, smell like that.
3776320	3777440	It sounds like our clubhouse.
3777440	3779200	We was like, can we have sex of aliens?
3779200	3780640	Which was basically me saying...
3780640	3781520	Passionate, passionate love.
3781520	3782640	But it wasn't actually about sex.
3782640	3784800	It was about, is our chemistry compatible, right?
3784800	3785280	Is there some...
3786480	3787840	Yeah, can we...
3788800	3790720	Yeah, are they edible too?
3790720	3791840	They could be very edible.
3791840	3793040	They could be delicious.
3793040	3794560	That's why I want to see some aliens, right?
3794640	3796000	Because I think, are there...
3796000	3797280	I think evolution...
3799440	3801440	I mean, evolution exploits symmetry, right?
3801440	3803280	Because why generate memory?
3803280	3805840	Why generate storage, the need for storage space
3805840	3806960	when you can use symmetry?
3807600	3810480	So, and symmetry is quite, maybe quite effective
3810480	3812960	in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?
3812960	3816000	So maybe you could be reasonable to assume
3816000	3816960	that aliens could have...
3817920	3819680	They could be bipedal.
3819680	3821440	They could be symmetric in the same way.
3822240	3824960	Might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.
3824960	3826240	I mean, we can make them.
3826240	3828960	Perhaps there's this whole zoo of different aliens out there
3828960	3830640	and we'll never get to be able to classify
3830640	3832560	some of the weird aliens we can't interact with
3832560	3834720	because they have made such weird stuff.
3835520	3837040	But we are just going to look at...
3837040	3839040	We're going to find aliens that look most like us.
3839040	3839520	Why not?
3840240	3842240	Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.
3842240	3842720	Yeah.
3842720	3843440	Yeah.
3843440	3845920	But I think it's really hard to imagine
3845920	3849280	what the space of aliens is because the space is huge.
3849280	3851520	Because one of the arguments that you can make
3851520	3853200	about wildlife emerges in chemistry
3853200	3856400	is because chemistry is the first scale
3856400	3859600	in terms of building up objects from elementary objects.
3861280	3863280	That the number of possible things that could exist
3863280	3866000	is larger than the universe can possibly make all at once, right?
3866000	3869200	So imagine you have two planets
3869200	3871840	and they're cooking some geochemistry.
3871840	3874720	Our planet invented one kind of biochemistry.
3874720	3876960	And presumably as you start building up
3876960	3878800	the complexity of the molecules,
3878880	3881200	the chances of the overlap in those trajectories,
3881200	3883760	those causal chains being built up is probably very low.
3884880	3887600	And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced
3887600	3888960	along its evolutionary path.
3888960	3891840	So I think it's very difficult to imagine predicting
3891840	3893680	the technologies that aliens are going to have.
3894400	3897760	I mean, you're looking at basically planets
3897760	3899520	have kind of convergent chemistry,
3899520	3900720	but there's some variability.
3900720	3902640	And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth
3902640	3904400	into the possibility space for chemistry.
3904400	3907360	So do you think it would detect the technology,
3907360	3910480	the objects created by aliens before we detect the aliens?
3911520	3912240	Possibly.
3912240	3914400	So when you're talking about measuring assembly index,
3915840	3918480	don't you think we would detect the garbage first?
3919120	3921600	Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations,
3921600	3922880	isn't this going to be trash?
3926000	3927920	I think I would come back to Arecibo.
3927920	3930320	The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope
3930320	3933360	built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.
3933360	3934560	How's Arecibo spelled?
3935440	3936960	A-R-E-C-I-B-O.
3936960	3938320	Yes, thank you.
3938320	3939920	And there we go, they got out there.
3939920	3941760	That's the telescope that sent the message
3941760	3942480	that you're talking about.
3942480	3945440	So that message was sent where?
3945440	3948720	It was beamed at a star, a specific star,
3948720	3950960	and it was sent out many years ago.
3952160	3953440	And what they did,
3953440	3955120	so this is why I was pushing on binary,
3955120	3956160	is a binary message.
3956880	3959840	I think it's a semi-prime length number of characters.
3959840	3963840	So I think 27E3 by 23, I think.
3963920	3965520	And it basically represents human bit,
3965520	3969920	proton, binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.
3970480	3972000	And it's really cool.
3972560	3977280	But I'm just wondering if it could be done
3978560	3980640	not making any, because it made assumptions
3980640	3982000	that aliens speak binary.
3982800	3984160	Why make that assumption?
3984160	3986480	Why not just assume that if the difference
3986480	3988480	between physics, chemistry, and biology
3988480	3991760	is the amount of memory that's recordable
3991760	3996800	by the substrates, then surely the universal thing,
3996800	3998720	I'm going to make some sacrilegious statement
3998720	4002320	which I think is pretty awesome for people to argue with.
4002320	4004080	So this is, we're looking at an image
4004640	4009040	where it's the entirety of the message encoded in binary.
4009680	4012080	And then there's probably interpretation
4012080	4013680	of different parts of that image.
4013680	4017840	There's a person, there's green parts.
4017840	4019520	It looks like for people just listening
4019520	4021520	like a game of Tetris.
4022000	4025600	Encoding in minimal ways, a bunch of cool information probably.
4025600	4026640	Representing all of us.
4026640	4028800	So at the top, it's kind of teaching yourself to count
4028800	4029920	and then it all goes all the way down,
4029920	4031680	teaching you chemistry and then just says,
4032240	4033920	but it makes so many assumptions.
4033920	4035920	And I think if we can actually,
4035920	4039120	still look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent
4039120	4040400	in expressing this, but I'll have a go
4040400	4041760	and you can correct it if you want.
4041760	4044800	Which is like, one of the things that Sarah
4044800	4049360	has had a profound effect on the way I look at the origin of life.
4049440	4051520	And this is one of the reasons why we're working together,
4051520	4054080	because we don't really care about the origin of life.
4054080	4057520	We want to make life, make aliens and find aliens,
4057520	4058800	make aliens, find aliens.
4058800	4060640	I think we might have to make aliens in the lab
4060640	4062720	before we find aliens in the universe, right?
4062720	4064480	I think that would be a cool way to do it.
4065360	4068160	So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?
4068160	4071520	Well, it's selection through assembly theory,
4071520	4073520	creating memories, because when you create memories,
4073520	4076960	you can then command your domain,
4076960	4078240	you can basically do stuff.
4078320	4079680	You can command matter.
4080720	4082800	So we need to find a way by understanding
4082800	4085920	what life is of how the minimal way to command matter,
4085920	4087520	how that would emerge in the universe.
4088080	4089840	And if we want to communicate,
4089840	4092480	I mean, maybe we don't want to necessarily uniformly communicate.
4093520	4095200	What I would do, perhaps, if I had,
4095200	4098000	is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth
4098000	4099920	to have this magic way of communicating with aliens,
4099920	4103440	get them quite far away from Earth, plausibly deniable,
4103440	4105520	and then send out the message
4105520	4107120	that would then attract all the aliens,
4107120	4109440	and then basically work out if they're a friend or foe,
4109440	4110400	and how will they want to hang out?
4110400	4112960	The message is being something that has to do with the memories.
4112960	4113680	Yes.
4113680	4116640	Like the assembly version of our SIBO,
4116640	4118240	so that everyone in the universe
4118240	4120160	that has been understands what life is.
4120880	4123120	So aliens need to work out what they are.
4123120	4124720	Once they've worked out what they are,
4124720	4127040	they then can work out how to encode what they are,
4127040	4128560	and then they can go out and send messages.
4128560	4132160	It's like the universal Rosetta Stone
4132800	4135760	for life in the universe is working out
4135760	4136800	how the memories are built.
4136800	4138720	I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well,
4140960	4142240	whether that, you would agree with that?
4142800	4146080	No, I wanted to raise a different point,
4146080	4149360	which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens yet
4149360	4150960	because we haven't gotten the technology.
4151600	4154000	And presumably, we think assembly theory
4154000	4155040	is the right way of doing it,
4155040	4156400	but I don't think that we know how to go
4156400	4157920	from the kind of data you're describing,
4158480	4161200	Lex, like, you know, visual data or smell
4161200	4163440	to construct the assembly spaces yet.
4163440	4165600	And in some ways, I think that the problem
4165600	4168400	of life detection really is the same problem
4168400	4170240	at the foundations of AI,
4170240	4172960	that we don't understand how to get machines
4172960	4176640	to see causal graphs, to see reality in terms of causation.
4177760	4180240	And so I think assembly and AI
4180240	4182320	are going to intersect in interesting ways, hopefully.
4183680	4186000	But the sort of key point,
4186000	4188560	and I've been trying to make this argument more recently,
4189520	4190800	I might write an essay on it,
4190800	4193040	is, you know, people talk about the great filter,
4193040	4195440	right, and which is, again, this like doomsday thing
4195440	4196720	that, you know, people want to say,
4196720	4197680	there's no aliens out there
4197680	4199040	because something terrible happened to them.
4200080	4203760	And it matters whether that's in our past or our future,
4203760	4206320	as to the longevity of our species, presumably,
4206320	4207920	which is why people find it interesting.
4207920	4210640	But I think it's not a physical filter.
4210640	4211840	It's not like things go extinct.
4211840	4212560	I think it's literally,
4212560	4214160	we don't have the technology to see them.
4215520	4216880	And you could see that with microscopes.
4216880	4218560	I mean, we didn't know there were microbes on this table
4218560	4221600	for our tables for thousands of years or telescopes.
4221600	4223360	Like, there's so much of the universe we can't see.
4223360	4225600	And then, basically, what we have done as a species
4225600	4229120	is outsource our physical perceptions to technology,
4229120	4230800	building microscopes based on our eyes,
4231840	4233360	you know, and building size monitors
4233360	4234800	based on our sense of feelings,
4234800	4236160	like feel earthquakes and things.
4236160	4238000	And AI is basically, we're trying to outsource
4238000	4240480	what's actually happening in our thinking apparatus
4240480	4243200	into machines now, into technological devices.
4243200	4244960	And maybe that's the key technology
4244960	4247040	that's going to allow us to see things like us
4247040	4248640	and see the universe in a totally different way.
4248640	4250160	But you kind of mentioned the great filter.
4250160	4252240	Do you think there's a way through technology
4252240	4253920	to stop being able to see stuff?
4253920	4255680	So can you take a step backwards?
4255680	4256400	I think so, yeah.
4256400	4258560	Did you imply that with the great, so like...
4258560	4261040	Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter
4261040	4265360	in the sense that a example of life
4265360	4267360	evolving on a planet over billions of years
4267360	4270880	has to acquire a certain amount of knowledge and technology
4270880	4274480	to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.
4274480	4276720	Well, that's the sense I have is,
4277680	4280080	I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,
4280640	4285200	there's this kind of idea that we have most of the tools
4285200	4287200	already to hear the signal.
4287840	4291680	But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools
4291680	4292640	to see the signal.
4292640	4292800	No, we don't have what we're doing.
4292800	4293600	Yeah, I agree.
4293600	4295680	That's the biggest, like, to hear.
4295680	4297760	We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.
4297760	4297920	Yeah.
4299040	4300080	Aliens are everywhere.
4300080	4300960	We just don't have the...
4300960	4301440	Exactly.
4301440	4304800	Yeah, well, oh, that's...
4304800	4306160	I mean, I got this in part, actually,
4306240	4308080	because you were like, you know, last time I was here,
4308080	4309360	I was like, look at the carpet.
4309360	4311040	You know, could it, like, if you had an alien detector,
4311040	4312480	would the carpet be aliens?
4312480	4313680	I mean, I think we really don't.
4314800	4317440	It would be, but the aliens would nevertheless
4317440	4319600	have a high assembly index or produce things
4319600	4320560	of a high assembly index.
4320560	4321120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4321120	4322880	And those things of a high assembly index,
4324560	4327040	you have to have a detector that can recognize
4327040	4329120	high assembly index in all its forms.
4329120	4330000	Yeah, yes.
4330000	4330800	That's it, that's it.
4330800	4333680	Take data, construct assembly space.
4333680	4335200	Yeah, those patterns, basically.
4335200	4337440	So one way to think about high assembly index
4337440	4341440	is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.
4341440	4343680	I can give you an example, because, I mean,
4343680	4345440	in molecules, we've been talking about in objects,
4345440	4348960	but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.
4348960	4352320	Like, imagine you're just, like, I always get bothered
4352320	4355280	by the fact that, like, when you look at birds flocking,
4355280	4357360	you can describe that with, like, a simple boys model,
4357360	4358800	or, like, you know, people use spin glass
4358800	4360000	to describe animal behavior,
4360000	4362000	and those are, like, really simple physics models.
4362000	4366640	Yet you're looking at a system that you know has agency,
4366640	4368720	and there's intelligence in those birds.
4368720	4371840	And I, and basically, like, you can't help but think
4371840	4374240	there must be some statistical signatures of the fact that
4374240	4377680	they're, that's a group of agents versus, you know,
4377680	4380080	like, I don't know, you know, the physics example,
4380080	4382560	maybe, like, I don't know, brownie emotion or something.
4383520	4385040	And so what we're trying to do is actually apply
4385040	4387040	assembly to trajectory data to try to say
4387040	4389760	there's a minimal amount of causal history
4389840	4392800	to build up certain trajectories for observed agents
4392800	4394560	that's, like, an agency detector for behavior.
4395440	4397200	Do you think it's possible to do some, like,
4397200	4401600	like, Boids or those kinds of things, like, artificial,
4401600	4404880	like, cellular automata play with those ideas
4404880	4408240	with assembly, with assembly theory?
4408240	4410880	Have you found any useful, really simple,
4410880	4415280	mathematical, like, simulation tools
4415280	4417920	that allow you to play with these concepts?
4417920	4420800	So, like, one, of course, you're doing mass spec
4420800	4423280	in this physical space with chemistry,
4424240	4426640	but it just seems, well, I mean, computer science person,
4426640	4428640	maybe, it seems easier to just-
4428640	4429440	I agree with you.
4429440	4433280	And sexier in terms of tweeting visual information
4433280	4438080	on Twitter or Instagram, more importantly, to play,
4438080	4441040	like, here's an organism of a low assembly index
4441040	4443600	and here's an organism of a high assembly index
4443600	4446160	and let's watch them create more and more memories
4446960	4449200	and more and more complex objects.
4449200	4451840	And so, like, in mathematics, you get to observe
4451840	4454240	what that looks like, to build up an intuition
4454240	4455680	what assembly index is like.
4455680	4457760	We are building a toolkit right now,
4457760	4458960	so I think it's a really good idea.
4459520	4462000	But what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed
4462000	4464080	with the infrastructure required.
4464080	4466880	And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information
4466880	4468720	in mathematics, when human beings,
4469360	4471760	when human being, we take a lot of the infrastructure
4471760	4472960	for granted.
4472960	4475040	And I think we have to strip that back a bit
4475040	4475760	for going forward.
4475760	4476720	But you're absolutely right.
4476720	4480400	I would agree that I think the fact that we exist
4480400	4483200	in the universe, this is like, I can see that
4483200	4484960	lots of people would disagree with this statement,
4484960	4488320	but I don't think Sarah will, but I don't know.
4488320	4490320	The fact that objects exist,
4490320	4492640	I don't think anyone on Earth will disagree
4493360	4495120	that objects can exist elsewhere, right?
4495680	4498720	But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.
4498720	4503280	But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition,
4503280	4505840	the universe's ability to acquire memory
4506640	4509200	is the very first step for building life.
4510080	4514000	And that must be, that's so easy to happen.
4514000	4516480	So therefore alien life is everywhere,
4516480	4518000	because all alien life is,
4518720	4522000	is those memories being compressed and minimized
4522000	4524160	and the alien equivalent of the cell working.
4524800	4527680	So I think that we will build new technologies
4527680	4528640	to find aliens.
4529680	4532160	But we need to understand what we are first
4532240	4535120	and how we go from physics to chemistry to biology.
4536480	4538960	The most interesting thing, as you're saying,
4538960	4540080	to take these two organisms,
4540800	4542880	different assemblies, there's one you get into biology.
4543440	4545840	Biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent.
4546480	4548720	Physics is probably, chemistry is less weird,
4548720	4550080	because the rules of chemistry are small
4550080	4550880	and the rules of biology.
4550880	4553760	And then going away to physics where you have a very
4556080	4559520	nicely tangible number of ways of arranging things.
4560160	4563760	And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.
4563760	4564640	And so once we get there,
4564640	4567200	my dream is that we are just going to be able to suddenly are,
4568160	4570480	I mean, I'm, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.
4570480	4571520	I'm not mean to be arrogant.
4571520	4574000	It's just, again, I've got this hammer called assembly
4574000	4575280	and everything's a nail.
4575280	4577280	But I think that once we crack it,
4577280	4578640	we'll be able to use assembly theory
4579200	4580640	plus telescopes to find aliens.
4582320	4585680	Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee
4585680	4588080	on the number of aliens that are out there?
4588880	4590000	Do actually, yeah.
4590000	4590400	Well.
4590400	4591520	And what they look like.
4591520	4593120	So any of the things we've been talking about,
4593120	4598000	is there nuanced, it's always nice to discover
4599760	4603520	wisdom through nuanced disagreement.
4603520	4605840	Yeah, I don't, I don't wholly disagree,
4605840	4608560	but I think, but I do think I disagree.
4608560	4610480	It's kind of, there's nuance there.
4611200	4611760	But, but we need to-
4611760	4612720	You can disagree.
4612720	4613360	No, that's fine.
4614560	4615600	It is nuanced, right?
4615600	4617760	So you made the point earlier that you think,
4618960	4621040	you know, once we discover what alien light,
4621040	4623200	what life is, we'll see alien life everywhere.
4624320	4626240	And I think I agree on some levels in the sense
4626240	4629040	that I think the physics that governs us is universal.
4629040	4631200	But I don't know how far I would go to say,
4631200	4632800	to say that we're a likely phenomena,
4632800	4635840	because we don't understand all of the features
4635840	4637600	of the transition at the origin of life,
4637600	4639600	which we would just say in assembly,
4639600	4642800	as you go from the no memory physics to,
4643280	4645840	there's like a critical transition around the assembly index
4645840	4647520	where assembliness starts to increase.
4647520	4649120	And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere
4649120	4650720	and complexification of the biosphere.
4651600	4653440	So there's a principle of increasing assembliness,
4653440	4655120	where that goes back to what I was saying at the very beginning
4655120	4656720	about the physics of the possible,
4656720	4659440	that the universe basically gets in this mode
4659440	4662560	of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.
4663600	4666880	Now, how often that transition happens,
4666880	4669040	that you get the kind of cascading effect
4669040	4670400	that we get in our biosphere,
4670560	4672000	I think we don't know, if we did,
4672000	4674000	we would know the likelihood of life in the universe.
4674000	4675600	And a lot of people want to say life is common,
4675600	4677040	but I don't think that we can say that yet,
4677040	4678400	so we have the empirical data,
4678400	4679840	which I think you would agree with.
4679840	4683040	But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have,
4683040	4686160	which I don't like, but I did have it,
4686160	4690320	which is, if life emerges on one planet,
4690320	4691920	and you get this real high density of things
4691920	4693200	that can exist on that planet,
4693200	4696400	is it sort of dominating the density of creation
4696400	4698000	that the universe can actually generate?
4698000	4699520	So like if you're thinking about counting,
4700080	4701360	entropy, right?
4701360	4703760	Like the universe has a certain amount of stuff in it,
4703760	4707840	and then assembly is kind of like an entropic principle,
4707840	4708960	it's not entropy.
4708960	4712880	But the idea is that now transformations among stuff
4712880	4716080	or the actual physical histories of things
4716080	4717600	now become things that you have to count
4717600	4720000	as far as saying that these things exist
4720000	4721920	and we're increasing the number of things that exist.
4723840	4725440	And if you think about that cosmologically,
4725440	4727600	maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential
4727600	4728800	of the whole universe, I don't know.
4729760	4731600	How's that, can you explain that a little bit?
4731600	4735440	Why can anyone geographical region suck up
4735440	4737040	the creative capacity of the universe?
4737600	4740160	Just like, I know it's a ridiculous thought.
4740160	4741440	I don't actually agree with it,
4741440	4742320	but it was just a thought experiment.
4742320	4743920	I love that you can have thoughts
4744640	4746880	that you don't like and don't agree with,
4746880	4748960	but you have to think through them anyway.
4748960	4749280	Yeah.
4750480	4751920	The human mind is fascinating.
4751920	4755840	Yeah, I think these sort of counterfactual thought experiments
4755840	4757520	are really good when you're trying to build new theories
4757520	4759840	because you have to think through all the consequences.
4759840	4763600	And there are people that want to try to account for, say,
4763600	4765200	the degrees of freedom on our planet
4765200	4767920	in cosmological inventories of talking
4767920	4769600	about the entropy of the universe
4769600	4772640	and when we're thinking about cosmological era of time
4772640	4773440	and things like that.
4773440	4775360	Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals
4775360	4776080	as they stand now,
4776080	4778160	but assembly would give you a way of counting it.
4778160	4779280	And then the question is,
4779280	4781680	if there's a certain maximal capacity
4781680	4784000	of the universe's speed of generating stuff,
4784000	4785360	which Lee always has this argument
4785440	4787520	that assembly is about time,
4787520	4789200	the universe is generating more states.
4789200	4792880	Really, what it's generating is more assembly possibilities.
4792880	4796000	And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that,
4796000	4798240	that the universe is accelerating its expansion
4798240	4800000	because that makes more physical space.
4800000	4801280	And what's happening on our planet
4801280	4803600	is it's accelerating in the expansion
4803600	4805120	of possible things that exist.
4805120	4807040	And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate
4807040	4809280	of what it can do to generate things.
4809280	4811040	And then if there is a maximal rate,
4811040	4813440	maybe only a certain number of planets can actually do that
4813440	4816080	or there's a trade-off about the piece of growth
4816080	4817440	on certain planets versus others.
4817440	4819120	I have a million questions there.
4819120	4820800	Do you have thoughts on what you're saying?
4820800	4821440	Just a quick, yeah.
4821440	4822160	I'll just say something very quick.
4822160	4822960	It's a thought experiment.
4822960	4823440	No, that's good.
4823440	4824160	I think I get it.
4824160	4824880	I think I get it.
4824880	4826800	So what I want to say is,
4827440	4828960	when I mean aliens everywhere,
4828960	4836080	I mean memories are the prerequisite for aliens
4836080	4838960	via selection and then concentration of selection
4838960	4840320	when selection becomes autonomous.
4840320	4841840	So what I would love to do
4841840	4844160	is to build, say, a magical telescope
4844160	4844960	that was a memory...
4844960	4845520	A magical one.
4845520	4846160	A magical one.
4846160	4846800	A magical one.
4846800	4848000	Sorry, a real one.
4848000	4850800	There will be a memory detector to see selection.
4851360	4853200	So you could get to exoplanets
4853200	4854320	and say that exoplanet looks like
4854320	4856320	there's lots of selection going on there.
4856320	4858640	Maybe there's evolution and maybe there's going to be life.
4858640	4860080	So what I'm trying to say is narrow down
4860080	4861760	the regions of space where you say
4861760	4863840	there's definitely evidence of memory
4863840	4865280	as high assembly there,
4865280	4867040	or not high assembly because that would be life,
4867040	4871120	but where it's capable of happening.
4871120	4874400	And then that would also help us frame the search for aliens.
4874400	4877680	I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to cells
4877680	4878880	and all the other things.
4878880	4880160	I think you're right.
4880160	4883360	But I think that we just need to get more data.
4883360	4884800	Well, I didn't like the thought experiment
4884800	4885920	because I don't like the idea
4885920	4887600	that if the universe has a maximal limit
4887600	4889600	on the amount it can generate per unit time,
4889600	4892320	that our existence is actually precluding the existence of other things.
4892320	4892960	Well, I'll just say one thing.
4892960	4894160	But I think that's probably true anyway
4894160	4895520	because of the resource limitations.
4895520	4897360	So I don't like your thought experiment
4897360	4898400	because I think it's wrong.
4899360	4900000	Well, no, no.
4900000	4901360	I do like the thought experiment.
4901360	4902320	So what you're trying to say is like,
4902320	4904080	there is a chain of events that goes back
4904080	4907520	that's manifestly culminated with life on Earth.
4908160	4909840	And you're not saying that life isn't possible
4909840	4910880	where else where you say that
4910880	4912400	there has been these number of things,
4912400	4913600	contingent things that have happened
4913600	4915520	that have allowed life to merge here.
4916640	4918240	That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere,
4918240	4920400	but you're saying that the intersection of events
4920400	4922320	may be concentrated here.
4925040	4926240	Not exactly.
4926240	4930800	It's more like if you look at, say,
4930800	4932160	the causal graphs are fundamental,
4932160	4934000	maybe space is an emergent property,
4934000	4936560	which is consistent with some proposals in quantum gravity,
4936560	4938480	but also how we talk about things in assembly theory,
4939040	4941680	then the universe is causal graphs generating
4942240	4944080	more structure in causal graphs.
4944080	4946080	So this is how the universe is unfolding.
4946080	4950000	And maybe there's a cap on the rate of generation.
4950000	4952240	Like there's only so much stuff that gets made
4952240	4954560	per update of the universe.
4954560	4956320	And then if there's a lot of stuff being made
4956320	4958400	in a particular region that happens
4958400	4960880	to look the same locally, spatially,
4960880	4963200	that's an after effect of the fact
4963200	4964960	that the whole causal graph is updating.
4967520	4969200	Yeah, I don't know that.
4969200	4970880	I think that doesn't work.
4970880	4971840	I don't think it works either,
4971840	4973600	but I don't have a good argument in my mind about.
4973600	4975840	But I do like the idea of the capacity of the universe
4975840	4977520	because you've got the number of states.
4977520	4978640	Yeah, we can come back to it.
4978640	4980560	Well, let me ask real quick.
4980560	4983760	Why does different local pockets
4984560	4986720	of the universe start remembering stuff?
4987440	4990400	How does memory emerge exactly?
4990400	4995920	So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful.
4995920	4997600	That's when the physicists were happiest,
4997600	5002000	those low memory objects, which is like
5002000	5003760	ultra low memory objects,
5003760	5005600	which is what the definition of stuff.
5006400	5008960	Okay, so how does memory emerge?
5008960	5011760	How does, which is this, how does this,
5011760	5013200	the temporal stickiness?
5014160	5015920	So objects emerge.
5018640	5021920	I'm going to take a very chemo-centric point of view
5021920	5024400	because I can't imagine any other way of doing it.
5024400	5025760	You could think of other ways maybe.
5027280	5033360	But I would say heterogeneity in matter is where the memory,
5033360	5035440	so you must have enough different ways
5035440	5038400	of rearranging matter for there to be a memory.
5038400	5040960	So what that means is if you've got particles colliding in a box,
5041040	5045520	let's just take some elements in a box.
5046880	5050240	Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of ways.
5050240	5051760	So there's a combinatorial explosion
5051760	5055280	of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,
5055280	5056240	bonds being made.
5056960	5059280	Because there's such a large number,
5059280	5062160	the population of different objects that are possible,
5062160	5065040	this goes back to assembly theory where assembly theory,
5065040	5067280	there's four types of universes, right?
5067280	5070800	So you've got basically, and this is what one was up earlier,
5070800	5074320	where one universe where you've just got everything is possible,
5074320	5077360	so you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything.
5077360	5082320	Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial,
5082320	5085840	where you basically have to accrue information in steps.
5085840	5088320	Then you've got assembly observed,
5089120	5091360	and then you've got the object assembly going back.
5091360	5095280	So what I'm trying to say is if you can take atoms and make bonds,
5095280	5098080	let's say you take a nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom,
5098080	5099520	you find an amino acid,
5099520	5100960	then you add another carbon atom on it,
5100960	5102080	in a particular configuration,
5102080	5104160	then another one, all different molecules,
5104160	5106640	they all represent different histories.
5107680	5110160	So I would say for me right now,
5110160	5113200	the most simple route into life seems to be
5113200	5115280	through recording memories and chemistry.
5116000	5118080	But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways
5118080	5120560	and can't be other emergent effects.
5120560	5123600	But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds,
5124160	5129360	and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future.
5129360	5130800	So imagine a box of atoms,
5132400	5134880	and then you combine those atoms in some way.
5134880	5140080	So you make molecule A from load of atoms,
5140080	5144400	and then molecule A can go back to the box and influence the box.
5145920	5149600	Then you make A' or AB or ABC,
5149600	5151040	and that process keeps going,
5151120	5153200	and that's where the memories come from.
5153200	5156320	Is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding?
5157040	5158000	I don't know if it makes any sense.
5158000	5163120	And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level.
5164560	5168800	So the physicists have no, no, like not enough.
5170800	5175520	They're like desperately begging for more freedom
5176720	5180400	and heterogeneous components to play with.
5181840	5182960	That's exactly it.
5182960	5184720	What do you think about that, Sarah?
5184720	5186720	I mentioned already, I think it's significant
5186720	5190080	that whatever physics governs life emerges actually in chemistry.
5190080	5194880	It's not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale.
5194880	5197840	It's in, well, atomic scale chemistry.
5197840	5199440	But like when you get into this,
5199440	5201760	this combinatorial diversity that you get
5201760	5204400	from combining things on the periodic table,
5204400	5207520	that's when selection actually matters
5207520	5208960	or the fact that some things can exist
5208960	5211120	and others can't exist actually starts to matter.
5212000	5215840	So I think of it like you don't study gravity
5215840	5217040	inside the atomic nucleus.
5217040	5219520	You study it in terms of large-scale structure of the universe
5219520	5221200	or black holes or things like that.
5221200	5224240	And whatever we're talking about as physics of information
5224240	5226080	or physics of assembly becomes relevant
5226080	5228000	at a certain scale of reality.
5228000	5231040	And the transition that you're talking about,
5231040	5234240	I would think of as just when you get a sufficient density
5235040	5236720	in terms of the assembly space
5236720	5240560	of the relationship of the overlap and the assembly space,
5240560	5243040	which is a feature of common memory,
5243040	5247440	there is this transition to assembly-dominated physics,
5247440	5248080	whatever that is.
5248800	5250320	Oh, like when we're talking about,
5250320	5252960	and we're trying to map out exactly what that transition looks like.
5252960	5256080	We're pretty sure of some of its features,
5256080	5257520	but we haven't done all of that.
5257520	5259360	Do you think if you were there in the early universe,
5259360	5263040	you would have been able to predict the emergence of chemistry and biology?
5263120	5266800	And I ask that because at this stage as humans,
5266800	5271200	do you think we can possibly predict the length of memory
5271200	5274880	that might be able to be formed later on
5275600	5276880	in this pocket of the universe?
5276880	5282240	Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?
5282800	5284880	I think as much time as you have in the past
5284880	5286720	is how much you can predict in the future
5286720	5289360	because it's actually physical in the system.
5289360	5294880	And you have to have enough time for features of that structure to exist.
5295760	5296800	Wait, let me push back on that.
5297680	5301040	Isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a shortest path
5301040	5303440	that stretches all the way to the beginning,
5304080	5306000	that's building some giant monster?
5306640	5307360	Maybe, yeah.
5308800	5312240	The universe has as much memory as the largest assembly object in the universe.
5313520	5314560	So you can't predict?
5315200	5317440	You can't predict any deeper than that, no.
5317920	5322080	So I guess what I'm saying is what intuition do you have
5322080	5325680	about complexity living in the world that you'd have today?
5329120	5333440	I guess how long does it get more fun?
5334240	5335760	Isn't there going to be at some point,
5335760	5337840	because there's a heat death in the universe,
5337840	5343680	isn't there going to be a point of the highest assembly of object
5343680	5346960	with the highest probability being generated?
5347040	5348480	When is the universe going to be the most fun
5348480	5350160	and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?
5350160	5350640	Exactly.
5351280	5354160	And will you know when you're having the most fun
5354160	5356640	that this is the best time you're in your prime?
5356640	5358000	Are you going to do what everyone does,
5358000	5359840	which is deny that you're in your prime
5359840	5361280	and the best years are still ahead of you?
5362720	5363120	I don't know.
5363120	5364080	What option do you have?
5367440	5371280	I mean, the problem is there's lots of really interesting features here.
5371280	5372960	I just want to mention one thing that might be,
5373520	5376080	is I do think assembly theory applies all the way back
5376080	5377680	to subatomic particles.
5377680	5381280	And I also think that cosmological selection might have been actually,
5381280	5383760	there might have been a, I would say it's a really boring bit,
5383760	5385360	but it's really important for a cosmologist
5385920	5387520	that universes have gone through.
5387520	5389360	Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this?
5389360	5390560	Maybe that there is this,
5390560	5392160	that basically the universe evolves.
5392160	5393680	You've got the wrong constants.
5393680	5394880	We'll start again.
5394880	5396160	And the most productive constants
5396160	5398800	where you can allow particles to form in a certain way,
5398800	5401040	propagate to the next universe, we go again.
5401040	5403120	So actually selection goes all the way back
5403120	5404640	and these are the cycle of universes.
5404640	5406480	And now this universe has been selected
5406480	5410240	because life can occur and it carries on.
5410240	5412320	But I've really butchered that.
5412320	5413200	There is a much more-
5413200	5416720	So this is some aspect where through the selection process,
5417360	5419200	there's parameters that are being fine-tuned
5419200	5420560	and we happen to be living in one
5420560	5422240	where there's some level of fine-tuning.
5422800	5424160	Is there, given that,
5426160	5431200	can you still man the case that we humans are alone in the universe?
5431280	5434880	We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.
5434880	5436240	Yeah, I can, I guess.
5436240	5438320	Sad though, I mean, so from-
5438320	5439200	Is it possible?
5439200	5440800	Yes, it's possible.
5441360	5444080	Let's assume, well, we know.
5445120	5446000	I mean, it's possible.
5447440	5450240	So let me, so okay, so there is a particular
5450880	5453440	set of elements on earth in a particular ratio
5454880	5456560	and the right gravitational constant
5457280	5459680	and the right viscosity, you know,
5459680	5461680	of stuff being at a move around.
5461680	5463760	The right distance from our sun,
5464320	5466400	right number of events where we have a moon,
5467600	5468800	the earth is rotating,
5470720	5473120	the late heavy bombardment produced
5473120	5475200	a lot of, brought in the right stuff.
5476000	5479840	And Mars was cooking up, you know,
5479840	5481360	the right molecules first.
5481360	5483200	So it was habitable before earth.
5483200	5485840	It was literally doing the combinatorial search.
5485840	5489600	And before Mars kind of became unhabitable
5490080	5494000	it seeded earth with the right molecular replicators
5494640	5496320	and there was just the right stuff on earth
5496320	5498960	and that's how the miracle of life occurred.
5500720	5503360	Although I find, I'm very uncomfortable with that
5503360	5508240	because actually, because life came so quickly
5508240	5509280	in the earth's past.
5510720	5515520	But that doesn't mean that life is easy elsewhere.
5515520	5517760	It just might mean that the-
5517760	5520080	Because chemistry is actually not a long-term thing.
5520080	5521200	Chemistry can happen quickly.
5521200	5524080	So maybe going on with the steel manning of the argument
5524080	5526880	to say, actually, the fact that life emerged quickly
5526880	5528240	doesn't mean that life is easy.
5528240	5531680	It just means that the chemistry was right on earth
5531680	5533680	and earth is very special.
5533680	5536320	And that's why there's no life anywhere else in the universe.
5537040	5540800	Yeah. So Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing.
5541600	5544880	So what if that's the reason we're lucky
5544960	5547600	is that we got to have a rare cascading
5548480	5551840	of accelerating cascading effect
5551840	5553760	in terms of the complexity of things.
5554400	5558400	So maybe most of the universe is trying to get sticky
5558400	5561280	with the memory and it's not able to really form it.
5561280	5562960	And then we got really lucky in that.
5562960	5566720	And there's a lot of earth-like conditions, let's say,
5567360	5570960	but you really, really have to get lucky on this.
5571520	5574080	But I'm doing experiments right now.
5574080	5576400	In fact, experiments that Sarah and I are working on
5576400	5578240	because we have some joint funding for this,
5578240	5580720	where we're seeing that the universe can get sticky
5580720	5581360	really quickly.
5581360	5584320	Now, of course, we're being very anthropocentric.
5584320	5585680	We're using laboratory tools.
5585680	5586400	We're using theory.
5586400	5589760	But actually, the phenomena of selection,
5590320	5593360	the process of developing heterogeneity,
5594080	5595040	we can do in the lab.
5595040	5597600	We're just seeing the very first hints of it.
5597600	5601440	And wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin down
5602400	5607520	a bit more precisely becoming good Bayesianists for this,
5607520	5610080	for the origin of life and the emergence of life,
5610080	5611840	defining out what kind of chemistries
5611840	5613120	we really need to look for.
5614400	5615920	And I'm becoming increasingly confident
5615920	5617760	we'll be able to do that in the next few years.
5617760	5620480	Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab
5621360	5624000	from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,
5624000	5625600	from dead stuff, from moon.
5625600	5627920	Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon,
5627920	5631040	put it in our origin of life experiment
5631120	5634000	and make moon life and restrict ourselves
5634000	5636320	to interesting self-replicating stuff
5636320	5637360	that we find on the moon?
5638400	5640560	Sarah, what do you think about this approach
5640560	5643040	of engineering life in order to understand life,
5643600	5645760	so building life in the machine?
5645760	5646240	Yeah.
5646240	5649120	So, I mean, Lee and I are trying right now
5649120	5654720	to build a vision for a large institute
5654720	5657520	or experimental program basically to do this problem.
5657520	5660960	But I think of it as like we need to simulate a planet.
5660960	5662720	So, like the Large Hadron Collider
5662720	5664480	was supposed to be simulating conditions
5664480	5665600	just after the Big Bang.
5666160	5667840	Lee's built a lot of technology in his lab
5667840	5670000	to do these kind of selection engines.
5670000	5672960	But the question you're asking is,
5672960	5674800	how many experiments do you need to run?
5674800	5677520	What volume of chemical space do you need to explore
5677520	5680480	before you actually see an event?
5680480	5681680	And I like to make an analogy
5681680	5683520	to one of my favorite particle physics experiments
5683520	5684800	which is super kamiakande
5684800	5686480	that's looking for the decay of the proton.
5686480	5688880	So, this is something that we predicted theoretically,
5688880	5690560	but we've never observed in our universe.
5691120	5693200	And basically what they're doing is every time
5693200	5695200	they don't see a proton decay event,
5695200	5697600	they have a longer bound on the lifetime of a proton.
5697600	5700640	So, imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind
5700640	5703520	of trying to simulate planetary conditions,
5703520	5704400	physically simulate.
5704400	5706240	You can't simulate original life in the computer.
5706240	5707520	You have to do it in an experiment.
5708320	5710720	Simulate enough planetary conditions
5710720	5712640	to explore the space of what's possible
5712640	5714960	and bound the probability for an original life event.
5714960	5716080	Even if you're not observing it,
5716080	5717440	you can talk about the probability.
5717440	5723200	But we, hopefully, life is not exponentially rare
5723200	5725840	and we would then be able to evolve
5727120	5731680	in an automated system alien life in the lab.
5731680	5732720	And if we can do that,
5732720	5734160	then we understand the physics
5734160	5735360	as well as we understand
5735360	5736880	what we can do in particle accelerators.
5737440	5739920	So, keep expanding physically the simulation,
5740560	5744560	the physical simulation until something happens.
5744560	5746480	Yeah, or just build a big enough volume
5746480	5748320	of chemical experiments and evolve them.
5748320	5750800	So, if they say volume, you mean like literally volume.
5750800	5753120	I mean physical volume in terms of space,
5753120	5754320	but I actually mean volume
5754320	5756160	in terms of the combinatorial space of chemistry.
5757440	5761600	So, how do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,
5761600	5764800	the search space, such that it's always like
5765520	5768000	you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit.
5768000	5770480	Yeah, how do you build a search engine for chemistry?
5770480	5771520	I think you explained it really well.
5771520	5772400	We should carry on doing this.
5772400	5773600	I should pretend the physics,
5773600	5774960	be the physicist, you be the chemist.
5775120	5778720	So, the way to do it is I will always play a joke
5778720	5784560	because I like writing grants to ask for money to do cool stuff.
5785920	5788880	Years ago, I started wanting to build.
5788880	5790560	So, I actually wanted the weather.
5790560	5792800	So, I built this robot in my lab called the computer,
5792800	5795200	which is this robot you can program to do chemistry.
5796640	5799600	Now, I made a programming language for the computer
5799600	5803280	and made it operate chemical equipment.
5804240	5805920	Originally, I wrote grants to say,
5805920	5808240	hey, I want to make an origin of life system.
5809280	5811520	No one would give me any money for this.
5811520	5813440	They said, what's this ridiculous?
5813440	5814400	Why are you wanting to make?
5814400	5815120	Oh, it's really hard.
5815120	5816000	It takes forever.
5816000	5818320	You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway.
5818320	5819520	Why would we give you any money?
5820080	5821840	And so, I turned it around and said,
5821840	5825440	can you instead, can you give me money to make robots,
5825440	5826560	to make molecules?
5826560	5827200	Oh, interesting.
5827200	5828880	And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.
5829520	5833520	And that's, so actually, the funny thing is the computer
5835360	5837040	project, which I have in my lab,
5837040	5838960	which is very briefly, it's just basically,
5838960	5840960	it's like literally an automated test tube.
5840960	5842880	And we've made a programming language for the test tube,
5842880	5843440	which is cool.
5845120	5848560	Has come, has literally came from this.
5848560	5849760	I went to my lab one day and said,
5849760	5852080	I want to make a search engine to get the origin of life
5852080	5853440	because I don't have a planet.
5853440	5856080	And I thought about doing it in a microfluidic format.
5856080	5858240	So microfluidic is very nano chat,
5858240	5860720	very small channels in device where you can basically
5860720	5863840	have all the pipes produced by lithography.
5863840	5865600	And you can have a chamber, maybe say,
5865600	5868400	between say 10 and 100 microns in volume.
5868400	5869920	And we slot them all together like Lego.
5870480	5872720	And we can make an origin of life system.
5872720	5874640	And I could never get it to work.
5875680	5879600	And I realized I had to make do chemistry at the kind of test
5879600	5880240	tube level.
5880960	5883120	And what you want to be able to do,
5883760	5886320	yeah, it goes back to that tweet, 1981.
5886320	5889520	1981, the computer, we're looking at a tweet from Lee.
5890080	5892720	In 1981, the computer was a distant dream.
5893760	5895920	Oh, wow, this is the scientist looking back.
5895920	5899200	It is the young boy who dreamed.
5899200	5904000	In 2018, it was realized, spelled in the British way, realized.
5905520	5907760	Yeah, I'm starting to say it, but not.
5907760	5911120	So now there's a system that does the physical manifestation
5911200	5917040	of whatever the programming language, the spec, tells you to do.
5917040	5919920	Yeah, well, in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.
5920560	5921520	Well, what was the computer?
5921520	5922560	ZX81.
5922560	5924080	ZX81.
5924080	5925920	Sinclair ZX81.
5925920	5927840	It was, and I got a chemistry set.
5929200	5931760	And I like, I like the chemistry set.
5931760	5933280	And I like the computer.
5933280	5934800	And I just wanted to put them together.
5934800	5936960	I thought wouldn't it be cool if I could use the computer
5936960	5938080	to control the chemistry set.
5938800	5940640	And obviously that was insane.
5940640	5944240	And I was like, you know, eight years old, right?
5944240	5946000	Nine years old, going on nine years old.
5946000	5953440	And then I invented the computer just because I wanted to build
5953440	5955600	this origin of life grid, right?
5955600	5958720	Which is like, literally a billion test tubes connected together
5958720	5963280	in real time and real space, basically throwing a chemical dice.
5963280	5964640	Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice.
5964640	5965520	You're going to get lucky.
5966400	5970480	And that's what we, I think Sarah and I have been thinking very deeply about.
5970480	5976960	Because, you know, there's more money being spent on the origin of the gravity
5976960	5979520	or looking at the Higgs boson than the origin of life, right?
5979520	5983680	And the origin of life is the, I think the biggest question,
5983680	5986160	or not the biggest question, it is a big question.
5986160	5986800	Let's put it that way.
5986800	5988000	What is the biggest question?
5988000	5988960	You're okay saying that.
5988960	5990400	Okay, all right.
5990400	5992880	Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life
5992880	5994080	that that's not going to solve?
5995760	5999360	That's not actually going to solve the question of what is life?
6000160	6002560	Like, because you're kind of putting a lot of...
6002560	6003040	I don't think so, yeah.
6003040	6004480	I think that's the same problem.
6004480	6008400	But you're putting, is it possible that you're putting too many,
6009840	6011920	too much bets into this origin part?
6011920	6016320	Maybe the origin thing isn't, isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?
6016320	6017600	Isn't it a stack of turtles?
6017600	6021600	Because then if you create it in the lab, maybe you need some other stuff.
6021600	6022640	Well, that's not the thing about the origin.
6022640	6027120	Like you, like in the lab, there's still memory.
6027120	6028080	Yeah, yes.
6028080	6028480	Right.
6028480	6031600	The experiment is already the product of evolution.
6031600	6032000	Right.
6032000	6034800	And some may be really deep way, not an obvious way,
6034800	6036000	in some very deep way.
6036000	6039520	So maybe the haters are always going to be like,
6039520	6042000	well, you have to reconstruct the fold.
6042000	6042640	They have to build a different score.
6042640	6045280	Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware of that argument.
6046800	6048000	Well, no, I know, I just...
6048000	6049760	We're the one making that argument usually.
6050720	6054320	I just think that if we create life in the lab,
6054320	6059360	it's not obvious that you'll get to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily,
6060720	6062960	what is the line between life and non-life?
6062960	6063520	No, I think so.
6063520	6064880	Look, there's so much here.
6064880	6066240	I'm just saying, playing double.
6066240	6066800	So much here.
6066800	6070320	But let me play doubles back in a previous conversation, right?
6070320	6074240	And say, yeah, I will.
6074240	6074640	Why not?
6074640	6074960	Why not?
6074960	6075280	I've got time.
6075280	6075920	Yeah, let's go.
6075920	6076960	Seller Automata.
6076960	6077280	Yes.
6077280	6083120	Seller Automata, these very simple things where you color squares,
6083920	6086560	black or white, and implement rules and play them in time,
6086560	6090800	and you can get these very complex patterns coming out.
6090800	6091680	There's nice rules.
6091680	6093040	They're true and complete rules.
6094720	6101520	And I would argue that Seller Automata don't really exist on their own.
6101520	6104400	They have to exist in a computing device.
6104880	6107440	If that were there's computing devices, a piece of paper and abstraction,
6107440	6112400	a mathematician drawing a grid, or a framework.
6113520	6118320	Now, so I would argue CAs are beautiful things, simple, going complex,
6118320	6122080	but the complexity is all borrowed from the lithography, the numbers.
6123440	6123760	Right.
6123760	6128960	Now, let's take that same argument with the chemistry experiment origin of life.
6130960	6132400	What you need to be able to do is go out,
6132400	6136880	and I'm inspired to do this, to go out and look for CAs occur in nature.
6137920	6143920	Let's find some CAs that just emerge in our universe.
6144640	6149120	For people just to start to interrupt, for people just listening in general,
6149120	6155040	I think what we're looking at is a Seller Automata, where again, as Lee described,
6155040	6160160	there is just binary black or white squares, and they only have local information,
6160800	6165200	they're born and they die. You would think nothing interesting would emerge,
6165200	6169120	but actually what we're looking at is something that I believe is called glider guns,
6170960	6178000	or a glider gun, which is moving objects in this multi-cell space that look like their organisms,
6178640	6185040	that have much more information, that have much more complexity than the individual building
6185920	6191600	in fact look like they have a long-term memory, while the individual components
6191600	6194960	don't seem like they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.
6194960	6199680	Yes, the argument here is that has to exist on all this layer of infrastructure,
6199680	6203680	right, and though it looks simple, and then what I would make if I were you,
6203680	6208560	say, well, I think CAs are really simple and everywhere, is say, show me how they emerge
6208560	6213920	and substrate. Now, let's go to the origin of life, machine. I don't think we want to do the
6214000	6219280	origin of life, just any origin is good. So we do, so we literally have our sand shaker,
6219280	6223600	shake the sand, like massive grid of chemistry experiments, shaking sand, shaking whatever,
6225200	6228480	and then because we know what we've put in, so we know where, how we've cheated,
6228480	6230800	and the same way with CA, we know how we've cheated, we know what the,
6230800	6233840	we know the number of operations needed, we know how big a grid we want to get this,
6234560	6242320	if we could then say, okay, how can we generate this recipe in the lab and make a life form,
6243280	6248000	what were the, what contingency did we need to put in, and we're up front about how we cheated,
6248640	6253040	okay, say, oh, you had to shake it, it was a periodic, planet rotates,
6254000	6258480	it's tried, comes in and out, so, and then we can start to basically say, okay, how
6259120	6264720	difficult is it for these features to be found, and then we can look for exoplanets and other
6264720	6269280	features, so I think Sarah's absolutely right, we want to explain to people we're cheating,
6269280	6273040	in fact, we have to cheat, no one has given, I'm good at writing grants, I used to be,
6273040	6276720	I'm not very good right now, I keep getting rejected, but writing a grant for a planet
6276720	6281760	in 100 million years, no grant fund there is going to give me that, but maybe money to make a kind
6281760	6289040	of a grid, a computer grid, origin of life, computer grid, in physical space, and just do it.
6289040	6296240	So Sarah said something which is, you can't simulate the origin of life in a computer,
6296240	6304160	so like in simulation, why not? You said it very confidently, so is it possible,
6304960	6308160	and why would it be very difficult? What's your intuition there?
6308800	6313920	I think it's very difficult right now because we don't know the physics, but if you go based on
6313920	6318480	principles of assembly theory and you think every molecule is actually a very large causal graph,
6318480	6322640	not just the molecule, then you have to simulate all the features of those causal graphs, and I
6322640	6326080	think it becomes computationally intractable, you might as well just build the experiment.
6326800	6331360	Because you have, in the physical space, you have all the objects with all the memories,
6332400	6335920	and in a computer you would have to copy them reconstruct.
6337600	6343440	That's a beautiful put, and I would say that lots of people, you just don't have enough
6343440	6349680	resources, it's easier to actually do the physical experiment, because we are literally,
6349760	6353440	I would view the physical experiment almost like a computational experiment,
6353440	6358800	we're just outsourcing, it's just basically we're just outsourcing all the matrix algebra.
6358800	6364800	On your point about the experiment being also an example of life, it's almost like you want to
6364800	6370160	design, it's like, you know, all of us are lineages of propagating information across time,
6370160	6374000	and so everything we do becomes part of life because it's part of that causal chain,
6374000	6378000	so it's like you want to try to pinch off as much as you can of the information from your
6378000	6382640	causal chain that goes into the experiment, but you can't pinch off all of it to move it to like
6382640	6385920	a different timeline, it's always going to be part of your timeline, but at least if you can
6385920	6389840	control how much information you put in, you can try to see how much does that particular
6389840	6395920	trajectory you set up start generating its own assembly, so you know where it starts,
6395920	6400080	and then you want to try to see it take off on its own when you try to pinch it off as much as
6400080	6409840	possible. Got it. Quick pause, bath and break. Yes. All right, cool. And now we're back. All right,
6410880	6415120	we talked about the early days of the universe when there was just stuff and no memory,
6415840	6420480	not even causality, I think Lee at least implied the causality is emergent somehow,
6420480	6428720	we could discuss this. What happened before this all originated? What's outside the universe?
6430480	6437760	Divide by zero. Okay, so it's not relevant, not understandable. Is it useful to even ask the
6437760	6445520	question? No. Because it's so hard? No, it's not hard, it's just not a question. If I can't do an
6445520	6450800	experiment or even think of an experiment, the question doesn't exist. Well, no, you can't think
6450800	6456800	of a lot of experiments, no offense. What I mean is I can't- Because your causality graph is like
6456800	6464720	this is what we've been talking about. It's like there is limits to your ability to construct
6464720	6469440	experiments. I agree, but I was trying to be facetious and I'm trying to make a point because I
6469440	6479360	think that if there is a causal bottleneck through which information can't propagate in principle,
6480000	6485600	then it's very hard to think of an experiment, even in principle, even one that's beyond my
6486160	6492080	mediocre intellect, which is fine. I'm happy to accept that. But this is one of the things I
6492080	6496880	actually do think there was something before the Big Bang because I would say that I think
6496880	6502320	the Big Bang just couldn't occur and create time. Time created the Big Bang. There was time
6502320	6509120	before the Big Bang. Yeah. There was no space, but there was time. Yeah. I'm just making that
6509120	6513440	stuff up just to make all the physicists happy, but I think it's- You think that would make them
6513440	6517920	happy because they would be quite upset, actually. Why would they be upset? Because they would say
6517920	6524000	that time can't exist before the Big Bang. Yeah. I mean, this goes back to an argument that you
6524000	6529120	might not want to have the argument here. I was talking to Sarah earlier today about an argument
6529120	6535920	we had about time a long time ago, a long time and time. I think there is this thing called
6535920	6540240	time or state creation. The universe is creating states and it's outside of space,
6540880	6545200	but they create space. What I mean is you can imagine there are states being created all the
6545200	6551280	time and there is this thing called time. Time is a clock, which you can use to measure when
6551280	6556160	things happen, but that doesn't mean because you can't measure something that states aren't being
6556160	6564800	created. You might locally refer to the Big Bang and the Big Bang occurred at some point
6565440	6569920	in when those states were there. Probably there had to be enough states for the Big Bang to occur.
6572480	6576960	But I think that there is something wrong with our conception of how the universe was created
6576960	6583680	in the Big Bang because we don't really get time because, again, I don't want to become
6583680	6591680	boring and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing. Until I can really explain that
6591680	6596000	more elegantly, I'm just going to get into more trouble. We're going to talk about time because
6597200	6601200	time is a useful measure in device for experiments, but also time is an idea.
6602080	6607120	But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think? Is it a useful question to ask what happened
6607840	6612720	before the Big Bang? Is it a useful question to ask what's outside the universe?
6615040	6620800	I would think about it as the Big Bang is an event that we reconstructed as probably happening
6620800	6625760	in the past of our universe based on current observational data. The way I like to think about
6625760	6635760	it is we exist locally in something called the universe. Going back to the physics of existence,
6635760	6641520	we exist locally in the space of all things that could exist. We can infer certain properties of
6641520	6646000	the structure of where we exist locally. One of the properties that we've inferred in the past
6646000	6652800	is that there is a thing we call the Big Bang. There's some signatures of our local environment
6652800	6660480	that indicate that there was a very low information event that started our universe. I think that's
6660480	6668720	actually just an artifact of the structure of the assembly space that when you start losing
6668720	6674560	all the memory in the objects, it looks like what we call a Big Bang. I think it makes sense to talk
6674560	6680160	about where you are locally. I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities,
6680160	6684640	what could exist outside the universe, in the sense that they become part of our reasoning
6684640	6691600	and therefore part of our causal chain of things that we can do. The multiverse in my mind exists,
6691600	6695360	but it doesn't exist as a multiverse of possibility universe. It exists as an
6695360	6699120	idea in our minds that allows us to reason about how physics works and then to do physics
6699120	6707040	differently because we reason about it that way. I always like to recenter it on things exist,
6707040	6712000	but they don't always exist like we think they exist. When we're thinking about things outside
6712000	6716160	the universe, they absolutely exist because we're thinking about them, but they don't look like
6718160	6720560	the projections in our mind. There's something else.
6720880	6724800	Something you said just gave me an idea to go back to your question. If
6728240	6732080	something caused the Big Bang, if there was some memory or some artifact of that,
6732080	6736560	then of course, to answer your question, it's worth going back to that because that would imply
6736560	6740720	there is something beyond that barrier, that filter. That's what you were saying, I guess.
6741920	6745600	I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe. I just don't think that. I think the most
6745600	6750960	interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more,
6750960	6756960	like that optimism. I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask as being scientific ones because
6756960	6762720	I find that that's where the most creative potential is to impact the future trajectory of
6762720	6767040	what we're doing on this planet. The interesting thing about the Big Bang is basically from our
6767760	6772640	current perspective of what we're able to detect, it's the time when things were forgotten.
6772960	6779440	Yes. It's the time the reset from our limited perspective. The question is,
6779440	6786960	is it useful to ever study the thing that was forgotten? Or should we focus just on the
6786960	6790080	memories that are still there? The point I was trying to make about the experiment
6790080	6794160	is I was trying to say both things. I think perhaps, yes, from the pot following point of view,
6794160	6800080	if you could then imagine what was forgotten and then work forwards, you will have different
6800080	6805440	consequences. Then it becomes testable. As long as we can find tests, then it's definitely worth
6805440	6809440	thinking about. What I don't like is when physicists say, what happened before the Big
6809440	6817120	Bang and before, before, before, without giving me any credible conjecture about how would we
6817120	6822640	know the difference? The way you framed it is quite nice. I like that. It's like, what have we forgotten?
6823440	6828240	Is there a room for God in assembly theory? Who's God?
6829440	6831920	I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.
6832560	6836160	What's a necessary being? Something that has to exist.
6838240	6842080	Oh, I mean, you like the shortest path. Does God need-
6842080	6849760	No, no, no. You can go back to Thomas Aquinas and arguments for the existence of God. I think
6849840	6854800	most of the interesting theological arguments are always about whether something has to exist,
6854800	6859200	or there was a first thing that had to exist. I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those
6859200	6868400	kind of arguments. God here meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff.
6870400	6872480	What I was trying to say earlier is that- Isn't that just the universe?
6872480	6879440	Yeah, yeah. There's a difference between- I imagine a black box, like a machine.
6880480	6883360	Yeah. Then I would be more comfortable calling that God,
6884240	6887600	because it's a machine. You go into a room and there's a thing with a button.
6887600	6889840	Yeah, I don't like the great programmer in the sky version.
6890480	6897280	Yeah, but if it's more kind of- I don't like to think of, if you look at a cellular automata,
6899840	6906160	if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God, that generates a bunch of stuff.
6906160	6913600	But if there's a machine that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,
6913600	6920960	then that feels like God. In terms of terminology. I wonder if there's a machine
6920960	6926000	that's required to generate this universe. That's very important for running this in the lab.
6926720	6930640	So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier that I can't remember the phrase,
6930720	6936000	but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe? Yes. Where does God exist?
6936880	6943760	God at least exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly people who have religious
6943760	6947440	faith they believe in. But let's then take your- But you're talking a little bit more
6947440	6952160	about generics. Say, well, is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God? I would
6952160	6960240	say God did not exist at the beginning, but he or she does now. Because I'm saying the
6960320	6965680	mechanism- Well, you don't know if he didn't exist in the beginning. So this could be us
6965680	6972480	in our minds trying to just listen to gravitational waves, detecting gravitational waves. It's the
6972480	6979120	same thing. Us trying to go back further and further into our memories to try to understand
6979120	6988320	the machines that make up us. And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of
6989200	6995520	what kind of machines could create. There's always a tweet. There's always a tweet.
6996400	7001040	If the universe is a computer, then God must have built it because computers need creators.
7001040	7008480	There you go. And then Yoshibah replied, since there's something rather than nothing,
7008480	7016320	perhaps existence is the default. If existence is the default that many computers exist,
7016400	7021600	creator gods are necessary computers and necessarily computers too. I'm very confused by
7021600	7025680	that. But that's an interesting idea that existence is a default versus non-existence.
7025680	7031200	I agree with that, but the rest is- And then Lee responds, perhaps this reasoning is incomplete.
7032480	7037600	That's how scientists talk trash each other on Twitter apparently. Which part don't you agree with?
7038560	7042800	When he said if existence is a default, then many computers exist. This comes back to the
7042800	7049040	inventor and discovery argument. I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable
7049680	7055440	of computation because there wasn't enough technology, enough states. So what you're
7055440	7061680	saying is if God is a mechanism, so I might actually agree, but then the thing is lots of
7061680	7067600	people see God is more than a mechanism. For me, God could be the causal graph in assembly theory
7067600	7072320	that creates all the stuff that the memories we know. And the fact that we can even relate to
7072320	7077120	each other is because we have the same. We share that heritage and why we love each other or we
7077120	7085440	like to see God in each other is it's just we know we have a shared existence. So if the
7085440	7090560	God is the mechanism that created this whole thing, I think a lot of people see God in a
7090560	7098080	religious sense as that mechanism also being able to communicate with the objects it creates.
7098080	7103520	And if it's just the mechanism, we won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates.
7103520	7110960	It can only interact with the... Well, there's versions of God that create the universe and then
7110960	7120000	left. Yeah, like spark. For some religions. The first spark. Yeah, but I think I liked your analogy
7120000	7128800	of the machine and the rules. But I think part of the problem is we have this conception that we
7128800	7133440	can disentangle the rules from the physical substrate and that's the whole thing about software
7133440	7138480	and hardware being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws that they exist outside the universe.
7138480	7141360	They're not actually a feature of the universe. They don't have to merge out of the universe
7141360	7148480	itself. So I think if you merged your two views, then it gets back to the God as the universe.
7148480	7152160	And then I think the deeper question is why does it seem like there's meaning and purpose?
7152800	7158000	And if I think about the features of the universe that give it the most meaning and purpose, those
7158000	7162560	are what we would call the living components of the universe. So if you wanted to say,
7162560	7166560	God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an emergent property of our minds,
7166560	7172480	but I would just say the way the universe creates meaning and purpose, there is really a physics
7172480	7177040	there. It's not like a illusory thing and that is just what the physics of life is.
7177840	7184160	So is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?
7185520	7192400	So basically, whatever God is that mechanism, we just leave parts of that behind.
7192400	7196800	But the universe is constantly generating itself. So if God is that mechanism, it would be that
7196800	7205040	that would still be active today. I'm agnostic, but if I would call the things I believe in God
7205040	7212160	in the way that some people talk about God, I would say that God is like in the universe now.
7212160	7219120	It's not an absent thing. So I think there's a mislabeling here, because you're, I mean,
7220640	7228800	I mean, I'm a professional idiot, actually. But you should put that on your CV.
7230800	7234720	Professionally, not recreationally or amateur, but professionally.
7234800	7239360	I think so. I would say if you were talking about God, I mean, again, I'm way out,
7239360	7243760	way out of my depth here, and I'm almost feeling, you know, I feel quite uncomfortable articulating,
7243760	7249200	but I'll try. For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness of reasoning entity that
7249200	7256080	actually has causal power. And you're human like intelligence. And so you're like,
7256080	7260000	then you're saying like gravity could be God or time could be God. I mean, I think for me,
7260960	7266080	for my conception of time is probably as fundamental as God, because it gave rise to human
7266080	7270160	intelligence and consciousness in which we can have this abstract notion of God.
7271920	7279360	So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very mechanistic kind of unsophisticated sense,
7279360	7282480	whereas other people say that God is more sophisticated and got all this, you know,
7282480	7288480	feelings and love and, you know, and this abstracting ability. So is that what,
7288560	7294080	or do you mean that? Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that decided to flick the universe
7294080	7304640	into existence? Well, one of the features that God would have is the ability to flick the universe
7304640	7312080	into existence. I, you know, like Windows 95, I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP
7312160	7318000	or Windows 10. I don't know the full feature set. Okay. So the very least you have to flick
7318000	7325040	the universe into existence. And then other features might include ability to interact with
7325040	7331360	that universe in interesting ways. And then how do you interact with the universe in interesting
7331360	7336320	ways? You have to be able to speak the language of its different components. So in order to interact
7336320	7345920	with humans, you have to know how to act human like. So, so I don't, I don't know.
7348800	7358240	But it seems like whatever mechanism created the universe might want to also generate
7359120	7364000	local pockets of mechanisms that can interact with that. Like, inject.
7365040	7369600	God was lonely. Yeah, it was long. I mean, it could be just a teenager and another
7370480	7374400	just playing a video game. Yeah, maybe. Well, I was going to say, I mean, I, I don't,
7374400	7379040	so this is referring to our origin of life engine. It's like, I, I don't believe in God,
7379040	7383440	but that doesn't mean I don't want to be one. Right. Because I want to make a universe and
7383440	7387440	make a life form. But that maybe, that may be rude to people who have, you know,
7387440	7389440	dear religious beliefs. What I mean by that is,
7391200	7397280	isn't it, if we are able to create an entirely new life form, different chemistry, different culture,
7399440	7403120	what does it make up and makes us good? By that definition, it makes us gods, right?
7403120	7407360	Well, there is. I mean, like when you have children, you're like one of the magical
7407360	7410320	things of that is your kind of mini gods. I mean, first of all,
7411280	7414480	from a child's perspective, parents are gods for quite a while.
7415840	7420160	And then you, I mean, they're, in the positive sense, there's a magic to that. That's why I love
7420160	7424240	robotics, is you instill life into something. And that makes you,
7426960	7431520	feel God like, you know, sort of positive way. Being a creator is a positive thing.
7431520	7435360	A creator. Yeah, exactly. And a small scale. And then God is, would be
7436080	7442800	a creator at the largest possible scale, I suppose. Okay. You mentioned offline the
7442800	7445920	Assembletron. Assembletron?
7445920	7447360	Assembletron. Yep.
7448400	7452160	What's an assembly? These are the, this is an early idea of something you're thinking about.
7452800	7456240	So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team are interested in
7458000	7463600	using AI to understand life. My team is, and I'm, and I'm wondering if we could apply the
7463600	7469680	principles of assembly theory, that is, the causal structure that you get with assembly theory,
7469680	7476800	and hybridize it and make a new type of neuron, if you like. I mean, there are causal neural
7476800	7481840	networks out there, but they are, they are not quite the architecture, like what I would like.
7481840	7487520	I would like to associate memory bits with, basically, I'd like to make a,
7487520	7493760	rather than having an ASIC for neural networks, I want to make an ASIC for assembly networks.
7494320	7501680	Right. And so can you say that again, assembly networks? So what, what is a,
7501680	7507360	sort of like a thing with an input and output? And it's like a neural network type of thing.
7507360	7509680	What does it do exactly? What's the input? What's the output?
7509680	7513600	So in this case, so if you're talking about a general neural network, I mean,
7513680	7517680	general neural network, you can train it on also any sort of data, right,
7517680	7525200	depending on the framework, whether it's like text or, or image data or whatnot.
7525840	7531440	And that's fine. But there's no causal structure associated with that data. Now,
7531440	7535440	just imagine, rather than, you know, let's say we're in a classified difference between cat and
7535440	7540400	the dog, right, classic cat and dog neural network. What about if the system understood
7540400	7548080	the assembly space to create the cat and the dog? And rather than guessing what was happening and
7548080	7554640	training on those images and not understanding those features, it, it, you almost like you could
7554640	7560880	imagine doing a, going back a step and doing an, and training, going back a step and doing a training,
7560880	7565840	going back a step, back a step, back a step. And, and I wonder if that is actually the origin of
7565840	7571680	intelligence or how we'll crack intelligence, because we need to, because we'll, we'll create
7571680	7578640	the entire graph of events and, and be able to kind of look at cause and effect across those
7578640	7583680	graphs. I'm explaining it really badly, but it's a, it's a gene of an idea. And I'm guessing
7583680	7587920	very smart, very rich people in AI already doing this.
7589360	7594960	Trying to not generate cats and dogs, but trying to generate things of high assembly index.
7595040	7601360	Yeah. And I think, I think, and, and, and also using causal graphs in neural networks and machine
7601360	7605200	learning and deep learning, maybe building a new architecture. I'm just wondering,
7605200	7608720	is there something we can get out of assembly theory allows us to rebuild
7608720	7615040	current machine learning architectures to give more, give causation more cheaply? I mean,
7615040	7618720	I don't know if that's what you're, we've been inventing this for a little while, but we're
7618720	7621440	trying to finish the theory paper first before we do anything else.
7621440	7627200	Yeah. You also want to have, say, goal directed behavior in neural networks. Then assembly theory
7627200	7630880	is a good framework for doing that. Daniel's been thinking about that a lot. And I think it's a
7630880	7637040	really interesting idea that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn to think about
7637040	7641280	goal directed behavior as a learning process, that you're learning a specific goal. The
7641280	7645120	universe is learning a goal when it generates a particular structure and that you can map that
7645120	7649680	physical structure in a neural network. How, what's the goal?
7651760	7658320	Well, in a neural network, you're designing the goal in, in biology. I mean, you know,
7658320	7661680	people are not supposed to use teleological language in biology, which is ridiculous,
7661680	7668720	but because goals are real things, they're just post-selected. So you can talk about goals after
7668720	7674640	the fact. You know, once a goal emerges in the universe, that physical entity has a goal.
7674640	7679520	But Lee and I came up with a test for, like a Turing test for goal directed behavior
7680320	7683920	based on the idea of assembly. Like, we have to formalize it still, but I would like to write
7683920	7689360	a paper on it. But like, the basic idea is like, if you, like, if you had two systems that were
7689360	7695920	completely equivalent, you know, like in the instantaneous, like physical experimental setup,
7695920	7700160	so Lee has to figure out how to do this. But there was something that would be different in their
7700160	7705200	future. And there was a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility,
7705200	7709680	that future outcome, then you could say that that system had some representation of, of,
7709680	7715120	of some kind of goal in mind about what it wanted to do in the future. And I, so, so goals are
7715120	7720480	interesting because they don't exist as instantaneous things. They exist across time, which is one,
7720480	7726480	one of the reasons that assembly theories may be more naturally able to account for the existence
7726480	7734080	of goals. So goals are the only existent time, or they manifest themselves in time
7735120	7743120	through, you said, symmetry breaking. So it's almost like, imagine, like, if representations in
7743120	7749200	your mind are real, right? And you can imagine future possibilities, but imagine everything
7749200	7754320	else is physically equivalent. And the only thing that you actually change your decision based on
7754320	7760080	is what you model as being the future outcome. Then somehow that representation in your mind
7760080	7764320	of the future outcome becomes causal to what you're doing now. So it's kind of like retrocausal effect.
7764320	7769120	But it's not actually retrocausal. It's just that your, your assembly space is actually
7769760	7773600	includes those possibilities as, as part of the structure. It's just you're not observing all
7773600	7777600	the features, the assembly space in the current moment. Well, the possibilities exist, but they
7777600	7784160	don't become a goal until they realize. So, so one of the features of assembly space that's
7784160	7789760	super interesting, and it's easier to envision with like Legos, for example, is if you're thinking
7789760	7794000	about an assembly space, you can't observe the entire assembly space in any instant in time. So
7794000	7798560	if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you want to look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos,
7798560	7802800	you have to break the Legos apart. And then you look, and then you look at all the possible
7802880	7807520	ways of building up the original object. So now you have in your mind the goal of building
7807520	7812240	that object, and you have all the possible ways of doing it. And those are actual physical features
7812240	7816960	of that object, but that object doesn't always exist. What exists is the possibility of generating
7816960	7822720	it. And the possibilities are always infinite. Well, for that particular object, you know,
7822720	7826720	like, you know, it has a well-defined assembly space. And I guess what I'm saying is that
7826720	7832320	object is the assembly space, but you actually have to unpack that object across time to view that
7832320	7839600	feature of it. It's only an observable across time. The term goal is such a important and
7839600	7845680	difficult to explain concept, right? Because what you want is a way is like, I think only conscious
7845680	7852720	beings can have conscious goals. Everything else is doing selection. And but selection does
7852720	7859520	invent goals. And in a way that the way that biology reinterprets the past in the present
7860240	7866240	is kind of helps you to understand there was a goal in the past now, right? It's kind of like
7866240	7874720	goals only exist back in time. So first of all, only conscious beings can have
7875760	7882720	conscious goals. I'm not even going to touch that one. Why? Go for it. Come on.
7883280	7890960	The line between conscious goals and non-conscious goals, exactly. And also maybe just on top of that,
7890960	7898960	you said a touring test for goal-directed behavior. What is a touring test potentially look like?
7898960	7902800	So if you've got two objects, we were thinking about this. So we actually got some funding to
7902800	7907600	work together on two teams. So I'm trying to do, and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory
7907600	7911520	and Sarah is teaching me a bit of theory. And Sarah is trying to design experiments and I'm
7911520	7916560	teaching experiments. Because I think it's really good for us to have that. So say, when would a,
7917920	7921120	so that's good. I like this, this, I'm sure we use the Dan Dennett essay.
7921840	7926240	Yeah. And I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a touring test after, but yeah. So Dan
7926240	7931600	Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and free will inflation.
7932640	7933840	The title is so brilliant.
7933840	7935520	It's the actual title. I think so.
7935520	7938000	Herding cats and free will inflation.
7938000	7940640	Yeah. Something like that. I mean, it's not maybe not. And so,
7940640	7941440	No, I think that's right.
7941440	7944640	So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hillside.
7945600	7950000	Okay. And it just happens to be a snowy hill. And let's just say you see an object go rolling
7950000	7955600	down the hill. Or you, you, you, you, and the rock will go rolls downhill. The start goes to the end.
7956560	7960160	How do you know objects had a goal? Now you unveil the object and you'll see it's actually
7960160	7966640	a skier. And the skier starts at the top and goes down the bottom. Great. Then you look at the rock.
7966640	7970320	Rock rolls down the hill and gets the bottom. How can you tell the difference between the two?
7971200	7975440	So, and what Dan says is like, well, this, it's clear the skiers in control
7976240	7980480	and the, and because they're adjusting the trajectory system updating going on.
7980480	7983520	Then the only way you can really do that is you have to put the skier back to the top of the hill
7983520	7988720	again. They tend to start roughly in the same space and probably go to take all that complex
7988720	7992880	set of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same finish point, right? With plus or minus
7992880	7997360	few meters. Whereas if it's just a random rock going down to random trajectory, that wouldn't
7997360	8002240	happen. And so what Sarah and I were kind of doing when we were writing this grant, we're like,
8002240	8009040	we need to somehow instantiate the skier and the rock in the experiment and then say, okay,
8009040	8014480	when is the object, when it, so for an object to have a goal, it has to have an update, it has to
8014480	8021440	have some sensing and some kind of, you know, inbuilt actuation to respond to the environment.
8021440	8026160	And, and then we just have to iterate on that. And maybe Sarah, you can influence the cheering
8026160	8030720	test part. Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was slightly different. So I get really
8030720	8035440	frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most people do. You know, a lot of people are,
8036080	8041120	which is not necessarily related to, to free will directly or to this goal directed behavior. But I
8041120	8046880	think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics here. But I think for me, I was, you know,
8046960	8051520	everybody's always interested in explaining intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic
8051520	8056240	experience. And there's all sorts of problems with that. Because you can never actually be
8056240	8059360	another physical system. So you can't know what it's like to be another physical system.
8060320	8064960	So I always thought there must be some way of getting at this problem about if an agent or an
8064960	8069920	entity is conscious, or at least has internal representations. And those are real physical
8069920	8078160	things that there, it must have causal consequences. So the way I would ask the question of consciousness
8078160	8082960	is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically? But if, if things have intrinsic experience,
8083600	8088160	is there any observable difference from the outside about the kind of causation that that
8088160	8092960	physical system would enact in? And for me, the most interesting thing that humans do is have
8092960	8098080	imaginations. So like we can imagine rocket centuries before we build them, they become real
8098080	8102400	physical things because we imagine them. And people might disentangle that from conscious
8102400	8106880	experience. But I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do is actually a conscious process.
8106880	8113680	So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems, and I said, one had an internal
8113680	8118480	representation, which is slightly different than a conscious experience, obviously. So I'm entangling
8118480	8124720	some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought experiments. Then how, and I, and I set them up
8124720	8130800	in a physically equivalent situation, would it be the case that there would be
8132480	8137360	experimental observables associated with it? And that, that became the idea of trying to
8137360	8141840	actually measure for internal representation and consciousness. So Turing basically didn't want
8141840	8145920	to do that. You just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior,
8145920	8151760	but never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that. And I guess
8151840	8156720	I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually test for
8156720	8162720	that? For the imagination that led to the. That there was something internal going on,
8162720	8169520	some kind of inner world, as people say, but I, or you could say, you know, like it actually is an
8169520	8174800	agent, it's making decisions, it has an internal representation. And whether you say that's
8174800	8179360	experience or not is a different thing. But at least the feature that there's some abstraction
8179360	8183120	it's doing, that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrates.
8183120	8186480	Do you think it's possible to do that kind of thing? One of the compelling things about the
8186480	8192800	Turing test is that, you know, defining intelligent, defining any complicated concept as,
8194720	8200400	as a thing, like observing it from the surface and not caring about what's going on deep inside,
8200400	8206320	because how do you know? That's the point. So the idea is exactly that. So what we're trying to do,
8206320	8211040	the Turing test for goal directiveness is literally take some objects that clearly don't
8211040	8215200	have an internal representation, grains of sand blowing on the beach or something, right?
8215760	8221200	And I know a crab wandering around on the beach. And then generating an experiment where we
8221200	8226320	literally the experiment generates an entity that literally has no internal representation
8226320	8230800	to sand, like a drop, these are oil droplets, actually, what got in mind, a robot that makes
8230800	8235360	oil droplets. But then what we want to try and do is train the oil droplets to be like crabs.
8236000	8241840	Give them an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information from the
8241840	8249840	environment. So they understand, they remember the past, are in the present, and can imagine a
8249840	8255680	future and a very limited way they're kind of game engine, their limited simulation of the world
8256240	8259280	allows them to then make a decision. Your objects across time.
8260240	8264560	So then you would run a bunch of crabs, like over and over and over and over.
8264560	8265680	How many crabs, Lee?
8267440	8272560	Because you have to have a large number of crabs. What does your theory say? Is there a mathematical?
8272560	8274160	We're working on it. I mean, this is literally-
8274160	8275760	Limit, crab limit.
8275760	8276960	There's literally a-
8276960	8277520	Excellent.
8277520	8278560	There's literally-
8278560	8281840	What's the herding cats have to do? Oh, that's random. Wait, what's cats?
8282480	8286400	In the title by Daniel Dennett, Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation.
8287600	8290800	What does herding cats mean? What does free will inflation mean?
8291280	8296640	I love this essay, because it explained to me how I could live in a deterministic universe,
8298560	8306720	but have- not free will, but have freedom, you know, and also helped me explain that
8308080	8310800	time needed to be a real thing in this universe.
8310800	8316640	So what basically Dan was saying here is like, these cats appear to just do what they want,
8317520	8322560	right? And if you live in a deterministic universe, why do the cats do these things?
8323120	8324800	You know, aren't they just- isn't this all obvious?
8326160	8328640	And how does free will inflate the universe?
8328640	8333680	And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay because my interpretation of the essay
8333680	8341520	in assembly theory makes complete sense, because you need an expanding universe in assembly theory
8342320	8348960	to create novelty that you search for that then when you find something interesting
8348960	8352080	and you keep doing it because it's cool and it gives you an advantage,
8353200	8355360	then it appears in the past to be a goal.
8355360	8359520	So what does in assembly theory, the expansion of the universe look like?
8360640	8366480	What are we- what are we talking about? Why is- why- why does the expansion of the universe
8366480	8369600	give you more possibilities of novelty and cool stuff?
8370320	8374080	So for me, I don't think about the universe in terms of big bang in space.
8374080	8378960	I think about in terms of the big- the big memory expansion that you have one- you only have the
8378960	8382800	ability to store one bit of information, so then you can't do very much.
8382800	8388000	So what the universe has been doing since the- since forever, it's been creating more-
8388880	8390880	it's been increasing the size of its RAM.
8392560	8397440	Okay? So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte, three megabyte, four megabytes all the way up.
8397440	8403360	And so the more RAM you have, the more you can remember about the past,
8404160	8407040	then which allows you to do cooler things in the future.
8407040	8411600	So if you can remember how to launch a rocket, then you might be able to imagine how to land a
8411600	8417520	rocket and then relaunch, re-land and carry on because- and so the- the- the- you able- you're
8417520	8420960	able to expand the space and remember the past.
8420960	8423520	And so that's why I think it's very important.
8423520	8427360	But not a perfect memory. It's- it's a- it's an interesting question whether
8427360	8429600	there's some forgetting that happens and might increase.
8430400	8437040	Is the expansion of the forgetting at some point accelerate faster than the- the remembering?
8437040	8441120	I think that that's a very important thing that probably intelligence does and we're going to
8441120	8444960	learn and machine learning about because you want machine learning right now or- or artificial
8444960	8450160	intelligence right now doesn't have memory right, but you want the ability to- or not for- if you
8450160	8455360	want to get to human-like consciousness, you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff
8455360	8459440	and then to selectively forget stuff so you can re-remember it and compress it.
8459440	8462000	Arguably the way that we come up with new physical laws-
8462000	8463120	Do currency.
8463120	8465360	Yeah, like- yeah, sorry, you were-
8465360	8467040	No, no, sorry, no, I just wanted to-
8467040	8475840	I- I think that there is a- a great deal to be gained from having the ability to remember things,
8475840	8480640	but then when you forget them, you can then have a- you can basically do the simulation again
8480640	8485200	and work out if you get to that compressed representation so that it's in cycles.
8485200	8491200	So cycles of memory- remembering and- and forgetting are probably important, but there
8491200	8494320	shouldn't be excuse to have a met- universe of no memory in it.
8494320	8497840	The universe is going to remember that it forgot, but just not tell you.
8500240	8504640	I'm- I'm looking at the- this paper and it's talking about a puppet controlling a puppet
8505200	8508160	controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet controlling a puppet
8508160	8510560	conceptually easy to understand, but physically impossible.
8510560	8511600	It's physically impossible.
8511600	8513520	It's predicting a fair coin toss.
8513520	8517520	I don't know what he's talking about, but there's pictures of puppets controlling puppets.
8518480	8523840	Let me ask you- there's a- there's a few things I want to ask, but we brought up time quite a bit.
8524640	8526720	You guys tweet about time quite a bit.
8528960	8530640	What is time in all of this?
8530640	8531920	We kind of mentioned it a bunch.
8533360	8536800	Is it not important at all in terms of- is it just a word?
8536800	8538800	Should we be talking about causality mostly?
8538800	8544080	Like Sarah, what do you think is- we've talked about like memories.
8544080	8548400	Is that the fundamental thing that we should be thinking about and- and time is just a useful
8548400	8550480	measurement device or something like that?
8550480	8552320	Well, there's different concepts of time, right?
8552320	8555760	So I think in assembly theory, when we're talking about time, we're talking about the ordering of
8555760	8558160	things. So that's the causal graph part.
8558160	8562080	And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a certain ordering
8562640	8564560	and certain things can't happen until other things happen.
8564560	8569760	But usually when we colloquially talk about time, we're talking about the flow of time.
8571360	8573840	And I guess Lee and I were actually debating about this this morning.
8573840	8578800	So in talking on it, walking on the river here, which is a very lovely spot for talking about time,
8579920	8583840	but that the- you know, that when the universe is updating, it's transitioning between
8584800	8586800	things that exist now and things that exist now.
8589120	8590960	That's really the flow of time.
8591600	8595600	So there's- there's- you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.
8595600	8599200	And then there's also an arrow of time that people talk about in physics,
8599200	8602720	which is that time doesn't appear to have a directionality in fundamental physics,
8602720	8605040	but it does to us, right?
8605040	8606720	Like we can't go backwards in time.
8606720	8609760	And usually we- you know, that would be explained in physics in terms of,
8610480	8612000	well, there's a cosmological arrow of time,
8612000	8614720	but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time of increasing entropy.
8615920	8619200	But what we would say in assembly theory is that there is a clear directionality.
8619200	8621920	The universe only runs in one direction, which is why some things-
8621920	8625360	it's easy to make- if the universe runs in one direction,
8625360	8627520	it's easy to make processes look reversible.
8627520	8630880	For example, if they have no memory, they're easy to run forward and backwards,
8630880	8634080	which is why the laws of physics that we have now look the way they do,
8634080	8636480	because they involve objects that have no memory.
8636480	8640480	But when you get to things like us, it becomes very clear that the universe has a directionality
8640480	8641360	associated to it.
8641440	8642960	So it's not reversible at all.
8642960	8646240	It's the no man ever steps in the same river.
8646240	8648320	I just have to bring that up because you won't go on the river.
8648320	8651040	No man has ever steps in the same river twice,
8651040	8653440	for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.
8654240	8656160	So it's not reversible, any of the same.
8656160	8659360	No, no, but reversibility is an emergent property, right?
8659360	8662000	So we think of the reversibility of laws as being fundamental
8662000	8663840	and the irreversibility as being emergent.
8663840	8666800	But I think what we would say from how we think about it,
8666800	8669520	and certainly it's easy to get the case for our perception of time,
8669520	8672400	but also what's happening in biological evolution,
8673360	8677120	you can make things reversible, but it requires work to do it.
8677120	8680400	And it requires certain machines to run it forward and backward.
8680400	8682640	And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas
8682640	8684480	on a constructor theory related to that,
8684480	8685920	which is a totally different set of ideas.
8685920	8689600	So you can travel back in time sometimes.
8689600	8694000	Yes, you can't travel actually back in time,
8694000	8697840	but you could reconstruct things that have existed in the past.
8697840	8700640	You're always moving forward in time, but you can cycle through.
8701760	8703360	Can I clarify what you just said?
8703360	8706160	Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back?
8706160	8706960	Yes.
8706960	8709040	Thank you, that really clarified it.
8709040	8712400	What Sarah is saying is you don't go back in time,
8712400	8715840	you recreate what happened in the past, in the future, and inspect it again.
8715840	8719040	So in that local pocket of time, it's as if you travel back in time.
8719040	8722160	So how's that not traveling back in time?
8722160	8724720	Because you're not going back to your same self, back in time.
8724720	8727200	You're creating that in the future.
8727200	8729040	What else is the same as it was in the past?
8729520	8731440	No, no, no, no.
8731440	8732640	It's not in registry.
8732640	8734080	I mean, it goes back to the big question.
8734080	8738400	I'm saying, I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today
8738400	8742000	when we first had this discussion and I was talking to Sarah on Skype.
8742000	8745840	And I said, by the way, time is the fundamental thing in the universe.
8745840	8747360	She almost hung up on me.
8747360	8750960	Right, but you can even, I mean, if you want to make an analogy to computation,
8750960	8752880	and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this,
8752880	8756960	like about reversible computation and reversible Turing machines,
8756960	8760560	in order to make it reversible, you have to store memory to run the process backwards.
8761200	8763760	So time is always running forward in that.
8764480	8766560	So you can't erase the memory.
8766560	8771200	You can erase the memory, but the point, when you go back to zero, right?
8771200	8777280	But the whole point is that in order to have a process that even runs in both directions,
8777280	8781600	you have to start talking about memory to store the information to run it backwards.
8781600	8782080	I got it.
8782080	8786880	So you can't really then, you can't have it exactly how it was in the past.
8786880	8788000	Yeah, exactly.
8788000	8790880	So you have extra stuff, extra baggage always.
8790880	8793280	A really important thing I want to say on this,
8793280	8798240	I think if I try and get it right, I just say that if you can think that the universe is expanding
8798240	8804080	in terms of the number of boxes that it has to store states, right?
8805200	8808880	And this is where the directionality of the universe comes from, everything comes from.
8808880	8813840	You could erase what's in those boxes, but the fact you've now got so many boxes at time
8813840	8818000	now in this present, there's more of those boxes than there were in the past.
8818000	8820160	But the boxes aren't physical boxes.
8821440	8823360	It's not space or time.
8823360	8825680	Why is the number of boxes always expanding?
8825680	8828960	It's very hard to imagine this because we live in space.
8829520	8836480	So what I'm saying, which is I think probably correct, is that we just let's just imagine for
8836480	8842480	a second, there is a non-local situation, but there are these things called states
8843360	8850320	and that the universe, irrespective of whether you measure anything, there is a universal,
8850320	8852720	let's call it a clock or a state creator.
8853360	8857840	Maybe we can call it, that's why maybe you can call it God, but let's call it a state creator
8857840	8860880	where the universe is expanding and the number of states it has.
8861520	8863200	Why are you saying it's expanding though?
8863200	8864560	Is that obvious that it's expanding?
8864640	8868000	It's obvious because that's where the, because we...
8868960	8870240	That's a source of novelty.
8870240	8874800	It's a source of novelty and it also explains why the universe is not predictable.
8875840	8876960	I didn't know it's not predictable.
8876960	8877600	Well, it's...
8877600	8879120	I just like interrupting him.
8879120	8881360	Sorry, it's fun because you're struggling.
8881360	8886480	I'm struggling because I'm trying to be as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm insane.
8887600	8888560	And I'm not insane.
8888560	8890240	It's obvious because you...
8891040	8898800	I'm a chemist, so as a chemist I grew into the world understanding irreversibility.
8899360	8900880	Irreversibility is all I knew.
8901920	8907200	And when people start telling me the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick.
8907200	8908480	We can use time to do it.
8908480	8917440	So what I mean is the second law is really the magical.
8918480	8919920	But why does it need to be magical?
8919920	8921440	The universe is just asymmetric.
8921440	8924560	All I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric in the state production.
8925280	8930320	And we can erase those states, but we just have more computational power.
8930320	8935440	So what I'm saying is that the universe is deterministic horizon.
8935440	8937840	This is one of the reasons we can't live in a simulation, by the way.
8939360	8940000	The irreversibility.
8940000	8941040	You can't live in a simulation.
8941040	8942400	The irreversibility.
8942400	8942880	Yeah, yeah.
8942880	8946560	So basically every time you try and simulate the universe in this, you know,
8946560	8949040	I live in a simulation, the universe is expanded in states.
8949040	8951360	Like, oh, damn it, I need to make my computer bigger again.
8951360	8954480	And every time you try and contain the universe in the computation,
8954480	8956560	because it's got bigger in number of states.
8956560	8962720	And so I'm saying the fact the universe has novelty in it is going to turn out
8962720	8969520	experimentally to be proof that time, as I've labeled it, is fundamental
8970160	8973920	and exists as a physical thing that creates space.
8974880	8978800	Okay, so if you can prove that novelty is always being created,
8979520	8983920	you're saying that it's possible to also then prove that it's always expanding
8983920	8985360	in the state space.
8985360	8988080	Those are things that have to be proven.
8988080	8989920	That's what working experiments for, yeah.
8989920	8993440	And you're trying to, like by looking at the sliver of reality,
8994240	8996320	show that there's always novelty being generated.
8996320	9001680	Yeah, because if we go live in a universe that the conventional physicist would live in,
9001680	9004240	it's a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists.
9004960	9012160	I want to prove that that book doesn't exist, it's continuously being added pages on.
9012160	9015280	So what I'm saying, if the universe is a book, we started,
9015280	9019760	the universe at the beginning only had no pages or had one page, another page, another page,
9019760	9022400	whereas the physicists would now say all the pages exist,
9022400	9024640	and we could in principle access them.
9024640	9027120	I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.
9027120	9029200	Do you know what's written in this book?
9029200	9030240	The free will question.
9032160	9040640	Is there room for free will in this view of the universe is generating novelty
9040640	9046000	and getting greater and greater assembly structures built, Sarah?
9046800	9047040	Yes.
9048000	9048880	Okay.
9048880	9049120	Done.
9049840	9050400	Next question.
9050960	9052960	Why, what's the source of free will in this?
9052960	9057440	Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will, but...
9058240	9058640	Yeah.
9058640	9059280	Well, please.
9060480	9065520	I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is,
9066640	9069840	do we have individual autonomy and agency?
9070480	9075200	And when I do things, is it really me or is it my atoms that did it?
9076480	9079120	And that's the part that's interesting to me.
9079120	9081920	I guess there's also the determinism versus randomness part.
9082880	9090240	But the way I think about it is each of us are a thread or an assembly space through
9091200	9093520	this giant possibility space.
9093520	9097680	And it's like we're moving on our own trajectory through that space,
9097680	9099520	and that is defined by our history.
9099520	9101920	So we're causally contingent on our past,
9102480	9108960	but also because of the intersection of novelty generation,
9108960	9111280	it's not completely predetermined by the past.
9112080	9117840	And so then you have the causal control of the determinism part,
9117840	9121440	that you are your causal history and there's some determinism from that past,
9121440	9124320	but there's also room for creativity.
9124320	9128640	And I think it's actually necessary that something like free will exist
9128640	9131280	if the universe is going to be as creative as possible.
9131280	9137280	Because if I were all intelligent being, inventing a universe,
9138000	9142400	and I wanted it to have maximal number of interesting things happen,
9142400	9144640	again, we should come up with the metric of interesting.
9145440	9153680	But generating maximal possibilities, then I would want the agents to have free will
9153680	9157920	because it means that they're more individual.
9159520	9162320	Each entity actually is a different causal force in the universe.
9163280	9166480	And it's intrinsic and local property of that system.
9166560	9169760	There's a greater number of distributed agents.
9170320	9173520	Like are you always creating more and more individuality?
9174560	9178880	Kind of. I would say you're creating more causal power, but...
9178880	9181600	So causal power, the word consciousness,
9181600	9185120	is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?
9185120	9187680	I mean, that's why I have this conception of consciousness
9187680	9189040	being related to imagination.
9189040	9191200	Because the more that we can imagine can happen.
9191200	9194640	And the more counterfactual possibilities you have in mind,
9194640	9196240	the more you can actually implement.
9196240	9200000	And somehow free will is also at the intersection of the counterfactual becoming the actual.
9201360	9205760	So can you elaborate on that a little bit, that consciousness is imagination?
9205760	9207600	I don't know exactly how to articulate it.
9207600	9211280	And I'm sure people will take aim at certain things I'm saying,
9211280	9213040	but I think the language is really imprecise.
9213040	9214800	So I'm not the best way to...
9214800	9216240	It's really interesting.
9216240	9222880	Like what is imagination and what role does it play in the human experience,
9222880	9224560	in the experience of any agent?
9225280	9226320	I love imagination.
9226320	9229360	I think it's like the most amazing thing we do.
9229360	9231360	But I guess one way I would think about it is,
9231360	9234960	we talked about the transition to life being the universe acquiring memory.
9234960	9236560	And life does something really interesting.
9236560	9238560	Just think about biology generally.
9238560	9241920	It remembers states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future.
9241920	9244640	So the longer life has evolved on this planet,
9244640	9246560	the deeper that past is, the more memory we have,
9246560	9248720	the more kinds of organisms and things.
9248720	9252640	But what human level intelligence has done is quite different.
9252640	9256880	It's not just that we remember states that the universe has existed in before,
9256880	9259520	it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed,
9259520	9262480	and we can actually make them come into existence.
9262480	9266400	And I think that's the most unique feature about the transition
9266400	9270160	to whatever we are from what life on this planet has been doing
9270160	9271920	for the last four billion years.
9271920	9274800	And I think it's deeply related to the phenomena we call consciousness.
9274800	9276240	Yeah, I was going to just agree with that.
9276240	9280320	I think that consciousness is the ability to generate those counterfactuals.
9280320	9283040	Now, whether you can say, you know, are there degrees of consciousness?
9283040	9289920	I mean, I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals,
9289920	9293360	although they do have some kind of, they are able to search a space and pathways.
9293360	9299520	But I think that there is a very concrete, or concrete,
9299520	9303040	there's a very specific property that humans have.
9303040	9305040	And I don't know if it's unique to humans.
9305040	9308880	I mean, maybe dogs can do it and birds can do it, right?
9308880	9311600	And where they are basically solving a problem,
9311600	9316320	because consciousness was invented, or this abstraction was invented by evolution
9316320	9317840	for a specific reason.
9319200	9322960	And so, look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion
9322960	9330080	that time was fundamental was actually because Sarah and I had a completely different...
9330080	9332400	The most heated debate on Skype chat ever.
9332400	9333760	No, no, no, no, we had to...
9333760	9334960	And which topic?
9334960	9337520	No, it goes back to the free will thing.
9337520	9339040	So I think the...
9339040	9342800	Although I've changed my view a bit because there's some really interesting physicists out there
9342800	9348080	who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space...
9348080	9350320	I don't want to go there just now because I think I'll mess it up.
9350320	9354720	But briefly, I could not see how the universe...
9354720	9355920	How we could have free will.
9355920	9358160	And I mean, this is really boring because this is like...
9358160	9360080	This is a well trodden path, but I'll...
9360080	9361680	But I'm not so boring.
9361680	9362560	I suppose it's kind of...
9362560	9363440	We just want to be precise.
9364000	9366880	If the universe is deterministic, how can we have free will?
9368000	9370080	So Sarah's a physicist.
9370960	9372480	I think she believe...
9372480	9377760	Not believe can show that most of the laws we have are deterministic to some degree,
9377760	9380160	quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.
9380160	9382320	And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will.
9382320	9386800	I'm like, your belief system is broken here, right?
9386800	9391200	Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic universe.
9392160	9399200	And then I realized that I agreed with her that I do think that free will is a thing
9399200	9401360	because we are able to search for novelty.
9401360	9403840	And then that's where I came to the conclusion that time
9403840	9406320	the universe was expanding in terms of novelty.
9406320	9408880	And it goes back to that Darren Dennett essay that we're talking about,
9408880	9410480	the free will inflation.
9411760	9413520	So you have...
9413520	9414320	So the past...
9415520	9416800	It did not exist in the past.
9416800	9418640	The past exists in the present.
9418640	9421520	What I mean is there was no past.
9421520	9422560	There is only present.
9423440	9425120	So that means you are the sum total.
9425120	9428880	Everything that occurs in the past is manifestly here in the present.
9429600	9433360	And then you have this little echo state in your consciousness
9433360	9438080	because you're able to imagine something without actualization.
9438080	9441600	But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons and potassium
9441600	9444560	iron flows in your neural network, in your brain.
9444560	9446320	Maybe consciousness is just the present.
9447200	9452000	So somehow you imagine that and then by imagining, oh, that's good.
9453120	9456240	I'm going to make a robot do this thing and program it.
9456240	9458000	And then you physically then go and do it.
9458960	9460800	So that changes the future.
9460800	9461120	Sorry.
9462000	9462960	What's imagination?
9464080	9465920	Does it require the past?
9465920	9467600	Does it require the future?
9467600	9468800	Does it require memory?
9468800	9469200	Does it...
9469760	9470640	So imagination...
9471200	9473040	Does it only exist in the moment?
9473040	9474240	So imagination is...
9474880	9479120	Well, yeah, probably it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on.
9479120	9483520	You can maybe your subconscious brain has been generating all the bits for it.
9483520	9489920	But no, imagination occurs when you, in your game engine, you remember the past
9489920	9494320	and you integrate sensory the present and you try and work out what you want to do in the future.
9494320	9495440	And then you go and make that happen.
9496000	9497760	So the imagination is this...
9497760	9501520	It's like asking what imagination is about asking what surfing is.
9502320	9506240	You can surfboard, surf a wave coming in.
9506240	9511120	When you're on that wave and you're surfing, that's where the imagination is.
9511120	9516000	I think imagination is just accessing things that aren't the present moment in the present moment.
9516000	9521600	So I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the table and I can imagine the river and things
9521600	9522560	or whatever it was.
9523200	9530000	And so it seems to be that it's our ability to access things that aren't present.
9530080	9537280	But to conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin to something that happened to you recently.
9537280	9540640	Right, but they don't have to be things that actually happened in your past.
9540640	9542480	And I think this gets back to assembly theory.
9542480	9547200	Like the way I would think about imagination from an assembly theoretic standpoint is I'm
9547200	9553760	a giant causal graph and I exist in a present moment as a particular configuration of Sarah.
9554160	9556720	But there's a lot of...
9556720	9558480	I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage.
9558480	9562240	I have that whole causal history and I can access parts of it.
9562240	9566080	Now, when you talk about getting to something as complex as us, having as large an assembly
9566080	9567840	space as us, there's ways of...
9568480	9573440	Like there's a lot of things in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed
9573440	9577120	in the past history of the universe because like the universe got big enough to contain
9577840	9580320	the three of us in this room in time.
9580960	9588400	But not all the features of each one of us individually have come into existence as physical
9588400	9590320	objects we would recognize as individual objects.
9590320	9595360	This goes back to your point that we actually have to explain why things actually even look
9595360	9598320	like objects and aren't just a smear of mass.
9600720	9603920	And just on the free will and physics thing, when you were talking...
9603920	9607120	I just want to bring this up because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint that
9607200	9612080	Nicholas Jisen has that we want to use the laws of physics and then say you can't have
9612080	9612560	free will.
9612560	9617040	And his point is you have to have free will in order to even choose to set up an experiment
9617040	9618160	to test the laws of physics.
9618160	9622400	So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental than physics is because to even
9622400	9628240	do science, there's some assumption that the agents have free will.
9628240	9634080	And I always thought it was really perplexing that physics wants to remove agency because
9634080	9637520	the idea that I could do an experiment here on this part of earth and then I can move
9637520	9642400	somewhere else and prepare an identically prepared experiment, run an experiment again
9643040	9647120	seems to imply something about the structure of our universe that is not encoded in the laws
9647120	9648400	that we're testing in those experiments.
9649760	9653520	So this kind of dream of physics that you can do multiple experiments, different locations
9653520	9658560	and then validate each other, you're saying that's an illusion?
9659120	9663440	No, I'm saying that requires decision making and free will to be a real thing, I think.
9664640	9669040	I think the fact that we can do science is not arbitrary and I think people,
9669840	9673280	the standard canon in physics would be, well, you could trace all of that back to the initial
9673280	9677600	condition of the universe, but the whole point of science is I can imagine doing the experiment
9677600	9679600	and I can do it and then I can do it again and again and again.
9680560	9686480	To your imagination, somehow fundamentally generative of novelty, so it's not like the
9686480	9688560	universe could have predicted the things you imagined.
9690080	9693360	So coming back to novelty, I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,
9693440	9695680	but it supercharges it. It's another transition, I think.
9697520	9700640	I mean, this may be a boring statement, but I would say the fact that, sorry?
9700640	9702640	I'm not sure. These are hard questions.
9702640	9706320	Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist is yet another proof that
9707360	9709840	time is fundamental and novelty exists, right?
9710400	9714480	Because I think, again, if you ask the physicists to write down the infinite
9714480	9721520	Bible of the universe, let's call it the Bible, the mathematical universe,
9721520	9724720	whether you're on Max Teckmark or Sean Carroll or Frank Wilczek
9728320	9730320	or Stephen Wolfram, okay?
9731280	9732160	I like that book.
9732160	9734400	Yeah, I love it too. There's lots of pretty pictures.
9735040	9739760	It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity of the universe by saying, well,
9739760	9742000	it's all there mathematics, it all exists, right?
9742000	9746800	And I would say that that's why I'm excited about the future of the universe because it,
9747760	9755200	although it is somehow dependent upon the past, it is not constrained just by the past,
9756560	9757920	which is kind of mad.
9758560	9762400	Yeah, that's what free will is. It's not constrained by the past.
9762400	9766320	It's dependent on the past. This moment, it's not just dependent.
9766320	9772800	This moment is the past, and yet it has the capacity to generate a totally unpredictable future.
9772800	9776240	I mean, the other thing I would say is super important for human beings, right?
9776320	9779840	Human beings have actually very little cause or control in the future.
9780560	9782000	I realize this the other week.
9782000	9783360	Oh, then we have future in the future.
9783360	9786160	Yeah, yeah. So what happened? So this is what I think it is.
9786160	9791280	The way, by reinterpreting your past, I mean, talk about from a kind of cognitive,
9791280	9797120	psychological cognitive point of view, by reinterpreting your past in your current mind,
9797840	9800480	you can actually help you shape your future again.
9801120	9806720	So you, but you have much more freedom to interpret your past, to act in the present,
9806720	9810160	to change your future than you do to change your future. I may sound weird,
9810160	9813760	so I'm saying to everybody, imagine your past, think about your past,
9813760	9819200	reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can, then imagine what you can do next,
9819200	9821840	or imagine your past in a more negative way and what you do next.
9821840	9824400	And look at those two counterfactuals, they're different.
9824960	9827040	Yeah, it's fast. I mean, Daniel Kahneman talks about this,
9827040	9830960	that most of our life is lived in our memories. And it's interesting because you can
9830960	9836240	essentially, in imagination, choose the life you live. So maybe free will exists in imagination.
9837520	9843600	Choices are made in your imagination. And that results in you basically able to control
9843600	9850000	how the future unfolds. Because you're like, imagining, like reinterpreting constantly,
9850000	9851360	the things that happen to you.
9851360	9855200	Exactly. So if you want to increase your amount of free will,
9855200	9858560	those people that have most, I don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency,
9858560	9865920	because of our sad constraints, whether you know, happenstance, health, economic,
9866640	9873040	born in a certain place, right? But those of us that have the ability to go back and
9873040	9880880	reinterpret our past, and use that to change the future, are the ones that exert most agency
9880880	9887920	in the present. And I want to achieve higher degrees of agency and enable
9887920	9891840	everyone else to do that as well, to have more fun in the universe.
9891840	9894320	Then we'll hit that peak, maximum fun point.
9894320	9897280	I don't think there's ever going to be a maximum, I think it's,
9897280	9899840	the wonderful thing about the future is there's always going to be more fun.
9900400	9905440	Yeah, you, I think, again, go back to Twitter, I think,
9905440	9909760	you lead tweeted something about being a life maximalist that you want to maximize the number
9909760	9915920	of life, the amount of life in the universe. So, and, you know, that's the more general
9916640	9921520	version of that goal is to maximize the amount of fun in the universe, because life is a subset
9921520	9926240	of fun. They're all kinds of, I suppose they're either correlated or exactly equal, I don't know.
9926960	9930640	Anyway, speaking of fun, let me ask you about alien sightings.
9932160	9935040	So there's been quite a bit of UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff.
9935040	9946240	What do you think would be the first time when humans sight aliens, see aliens in a sort of
9946880	9952400	unquestionable way, this extremely strong and arguable way
9954160	9960960	we've made contact with aliens, Sarah, what would it look like? Obviously, the space of
9960960	9967120	possibility is huge here, but if you were to kind of look into the future, what would that look like?
9967120	9975040	Would it be inklings of UFOs here and there that slowly unravel the mystery, or would it be like
9975040	9982400	an obvious overwhelming signal? So I think we have an obsession with making contact with events.
9983040	9988800	So what do I mean by that is, you know, like people have a UFO sighting, they make contact.
9989440	9996880	And I always think, you know, what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now is not
9996880	10001760	that I have a disbelief about what people are experiencing or feeling, but like the discussion
10001760	10008080	right now is sort of at the level of modern mythology. Aliens are our mythos in modern
10008080	10015040	culture. And when you treat it like that, then I want to think about when do things that we
10015120	10019760	traditionally only regularize through mythology actually become things that become standard
10019760	10024480	knowledge? So, you know, like it used to be, you know, variations in the climate were described
10024480	10028480	by some kind of gods or something. And now it's like, you know, our technology picks up an anomaly
10028480	10034160	or someone sees something, we say it's aliens. And I think the real thing is it's not contact with
10034160	10039920	events, but like first contact is actually contact with knowledge of the phenomena or the explanation.
10039920	10045840	And so this is very subtle and very abstract, but when does it become something that we actually
10045840	10049840	understand what it is that we're talking about? That's first contact. It's not-
10049840	10055040	Would you make the myth, would you give credit to the myth, the mythology as first contact?
10055600	10059680	Because you- I think yes, I think it's the rudimentary that we have some understanding
10059680	10063200	that there's a phenomena that we have to understand and regularize. So I think-
10063200	10065520	Right, to understand that there is weather. Yes.
10065520	10068400	You have to construct a pathology on that weather. Yes.
10068400	10074640	It's something that's controllable. I see mythology basically as like baby knowledge.
10076160	10082480	It could be that, you know, although there's lots of alien sight, so-called alien sightings,
10082480	10085520	right? So there are a number of things you can do. You could just dismiss them and say they're
10085520	10089600	not true. They're kind of made up. Or you say, well, there's something interesting here, right?
10089600	10093600	We keep seeing a commonality, right? We see the same phenomena again and again and again.
10094240	10098000	Also, there's this interesting thing about human imagination. Even if they are-
10098960	10105600	Let's not say made up, but misappropriated kind of other inputs. The fact that human consciousness
10105600	10110800	is capable of imagining in contact with aliens, does that not tell us about something about
10110800	10113520	where we are in our position, in our culture, in our technology?
10113520	10115360	It tells us not where in time we are.
10115360	10119680	Could it be that we're making contact with- Let's say that- So let's say,
10119680	10123520	let's take the most miserable version. There are no aliens in the universe. Life is only on earth.
10124560	10128480	That then, the interpretation of that is we're desperate to kind of understand why we're the
10128480	10132720	only life in the universe, right? The other one is the other most extreme is that aliens are visiting
10132720	10137360	all the time and we just, you know, we're just not able to capture them coherently. Or there's a
10137360	10142720	big conspiracy and, you know, there's an area 51 and there are lizards everywhere and there's that.
10143920	10148720	Or I'm kind of in favor of the idea that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea that we aren't
10148720	10154240	alone in the universe and we're just running the simulation and we're seeing some evidence.
10154240	10158960	You know, we don't know what life is yet. We do have some anomalies out there.
10159680	10167680	We can't explain everything. And over time, you know, we will start to unpack that.
10168560	10172960	One very plausible thing we might do, which might be boring for the average alien
10172960	10179600	observer or believes that aliens are, as in intelligent aliens are visiting earth,
10179600	10184800	it could be that we might go to the outer solar system and find a new type of life that has
10184800	10189840	completely new chemistry. Bring these cells back to earth where you could say in my hand,
10189840	10195920	on earth, here's RNA, DNA and proteins and look, cells self-replicating from Titan.
10195920	10200560	We have this new set of molecules, new set of cells and we feed it stuff and it grows.
10201360	10208640	That for me, if we were able to do that, which would be like the most, that would be my UFO
10208640	10212640	sign. That's a good test. So you feed it and it grows. Yeah.
10214480	10222560	We've made, so not until you know how to feed the thing and it grows somehow.
10222560	10226000	We can make a comic book, you know, the tiger that came for tea, the alien that came for tea.
10226720	10234640	What would you say is between the two of you is the biggest disagreement about alien life out there?
10235760	10241840	Is it from the basic framework of thinking about what is life to maybe what aliens look like,
10241840	10246560	to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings? What would you think?
10247200	10252800	So I would say the biggest one is that the emergence of life does not have to be
10253360	10259680	that it can't just happen once on the planet, that it could be two or more life forms present
10259680	10264240	on the planet at once. And I think Sarah doesn't agree with that. I think that's like
10265040	10271120	logically inconsistent. That's really polite. I'm really saying it's nonsense because you think.
10271120	10275280	Oh, likely is that. So the idea that what does it look like? Let's imagine
10276880	10281200	two alien civilizations co-existing on a planet. What's that look like exactly?
10281200	10285360	So I would say, I think I've got to get around your argument.
10286160	10291040	Yeah, let's say that on this planet, there's just like, there's lots of available chemistry
10291680	10298800	and one life form emerges based on carbon and interacts and there's an ecosystem based on carbon
10298800	10305120	and there's an orthogonal. And so it's planetary phenomena, which is what you I think, right?
10305120	10310320	But there's also one that goes on silicon. And because there's enough energy and there's enough
10311040	10315360	stuff that these life forms might not actually necessarily compete
10316560	10320640	evolutionarily. Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all because they're going to be
10320640	10323680	co-constructing each other's causal chains. I think that's what you just got me.
10325200	10330080	So there's no overlap in terms of their causal chains or very limited overlap.
10330080	10334000	Yeah. So I think the only way I can get away with that is to say, right, life could emerge on a planet
10334080	10338640	underneath. The lizard people under the crust of the earth.
10338640	10344800	I think, I think, let's go, I think, but look, as you can see, we disagree. So,
10344800	10350160	and I think Sarah actually has convinced me because of the life is a planetary phenomenon,
10350160	10355600	the emotional life is a planetary phenomena. And actually, because of the way evolution
10355600	10360480	selection works, then nothing occurs in isolation, the causal chains interact. So there is a common,
10360480	10362480	there's a consensus model for life on the earth.
10362480	10368240	But you don't think you can place aliens from elsewhere onto the, can't you just
10369360	10372240	place multiple alien civilizations on one planet?
10372240	10377840	Right. But I think, so you can take two original life events that were independent
10377840	10381520	and commingle them. But I don't think when you're talking about,
10383360	10389280	when you look at the interaction of that structure, it's like the same idea as like
10389360	10393600	an experiment being an example of life, right? That's a really abstract and subtle concept.
10393600	10398880	And I guess what I'm saying is life is information propagating through matter. So once you start
10398880	10406000	having things interacting, they, in some sense, commingle and they become part of the same chain.
10406880	10409840	This is, the commingling starts quickly. Yeah.
10409840	10412320	It proceeds, we proceed to commingle quickly.
10412320	10417600	Right, right. So you, you could say, so the question is then, the more interesting question
10417840	10421760	is, are there two distinct origins events? And I still think that there's reasons that
10421760	10426880	on a single planet, you would have one origins event because of the time scales of cycling,
10427520	10432480	of geochemistry on a planet. And also the fact that I don't think that the origin of life happens
10432480	10437120	in a pool and like radiates outward through evolutionary processes. I think it's a multi-scale
10437120	10441520	phenomenon happens at the level of individual molecules interacting, collections of molecules
10441520	10447920	interacting in entire planetary scale cycles. So life as we know it has always been multi-scale.
10447920	10453120	And there's, I'm brilliant examples of individual mutations at the genome level changing global
10453120	10458560	climate, right? So there's a tight coupling between things that happen at, you know,
10458560	10464080	the largest scale of our planetary scale and the smallest scale that life mediates.
10464080	10469680	But it still might be difficult within something you will call as a single civil alien civilization,
10469680	10472800	you know, different, there's species and stuff. But I think what, yeah,
10472800	10476560	they can't, might not be able to communicate. But you're asking about life, not species, right?
10476560	10484480	So what's the difference between one living civilization? This is almost like a category
10484480	10490800	question versus species, because it can be very different. The way evolution, because there's
10490800	10495600	like island, like literally islands that you can involve different kinds of turtles and stuff.
10495760	10503520	Yeah. So I guess what I'm saying is, if you look at the structure of two interacting living
10503520	10509760	things, populations, and you look in their past and they have independent origins for their causal
10509760	10514800	chain, then you would say one was alien, you know, they have different independent origins events.
10514800	10519040	But if you look at their future by virtue of the fact they're interacting, their causal chains have
10519040	10526960	become commingled so that then in the future, they are not independent, right? So that's why
10526960	10532400	you would even define them as aliens. So the structure across time is two examples of life
10532400	10536080	become one example of life because life is the entire structure across time.
10536080	10539280	Right. But there could be a lot of variation with this.
10539280	10544640	Yeah. So the question we're all interested in is how many independent origins of a
10545200	10547840	complexifying causal chain are there in the universe?
10549120	10557760	But the idea of origin is easy for you to define because like when the two, when the
10557760	10566160	species split in the evolutionary process, and you get like a dolphin versus a human
10566160	10570400	or Neanderthal versus Homo sapiens, isn't there?
10570400	10576720	They make a distinction here quickly. So I think, sorry to interrupt. What we're saying,
10576720	10581120	I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, Sarah, we won that argument because I think she's right,
10581120	10585440	that once the causal chains interact and going forward. So we're talking about a number of
10585440	10589440	things. Let's go all the way back before origin of life, origin of life on Earth,
10590320	10594400	chemistry emerges. So there's all these, I would say there's probably mechanistically,
10595200	10599520	the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way to get replicators, the ribosome kind of
10600400	10602880	was really rubbish at the beginning. And he just competed, competed, competed,
10602880	10607280	got better and better ribosome. And suddenly that was a technology. The ribosome is the
10607280	10613600	technology that way, boom, allowed evolution to start. So what I was trying to, why I interrupted
10613600	10620240	you is say that once evolution has started using that technology, then you can speciate.
10620240	10624960	And I was trying to, and I think what Sarah said was convinced me of, because I was like,
10624960	10628400	no, we can have lots of different chemistry, shadow, biosphere on Earth. And she's like,
10628400	10635360	no, no, no, you have to have this, you have to get to this minimum evolutionary machine.
10636160	10640400	And then when that occurs, speciation occurs, exactly what it's like dolphins, humans,
10641360	10647680	everything on Earth. But when you're looking at aliens or alien life, there's not going to be
10647680	10651600	two different types of chemistry, because they compete, they compete and interact and cooperate
10651600	10655440	because the causal chains overlap, one might kill the other, one might combine with the other,
10655440	10660720	and then you go on, and then you have this kind of this average, and sure, there might be
10660720	10665520	respeciation. It might be have two types of emerging chemistry. It almost looks like the
10665520	10672400	original life on Earth required two different pre-life forms, the peptide world and the RNA world,
10672400	10677840	somehow they got together. And by combining, you got the ribosome. And that was the minimum
10677840	10684480	competent entity for evolution. And would all alien civilizations have an evolutionary process?
10685440	10690400	On a planet. So like, that's one of the almost, it's almost the definition of life,
10690400	10693840	to create all those memories, you have to have something.
10693840	10695280	Things have to change in time.
10695280	10695680	Yeah.
10695680	10697120	But there has to be selection.
10699520	10702160	That's like an efficient, there's no other way to do it.
10702160	10704880	No. Well, never say never, because soon I'll say that.
10704880	10708880	That's the part that depresses me though, going back to like, I don't know, the earlier
10708880	10713440	discussion on violence and things, like, and I don't know where somebody was tweeting about
10713440	10718080	this recently, but like, you know, how much stuff had to die. Maybe it was you.
10719040	10719280	Yeah.
10719280	10728400	Yeah. So we were talking about life. And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.
10728400	10732080	Right. So selection means things had to be weeded out, right?
10732080	10732480	So.
10732480	10735360	Well, we can celebrate that. Death makes way for a tool.
10735360	10740160	Yeah. I mean, and also, you know, one of the most interesting features of major extinction
10740160	10745840	events in the history of our planet is how much novelty emerged immediately after, right?
10745840	10749520	So, and of course, you know, a lot of people make arguments, we wouldn't be here if the dinosaurs
10749520	10756480	didn't go extinct. So in some ways, we can attribute our existence to all of that.
10756480	10761600	But I guess I was just wondering sort of like, if I was going to build a universe myself,
10762560	10764960	in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature?
10764960	10765920	But it does seem to be a universe.
10765920	10769200	I think you have to. I mean, I think we're probably being over
10770160	10773760	anthropomorphizing. I remember watching the blue, I think it was the blue planet,
10773760	10776400	David Attenborough was showing these seals and because of climate change,
10776400	10779760	some seals were falling off a cliff and how tragic that was. I was like,
10780400	10784240	I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool. Look at the, those ones down there,
10784240	10787920	they've obviously got some kind of mutations, some and they're not doing that dark thing.
10787920	10794640	And so that poor gene will be weeded out. Of course, at the individual level, it looks tragic.
10794640	10797760	And of course, as human beings have the ability to abstract and we empathize,
10797760	10801360	we don't want to cause suffering on other human beings. And we should retain that.
10801360	10807520	But we shouldn't look back in time and say, you know, how many butterflies had to die?
10808320	10814080	I remember making, how many, if you think about the caterpillar, become the chrysalis,
10814080	10818720	and then the butterfly getting out, how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering,
10818720	10822800	if that process of pruning had not occurred, we have no butterflies.
10822800	10826640	So none of the butterfly beauty in the world without all that pruning.
10826640	10831680	So pruning is required, but we shouldn't anthropomorphize and feel sorry for the biological
10831680	10836800	entities. Because that's, that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.
10836800	10842480	What we should do is project forward and maybe think about what values we have across our species
10842480	10847200	and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings. You know, you know, now that we know that animals
10847200	10853040	suffer at some level, think about humane farming. When we find that plants can in fact,
10853040	10858480	are conscious and can think and have prane, then we'll do humane gardening.
10858480	10866240	Until that point, we won't do it, right? I like this. Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature
10866240	10874320	of murder. That's the title. I didn't say that, but okay. Well, I just insert it. I have a hard
10874320	10879680	time with it, though. I think the way you put it, it's kind of... But it's the reality of,
10879680	10884640	it's the reality of, it is beautiful. You know, there's an Instagram account called
10884640	10890960	Nature's Metal. And I keep following it, I'm following it because I can't handle it for
10890960	10896960	prolonged periods of time. We evolve together, you dialogue. Yeah. We evolve together, but you
10896960	10903200	die alone. You live alone too. It's a Gatsby thing. I don't know. We evolve together. Where's the
10903200	10908960	together? The together is the murder and the sex and murder. I just tried like my romantic vision
10908960	10913760	of it to try to make me happy, Sarah, instead of sad, Sarah. I talk in third person when I think
10913760	10921680	very abstractly, sorry, is this whole certain things can coexist so the universe is trying
10921680	10928640	to maximize existence, but there's some things that just aren't the most productive trajectory
10928640	10933200	together, but it doesn't mean that they don't exist on another timeline or another chain
10933200	10938320	somewhere else. And maybe you would call that then some kind of multiverse or things, but
10938960	10944320	what am I saying? I think you can't go down a level. I'm just making stuff up to make it feel
10944320	10949520	better. No, you're not. I don't understand. Is it logical? And we need... No, I know, I know.
10949520	10954320	If you look at bacteria, if you look at virus, I mean just the number of organisms that are
10954320	10958880	constantly looking at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop. It's like a slaughter. Right.
10958880	10962080	So... Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God. I mean, there's a whole thing about
10962240	10967600	why is the universe unable to suffering? Individuals don't exist, right? So for this,
10967600	10973600	I think if you think about life as an entity on earth, right? Let's just go back a second.
10973600	10977360	I mean, I like that. I'll be ludicrous for a second. I don't exist. You don't exist, right?
10978720	10984240	But the actions you do, the product of evolution exists, right? The objects you create exist
10985120	10990400	quantitatively in the real world. If you then understand life on earth or alien life or any
10990400	10995680	life in the universe, there's this integrated entity where you need cells in your body to
10995680	11000800	die. Otherwise, you'd just get really big and you wouldn't be able to walk around, right? So,
11001920	11009280	you do. Yeah. Yeah. So I think... It's the patterns that persist, not the physical things.
11009280	11014480	And of course, we have... We place immense values on fellow human beings. And I'm
11015680	11019120	majestic professor, does like other individual human beings.
11019120	11021760	Now you're talking in third person too. I know it happens, right?
11021760	11026160	So death, would you say... I mean, because you said evolution is a fundamental part of
11027360	11030080	life. So death is a fundamental part of life. Yeah.
11032160	11036000	Right now, it might not be in the future. We might hack some aspects of death
11036640	11042080	and we'll evolve in different ways. But isn't there... I think Sarah mentioned this life density.
11043040	11051200	Can't that become a problem? Like too much bureaucracy, too much baggage builds up.
11051200	11056720	Like you need to keep... I think it's okay that we dissipate. I don't think of it like...
11056720	11063280	Disappear, yes. No, but I mean, we're so fixated on ourselves as individuals and agents. And we
11063280	11068800	were talking about this last night actually over dinner. But an individual persists for a certain
11068800	11073680	amount of time. But what you want to do, like if you're really concerned with immortality, is not
11073680	11078960	to live indefinitely as an individual, but maximize your causal impact. So what are the traces of you
11078960	11085680	that are left? And you're still a real... I always think of Einstein. Like for a period of time,
11085680	11090640	he was a real physical thing we would identify as a human. And now we just see echoes of that human
11090640	11095920	in all of the ways that we talk about his causal impact. Or frankly, right is another great example.
11096000	11099120	How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future? Like, oh, I got you.
11099760	11105920	So I guess the question is, how much do you want to control the localization of certain features
11106560	11112880	of, say, a packet of propagating information we might call person and keep them localized to
11112880	11116960	one individual physical structure? Or do you want to... Is there a time when that just becomes a
11116960	11123040	dissipated feature of the society that it once existed in? And I'm okay with the dissipated
11123040	11127120	feature because I just think that makes more room for more creativity in the future.
11128080	11134400	So you mentioned engineering life in the lab. Let me take you to Computer Science World.
11135840	11144400	What about robots? So is it possible to engineer... Because you're really talking about
11146480	11151600	like engineering life at the chemistry level. But do you think it's possible to engineer
11152560	11161040	life at the humanoid level, at the dog level? Or is that... At which level can we instill
11161040	11167440	the magic of life into inanimate stuff? No, I think you could do it at every level. I just
11167440	11173520	think that we're particularly interested in chemistry because it's the origin life transition
11174480	11177440	that presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it, is going to give you the most
11178320	11185360	and interesting or deepest insights into the physics. But presumably, everything that we do
11185360	11189520	and build is an example of life. And the question is just how much do you want to take from things
11189520	11196080	that we have now and put them into examples of life and copy them into machines? I saw that there
11196080	11200800	was this tweet again. I think you were at the Mars conference and you were hanging out with a
11200800	11206640	humanoid robot. Yes. That was a fun time. Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020.
11206720	11212000	Did you guys color match ahead of time with the robot or did that accidentally happen?
11212000	11216320	Accidentally, I went up and I wanted to say hi. Toro voice, would that be the correct name for
11216320	11222560	the color? I think so. We didn't color coordinate our outfits. Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did.
11222560	11227600	The robot probably did. Much more stylish. So for people who are just listening, there's a picture
11228160	11234800	Sarah standing next to a humanoid robot. I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision.
11234800	11238400	Actually, no, I just... I did that perfectly. There's a lighter.
11239520	11245120	No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested. Sorry to interrupt. Was it manual control? Was
11245120	11251520	it actually stabilizing itself? Oh, no, it was walking around. Oh, nice. Yeah. Nice. It was
11251520	11255680	pretty impressive. I mean, actually, there's some videos online of Jeff Bezos walking with one of
11255680	11262880	those across the lawn nearby there. Yeah. So... I wasn't invited.
11267120	11273920	Yeah, but there you go. See? That's incredible, isn't it? Yeah.
11273920	11278400	See, you look at the walking robot. Where did the idea for walking come from? It was invented by
11278400	11283360	evolution, right? And us as human beings able to conceptualize and design and engineer.
11283440	11288560	The causal chain. So that robot is evidence of life. And so I think what's going to happen is
11291120	11295760	we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically. How can you literally go from
11295760	11301360	sand to cells? So that's the first transition. I think there are a number of problems we want to do.
11301360	11306480	Make life in the lab. Great. Then we want to make life in the lab and we want to suddenly start to
11306480	11312240	make intelligent life or life that can start to solve abstract problems. And then we want to make
11312240	11319600	life that is conscious. Okay. In that order. I think it has to happen that order. Getting
11319600	11323600	towards this artificial general intelligence. I think that artificial general intelligence
11324240	11328480	can't exist in a vacuum. It has to have a causal chain all the way back to Luca, right?
11329440	11332320	And so the question I think I really like the question is to say,
11334240	11340880	how is our pursuit of more and more life like? I know you want to, you like robots,
11340880	11345520	you want to project into them, you want to interact with them. I think you would want,
11345520	11348560	if you have a robot dog and a robot dog does everything expected from a normal dog and you
11348560	11352560	can't tell a difference, you're not really going to ask the question anymore if it's a real dog
11352560	11356720	or not. Or you've got a personality, you're interacting with it. And so I think what would
11356720	11362400	be interesting would be to kind of understand the computational architecture, how that evolves,
11362400	11366560	because you could then, you know, teleport the personality from one object to the other and
11366640	11372320	say, right, does it act the same? And I think that as we go along, we're going to get better and
11372320	11377840	better at integrating our consciousness into machines.
11377840	11384560	Well, let me ask you that question just to linger on it. I would call that a living
11384560	11392800	conscious thing potentially, I as a human allegedly, but would you as a person try to define life?
11393600	11396160	If you pass the Turing test, are you a life form?
11396800	11402880	One of the reasons I walked up to the robot was because I wanted to meet the robot, right?
11402880	11411200	So it felt like I was, and I base a lot of my interaction with reality on emotion and feeling,
11411200	11415200	but like, how do you feel about an interaction? And I always love your point about like, is it
11415200	11419520	enough to have that shared experience with a robot, right? So walking up to it, does it feel
11419520	11424320	like you're interacting with a living thing? And it did to an extent. But in some degrees,
11424320	11428720	it feels like you're interacting with a baby living thing. So I think our relationship with
11428720	11434560	technology in particular robots we build is really interesting because basically, they exist as
11434560	11439840	objects in our future in some sense, like we're much older evolutionary lineage than robots are,
11439840	11446320	but we're all part of the same causal chain. And presumably, you know, they're kind of in their
11446320	11450720	infancy. So it's almost like you're looking at the future of life when you're looking at them,
11450720	11456880	but it hasn't really become life in a full manifestation of whatever it is that they're
11456880	11464160	going to become. And, you know, the more, the example of the walking robot was super interesting,
11464160	11468400	but they also had a dolphin that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,
11468400	11473680	and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool. And, you know, it's in this kind
11473680	11479680	of uncanny valley because, and I was having this conversation with a gentleman named Mutu,
11479680	11484160	who was super perceptive, but he was basically saying like, it made him feel really uncomfortable.
11485680	11490720	And I think, yeah, and I think a lot of people would have that response. And I guess my point
11490720	11494960	about it is, it is kind of interesting because you're basically trying to make a thing that you
11494960	11500400	think is nonliving mimic a living thing. And so, so the thought experiment I would want to run in
11500480	11505520	that case is, imagine we replaced every living thing on earth with a robot equivalent, like all
11505520	11510320	the dolphins and things. And in some sense, then you're making, if you think that the robots aren't
11510320	11515120	experiencing reality, for example, in the way that a biologically evolved thing would, you're
11515120	11522000	basically making the philosophical zombie argument become real and basically building
11522000	11527200	reality into a simulation because you've made everything quote unquote fake in some sense.
11527200	11530880	You've replaced everything with a physical simulation of it.
11530880	11537920	So as opposed to being excited by the possibility of creating something new,
11537920	11542240	you're terrified of humans being replaced.
11542240	11546080	I was just trying to run like, what would be the absolute, you know, thought experiment,
11546080	11551440	but I don't think that scenario would actually play out. I guess what I think is weird for
11552000	11556320	why we feel this kind of uncanny valley interacting with something like the robot dolphin
11556320	11560000	is we're looking at an object we know is kind of in the future in the sense of like,
11560000	11564080	if everything's ordered in time, but it's borrowing from a structure that we have common
11564080	11569120	history with. And it's basically copying in a kind of superficial way things from one
11569760	11572320	part of the causal chain to another. Yeah.
11573120	11574880	Well, that's, that's a video.
11575680	11581040	Everybody believed it was real. They look so real. And obviously,
11581040	11583520	a technology was developed for movies. So
11584080	11588000	Well, I think we're confusing our emotional response and understanding the causal chain
11588000	11592400	of how we got there, right? Because the philosophical zombie argument thinks about
11593440	11597600	objects just appearing, right, that you're facsimile in some way. Whereas there is
11597600	11602160	the cause of the chain of events that caused the dolphin to be built went for human being.
11602160	11605440	Yeah, would a philosophical zombies still have a high assembly index?
11605520	11611360	Yeah. Because it came it can't be philosophical zombies can't like like Boltzmann brains just
11611360	11615200	can't appear out of nowhere. Well, I guess my question would be in that that scenario where
11615200	11618560	you build all the robots and replace everything on earth with robots with the with the biosphere
11618560	11624320	be as creative under that scenario or not. And so are there are there quantitative differences
11624320	11628400	you would notice over time? And it's not obvious either way, right? It's not obvious right now
11628400	11633120	because we don't really we don't understand we haven't built into machines how we work.
11633120	11638400	So that's I think that there are one of the big missing things that I think that we're both
11638400	11643680	looking for, right? It's a cute robot. But the point there is that the biosphere won't be as
11643680	11652240	creative if you did it right now. No, of course, but in the future, we will be able to solve the
11652240	11660480	problem of origin of life, intelligence and consciousness, because they exist in physical
11660480	11666160	substrates, we just don't understand enough about the material substrate and the causal chain.
11666160	11670720	But I'm very confident we will get to an AGI, but it won't be what people think it won't be
11670720	11676480	solution won't be a we'll get fooled a lot. And so GPT three is getting better at falling us and
11676480	11683920	GPT 153 might really fall us, but it won't have the magic we're looking for it won't be a creative.
11684880	11691120	But it will help us understand the differences between really though, because isn't that what
11691120	11698960	love is being fooled? Like what why why are you not giving much value to the emotional connection
11698960	11704000	with objects with with robots with humans? Emotion is that thing which happens when you're
11704000	11710480	when you're the the funk your expectation function is is dashed and something else happens.
11710560	11714880	Right. I mean, that's what emotion is. Is that what love is to you? Yeah.
11715760	11720800	You were expecting one thing and something else happened. Yeah. I don't know. I don't think that's
11720800	11725120	true either. Well, what is it then? I think no emotion. Look, I'm sorry emotion is that but
11725120	11730400	but I think love is just fulfilling your purpose. No, but I'll can we look like look like whatever
11730400	11734560	that means. I mean, really? So yeah, okay. So when are you happiest is like when you're all right?
11734560	11739440	All right. Let me go back if you want to follow your bliss. Let me define love quickly. Okay,
11739920	11745040	in terms of assembly space, right? Excellent. I didn't think I'll be doing this today.
11745040	11749760	I can't wait till assembly theory 101 is taught and the second lecture is assembly theory of love.
11753520	11759760	It's being surprised. The expectation is being broken. I'm just I'm not an emotional being,
11759760	11764160	but I would say so let's talk. So we'll talk about emotion a bit, but love is more complex is love
11764160	11769440	is a very complex set of emotions together and logical stuff. But if you've got this thing,
11769440	11775520	this person that's on this causal chain that has this empathy for this other thing, love is being
11775520	11780960	able to project ahead in your assembly space and work out what you're the person you're in love with
11780960	11787360	has a need for and to do that for them without selflessly, right? Because you can project ahead
11787360	11791360	what they're going to need and they are there and maybe you can see someone is going to fall over
11791440	11794800	and you catch them before they fall over or maybe you can anticipate that someone's going to be
11794800	11799520	hungry and without helping you, you just help them. That just sounds like empathy.
11800160	11804640	But it's more complex than that, right? It's more complex. It's more about not just empathy,
11804640	11808160	it's understanding. It's about kind of sharing that experience.
11808160	11812240	You have an expression of love though. That's not what it's like to feel love like feeling love is
11812240	11818560	like I like I think it's like when you're aligned with things that you feel like are your purpose
11818560	11826160	or your reason for existing. So if you have those feelings towards a robot, why is that rope?
11827520	11832800	Because you said the AGI will build an AGI but there'll be a fundamental difference in AGI.
11832800	11835040	I don't think we'll build it. It's going to merge from our technology.
11835040	11840480	I think you guys all are doing the same thing. I just said that GPT, that we do not correctly
11840480	11845280	capture the causal chain that we have. Within GPT. Yeah, within AI.
11845440	11852960	Don't you think it captures, because GPT-3 is fundamentally trained on a corpus of knowledge,
11853840	11858960	you know, like the internet. Don't you think it gets better and better and better capturing
11858960	11863520	the memory of all of them? It will be better at falling you and at some point you won't care.
11864400	11869120	But when it comes, my guess, this is as quick as what I was getting to right before we got,
11869120	11874880	I got in the Love Trap. Love Trap, yeah. It was like Lee Cronin in the Love Trap, you know.
11877040	11881600	Sounds like a good band name. It makes it sad. Okay, it's sad. Assembly space is sad.
11881600	11888960	No, it's so short, but I think there are other features that allow, that we pull on innovation
11888960	11894160	that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT-3. So if you're being fooled there.
11894160	11899120	So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability to be surprising and creative,
11899120	11908160	whereas is it Dali, this thing, or if you take GPT-3 is not going to create a new verb. Shakespeare
11908160	11915200	created new verbs. You're like, wow. And that required Shakespeare to think outside of language
11915200	11920080	in a different domain. So I think having the connections across multiple domains is what
11920080	11925840	you need for AGI. Yeah, but I don't know if you need, I don't know if there's any limitations to
11926720	11934320	GPT and not being able to be cost domain. The number one problem is it's instantiated in a
11934320	11942320	resource-limited substrate that we don't use in silicon. The architecture is used for training,
11942320	11948720	for learning. It is about falling. It's not about understanding. And I think that there is some
11949360	11953760	understanding that we have that is not yet symbolically representable.
11953760	11959120	Language, learning language and using language seems to be fundamentally about fooling,
11959120	11963840	not understanding. Why do you use language exactly?
11963840	11970000	I might disagree with that quite fundamentally actually. But I don't, I'm not sure I understand
11970000	11975600	how I'll make a coherent argument for that. But my feeling is that there is, there are,
11975600	11984880	there is comprehension in reality in our consciousness below language. And we use those
11984880	11988960	for language for all sorts of expressions. And we don't yet understand that there's a gap.
11988960	11992880	We will get there. But I'm saying, wouldn't it be interesting? It's a bit like saying,
11992880	11999600	could I facsimile you or Sarah into a new human being, right? And let's just say I could copy
11999600	12004880	all your atoms and the positions of all your atoms and electrons into this other person,
12004880	12009920	they would be you. The answer is no. And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory,
12009920	12014800	because actually the feature space that you have, that graph, the only way to copy you
12014800	12018560	is to create you on that graph. So everything that's happened to you in your past,
12018560	12021440	we have to have a faithful record for. If you want another copy of Lex,
12021440	12024560	you have to do the exact thing. One other copy of Sarah, one other copy of Lee,
12024560	12029680	the exact past has to be replicated. Let me push back on that a little bit. That's maybe from an
12029680	12036080	assembly theory perspective, but I don't think it's that difficult to recreate a version of me,
12036080	12044320	like a clone that would make everybody exactly equally as happy. Like they wouldn't care which
12044320	12050080	one. And like there's two of me, and then they get to pick which one, and they'll kill either one,
12050080	12053760	they'll be fine, as long as they're forced to kill. They'll be fine. But here's what will happen,
12053760	12058640	is let's say we make artificial Lex. And it was like, wow, so cool, it looks the same interact.
12058640	12062160	Then there'll be this battle of like, right, we're going to tell the difference. We're going to
12062160	12069520	basically keep nudging Lex and artificial Lex until we get in novelty from one and we'll kill
12069520	12075200	the other one. And I think thank God. We're not novelty is a fuzzy concept. That's the whole
12075200	12082640	problem of novelty. So I will define novelty is not fuzzy. Novelty is the ability for you to create
12083600	12090320	architectures that are or create an architecture. So let's say you've got corpus of architectures
12090320	12094800	known, you can write down, you've got some distance measure. And then I create a new one,
12094800	12099920	and the distance measure so far away from what you'd expected is there's no linear algebra
12099920	12107360	we're going to get this, like that is creativity. And we don't know how to do that yet on any level.
12107360	12110640	Well, I was also thinking about like your argument about free will, like you wouldn't
12110640	12115280	be able to know it was it doesn't work instantaneously. It's not like a micro level thing,
12115280	12119840	but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories or longer term decisions. So
12119840	12126000	if you think that the novelty manifests over those longer timescales, it might be the two Lexes
12126800	12132560	diverge quite a bit over certain timescales of their behavior, even though nobody would notice
12133360	12140160	the difference. They might not. And the universe, the earth won't notice the difference. The
12140160	12144160	universe won't notice the universe would notice the difference. No, the universe doesn't know about
12144160	12148880	its novelty. This being generated. That's the whole point of novelty. This is what selection is,
12148880	12154400	right? It's like taking nearly equivalent ones and then deciding like the universe selects,
12154400	12158880	right? So whatever selection is, select some things to persist in time. It's going to select
12158880	12164080	the artificial one. So it likes that one better. But you're mixing up two arguments here. So look,
12164080	12168880	let's go back a second. What are you basing this argument on? I'm just saying that I kind of
12169600	12177840	don't think, because at least said that it's not possible, like if you copy every single molecule
12177840	12184880	in a person's body, that's not going to be the same person. That they won't have the same assembly
12184880	12190480	index. It won't be the same person. And I just don't, I think copying, you can compress. Not only
12190480	12196560	do I disagree with that, I just, I think you can even compress a person down to some where you can
12196560	12203920	fool the universe. I'm saying, let me restate it. It is not possible to copy somebody on,
12203920	12209600	because you, unless you copy the causal history. Also, you can't have two identical. I mean,
12209600	12213040	actually, I really like the idea that everything in the universe is unique. So even if like,
12213040	12216960	there were two lexes. I know you like that idea because you're human and you think you're unique.
12216960	12221040	Yeah, exactly. But also, I can make a logical argument for it that even if we could copy,
12221040	12224560	you know, all of your molecules and all their positions, the other you would be there. And
12224560	12229520	you have a different position in space. You're distinguishable. Yeah, the other thing I was
12229520	12233840	going to add. How unique are you just by the position in space, really? Sure. But then,
12233840	12237760	how much does that light translation of lex sitting there affect the future? That's not an
12237760	12244720	interesting, I see. But, but no, wait, wait a minute. Is part of the definition of something
12244720	12250080	being interesting is how much it affects the future? Yes. Yes. But let me come back.
12250640	12254960	But let me come back to one point quickly that you were making. Sure. I think I probably agree.
12255600	12259600	There's two lexes, right? There's a robot lex that you just basically, it's a, it's a,
12259600	12266320	it is a charade. It's a facsimile. It's just coded to emulate you.
12267440	12272160	Are you a robot lex? I wouldn't know, right? But let's get there. That's a very, very important
12272160	12278640	point here because he's ducking and diving between this eye. So, so if I facsimile you into a robot,
12278640	12283760	then it would, your robot might be, would be a representation of you now, but fundamentally
12283760	12287600	be boring because you go and have other ideas. If however you built an architecture,
12287600	12291920	the itself was capable of generating novelty, you would diverge in your causal chain,
12291920	12296240	and you're both be equally interesting to interact with. We don't know that mechanism.
12296240	12299760	All I'm trying to say is we don't yet know that mechanism. We do not know the mechanism that
12299760	12307120	generates novelty. And at the moment, in our AIs, we are emulating, we are not generating.
12307120	12311680	You don't think we're sneaking up on that? No, there is no ghost in the machine.
12313440	12316720	And I want there to be one. I want the same thing you want. Sorry, I was-
12316720	12322160	I know you want that as a human because everything you just said makes you feel more special.
12322160	12326640	I want to be, no, no, no, screw my specialness. I just want to be surprised. If I-
12326640	12330640	You don't think a robot can surprise you? If I, if you can produce an algorithm in
12330640	12336560	instantiated and robot surprise me, I will, I will, I will, I will have one of those robots
12336560	12342640	to be brilliant, but they won't surprise me. But why, why is it a problem to think that humans
12342640	12349360	are special? Maybe it's not the special, you're right. It's the better than. Yes. Because then
12349360	12355280	you start to not recognize the magic in other life forms that you either have created or you have
12355280	12362480	observed because I just think there is magic in legged robots moving about and they are full
12362480	12370480	of surprises. Yeah. So this is- Infectionality. Yeah. So I'm a little- I know why you like cellular
12370480	12377440	automata, right? But the, the specialness in your robot comes from the roboticist that built it.
12379200	12383200	Yeah. It's part of the lineage. Yeah. And so that's fine. I'm happy with that.
12383200	12386640	That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot was I was looking at 4 billion years of
12386640	12391760	evolution. Yeah. Right. If it wasn't, so I think I'm happy. I mean, I'm happy we're going to coexist.
12391760	12394640	I'm just saying you're going to get more excitement. There's something missing in our
12394640	12400400	understanding of intelligence. Intelligence isn't just training. The way the neural network is
12400400	12404160	conceived right now is great and it's lovely and it'll be better and we will argue forever. But
12404960	12409520	you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said, look, I know how to invent an architecture
12409520	12416560	and I can give it a soul. And what I mean by a soul is some, I know for real that there is
12416560	12421920	internal reference. As soon as I'm not fake internal reference, and if we could generate
12421920	12425280	that mechanism for internal reference, that's why our goal direct- That's why you have to-
12425280	12428800	We can do that. That's for goal directness. Yeah. Get that goal directness. You would love that
12428800	12434080	robot more than the one that's just made to look like it does because you'll have more fun with
12434080	12439360	it because you better generate other problems, get more novelty. Hell, you'd be able to fall
12439360	12445680	in love with that robot for real, but not the one that's faking it. What about fake it till you make
12445680	12456160	it? Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with fake humans. It's nice to fall in love
12456160	12461840	with something that's full of novelty, yes. I could imagine all kinds of robots that I would
12461840	12466480	want to have a close relationship with. And I don't mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy.
12467200	12473200	But I just don't think that novelty generation is such a special-
12476080	12479520	Okay, there's like mathematical novelty or something like that, and then there's just
12479520	12483920	humans being surprised. I think we're easily surprised. That's fine, but that's-
12483920	12487200	But you don't think that's a good definition of novelty? No, that's good. I'm happy to be surprised,
12489760	12493440	but not globally surprised because of someone else, but I really want, I was one,
12493440	12498800	why I'm a scientist, I really want to be the first to be surprised about something and the
12498800	12503280	first thing in the first in the universe to create that novelty and to know for sure that
12503280	12508320	that novelty has never occurred anywhere else. That's a real buzz, right? That's a way to really
12508320	12512880	know that. You have to have a really big look up, David. Right. Yeah, you're never going to be
12512880	12517760	know for sure, right? That's one of the hard things about being a scientist searching for
12517760	12523280	this type of novelty. Maybe that's why mathematics, mathematicians love discovery,
12523280	12528720	but actually they are creating, and then when they do create a new mathematical structure,
12528720	12534960	that they can then, you can write code to work out whether that structure exists before. That's
12534960	12540400	almost why I would love to have been a mathematician from that regard, to invent new math that really,
12540400	12544640	I know pretty much for sure does not exist anywhere else in the universe because it's so
12544640	12549680	contingent. Right, but this gets into, you said a few times that I still really don't understand
12549680	12554080	how you actually plan to do this, to build an experiment that detects how the universe is
12554080	12559280	generating novelty or that time is the mechanism. The problem that we all have, which I think is
12559280	12564640	what Lex is pushing against, is if I build the experiment, you don't know what you put into it,
12564640	12570160	so you don't know what, unless you can quantify everything you put in, all of your agency,
12570160	12576160	all the boundary conditions, you don't know if you somehow biased it in some way. So,
12576160	12580160	is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment or to that robot, or is it something
12580160	12584000	you gave it, but you didn't realize? It's going to be, it's going to asymptote towards that,
12584000	12588000	right? You're never going to know for sure, but you can start to take out, you know, you can use
12588000	12593600	good Bayesian approaches and just keep updating and updating and updating until you point to one
12593600	12598080	sense of purposes. So you want to bound on how much novelty generation it could be. Yeah. Got it.
12598960	12603600	So the ability to generate novelty is correlated with high assembly index,
12603600	12609200	with assembly index? Yeah, and yeah. Because the space of possibilities is bigger.
12611440	12618400	So that's the key, this could be a good, so we're running joke of like why Lex is single,
12618400	12627280	this could be a good part four. So what you're looking for in a robot partner is ability to
12627280	12637120	generate novelty. And that's, I suppose you would say it's a good definition of intelligence too.
12640560	12648640	Boy, is novelty a fuzzy concept. Is creativity better?
12650000	12655920	Yeah, I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy. It's kind of the same. Maybe that's why aliens haven't come
12655920	12660640	yet is because we're not creating enough novelty. Like there's some kind of a hierarchy of novelty
12660640	12665120	in the universe. Well, I think novelty is like things surprise you, right? So it's a very passive
12665120	12668720	thing. But I guess I would remember by saying creativity is I think it's much more active,
12668720	12673680	like you think there's like a mechanism of like the things that exist or generating the creativity.
12673680	12678160	Novelty seems to be there's some spontaneous production and it's completely decoupled from
12678160	12684080	the things that exist. No, I understand. I think that creativity is the mechanism
12684080	12690000	and novelty is the observable. Yeah, novelty could just be surprise. Your model of the world
12690000	12694880	was broken and not necessarily in a positive way. That's surprise. So there's three things now.
12694880	12698160	Let's go back to school. Right. Let's go. You've got surprise, which is basically,
12698800	12702400	I'm, I don't, I mean, I'm surprised all the time because I don't read very much. I'm pretty dumb.
12702400	12707520	I was like, Oh, wow. I often used to invent new scientific, you know, ideas. And I was really
12707520	12711040	surprised by that. And then when looking at literature properly, and it's there. So surprise,
12711120	12717760	that's to the extent that you don't have full information. Creativity, the act of pushing
12718640	12725040	on that kind of on the causal structure and novelty, which is measuring that degree.
12725760	12731200	Right. So I think that's pretty well defined in that regard. So you want your robot, I mean,
12731200	12735760	and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet and the printing press share some,
12736480	12740000	I actually think creativity has dropped a bit since the create, since the internet,
12740000	12743920	because everyone's just, just, you know, just regurgitating stuff. But of course,
12743920	12748080	now it's beginning to accelerate again, because everyone is using this tool to be creative.
12748720	12753520	And boom, it's exploding. I think that's what happens when you create these new technologies.
12754560	12758160	That's really, that's really helpful. There's a difference between novelty and surprise.
12758160	12762960	Okay. I was, I think I was thinking about surprise. If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,
12762960	12767120	it'd be great. Robot surprises me, you know, experiment that surprises you. Yeah. I mean,
12767120	12771280	that's why I love doing experiments because I'm, I can't. It's still exciting. Yeah. Surprise is
12771280	12776640	exciting. Yeah. Even negative surprise. Like some people love drama in relationships. Like,
12778000	12783600	it's like, why the hell, why, why'd you do this? That could be exciting. I could imagine companies
12783600	12788640	selling updates to their companion robots that just basically generate negative surprise just to
12788640	12793360	just spice things up a bit. Yeah. It's the push and pull. That's, that's one of the components
12793440	12798720	of love. As you said, love is a complicated thing. Oh, beauty. I wanted to mention this because
12798720	12802960	you also tweeted, I think this was Sarah. No, it might have been Lee. I don't remember,
12802960	12809600	but it was a survey published in nature showing that scientists find, yeah. Anyway, there's a,
12809600	12816960	there's a plot published in nature of what scientists find beautiful in their work and it
12816960	12822880	separates biologists and physicists. It'd be nice if you showed the full plot and there's simplicity,
12822960	12828720	elegance, hidden order, interlogic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony, and so on.
12829520	12835120	Is there any interesting things that stand out to you? I think the fact that biologists like
12835120	12841680	complexity and pleasing colors. Oh, there's pleasing colors on there? Yeah. Yeah. Or shapes.
12841680	12846400	Or shapes. Pleasing colors. And then physicists obviously love simplicity above all else. Simplicity
12847040	12853520	and elegance. Simplicity and elegance. Yeah. They love symmetry and the biologists love complexity
12854640	12859360	and, or they just love a little bit less. They love everything a little bit less,
12859360	12864000	but complexity a little bit more. A little bit more. That's so interesting. And pleasing colors
12864000	12868640	or shapes. Do you think it's a useful, I forget what your tweet was that this is missing some of
12869120	12876640	something? No, I think it's because I think about how explanations become causal to our future. So
12877520	12884720	I have this whole philosophy that the theories we build and the way we describe reality should be
12885680	12893360	have the largest breadth of possibilities for the future of what we can accomplish. So in some
12893360	12898480	sense, it's not like Occam's razor is not for simplicity. It's for optimism or the kind of
12898480	12904480	future you can build. And so I think, I think you have to think this way when you're thinking about
12904480	12909120	life and alien life, because ultimately we're trying to build, I mean, science is just basically
12909120	12913600	our narratives about reality. And now you're building a narrative that is what we are as physical
12913600	12918160	systems. It seems to me it needs to be as positive as possible, because it's basically going to shape
12918160	12921600	the future trajectory where we're going. And we don't use that as a heuristic
12921600	12927440	in theory building, because we think theories are about predicting features of the world,
12927440	12930960	not causing them. But if you look at the history of all of the development of human
12930960	12935520	thought, it's caused the things that happen next. So it's not just about looking at the world and
12935520	12942960	observing it, it's about actually that feedback loop that's missing. And it's not in any of those
12942960	12952800	categories. What do you think is the most beautiful idea in the physics of life, in the
12952800	12958240	chemistry of life, in this, through all your exploration with assembly theory,
12960480	12970480	what is the thing that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful or potentially beautiful?
12970480	12977360	For me, it's that the universe is a creative place. I guess I want to think, and whether it's
12977360	12984800	true or not, is that we are special in some way, and it's not like an arbitrary added-on epiphenomenon
12984800	12988720	or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist, but it's something deep and intrinsic to the
12988720	12995040	structure of reality. And to me, the most beautiful idea that come out of that is that the reason we
12995040	13001600	exist is for the universe to generate more things and to think about itself and use that as a
13002240	13012000	mechanism for creating more stuff. That's for me. So the life that this however
13012800	13019840	common it is, is an intrinsic part, is a fundamental part of this universe, at least that we live in.
13020800	13026720	It's always interesting to me because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity, and
13026720	13031120	they're supposed to be our most fundamental theories right now. And they describe things
13031120	13036160	like the interaction of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate, or all these kind of
13036160	13041200	features. And they're these really deep theories, and they tell us a lot about how reality works,
13041200	13046080	but they're completely agnostic to our existence. And I can't help but think that whatever
13046080	13052960	describes us has to be even deeper than that. And I think incorporating memory, I guess,
13053600	13058480	of causality, whatever the term you want to use into the physics of the world might be.
13058480	13063120	That's the easiest way to do it. It's the cleanest- so here we go again with the physicists,
13063120	13068080	I'm a physicist. I was going to say the simplest, most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of
13068080	13075040	ways that we have these paradoxes associated with life when you- it's not that life is not
13076400	13082000	current physics is not incompatible with life, but it doesn't explain life. And then you want to
13082000	13087200	know where are the explanatory gaps. And this idea that we have an assembly, that time is
13087200	13093040	fundamental and objects actually are extended in time, and have physical extent in time is the
13093040	13100000	cleanest way of resolving a lot of the explanatory gaps. So I've been- I struggle with assembly theory
13100000	13107600	for many years, because I could see this gap. And I think when I first met Sarah, and we realized
13107600	13114480	we were kind of talking about the same problem, but we were- we understood none of the language,
13114480	13117680	it was quite hilarious actually, because it's like, look, I've no idea what you're talking about,
13117680	13122880	but I think it's- seems right. So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory is I
13122880	13128000	realized the assembly theory explains why the universe- why life is the universe developing a
13128000	13133840	memory, but not only that poetically, I could actually go measure it. And I was like,
13134880	13140800	holy shit, we just- we physically measured this thing, this abstract thing, and we could measure
13140800	13146560	it. And not only could we measure it, but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.
13148240	13154800	And because, I mean, you know, I think as a kind of inventing this together with Sarah and her team,
13155760	13160640	you know, I thought there was a quite a high chance that, you know, we're doing science,
13160640	13167040	there's such a high probability we're wrong, you know, on this. And I remember kind of trying to go
13167040	13176160	to hard physicists, mathematicians, complexity theorists, and everyone just kind of giving
13176160	13180720	me such a hard time about it. And so, you know, this is kind of- this is- you've just done this,
13180800	13187120	you've just done that, you know, you've just recapitulated an old theory. And I was unable,
13187120	13193200	I lacked the language to really explain, and I had to- it was a real struggle. So this realization
13193200	13200080	that life- what life does that physics cannot understand or chemistry is a universe develops
13200080	13207040	a memory that's causally actionable. And then we can measure it, but it isn't just one thing,
13207040	13211040	there is this intrinsic property of all the objects in the universe. Like I've said before,
13211040	13215360	but you know, me holding up this water bottle isn't any other water bottle, but it is a sum total
13215360	13222560	of all the water bottles that have existed, right? And will likely change the future of water bottles
13222560	13229040	and for other objects. So it's this kind of- so for me, assembly theory explains the soul
13229840	13235680	in stuff. But it- The monology. But it is monology. It's not like Sheldrake's Morphic
13235680	13241200	Resonance, where we have this kind of wooey thing permeating the universe. It is the interaction of
13241200	13247760	objects with other objects. And some objects have more instantaneous causal power. That's life,
13248480	13254240	living things. And some objects are the instantaneous output of that causal power,
13254240	13258320	dead objects, but they're part of the lineage. And that for me is fascinating and really beautiful.
13258880	13264160	And I think that even if we're determined to be totally wrong, I think it will help us
13264960	13269520	help, hopefully understand what life is and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the lab.
13270160	13273520	How does that make you feel, by the way? Does it make you feel less special
13273520	13278080	that you're so deeply integrated, interconnected to the lineage?
13278080	13282000	I mean, I came on one level. I just wanted it in my life as a scientist. I wanted to have an
13282000	13286800	interesting idea just once or an original idea. I mean, it was like, you know,
13288320	13292400	so I think that was cool that we had this idea and we were playing with it. And I think also that
13293040	13298640	I kind of, I mean, it took me ages to realize that Sarah had also had the same kind of form,
13298640	13301600	coming towards the same formulation, just from a completely different point.
13303840	13307120	But no, it makes me feel special. And it also makes me feel connected to the universe. It
13307120	13313440	also makes me feel not just humble about, you know, being a living object in the universe,
13313440	13317040	but the fact that it makes me really optimistic about what the universe is going to do in the
13317040	13324320	future, because we're not just isolated phenomena, we are connected. I will be able to have,
13324320	13329040	you know, one of my small objectives in life is to change the future of the universe in some
13329600	13333840	profound way just by existing. Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.
13339200	13343200	I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely, because I just realize I'm not like,
13343200	13346560	I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure, but I have so much overlap with the other
13346560	13351440	entities I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?
13351440	13359760	And yet your existence does have a huge amount of impact on the, how this whole thing unrolls
13359760	13363440	on the future of the world. As individuals, that's, yeah.
13363440	13365760	But I was going to say, local packets of agency.
13365760	13369920	I think we all have a profound impact on the future, some more than others, right? All human
13369920	13374880	beings, all life. And I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege in a way for, you know,
13374880	13380640	to say, to assert some degree of ego and agency, you know, I'm going to make a computer or make
13380640	13384960	an original life machine or do this thing. But actually, it's just like, you know, life's probably
13384960	13389760	living, if there is a God or there's a soul in everything, it's really laughing at us going,
13390320	13395120	I fool these guys by giving them ego. So they strive for this stuff and look what it does for,
13395120	13397840	you know, the assembly space of the universe.
13397840	13402160	And there's always a possibility that science can't answer all of it. So that part's challenging for
13402160	13409680	me. There might be a limit to this thing. Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions,
13409680	13416160	and I demand relatively short answers. Ali, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?
13420960	13427280	Or what's the scary thing that pops to mind? Giving lecture, giving seminars in front of
13427280	13435520	other scientists? Yeah, that is terrifying. If I had more time, I would ask you about the most
13435520	13442880	embarrassing, but we'll spare you. What about you, Sarah? Scariest thing up there? Some of the
13442880	13449120	scary things you've done? Actually, the scariest for me was deciding I wanted to get divorced,
13449120	13453840	because it was like a totally radical life. Life transformed me. Yeah, because we had been married
13453840	13460160	for a really long time. And I think it was just so much like, I realized so much of my
13460160	13463760	individual agency I didn't realize I had before, and that was just really scary,
13463760	13469200	like empowering scary, but terrifying. You were living in one way for your whole life,
13469200	13473680	and then you realized your life could be a different way. Yeah, there is a between humans.
13475680	13479840	The beautiful thing about love is the connection you have, but it's also become the dependency
13479840	13484720	in breaking that, whether it's a mentor with your parents, your friends. It's almost like waking up,
13484720	13490000	like just there's a different reality. Yeah, that was scary. Reinventing yourself. Okay,
13490000	13496560	if you could, Lee, maybe I'll actually alternate. Sarah, if you could be someone else for a day,
13496560	13502880	someone alive today, who you haven't met yet, or maybe you could do one who you've met, who would
13502880	13510800	it be? Kim Kardashian. No joke. The woman's brilliant. I would just like to expere. I think
13510800	13517280	she's got such an interesting and very deep understanding of social reality. But you also
13517280	13523520	said you have appreciation of love for fashion. I do, but that's actually the same. I just think
13523520	13526800	it's really interesting because we live in a social reality, which is completely artificially
13526800	13530640	constructed, and some people are really genius about moving through that, and I think she's
13530640	13534800	particularly good at it. I wonder if she's good at understanding her. I think it's very deeply
13534800	13539360	intrinsic to her. She's like surfing away. How much cognitive awareness she has of it,
13539360	13542960	or how strategic it is, but I think it's deeply fascinating. So I guess that's the first one
13542960	13548640	that comes to mind. What about you, Lee, if you could be somebody for a day? Don't say Yosha Bach.
13549600	13553760	Don't say Kim Kardashian. Let's do off the table. Off the table.
13553760	13559040	No, I was going to say, I would like to be, I have to be here today. I was going to say I'd
13559120	13566720	like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be
13566720	13571440	the latest arm processor. I would like to understand, I would like to know what it feels like to
13571440	13577360	basically... You like being objects. I like being, I've always obsessed with being objects
13577360	13581360	ever since I was a kid. What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day? I mean,
13581360	13585840	I'd like to understand how I access my memory, what anticipates coming next in clock cycles.
13585840	13590080	What about how it feels like? Yeah, I wonder how it feels like to be...
13590080	13593520	Yeah, to be useful. Thanks for that.
13597360	13603920	All right. If, Lee, if everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left,
13603920	13607840	what would your days look like? What would you do? Nobody else left impressed?
13608720	13614880	Nobody, no, probably can't really do any real science at scale. What would you do with your
13614880	13620480	remaining days out there? Yeah, every possible tool I could and put it in my workshop and just
13620480	13626480	make stuff. So try to make stuff. Just try and make stuff. Make companions. I'm probably not making
13626480	13632400	companions, probably, yeah. Probably just in the physical space. Yeah. What about you, sir? What
13632400	13637040	would you, when you're just left alone on earth, you're the last one? Are there animals in this
13637040	13644400	scenario? Nothing. No living beings. No plants? No plants. Oh, interesting. I was going to say,
13645120	13648160	I would try to walk the entire planet, at least all the landmass.
13648800	13655680	Well, that's true. So you probably don't know if there's stuff. You could be searching for plants
13655680	13665440	or other humans. What would I eat? You just have daily just allotment. No, but I would just walk
13665440	13670560	all the time. Of soylent. I don't know why I... Just walk. You're the explorer. I would just walk.
13671280	13675200	And I guess I would make a goal of covering all of the entire earth, because what else are you
13675200	13679920	going to do with your time? What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah, that you haven't done yet,
13679920	13691280	but you hope to do? Skydiving. Travel to space. I don't know. You know what's funny with my bucket
13691280	13695760	list? I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off. Always check it off. So your bucket
13695840	13701680	list is like a fog. It's like a mystery. Yeah. Almost by doing it. Yeah. So it's very subconsciously
13701680	13706400	driven. So it's in your subconscious in there? I think so. You're bringing it to the surface.
13706400	13709760	I think most of the steering of our agency is in our subconscious anyway. So I just kind of go
13709760	13716000	with the flow. But I guess, no, seriously. Yeah, no, I get it. I don't know. I guess that, but I
13716000	13718960	would like to go in a submarine, like to the bottom of the ocean. I think that'd be really cool.
13718960	13723840	To the bottom of the ocean. Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean? I am. Yeah.
13724720	13731120	Yeah. What about you, Lee? What item on your bucket list? I don't have a bucket list,
13731120	13736640	but I've just made one. I would love to take a computer to the moon or Mars and make drugs off
13736640	13742480	world. Be the first chemist to make drugs off world. The first drug manufacturer in space?
13742480	13746400	Yeah. Why not? Drugs in space. Do they have to be somehow, like be able to
13746400	13752240	have a tape, like be able to survive on that particular space? Or like what's the connection
13752320	13755680	between being on Mars and do many things? I just would like to be that. I'd like to take
13756800	13763040	the ability to have command and control over chemicals programmatically off earth to somewhere
13763040	13767600	else in the universe. That just seems like you like difficulty engineering problems.
13768640	13772480	Before I die, if I can do that, that's great. Would you travel to space? Yeah. Yeah, that's
13772480	13776720	what I'm saying. I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist. I want to take
13776720	13780480	scientific experiment in space and do a thing in space that's never been done before.
13781200	13787200	That's a real possibility. Yeah. So that's why there's no point in listing things I can't do.
13788960	13794640	All right. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never forget?
13796240	13802480	Small act of kindness, not big. Somebody was just kind to you. Somebody did something sweet.
13803200	13813360	When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out with... Basically, I needed a computer.
13813360	13817120	I needed some power, computation power, and someone took pity on me and helped me.
13818240	13822880	I was really touched. They didn't have to. They were actually quite a disabled scientist.
13822880	13827440	They had other things to do rather than help some random PhD student, gave me access,
13827440	13831600	taught me a little stuff. Yeah. Actually, when you're a grad student or when you're a student,
13831600	13837920	when you're a student, the younger it is, the better. The attention, the support,
13837920	13842480	the love you get from an older person, the teacher, something like that is super powerful.
13842480	13847120	It's fascinating. And from the perspective of the teacher, they might not realize the impact
13847120	13854480	they have, but that little bit, those few words, a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.
13854480	13859280	What about you, Sarah? Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point.
13859280	13864080	I love free Starbucks. I like it when you're in the line at Starbucks, and somebody buys
13864080	13867600	your coffee in front of you, and then you buy the next one. I love those, but that's not my
13867600	13871200	example. I love that too. Those are great. It makes me happy. And then my kids get all excited
13871200	13880000	when we do it, when we go in, for the first ones in line doing it. I guess I can use a similar
13880000	13886960	example about just being a student. Paul Davies is a very well-known theoretical physicist, and I
13889280	13894400	was generous enough with his time to take me on as a postdoc. But before I became his postdoc,
13894400	13897760	he invited me to a workshop at Arizona State University and the Beyond Center and
13898960	13902560	took a walk with me around campus just to talk about ideas after. And I think
13903200	13910400	there were two things that were completely generous about that. One is Paul's philosophy is
13910400	13915280	always interacting with young people. It's like you interact with a mind in the room. It doesn't
13915280	13921440	matter how well-known or whatever. It's like you evaluate the person for the person. But he also
13921440	13927040	gave me a book, The Urie Silence, that he had written, and he wrote in it. This is how EE gets
13927040	13932960	to ET, which was an anti-meric excess, which I worked on as a PhD student. It was the original
13932960	13936960	homochirality, all the way up to what the book was about, which was, are we alone in the university,
13936960	13943920	and is there an intelligent life out there? And it was just so much about the questions I wanted
13944000	13949040	to ask, because it was just everything about, it was just really, really kind.
13949760	13954320	Like that it's okay to ask these questions, and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.
13954320	13958400	I think a lot of my career is mostly his encouragement to ask deep questions. He gave
13958400	13962880	me the space to do it in ways that a lot of previous mentors had. I mean, I've had a good
13962880	13967200	experience with mentors, but it was like go off the deep end to ask the hardest questions.
13967760	13969760	And I think that's the best gift you can give somebody.
13970400	13974240	What would you, because you're both fascinating minds, and non, I would say,
13975680	13982960	non-standard in the best possible way. Is there advice you can give to young folks how to be
13982960	13986960	non-standard, how to stand out, novelty, how to generate novelty?
13986960	13989280	That's what I want on my tombstone. I have one.
13990160	13992400	He generated novelty.
13992400	13993200	No, no, how to.
13993760	13994000	How to.
13994960	14003120	How still. I just love doing science. And so when I was younger, I was just wanted, I mean,
14003120	14008000	I'm still not sure I'm a real scientist, right? So I want to try. So my advice for the young people
14008000	14014640	is just, if you love asking questions, then don't be afraid to ask the question, even if it pisses
14014640	14019040	people off, because if you piss people off, you're probably asking the right question.
14019840	14023760	What I would say, though, is don't do what I did, which is just piss everyone off.
14024400	14031440	Try and work out how to, you know, I think, if you're, if other people challenge by your questions,
14032800	14038320	you will get not only your respect, but people will give you, create space for you,
14038320	14044400	because you're doing something really new. I really try to create space in my academic career,
14044960	14050080	my team, really try and praise them and push them to do new things. So
14050080	14056080	my advice is try to do new things, get feedback, and the universe will help you.
14058400	14059840	Because the universe likes novelty.
14059840	14061600	I think so. I think so, right?
14061600	14063200	This one will keep them around.
14064240	14069360	What about you, Sarah? You two like to ask the really out there.
14069840	14076080	Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them. So I think it goes back to the love,
14076080	14079280	like if you're doing the thing you're supposed to be doing, you should really love it.
14080400	14083200	So I always tell people that they should do the thing they're most passionate about,
14083200	14089200	but I think a flip side of that is that's when you become in somebody, like not to sound cheesy,
14089200	14094000	but like your best version of yourself. So I guess, like for me, as I become more successful
14094000	14098560	in my career, I feel like I can be more myself as an individual. And so there's this, I've always
14098560	14103520	been following the questions I'm most interested in, which very early on I was discouraged from
14103520	14107360	knowing by many people because they thought they were unanswerable questions. And I always just
14107360	14112240	thought, well, if no one's even trying to answer them, of course they're going to be unanswerable.
14112240	14116720	And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint. But the more I found my way in that space,
14116720	14121760	the more I also made a space for myself as a person, because you're basically
14121760	14129280	generating the niche that you want to exist in. And so I think that's part of it,
14129280	14134320	is not just to follow your passion, but also think about like, who do you want to be and create that?
14135600	14140240	Yeah, who am I? Who do you want to be? I mean, I play temporarily with it.
14140800	14144480	Yeah, who am I now? Who do I want to be now? But who do I want to be in the future? They're not
14144480	14152800	decoupled. Yeah, I always wonder if that's like, if I become something, am I finding myself? Or am
14152800	14159120	I creating myself? Yeah. And I think those are somehow the same kind of thing. I do feel often
14159120	14166080	like that I was always meant to be this kind of thing. Yeah. But is that created or discovered?
14166080	14171600	I don't know. But basically go towards that direction. If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah.
14172160	14179200	Excellent. I'm waiting. They come find me. They're on a spaceship. And then they somehow figured
14179200	14190160	out the language you speak and ask you, what are you? What explain yourself? Not you, Sarah, but
14190160	14200000	the species. Oh. What's life on earth? Like we don't have time or busy grad students from another
14200640	14206640	planet. I see. What's interesting about human civilization? What's interesting about you?
14207600	14211360	You specifically too. They could be very kind of personal and kind of pushy.
14213440	14221120	And yeah, how would you describe? Okay, I have one. Because, you know,
14222160	14225680	obviously I self-identify as a scientist and a physicist, but intrinsically I feel more like
14225680	14229280	an artist. But it's almost like you're an artist that you don't know what you're painting yet.
14230160	14237040	And I guess I feel like that's humanity. Like in some sense, we're creating something I think
14237040	14241600	is profound and potentially very beautiful. Like it exists in the universe, but we're just so
14242400	14248240	night, like not night. We're just early. We're early. We're young. We don't know what we're doing yet.
14248240	14252480	Yeah. What's with the nuclear weapons? There's a big question too. Like what are you guys?
14252480	14257040	What are we doing with them? This creativity that you talk about. It sounds very nice, but it's
14257680	14263040	we're making things that are like very destructive and like the rockets. This seems very aggressive.
14263680	14270480	Yeah, I know. This is my blinders on. I don't know. I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation
14270480	14275360	about suffering. I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects of reality into what I want to
14275920	14281120	envision. And that's obviously problematic. But, you know, nuclear power has also given us a
14281120	14289040	lot of good things. So both human nature, both human beings and the technology we create has
14289040	14292560	the capacity for evil and the capacity for good. Yeah. And we can't all be good all the time.
14292560	14297600	I mean, there's like this huge misnomer that you need to be liked by everyone universally. And
14297600	14302560	obviously that's like an ideal, but it's physically impossible. Like you can't get a group of people
14302560	14307360	in the room and have everyone like each other all the time. So I think that kind of tension is
14307360	14313040	actually really important that we have different aesthetics, different goals,
14314800	14322080	and sometimes conflict comes out of that. Speaking of which, do you and Yosha Bach ever
14322080	14327200	say anything nice to each other? Or is it always conflict? We never have conflict. We argue,
14327200	14332160	but I don't think they argue. Arguments are bad. I mean, I think the problem I have,
14332240	14336000	not problem, I think. Here we go. And he's not here to defend himself.
14336000	14341520	No, I just, I don't necessarily understand the, the, I mean, he's just talking at such a high
14341520	14347280	level. You know, I'm a dimwit. So I'm like, I spend some, so I think a lot of our conflict,
14347280	14350960	it's not conflict, we actually, we actually have a, I think, I mean, I can't speak for Yosha,
14350960	14356240	I have a deep appreciation for him. He's brilliant. But I think I'm kind of frustrated and I'm trying
14356240	14363440	to, he thinks the universe is a computer and I want to turn the universe into a computer.
14363440	14367920	Yeah. That's, that's a small disagreement. So what would you, how would you defend your life
14367920	14372800	to an alien when you're being abducted? Would you focus on the specifics of your life?
14372800	14377040	No, no, no, I would be, I would try and be as random as possible and try and confuse them.
14377040	14384480	Oh, good. Good. Excellent. That might be the wiser choice.
14385120	14387680	The Easter eggs in reality? No, I mean, if aliens are abducted,
14387680	14391520	No, no, no, I would try and be as random as possible. I would try and do something that
14391520	14394720	would surprise the hell out of them, which I thought, I mean, they're probably risking,
14394720	14396720	they might kill me, but I think that might be funny.
14397520	14400320	Yeah, they might want to study you for prolonged periods of time.
14400320	14404960	My reasoning is if I wanted to stay alive, okay, so if the thing is I wasn't going back to Earth
14404960	14408800	and the job was to stay alive, if I could be as surprising as possible, they'd keep me around
14408800	14414560	like a pet, right? Pet Lee on the aliens. So you'd be okay being a pet?
14414560	14419520	Well, no, but I mean, the last human that survives would just be a pet to the alien.
14419520	14424960	I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun because then I might get some feedback
14424960	14428880	from their curiosity, but yeah. Let me ask you this question, given our
14428880	14434800	conversation has a very different meaning, more profoundly perhaps, but would you rather lose
14434800	14439040	all of your old memories or never be able to make new ones?
14442160	14446480	I would have to lose all my old memories.
14447520	14452240	Again, it's the novelty. What about you, Sarah?
14452240	14457120	I'm the same because I don't think like it's about the future experience, right? And in some sense,
14457760	14462080	like you were saying earlier, most of our lived experience is actually in our memories. So if
14462080	14465360	you can't generate new memories, it's like you're not alive anymore.
14467920	14473040	What comforts you on bad days? When you look at human civilization, when you look at your own
14473040	14479600	life, what gives you hope? What makes you feel good about what we're doing about life at the
14479600	14484720	small scale of you as a human and at the big scale of us as a human civilization, maybe the
14484720	14492880	big scale of the universe? Children, my kids, but I also mean that in like a grand sense of like,
14493680	14500320	not a grand, but like, like future minds in some sense. So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,
14500320	14504320	you know, people worry about apocalyptic things like AI existential risk and climate change,
14504320	14508480	which children of men, you know, the whole premise of the movie was there can be no
14508480	14513520	children born on the entire planet. And the youngest person on the planet is like 18 years old or
14513520	14519200	something. Like, can you imagine a world without children? It's just, it's harrowing. That's the
14519200	14527760	scariest thing. So I think what gives me hope is always youth and the hope of children and the,
14527760	14531760	you know, the possibilities of the future they see. And they grow up in a completely different
14531760	14539440	reality than adults do. And I think we have a hard time seeing what their reality actually looks like.
14539440	14543040	But I think, I think most of the time it's super interesting.
14543040	14548960	Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination, they have this kind of excitement. So it's so
14548960	14556560	cool. So fun to watch. And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way of all that
14557840	14563440	imagination. What about you, what gives you hope? So when I go back to my eight year old self,
14564480	14568800	the thing that I dreamed of as my eight year old self was this world in which technology became
14568800	14574320	programmable and there was internet and I get information. And I would expand my consciousness
14574320	14581760	by just, you know, getting access to everything that was going on. And this happened in my lifetime.
14581760	14585360	I mean, really do have that. I mean, okay, there's some bad things, you know, there's TikTok,
14585360	14589120	everyone just don't whatever, all the bad things about social media. But I think,
14592320	14597520	I mean, I can't quite believe my luck being born now. So amazing.
14598080	14600240	Be able to program reality in some way.
14600240	14603760	Yeah. And the thing that I really find fascinating about human beings
14604720	14610080	is that just how ingenious they are. I'm, you know, whether it's from my kids,
14611040	14618960	my research group, my peers, other companies, just how ingenious everyone is. And I'm pretty
14618960	14624640	sure humanity has a, or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital part in the future
14625360	14628880	is going to have a lot of fun. And I'm just, yeah, it's just, it's just mind blowing,
14628880	14635120	just to watch. And you know, so humans are ingenious. And I hope to help them be more
14635120	14641360	ingenious if I can. Well, what gives me hope, what makes me feel good on bad days is the existence
14641360	14648240	of wild minds like yours, novelty generators, assembly structures that generate novelty
14648880	14651520	and do so beautifully. And then tweet about it.
14652480	14656720	Sarah, this, I really, really enjoyed talking to you. I enjoy following you. I'm a huge fan.
14657440	14661600	Sarah Lee, I hope, I hope to talk to you many times in the future, maybe with your Shabak.
14661600	14664880	You're just incredible people. Thank you for everything you do. You're awesome.
14664880	14666560	Thank you for talking today. I really, really appreciate it.
14666560	14667360	Just relax. Thanks.
14667360	14668640	Yeah, I'm brilliant to be here.
14669680	14674320	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin. To support this podcast,
14674320	14679200	please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from
14679200	14687760	Arthur C. Clarke. Two possibilities exist. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not.
14688800	14697360	Both are equally terrifying. And let me, if I may, add to that by saying that both possibilities,
14697360	14702960	at least to me, are both terrifying and exciting. And keeping these two feelings in my heart
14702960	14709280	is a fun way to explore, to wander, to think, and to live always a little bit on the edge of madness.
14710080	14718880	Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
