1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
slaves produces surplus which the master gets, serfs produces surplus which the lord gets,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:16,000
employees produces surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,240
class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,720
group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,280
resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,440
The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff. One of the top Marxist economists and

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,360
philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic in general and for me personally given my family

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,800
history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism,

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,680
and Communism are used to attack and to divide much more than to understand and to learn.

10
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,320
With this podcast I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx as well as

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,120
their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries and in general we need to

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,840
both steal man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize and to challenge the ideas we

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,640
dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant and at times dangerous.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,600
This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,040
and now dear friends, here's Richard Wolff. Let's start with a basic question but maybe not so basic

16
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,320
after all. What is Marxism? What are the defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,240
political theory and ideology? Well the simplest way to begin the definition would be to say it's

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:20,640
the tradition that takes its founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because these

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,480
ideas that he put forward spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did, literally it's

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:41,440
140 years since Marx died and in that time his ideas have become major types of thinking

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,680
in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,

22
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,800
that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,120
And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity,

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,520
is that the Marxian ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,200
and economic conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently

26
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,320
in different places at different times and therefore Marxism as a kind of first flush

27
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:36,160
definition is the totality of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For

28
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:46,080
the first roughly 40-50 years Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism.

29
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,040
Marx himself, that's all he really did. He never wrote a book about communism,

30
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,560
he never wrote a book really about socialism either. His comments were occasional, fragmentary,

31
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
dispersed. What he was really interested in was a critical analysis of capitalism

32
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,160
and that's what Marxism was more or less in its first 40 or 50 years.

33
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:20,240
The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks.

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,720
In 1871 there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,120
Bismarck's Germany and in the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working class of

36
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,200
Paris rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian

37
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,880
society and Marx's people, people influenced by Marx were very active in that commune and the

38
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,880
leadership of the commune and Marx wasn't that far away. He was in London, these things were

39
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:04,080
happening in Paris, you know, that's an easy transport even then and for a short time, very

40
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:13,280
short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism, it became

41
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,640
a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been implicit, now it became

42
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,840
explicit what is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do and why and in what order,

43
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,720
and in other words governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted a few weeks,

44
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,520
the French army regrouped and under the leadership of people who were very opposed to Marx,

45
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,120
they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the of the communards as they

46
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,680
were called and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the

47
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:06,240
time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists,

48
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:16,320
Lenin Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again,

49
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:25,200
a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation

50
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,200
because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,

51
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,480
Brest-Litovsky and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts. And in that

52
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:49,600
situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, splits under

53
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:57,120
the pressures of all of this into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin Trotsky and the

54
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,520
others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short, he's in exile. His position,

55
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,680
Lenin's position, gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be killing

56
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,840
German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into colonies and

57
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,720
Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you can expect,

58
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,680
they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the comparable leader

59
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,520
at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist Party at this point,

60
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,160
that comes later, the head of the Socialist Party, a very important American figure named Eugene

61
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,640
Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument to the Americans should not fight in the war.

62
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,200
He has nothing to do with Lenin. I don't even know if they knew of each other, but he does it

63
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,560
on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the way, he runs for

64
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,440
president from jail and does very well. Really, very well, remarkable. And he's the inspiration

65
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:18,160
for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage politically than Bernie

66
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,840
has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link maybe later. History rhymes.

67
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,960
Yes, the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now

68
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:38,320
this seizure of power by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx,

69
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,920
developing what you might call a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians

70
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:52,640
too, but a Russian interpretation, this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism

71
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,960
into a plan at least. What are you going to do in the Soviet Union? A lot of this was then trial

72
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,640
and error. Marx never laid any of this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant

73
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,000
if he had, because it was 50 years earlier in another country, etc. What begins to happen,

74
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,400
and you can see how this happens then more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on,

75
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,880
is that you have kind of a bifurcation. Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of

76
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,160
capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set, and they differ from one to the other,

77
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,440
a set of notions of what an alternative post-capitalist society ought to look like,

78
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,520
how it ought to work, and there's lots of disagreement about it, lots of confusion,

79
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,720
and I would say that that's still where it is, that you have a tradition now

80
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,840
that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,

81
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,760
and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,

82
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,800
that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society

83
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,880
can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.

84
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,760
And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.

85
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,960
Fine. So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back,

86
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,360
what do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas

87
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,640
of Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?

88
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,840
Would he shake his head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations?

89
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,760
Like, how do you think he would analyze it? Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if

90
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,040
you've had a chance to take a look at his writing, but he had an extraordinary sense of humor. So

91
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,960
my guess is he would deploy his humor in answering this question, too. He would say some of them are

92
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,080
inspiring, some of the interpretations of his work, and he's very pleased with those.

93
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:19,200
Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could erase the connection between those things,

94
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,560
and the lineage they claim from him, which he would, there's a German word, I don't know if

95
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,360
he's like, if you speak the other languages, there's a wonderful German word called Verzichter,

96
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,960
and it's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse something,

97
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:45,520
but with real strong emphasis. Verzichter is a German way of saying, I don't want to do that.

98
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,600
And he would talk then, you know, in philosophical terms, because remember,

99
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,520
he was a student of philosophy. He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy

100
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,560
and all the rest. He would wax philosophical and say, you know, that the ideas you put out are a

101
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,720
little bit like having a child. You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own

102
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,480
person and will find his or her own way. And these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way.

103
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,040
And as you said, there's a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread

104
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,680
throughout the world made it even less able to be sort of stabilized and connected back to the

105
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,080
origins of where the idea came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians

106
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,080
after the revolution, because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they

107
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,600
occupied a position for a while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these

108
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,280
people criticizing capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid-century.

109
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,040
And these were the first guys who pulled it off. They made it. And so there was a kind of presumption

110
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,360
around the world. Their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it.

111
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:16,720
And so for a while, they could enunciate their interpretation, and it came to be widely grasped

112
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,520
as something which, by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism. The very idea

113
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,520
that you would put that adjective in front of Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian Marxism,

114
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,000
there were these words that where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the

115
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,520
cannon. You can depart from it, but this is the cannon. Before the Russian Revolution,

116
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:50,400
there was no such thing. And by the 1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time,

117
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,640
30, 40 years, it was a kind of, and the irony is, particularly here in the United States,

118
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,320
where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World War II is so total in this country

119
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:15,200
that I, for example, through most of my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time

120
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,440
simply explaining to American audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical

121
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:31,920
is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the cannon before 1917 and hasn't been

122
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,080
since at least the 1960s, but they don't know. It's not that they're stupid and it's not that

123
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,440
they're ignorant. It's that, well, the ignorance may be, but I mean, it's not a mental problem. It's

124
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,600
the taboo, shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way, recaptures what went before

125
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,200
and develops it in new direction, they just don't know. Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at

126
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:07,200
making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians, the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century

127
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,080
made a serious attempt at saying, okay, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually

128
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:19,120
build a system like this? And so in that sense, not at a high level, but at a detailed level,

129
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,880
it's interesting to look at those particular schools maybe. Right, because for example,

130
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,080
let me just take your point one step further, you really cannot understand the Cuban revolution,

131
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:38,080
the Chinese revolution, Vietnamese and the others, because each of them is a kind of

132
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:46,000
response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets did it. Are you going to do it that way? Well,

133
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,800
yes and no is the answer. This we will do that way, but that we're not going to do. And the

134
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,480
differences are huge, but you could find a thread, I can do that for you if you want,

135
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:07,520
in which all of them are, in a way, reacting to the originals. Yes, very much so. Like maybe most

136
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,040
of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones. That's something like that.

137
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,840
Well, can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools of that Soviet Marxism? So we

138
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:27,360
got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let's expand out to Maoism. So maybe I could

139
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:35,360
speak to sort of Leninism and then please tell me if I'm saying dumb things. There's a, I think

140
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:43,120
for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small, so the Vanguard party, like a small

141
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,680
controlling entity that's like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions. Then for

142
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,400
Stalinism, one interesting, so Stalin's implementation of all of this, one interesting

143
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,720
characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal Marxism to

144
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:14,160
make it all about nationalism, the strength of nation. So Maoism is different in that it's

145
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:24,240
focused on agriculture and rural. Then Trotskyism, I don't know except that it's anti-Stalin. I mean,

146
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,200
I don't even know if there's unique philosophical elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those

147
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,720
or something else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about

148
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,240
implementation of Marxism in the real world? Probably the best way to get into this is to

149
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,560
describe something that happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question.

150
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,200
In the early days of Marxist writings, and you know, his life spans the 19th centuries,

151
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:06,000
born in 1818, dies in 1883. So literally, he lives the 19th century. And you might, I mean,

152
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,240
to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the first two-thirds of his life

153
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:19,120
as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work. Marx was unusually

154
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,960
scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job and partly because

155
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,960
he was an exile in London, most of his adult life, he worked in the library. I mean, he had a lot of

156
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:39,680
time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels whose family were manufacturers. And you might say the

157
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:48,080
first half to two-thirds of his life are about the critique of capitalism. And that was what,

158
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,600
in a broad sense, the audience for his work, Western Europe more or less, was interested in.

159
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,960
That's what they wanted. And he gave that to them. He wasn't the only one, but he was very,

160
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:12,960
very effective at it. By the last third of his life, he and the other producers of a

161
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,400
anti-capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England, that's a whole other movement,

162
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,480
the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia,

163
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,800
and so on. You put all these together and there was a shift in what the audience,

164
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,640
let's call it a mixture of militant working-class people, on the one hand,

165
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:49,120
and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.

166
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,640
They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would

167
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,040
like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore,

168
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,800
should we? Why should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point,

169
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,520
the system has to be fundamentally changed. But they didn't go, you might imagine, they

170
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,000
didn't go and say, well, what will that new system looks like? They didn't go that way. What they

171
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,040
did was ask the question, how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have

172
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:37,760
captured people's minds, people's daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became,

173
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,040
this was already by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency,

174
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,080
the mechanism whereby we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation

175
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,920
focused on seizing the government. See, before that, it wasn't that the government was not a

176
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,480
major interest. If you read Marx's capital, the great work of his maturity, three volumes,

177
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,520
there's almost nothing in the state. I mean, he mentions it, but he's interested in the

178
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,320
details of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by store, office. What's the

179
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,520
structure? The government's secondary for him. But there's also humans within that capitalist

180
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,360
system of there's the working class. That's what he's interested in. Think of it almost

181
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,880
mechanically like the workplace. In the workplace, there are some people who do this and other people

182
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,560
who do that. And they accept this division of authority. And they accept this division of

183
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,040
what's going on here, particularly because he believed that the core economic objective of

184
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,920
capitalism was to maximize something called profit, which his analysis located right there in the

185
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,920
workings of the enterprise. And the government was not the key factor here.

186
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:09,120
And he was looking at ideas of value. How much is the, how much value does the labor of the

187
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,840
individual workers provide? And that means how do we reward the workers in an ethical way?

188
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,760
And so those are the questions of... Right, we'll get to that.

189
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,280
But the government was not part of that picture.

190
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,040
So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this

191
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:38,400
begins, but it really gets going after he dies. Is this debate among Marxists about the role of

192
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,280
the state? They all agree, nearly all of them agree that you have to get the state. The working

193
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:54,640
class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism.

194
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,600
When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of

195
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:11,120
them. And so the government is, in a sense, this key institution captured in Marxist language

196
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,240
by the bourgeoisie, by the by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of

197
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,000
suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way

198
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,720
capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution,

199
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:41,120
is to create a place where elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage

200
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,960
creates the notion, aha, here's how we're going to... We have to seize the state.

201
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,560
And then that gets agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how to do it. One side says,

202
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:02,480
you go with the election. You mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism.

203
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:11,200
And the other side is revolution. Don't do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged.

204
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,320
You can't get there. They've long ago learned how to manipulate

205
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,680
parliaments. They buy the politicians and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be

206
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,640
the way to do it. Revolution gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way.

207
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,800
They didn't do... I mean, they fought in the Duma in the in the parliament, but they didn't.

208
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:45,040
And this focus on the state, I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time

209
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,720
and if you're interested in the great names, there was a great theorist of the

210
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:58,880
role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power in Germany named Edward Bernstein.

211
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:07,520
Very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautzke and Rosa Luxemburg, two other huge

212
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,680
figures in Marxism at the time. And they wrote the articles that everybody reads, but it was a much

213
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,280
broader debate. And by the way, that debate still goes on. Reformism versus revolution.

214
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,240
And in terms of not all that different, I mean, it's adjusted to history, but in terms of different.

215
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,720
Can you comment on where you lean in terms of the mechanism of progress,

216
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,200
reformation versus... I'd rather tell you the historical story. Over and over and over again,

217
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,760
in most cases, the reformists have always won because revolution is frightening, is scary,

218
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:52,720
is dangerous. And so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant

219
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,160
discussion, not an abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.

220
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,280
I mean, and I'll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the 1930s,

221
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,320
you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States. The greatest shift to the left in

222
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:23,440
the country's history before or since. Nothing like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing

223
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,360
composed of the labor movement, which went crazy in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions

224
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,320
in the 1930s than at any time before or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time,

225
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,400
the explosion of two socialist parties and a communist party that became very powerful,

226
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,200
and they all worked together, creating a very powerful leftist presence in this country.

227
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:59,440
They debated in a strategically real way reform or revolution. The reformers were the union people,

228
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,120
by and large, and the communists were the revolutionaries, by and large, because they were

229
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,800
affiliated with the communist international, with Russia and all of that. And in between,

230
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,120
you might say, the two socialist parties. One that was Trotskyist in inspiration, and the other one

231
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:24,240
more moderate Western European kind of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended

232
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,880
up, the reformists won that debate. There was no revolution in the 1930s here. But there was

233
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,040
a reform that achieved unspeakably great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as

234
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,600
strong as it does, because it achieved in a few years in the 1930s, starting around 1932-3,

235
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,040
social security in this country. We had never had that before. That's the same one we have now.

236
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,760
Unemployment insurance never existed before, that you have till today. Minimum wage for the

237
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,080
first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment that hired 15 million people.

238
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,440
I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.

239
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
So that's the 30s and the 40s.

240
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,160
30s, not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's the best part. It was paid for by

241
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:24,160
taxes on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the government,

242
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:32,160
the joke is, I have to teach American history to Americans because it has been erased from

243
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,600
consciousness. We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of

244
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,920
the 20th century with the Russians. Right, with the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.

245
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:53,040
Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries. We

246
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:01,120
seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state and socialism is when the working class

247
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:09,120
captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses its power over the state to make

248
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,880
the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward. And again, make a long

249
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,680
story short in the interest of time. What happens, which is not unusual in human history, is that

250
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:31,440
the means becomes the end. In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear before he doesn't live very

251
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,800
long, he dies in 23. So he's only in power from 17 to 22. But at that time, he has his brain

252
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:46,080
in trouble. 1923, by the way, not at age 23. 1923. Yeah, he's only there for four or five years.

253
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,080
He's very clear. He even says, I've done work on that. I've published, so I know this stuff.

254
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,400
He says in a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state,

255
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,320
but we don't have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards that.

256
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,800
With Stalin, Lenin dies and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky loses the

257
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,120
fight. He's exiled. He goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power and does all the things he's

258
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:29,200
famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a decision. I mean, not that he

259
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:36,000
makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that they do the following. They declare that

260
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,920
they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state, not when the

261
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:54,400
state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other things. No, no. The state itself, once you have it,

262
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:02,560
is socialism. So when a socialist captures the state, that's socialism. Exactly. That's exactly

263
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,240
right. I feel like that's definitionally confusing. Well, it shouldn't be because I'll give you an

264
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,800
example. Yeah. If you go to many parts of the United States today and you ask people, what's

265
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,920
socialism? They'll tell you, they'll look you right in the face and they'll say, the post office.

266
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,920
And you know, when I first heard this as a young man, you know what? The post office. It took me a

267
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:35,840
while to understand the post office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States

268
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:44,480
where the government runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government

269
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,960
doesn't run it. If a private individual who's not a government official runs it, well,

270
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,080
then it's capitalism. If the government takes it, then it's socialism. So what is wrong with that

271
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,320
reasoning? So the idea, I think... There's nothing wrong with it. It's a way of looking at the world.

272
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,680
It's just got nothing to do with Marx. Well, there's Marx, there's Marxism. Let's try to

273
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:21,600
pull this apart. So what role does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned

274
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:30,560
with this class struggle, with respecting the working class. What is the connection

275
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,040
between that struggle and central planning that is often... Central planning is often associated

276
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:46,320
with Marxism. So a centralized power doing allocation. So that has to do with a very specific

277
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,840
set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union. Has nothing to do with Marx. How else can

278
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,720
you do... I don't think you can find anywhere in Marxist writing anything about central planning

279
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:09,280
or any other kind of planning. Again, fundamentally, then Marx's work has to do with factories,

280
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,400
with workers, with the bourgeoisie, and the exploitation of the working class.

281
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:23,520
You still have to take that leap. What is beyond capitalism? Right. So maybe we should

282
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:30,880
turn to that. Focus on that. Okay. We've already looked historically at several attempts

283
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,800
to go beyond capitalism. How else can we go beyond capitalism? Let me push it a little further.

284
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,600
They didn't succeed in my judgment as a Marxist. And I'm now going to tell you why they didn't

285
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,480
succeed because they didn't understand as well as they could have or should have

286
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,160
what Marxist was trying to do. I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time

287
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,600
under their circumstances. This is not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding

288
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,400
what's going on. All right. So give you an example. Most of my adult life, I have taught

289
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:14,240
Marxian economics. I'm a professor of economics. I've been that all my life. I'm a graduate of

290
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,280
American universities. As it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its

291
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,720
best universities. With another conversation, you and I can have. So I went to Harvard,

292
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,320
then I went to Stanford, and I finished a Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education.

293
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:42,000
They tried very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League, 20 semesters,

294
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,320
one after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word

295
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,160
about Marxism. That is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one

296
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,560
professor in Stanford in the one semester I studied with him. He gave me plenty to read,

297
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,280
but nobody else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past, and that's

298
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:18,640
very true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually through

299
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,160
this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it. Perhaps we can discuss historically

300
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,880
why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case. So Marxian economics, did Karl Marx come up in

301
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,400
conversation as a kind of dismissal? The best example, yeah, he came up only as an

302
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,480
object of dismissal. For example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with,

303
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,760
and that was for many years, the canonical book, isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a

304
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,400
professor of economics at MIT named Paul Samuelson. And people kind of, you know, a whole generation

305
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,120
or two were trained on his textbook. If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree,

306
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:15,120
and the tree is Adam Smith and David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of

307
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,040
it. He's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing developed. And it's a tree,

308
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,800
and everybody on it is the bourgeois. And then there's this one little branch that goes off like

309
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,560
this and sort of starts heading back down. That's Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it

310
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,800
complete because he's not a complete faker. But beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book

311
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:46,240
gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that's cold war. I mean, that's really,

312
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,600
that's really neat to hear. That's the craziness. Yeah, that's the cold war in this country. My

313
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,560
professors were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help.

314
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,240
Marx was interested in the relationship of people in the process of production,

315
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,680
that he's interested in the factory, the office, the store. What goes on, and by that he means,

316
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,320
what are the relationships among the people that come together in a workplace?

317
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:27,760
And what he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately

318
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:36,560
understood and that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation.

319
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,840
And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation, which he defines mathematically in the following

320
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:52,640
way. Whenever in a society, any society, you organize people, adults, not the children,

321
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,760
not the sick, but you know, healthy adults. In the following way, a big block of them,

322
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,320
a clear majority, work. That is, they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature.

323
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,280
A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater, whatever. In every human community,

324
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,960
Marx argues, there are the people who do that work, but they always produce more chairs,

325
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,720
more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume. Whatever their standard of

326
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,160
living doesn't have to be low, it can be medium, it can be hard, but they always produce more

327
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,600
than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he writes this, uses the German

328
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:48,160
word mehr, M-E-H-R, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the more. That more got badly

329
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:55,920
translated into the word surplus. Shouldn't it have been? But it was. By the way, by German

330
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,320
and English people doing the translations. What's the difference between more and surplus?

331
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,360
Is there a nuanced? Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary, it's sort of extra.

332
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,560
He's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation.

333
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,400
Yes, very simple. One minus the other. Yes. x minus y minus.

334
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,920
x is the total output, y is the consumption by the producer, therefore x minus y equals s the

335
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:35,760
surplus. Exactly. Now Marx argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following

336
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:44,880
question. Who gets the surplus? Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by

337
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:52,640
those who made it? And Marx's answer is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society.

338
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:00,960
How is that organized? For example, who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it

339
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,760
in exchange for getting it? What's their social role? For example, here we go now. If you get this

340
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:15,760
and you get the core of it anyway. And I don't charge much. The workers themselves could get it.

341
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,240
Western lawyers. That's right. The workers themselves could get it. That's the closest

342
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:30,400
Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers who produce the surplus

343
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,720
together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets it, but more

344
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,480
importantly, who gets to decide who gets it? Well, who gets it and who gets to decide what to do with

345
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:52,000
it. Right. Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it. So the logic of the

346
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,920
word sequence, it's produced, Marx uses the word appropriated, in other words, whose property,

347
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,120
who gets to decide, if you like, what happens, all that property ever meant,

348
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,080
is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of communism.

349
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,960
Right. And that's it. By the way, it's not just clean. It's the only one.

350
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,440
So what's, can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?

351
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,760
Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced

352
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,560
is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus

353
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:42,080
which the master gets, serfs produce a surplus which the Lord gets, employees produce a surplus

354
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:50,960
which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures,

355
00:41:50,960 --> 00:42:00,160
because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people,

356
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:08,640
not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment,

357
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,920
and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor,

358
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,080
simple metaphorical story. You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park,

359
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,520
a few blocks from here. It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those

360
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,360
men with an ice cream truck comes by, ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling, your children see the ice cream,

361
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:39,520
daddy, get me an ice cream. So you walk over, you take some money and you get two ice cream cones

362
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,760
and you give them to one of the children. The other one begins to scream and yell and how,

363
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,720
obviously, what's the issue? And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order

364
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,000
the one you gave the two ice cream cones to, give one of those to your sister or your brother or

365
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,600
whatever it is, and that's how you solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says,

366
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,640
you know, you didn't fix it by what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place.

367
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,880
My response, though you understand, all of the efforts to deal with inequality in

368
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,320
economic, political, cultural, these are all giving the ice cream cone back to the kid you should,

369
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,640
you should never do this in the first place.

370
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,320
The reallocation of resources creates bitterness and populace.

371
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:40,000
Look at our, we've, this country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my

372
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,840
life and I've lived here all my life and I've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself apart

373
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:53,600
and it's tearing itself apart basically over the re-division, the redistribution of wealth,

374
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,800
having so badly distributed in the first, but that's all in Marx. And notice as I explain to you

375
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,120
what is going on in this tension-filled production scene in the office, the factory, the store.

376
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,720
I don't have to say a word about the government. I'm not interested in the government.

377
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,360
The government's really a very secondary matter to this core question and here comes the big point.

378
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:27,280
If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter and substitute

379
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,680
a government official without changing the relationship, you know, you can call yourself

380
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,280
a Marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point of the Marxism. The point was not who

381
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,680
the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se. You've got to change the organization of the

382
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,160
workplace so there isn't a group that makes all the decisions and gets the surplus vis-a-vis

383
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,880
another one that produces it. If you do that, you will destroy the whole project. You will,

384
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,200
not only will you not achieve what you set out to get, but you'll so misunderstand it that you,

385
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,440
the Germans again have a phrase, it's get chief. It goes crooked. It doesn't go right. The project

386
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,560
gets off the rails because it can't understand either what its objective should have been and

387
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,000
therefore it doesn't understand how and why it's missing its objective. It just knows that this

388
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,520
is not what it had hoped for. I mean, there's a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is

389
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,480
to what degree, so there's human nature, to what degree does Communism,

390
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,320
a lack of exploitation of the working class naturally emerge if you leave two people together

391
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:51,440
in a room and come back a year later? If you leave five people together in a room,

392
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,120
if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people, it seems that humans form hierarchies

393
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:06,080
naturally. So the clever, the charismatic, the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you

394
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:16,080
define that, start becoming a leader and start to do maybe exploitation in a non-negative sense

395
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:23,120
a more generic sense starts to become an employer, not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human.

396
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,000
Here, you go do this and in exchange, I will give you this, just becomes the leadership role.

397
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:35,760
So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice. The idea sort of of Communism would be nice to

398
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,360
not steal from the world. It's nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because of human

399
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:48,000
nature. Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human

400
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:55,360
nature to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding in no particular order.

401
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:03,840
Here's some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell, is a history in which

402
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:18,720
a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise and as they do, they rule out some kinds

403
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,760
of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially disruptive and unacceptable.

404
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,840
The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct? Is there some human nature

405
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:38,800
that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is, this has to be repressed or else we don't

406
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:46,720
have a society. And Freud helps us to understand that that repression is going on all the time

407
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,240
and it has consequences. It's not a finished project. You repress it. It's gone. It doesn't

408
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,080
work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of people together at some point,

409
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:05,360
they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to want the other person or persons

410
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:13,040
to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to do that. We just don't.

411
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,680
Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it

412
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,000
on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every

413
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,120
effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you

414
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:44,240
endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological community that

415
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,480
has ever been studied, slavery wherever it's existed. I can show you endless documents in

416
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,880
which the defenders of those systems, not all of them of course, but many defenders used that

417
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:04,160
argument to naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,

418
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:11,520
to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.

419
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:19,440
And therefore capitalism since it was born and since it's been developing, we all know what the

420
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:26,720
next stage of capitalism is. Looking in fur. The burden is on the people who think it isn't going

421
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,280
to die. Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,

422
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,040
you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep using

423
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,720
that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive systems.

424
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:51,600
That said, well let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about the argument that

425
00:49:51,600 --> 00:50:01,920
sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk? So the versus the employee who's just there

426
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:10,560
doing the labor, the capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not in sort of

427
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,000
aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort hiring a lot of people? Aren't they

428
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,560
taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure? So first of all, there's risk almost

429
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:29,280
in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and ends in the future takes a risk

430
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,680
that between now and that future something's going to happen that makes it not work out.

431
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:41,840
I mean, I got into a cab before I came here today in order to do this with you. I took a risk. The

432
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,400
cab could have been in an accident, the lightning could have hit us, a bear could have eaten my

433
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,600
left foot. Who the hell knows? Should I reward you for the risk you took? No, hold it a second.

434
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,840
Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always found it wonderful. You talk about

435
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,600
risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk. Let's go with the worker

436
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:12,400
and with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to take

437
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:20,080
that job. He had, he made a decision to have children. They are teenagers. They're now in school

438
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,040
at a time when their friendships are crucial to their development. You're going to yank them

439
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:33,120
out of the school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk to do that job every day,

440
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,000
to forestall all the other things he could have done. He was taking a risk that this job would

441
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,520
be here tomorrow, next month, next year. He bought a house which Americans only do with mortgages,

442
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,600
which means he's now stuck. He has to make a monthly payment. If you make a mistake,

443
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,520
you capitalist. He's the one who's going to, you're a capitalist. You got a lot of money,

444
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,640
otherwise you wouldn't be in that position. You've got a cushion. He doesn't. If you investigate,

445
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,480
you'll see that in every business I've ever been in. I've been involved in a lot of them.

446
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,400
So you think it's possible to actually measure risk or as your basic argument is there's risk

447
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,760
involved in a lot of both the working class and the bourgeoisie, the capitalist, and it's very

448
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,040
difficult. The worker would never come and say, because he's been taught right,

449
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:35,680
I want this payment, a wage for the work I do, and I want this page, this payment,

450
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,040
for the risk I take. Well, there's some level of communication like that. You have acknowledgement

451
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,520
of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary, all those kinds of things.

452
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,840
But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.

453
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:57,200
You don't believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an

454
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:04,000
army of workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's

455
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,640
killing us. We get paid shit and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds

456
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,960
of the defenders of capitalism between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on

457
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,800
the one hand and the wage. Let me give you just a couple of examples, because this is my job.

458
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:32,400
This is my life, what I do. The median income of a child care worker in the United States

459
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:41,520
right now as we speak is $11.22 an hour median. So 50% make less, 50% make more.

460
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:50,240
The median income for car park attendant is several dollars per hour higher than that.

461
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:57,840
What does the car park attendant do? He stares at your car for many hours to make sure that nobody

462
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:06,720
comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it and moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure

463
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,600
that I know of that makes any rational sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four

464
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:20,400
year olds who are at the key moment of mental formation the first five years, to give that a

465
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,040
lower salary than you give the guy who watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it.

466
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:34,720
Gender explains all kinds of issues. The car park people are males and the day the child care

467
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,120
people are females and that in our culture is a very big marker of what, but the one who said

468
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:48,160
only the economics professor, nobody else says this stuff because in economy, I don't know if

469
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,920
you are familiar with our profession, but we have something which we call marginal product.

470
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,360
This is a, this is a fantasy. I was a mathematician before I became an economist. I loved mathematics.

471
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,400
I specialized in mathematics. So I know mathematics pretty well. What economists do is silly,

472
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:18,960
is childish, but they think it's mathematics. But think for a minute what it means to suggest

473
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,920
that you can identify the marginal product of a factor of production, like a worker.

474
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,080
In the textbook, when it's taught, I've taught this stuff. I hold my nose, but I teach it.

475
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:37,040
Then I explain to students what I've just taught you is horseshit, but first I teach it.

476
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,440
What is the marginal product if it might be useful to say?

477
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:45,440
The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the

478
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,520
diminution of the output? That's the marginal product of that worker.

479
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,920
Measured by- The amount of the output that diminishes-

480
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,160
Output of the raw product, of the product.

481
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,400
Usually in real terms, so physical, not the value. You could do a value,

482
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,240
but it's really more the physical you're at.

483
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,160
I mean, there is a transformation thing. I'd love to talk to you about value. It's so

484
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,680
interesting. What is value?

485
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,000
I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that, but I just want to get to the

486
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:25,840
that Hegel, who is Marx's teacher, has a famous line. You can't step in this in the same river

487
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:32,560
twice. The argument is you and the river have changed between the first and the second time.

488
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,040
So it's a different you and it's a different river. You can choose not to pay attention to that.

489
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,000
Just you can't claim you're not doing that. You can't claim that you can actually do that,

490
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,960
because you can't. There is no way to do that.

491
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,200
So the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean mathematical calculation

492
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,520
of the effect that it has on the output. That's right, because too many other things are going on,

493
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:02,560
too many things are changing, and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome

494
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:09,440
on the output side is uniquely determined by the change you made on the input side.

495
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,240
Can't do that.

496
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,080
Even in the average, it's not going to work out.

497
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:20,720
You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,

498
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,240
Keteris Paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did.

499
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,160
You held everything. You know why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world.

500
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,480
That's not possible. You better account for that. Otherwise, you're mistaking the abstraction

501
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,960
from the messy reality you abstracted from to get the abstraction.

502
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,600
As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment or an actual experiment

503
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,160
of removing every single economist from the world, would we better off or worse off?

504
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:52,960
Much better off.

505
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,680
Okay. Economics, and I'm one. I'm talking about myself. See, economics-

506
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,840
We're going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how the world works off.

507
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:11,760
No, but the serious part of this is that economics, you know, it's really about capitalism.

508
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,120
Economics as a discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing.

509
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,200
When I teach, I teach courses at the university, for example, called

510
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,480
History of Economic Thought, right? And I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.

511
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,320
And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things,

512
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,040
but they never called it economics. It made no sense to people to abstract

513
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:43,280
something as central to daily life as economics broadly defined. It made no sense.

514
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,480
That's a creation much, much later. That's capitalism that did that, created the feeling.

515
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,360
So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them particular passages.

516
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:00,640
By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it, Plato and Aristotle talked about markets

517
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,720
because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were beginning to intrude

518
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:14,480
upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena that we're not just producing

519
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,280
goods and then distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid pro quo. You know, I'll give

520
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,200
you three oranges. You give me two shirts, a market exchange. And both Aristotle and Plato

521
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:33,680
hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason, they destroy social cohesion. They destroy

522
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,520
community. They make some people rich and other people poor, and they set us against each other,

523
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,880
and it's terrible. And that's what they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on. One of them

524
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:52,240
said, okay, there can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says,

525
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,640
no, no, no, no, no, no. Too late for that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid

526
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:05,840
of this institution that has crawled in amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that.

527
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:14,160
But what we can do is control it, regulate it, get from the market what it does reasonably well,

528
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,880
and prevent it from doing the destructive things it does so badly.

529
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:25,200
So the fundamentally, the destructive thing of a market is the engine of capitalism. So

530
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:34,160
it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an institution

531
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:40,880
that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,

532
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,720
is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.

533
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,880
Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.

534
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,360
And this was that God said, if there's a person who needs to borrow from you,

535
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,760
then that's a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do is to help him,

536
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:15,120
to demand an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is God hates you for that.

537
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,480
That's a sin. Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.

538
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:26,640
But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the

539
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:35,520
intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able to create a system that involves

540
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:45,840
thousands, millions of humans. And there'd be some level of safe, self-regulating fairness.

541
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,240
There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.

542
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,920
I wonder what... I guess...

543
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:59,200
Suppose you were interested in having, suppose you took us your problem,

544
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,560
we have a set of funds that can be loaned out.

545
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,920
People don't want to consume it. They're ready to lend it. Okay.

546
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:13,520
To whom should they lend it? Well, we could say in our society,

547
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:20,400
we're going to run this the way professors in institutions like MIT work this.

548
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,080
They write up a project. They send the project in to some government office

549
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:33,200
where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government decides we're

550
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:40,320
going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in our society. We're in

551
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,280
greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend money to

552
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,960
people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here because we're

553
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:58,240
going to... But instead, what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate? Whoa, what do you do?

554
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:05,760
What ethics would justify you do it? It's like a market in general. Something is in shortage.

555
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,400
All markets are about how to handle shortage. That's one basic way to understand it.

556
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:16,080
And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word shortage

557
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,680
means, has no other meaning. If the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you've got a

558
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:28,560
problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough supply. You have

559
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:34,000
a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who have a lot of

560
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,200
money to bid up the price of whatever's short. That solves your problem because as the price

561
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:47,440
goes up, the poor people can't... They drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price.

562
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,520
So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people with the most money. At this

563
01:03:53,520 --> 01:04:00,800
point, most human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it

564
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:06,240
because it contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say,

565
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,920
what? You know what that means? It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk

566
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,040
and give it to their cat while the poor person has no milk for their five children.

567
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,320
There it is. Do you want to mark it? Why?

568
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,560
Over the fundamental thing that seems unfair, there's the resulting inequality now.

569
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,280
Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality. Yes, it is.

570
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,480
What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,

571
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:44,800
to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?

572
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:53,360
Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,

573
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:59,760
but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life,

574
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:07,920
to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments

575
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,440
that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces.

576
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:22,480
Not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined,

577
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,760
but just observing historically. Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff

578
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:34,240
that seemed to have made life easier and better on average. What do you say to that?

579
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:42,960
I have several responses to that, but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's

580
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:48,880
going on there. But let me give you the argument so that you can hear them and then you can evaluate

581
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:58,800
them as can anybody who's listening or watching. Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's

582
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:05,840
central arguments was that everything that exists, exists, quote, in the contradiction.

583
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,960
In simple English, there's a good and bad side if you like to everything,

584
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:17,360
and you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking for the good

585
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,200
things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the other side of the

586
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:29,760
good one, et cetera. The dialectic. Yes, exactly. Marx very attentive to that explicitly agrees

587
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,320
with this on many occasions and applies it, of course, to the central object of his research,

588
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:44,160
capitalism. This is not a simple-minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism

589
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:49,600
as if there were nothing that this system achieved or accomplished. One of the things he

590
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:59,200
celebrates a lot is the technological dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound,

591
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:05,920
because he lived at the time when major breakthroughs in textile technology, in mining,

592
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:16,880
in chemistry, and so on were achieved. But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible

593
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,400
for the improvement in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people,

594
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:31,520
Marx now comes back and says, oh, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system

595
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:41,680
has been mostly represented by capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists

596
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:50,560
with very few exceptions, some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the lives

597
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:58,480
of the mass of people. The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What that means is

598
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:04,880
replace a worker with a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap China,

599
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:11,040
bring in desperate immigrants from other parts of the world, because they will work for less

600
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:16,640
money than the folks that you have here at home. Every measure to help the standard of living

601
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:24,720
of American workers had to be fought for for decades over the opposition of capitalists

602
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,800
from the beginning to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was past 19,

603
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:36,960
middle of the 1930s, when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together,

604
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:44,720
they don't want, and today, just a factoid for you. The last time the minimum wage was raised

605
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:51,680
in the United States, federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty sum

606
01:08:51,680 --> 01:09:01,840
of $7.25 an hour, which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is,

607
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:08,720
not 11, 12, 13 years since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country

608
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:15,360
every year, and in the last year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up,

609
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:23,600
the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom,

610
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:36,320
of growing inequality. This is the nerve of the defender of capitalists who wants now to get

611
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:41,920
credit for the improvement in the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every

612
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:49,440
generation. You know, it takes your breath away. It's an argument, whoa. But I take my hat off if

613
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:58,000
I had one, because that is one of the only ways to justify this system. Long ago, let me get the

614
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:07,360
heart of it, long ago, capitalism could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease,

615
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:14,240
could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now, but it didn't. And that's the worst

616
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:23,600
moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify that when you could, you didn't?

617
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:29,120
Look, let me get at it another way, because this may interest you anyway.

618
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:37,280
The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic, it is. And along the way,

619
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,320
it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better, no question.

620
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:50,960
But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built into

621
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:59,520
capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous, and I can give you a, because you

622
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:06,400
do math, you'll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which you have

623
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:13,200
$100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,

624
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:20,080
and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers, and he puts them all together,

625
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:26,960
and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something at one of the prices,

626
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:35,120
and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,

627
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:42,080
let's say the revenue is, it doesn't really matter, it's 120, for lack of a better word,

628
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:49,520
220, sorry. And he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,

629
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,800
another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other 20 is his profit and he puts

630
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:02,880
that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough, a machine, a new machine. And the

631
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:12,160
new machine is so effective, you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers.

632
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,800
So you don't need to spend 100 on workers, you only need to spend 50. You can do it with half

633
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,920
the workers. And so the capitalist goes to the workers, by the way this happens every day,

634
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,600
and he says to half of them, you're fired. Don't come back Monday morning, I don't need you.

635
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:37,600
It's nothing personal, I got a machine. Why does he do that? Because the 50 he now no longer has

636
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,720
to spend on labor, because it doesn't need half of them, he keeps. Everything else is the same,

637
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:49,680
the machine, everything else is just to make their math easy. So he keeps as his own profit

638
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:57,280
the 50 that before he paid for those workers. Because when he sells it for 220, that 50 he

639
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:03,760
don't have to give to the next job until he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology

640
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:11,280
leads, he's happy. He's become more profitable. He's got an extra 50, which is why he buys the

641
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:19,360
machine. The workers are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their

642
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,720
husband and wife, tell them I don't have a job anymore. I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was

643
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:30,720
nice enough to say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need them. So I'm completely screwed

644
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:35,840
here. I don't know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's

645
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:41,680
education or whatever else he's got going for himself. All right, now, now the point. There was

646
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:47,200
of course an alternative path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers,

647
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,080
pay them exactly the same that you did before for half a day's work.

648
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:59,200
You would have got the same output, same revenue, same profit as before.

649
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:07,840
But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day of the lives

650
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:16,240
of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this technology,

651
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:23,920
but instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of more money.

652
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:30,880
You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.

653
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,520
So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation of

654
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:44,720
this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to ideas of what

655
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:49,920
the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative? So you just kind

656
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:57,120
of as a opposite by contrast showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work less,

657
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:05,760
get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other interests,

658
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:14,400
the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen and

659
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:21,920
embolden the basic humanity that's under all of us. Yes, but then what cost does that have

660
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:32,960
on the deadline fueled, competition fueled machine of technological innovation

661
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:39,200
that is the positive side of capitalism? It slows it down. It slows it down and the question is

662
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:46,960
which is more important for the flourishing of humanity? I agree with that and I'd love there

663
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:55,680
to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it, let's debate it and then let's decide what

664
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:00,960
mixture, because it's not either or, the math problem I gave you is either or we could mix it,

665
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:06,080
you could have a third less of a working day instead of a half less and then the other part

666
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:11,600
would be extra profit for our employer, et cetera. So let's have a democratic discussion

667
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:19,200
of what is the mix between the positive and we have no such thing. All of this is decided by

668
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:24,720
one side in this debate, which not only we know what they do, they always choose the one that

669
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:29,440
maximizes their profit because that's what they were told to do in business school where I've

670
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:37,200
taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision, but it's lopsided to boot. So we don't have the

671
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:43,920
opportunity, but I would love for us to be good Hegelian Marxists and say let's take a look at

672
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:50,240
the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can. We'll make mistakes, but we'll all

673
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:57,200
make them together. It won't be one of us making a dictatorial decision. Marx developed the notion

674
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,800
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, not as a notion of how government is not, I'm sorry, not

675
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,160
Marx, Lenin did that, not as a notion of how the government works, but as a notion of what the

676
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:15,760
practical reality is. The dictatorship of these key decisions is not made by some sitting council,

677
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,840
it's made by each little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace,

678
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,760
which is why Marx focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right

679
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:33,440
now so it doesn't lurk in the background what the alternative is. Let's go there. Okay. It goes

680
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:40,720
right back to what I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees together

681
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:49,280
appropriate their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it,

682
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:56,240
which includes the decision of whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not

683
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:05,920
to use the machine and the savings it might allow to be handled by more leisure for themselves

684
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:16,800
or as a fund for new developments in technology or new products or whatever they want. And you

685
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:22,480
this is an old idea in human. Marx loved that. Toward the end of his life, he

686
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,760
started reading extensively in anthropology. And one of the reasons he did that toward the end of

687
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,360
his life was because he kept discovering that in this society and that, including here in the

688
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:44,000
United States, that there were examples of people who organized their production in precisely this

689
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:52,480
way as a collective democratic community in which everybody had an equal voice. So we all

690
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:58,960
together decide democratically what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and what to do

691
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:07,600
with the output we all help to produce. So let's do it in, you know, in this country where democracy

692
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:17,360
is a value nearly everybody subscribes to. Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction

693
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:24,080
that there is a place in our society where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The

694
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:31,840
workplace, in the workplace a tiny group of people, unaccountable to the rest of them, the

695
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:38,080
employer, whether that's an individual, a family, a partnership, or a corporate board of directors.

696
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:46,400
Tiny group of people controls economically a vast mass of employees. Those employees don't elect

697
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,560
those people, have no, nothing, there is no accountability. It is the most undemocratic

698
01:19:53,280 --> 01:20:00,800
arrangement imaginable and this society insists on calling itself democratic

699
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:07,120
when it has organized the minor matter of producing everything in a way that is the direct,

700
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:15,600
it's autocratic. So to push back on a few things. So one is the idea of this society calling itself

701
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:21,520
democratic is that the government is elected democratically and the government is able to

702
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:27,760
pressure the workplace through the process of regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of

703
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,840
how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things. That's the one idea. The other is there

704
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:41,200
is a natural force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies of competition being the

705
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:49,040
accountability. So if you're a shitty boss, the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom

706
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,720
to move to another company work for a better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers and

707
01:20:54,720 --> 01:21:02,080
the bosses. That's at least the idea that you there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving.

708
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:09,120
One is the law. So regulatory regulations by passed by the government, democratic. And the second

709
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:15,600
is because there's always alternatives in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave

710
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:22,560
well because you can always leave. So I mean, that's kinds of accountability. But what you're

711
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:29,680
saying is that does not result in a significant enough accountability where the employer

712
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:36,080
that avoids exploitation of the worker. Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get

713
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:44,560
in those mechanisms. And let me respond to that. And then I'll counter argument. First, competition.

714
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:54,480
Here again, we have to be Hegelians just a little competition destroys itself. It doesn't

715
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,160
need any out. The whole point of competition is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same

716
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:06,960
product as the other guy, either a better quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because

717
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,160
the customers will come to me because my price is lower or my quality is better. And they'll

718
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:16,640
leave the other guy, he'll go out of business. Now let's follow. When he goes out of business,

719
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:23,440
because I won the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to

720
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:29,520
be able to serve a market. He can't serve anymore. So I'm going to buy the used equipment. I'm going

721
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:40,160
and thereby many become few. Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis.

722
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:47,040
It's the product. Well, let's see. That's where it comes from. There's another element to the

723
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:53,200
system where there's always a new guy that comes in. There isn't. Well, that's the dream. The

724
01:22:53,200 --> 01:23:00,640
entrepreneurial spirit of a free, of the United States, for example, of a capitalist system is

725
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:08,960
you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build up a business that takes on Google and

726
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:16,880
Facebook and Twitter and all the different car for GM, which is what you look at Tesla, for

727
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:23,680
example. That's the American dream. One of the many ideals of the American dream is you can

728
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:33,920
move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world. It can happen.

729
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,080
It can happen, but you're against it. That's like you can win a lottery.

730
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:44,240
No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here you can work your ass off if you have

731
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:50,240
a good idea. The odds are better in the lottery. That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.

732
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:56,720
How many Teslas do you know? Tesla is a really bad example because the car company, the automotive

733
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:05,200
sector is so difficult. They operate as such a thin margin of profit. They're probably a good

734
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:11,840
example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of lack of innovation.

735
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,640
That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain. They have their uniqueness as

736
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:26,000
you're quite right, but so does every other industry. The one thing that's common is that

737
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,720
many become few. What you can also have is when you have a few, they jack up the price. They make

738
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:39,920
an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism, Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize

739
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,720
people to break into this industry because the few remaining are making a wild amount of profit

740
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,040
because they are a few and can jigger the market to make it work like that for them.

741
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:00,480
The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market share, that's a polite way of

742
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,800
saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact, an oligopolist, one of a handful

743
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:12,240
of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for. To push back a little bit also,

744
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:20,080
because this is a question also, do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism?

745
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:30,320
It completely removes the basic decency of human beings. If you give me a choice to press a button

746
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:37,040
to get rid of the competition, but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering. There's a lot of

747
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:42,400
people at the heads of companies that won't press that button. It's not in the calculation,

748
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:48,240
it's not just money, it's human well-being too. You think?

749
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,680
Yes. You and I don't live in the same place then.

750
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:58,640
You're saying that the forces of capitalism take over the minds of the people at the top,

751
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,960
and then they seize being human. No.

752
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:05,360
The basic, okay. I wouldn't, I wouldn't.

753
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:10,640
Depending on your model of humans, but they lose track of the better angels of their nature,

754
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:15,600
and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cop at the top.

755
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,560
I would put it differently, that the system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural selection.

756
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:26,560
The guys who may, I could say the women too, it doesn't matter. The people who make it up through

757
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:33,040
the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along the way

758
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:38,160
that becomes selective. If they can't stand it, because they have that human quality,

759
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:43,760
and there are people like, I've known them. They're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont.

760
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,440
They went there and they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that.

761
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,960
I'm going to make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm going to

762
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:01,520
be enjoying the people that come by and be a decent human. Of course, of course, but the system

763
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:07,680
selects the firm. If you don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up,

764
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:12,880
you're toast there anyway. The rest of the people who vote for you are going to kick you out.

765
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,600
You can tell them all day long what a lovely person you are. They're going to look at you and

766
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,760
wonder, what happened to you? How did you even get this far with the lovely person horses?

767
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:31,360
It's not necessarily just lovely person. Maybe, I'll just say my bias is the people I know are

768
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:40,800
and especially at the top of companies are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big

769
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:47,760
part of it. I think a lot of the things we're talking about is when there's not much innovation

770
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:56,560
in the system. Innovation usually comes in the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.

771
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,600
There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you

772
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:08,160
want to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes and then there's

773
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:15,200
a flurry as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is and then you

774
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:20,400
have a period where you can get excited about that and the very rich people who come to the top

775
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,840
can talk endlessly as they always do about innovation.

776
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:33,280
But again, you know, it really is, this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring kind

777
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:42,560
of issue. For me, how do I put this in a way that, you know, I don't mean to offend, so please,

778
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,120
please. No, no, no, I don't want to. But

779
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:57,520
the problem with capitalism is, and maybe you'll like this, the problem with capitalism is

780
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,680
not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders

781
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:10,640
would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite, that it is such a

782
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:19,120
contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite make it.

783
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,960
There's always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking about,

784
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:32,320
who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top. By God knows

785
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:38,960
what hook or what crook that they did it, but most of them go, and you know why? Because

786
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:48,240
their humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do. I mean, the corporate

787
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:58,240
sector this year, just to give you an idea, CEOs are jacking up their wage package. They're already

788
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:05,280
out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now 300, 300 times what the average worker pays,

789
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:09,920
but they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's what's happening in their universe. That's

790
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,640
what they're all doing it, and they have to do. Each one of them justifies that I have to do that,

791
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:20,000
otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one, which of course is true, but is no comfort for the mass

792
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:27,920
of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument isn't very exciting. So they're doing that at a

793
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:35,040
time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone through the COVID disaster. They've gone

794
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:41,600
through the worst, second worst economic crash of capitalism in our history. After two years of this

795
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:48,480
one-two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch, and we are now predicting rising interest

796
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:53,920
rates and a recession at the end of the year or early next year. You can't do this to a working

797
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,760
class. When this was done to the German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result.

798
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:05,600
You keep doing that in this country. We're already watching it. You're going to get that too.

799
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,080
You're already getting bits and pieces. You can't keep doing this.

800
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:12,000
So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.

801
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,160
Taking out on it. That can turn to anger.

802
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:21,120
Some little 18-year-old kid who has to go three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket.

803
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:26,080
What? And it happens every day in this country. Every day.

804
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:33,120
So that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger, potentially.

805
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:40,400
By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality, and this goes to Elon Musk.

806
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:50,000
If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number

807
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:57,040
was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.

808
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:03,600
They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous in our resources.

809
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:12,800
There is a way to make transportation much more rational, and we've known it for decades.

810
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:20,240
It's called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained crystal clear,

811
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:30,000
clean, frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this

812
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:37,760
society. In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That's less than

813
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:44,000
we're sending to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it. A public transit system where?

814
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country's overwhelmingly

815
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,760
metropolitan area. Well, it surely has to be more than $30 billion. Well, it was a few years ago.

816
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,800
You're saying it's not a number that's insane. Right. It's not crazy stuff.

817
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,600
It's a reasonable number. Let me just finish the point.

818
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:08,480
Sure, yes. Okay. So I'm trying to be rationally here.

819
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,680
If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with

820
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:20,640
fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use of the fossil fuel,

821
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:25,920
particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass transit.

822
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,400
We don't, we're doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.

823
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,720
Well, there's, you know, on, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public

824
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:43,600
transit because it's going to be reasonable vehicles. It will end in theory car ownership.

825
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,640
So you just have a more kind of distributed public transit system.

826
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:52,400
If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal and the major goal of

827
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:59,600
the other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share by smaller, so they have some,

828
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:05,120
four General Motors Toyota, all of them are making electric cars. So what they've done is

829
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:10,480
they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.

830
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:15,200
That's fucking nuts. What are you doing? That's one of the things they're doing,

831
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,560
but automation is also another one. But on the Elon side, there's also

832
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:25,520
a hilariously named boring company, which is working on tunnels, which is actually expanding the

833
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,640
flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit. I think, listen,

834
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:38,560
I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know what a public

835
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:45,680
transit system is, period. There's F-150 pickup trucks. Well, there's, this is an interesting,

836
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:53,360
so the older, by the way, footnote, the older the city, the more likely it has public transportation.

837
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,480
So you're saying Boston is the best example? Yes.

838
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:00,400
Have you been, you know? Yeah, yeah. Of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.

839
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:05,120
Boston with the street railway. Boston is your case study of how to do this,

840
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,920
because they've been doing it all along. New York's pretty good too.

841
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:10,960
There's a trade out. Yeah. New York, I would say, is better than Boston because

842
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:17,200
there's, you know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.

843
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,560
It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point. But there is a,

844
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:32,000
the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America. And there is a practical nature to

845
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:39,920
the fact that in order to do public transit, in order to do some of these things that you're

846
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:44,880
talking about with the working class, there has to be a central planning component,

847
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:52,960
or there has to be a centralized component. And America is very much based on the idea of,

848
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,600
at least in recent times, I would say from the founding of individualism,

849
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:05,840
of respecting individual freedom. Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of

850
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:14,480
Marxism to life, you would trample on individual freedoms? No. Can you respect both? Sure. For

851
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:22,240
me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who have had

852
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:28,640
that freedom eroded under the capitalism. That's a motive for my Marxism. It was for Marx too.

853
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:36,160
He loved the French Revolution. He loved the liberté, égalité, fraternité, the great three,

854
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:41,680
and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like. He believed in all of that. His critique

855
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:48,160
of capitalism was it promised it and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond

856
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:57,520
it is because it didn't deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of

857
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:08,560
a gender. But again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, so if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way

858
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:18,240
it's set up in this society. Some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been

859
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:24,960
pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's bad and what's dangerous

860
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,440
and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in and tell you what

861
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:34,320
to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem. There really is no

862
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:40,640
other way to explain the following in American politics. Large numbers of people lose their

863
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:48,640
homes in a downturn, like the so-called Great Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government.

864
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:54,240
Large numbers of people go unemployed. And what are the media all about? The government.

865
01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:01,360
If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kick the workers by throwing them out of their home,

866
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:06,800
and they don't get angry with me. They get angry with the government. I fire large numbers of people.

867
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:11,680
I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a result of having no job and no income.

868
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:19,840
And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. This is a genius stroke.

869
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,560
In theory, but if you look at government, because you said accountability in the

870
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,640
capitalist system has no accountability. There's some pushback I give on the accountability. I

871
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,800
think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Galilean way. There's more accountability

872
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:42,000
for, I would say, that in theory, government is perfectly accountable. That's the whole point

873
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,560
of a democratic system, is you vote people in. In practice, there's a giant growing bureaucracy

874
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:53,120
that is accountable only on the surface. There's two parties

875
01:38:54,400 --> 01:39:02,960
that seem to be, are the same media somehow integrated into making the same two parties

876
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:09,280
that are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing

877
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:15,040
and bitterly arguing and calling each other's names, nasty names and all those kinds of things.

878
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:23,440
Okay, but that's government. So who exactly is worse here? Government or companies?

879
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:30,400
Well, why are we asking that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about

880
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:35,600
Republicans and Democrats just now, with which I agree, I would say the same thing about corporations

881
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,320
and the government. This is the same people, literally. But let's go to Churchill. Which one

882
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:46,080
is the, which one is worse? Let's go to Churchill, like democracy is the worst formal government,

883
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:51,440
except all the other ones or whatever. So this kind of same idea, which one exactly is worse?

884
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:57,600
Because to me, it seems like, which one between what government and industry and companies?

885
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:07,200
It's because government is plagued by, I will call it corruption because the corruption of

886
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:13,840
bureaucratic paperwork and then because they're, but they're not accountable. There doesn't seem

887
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:19,040
to be a serious accountability. Again, we're not see, we're not living on the same planet.

888
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:28,960
The greatest practitioners of central planning are corporations. Elon has an operation like

889
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:37,680
General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other mega-corps. They have to plan. They buy up companies

890
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:44,640
because they don't want to deal in the market. They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of

891
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:51,920
having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control. They want the

892
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:58,160
professor to teach the genius of a market. They hate the market. And when they grow to be big,

893
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:03,360
they keep buying whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them,

894
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:10,720
which requires them then to plan the production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying

895
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:18,960
them in the market. The model of the government is a private corporation. I have spent my life,

896
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:25,040
give you an example, in American universities, big ones, famous ones, not just as a student,

897
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:30,160
but as a professor. I teach now at the new school here. It's another one, right?

898
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:38,880
They will model themselves after businesses. You can attack the bureaucracy of universities,

899
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:48,240
good reason, it's a mess, but they're proudly modeling themselves on organizing their bureaucracy

900
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:56,080
in a business-like manner. So you're looking at a difference which isn't there. The government

901
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:03,200
and the private sector are partners and both of them wouldn't have it any other way. The corporations

902
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:09,920
want that from the government and the government now knows that to please the corporations is the

903
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,360
number one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs and keep their system

904
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:20,640
going. And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.

905
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:27,920
But there's important differences that I don't know if they're fundamental or just a consequence

906
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:32,880
of history, but if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than companies.

907
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:39,040
Companies are accountable by, especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable by sort of

908
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:43,200
the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling.

909
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:53,200
The government is accountable by votes and it seems like government, unlike companies,

910
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:59,760
for most of companies, history is always too big to fail, meaning it can always just print

911
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:09,840
money. It can always save itself and that creates a bureaucracy. You rarely pay the cost of having

912
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:16,640
made bad decisions if you're in government. You distribute the blame and it's very unclear

913
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:21,440
who's responsible for bad decisions. So bad decisions in government accumulate. So you become

914
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:27,520
more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor in your decision making in terms of,

915
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:32,880
you said public transit, should we build a public transit system in this city or not?

916
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:38,000
That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting decision. I would say it's very often a very good

917
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:45,280
decision, but whoever makes that decision should be accountable for a good or bad decision and it

918
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:53,120
seems like companies are more accountable. They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more

919
01:43:53,120 --> 01:44:00,960
because they can go bankrupt. There's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering

920
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:07,600
decisions. Government doesn't seem to be under the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with

921
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:14,080
that? I disagree with that. Everything in my history pushes me. You may be living... I may be

922
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:22,320
living in a different... Who knows? A planet or taking a different sort of drug. I won't mention

923
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:29,360
the name but I personally had a lot to do with a very large company here in the United States,

924
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:40,400
here in the New York area and it involved two brothers and a family who built it up into a

925
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:51,360
huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo of the family and he was more responsible

926
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:57,040
than anybody else building it up. But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his

927
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:05,200
brother so the one brother who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes became a vice

928
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:13,360
president, got an enormous salary, got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from

929
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:24,000
where I'm sitting right now and that was the way that family handled that company and all of his

930
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:32,400
relatives that were somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever because in my experience

931
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:39,920
with this and because I went to the schools I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,

932
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:46,720
corporate execs, full of those stories, you know, they made mistake after mistake which they would

933
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:55,600
tell you about, didn't undermine there. They were always able to blame somebody else, something else

934
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:01,280
that scraped them through and had they not been able to they would have been replaced by another

935
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:08,640
person who did the same thing for as long as they could and they knew it. They would talk about it

936
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:16,080
at family events, that's how I know. I understand that you want the outside world to look at it

937
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:25,120
this way but it's not my experience. But again, that kind of thing at the risk of saying human

938
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:34,080
nature again, I wonder what kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is the question

939
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:40,400
of, I would call that, let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption, which system allows

940
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,800
for more corruption. But remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less

941
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:52,240
government, it's more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when

942
01:46:52,240 --> 01:47:00,560
everybody has a vote, when you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are

943
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:06,800
to a larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is

944
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:12,320
that most companies are responsible to and now you've got a whole different universe. It's not

945
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:18,640
a small group of people, can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden, most of it on and on and on.

946
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:24,000
This is, you know, worker co-ops is what this is called in many parts of the world. So it's not

947
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:30,320
that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism I understand

948
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:39,520
is to pick from historical precedents the things that we think will work better. And I think if

949
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:45,040
all the people in an enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically decided, they would

950
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:50,880
never give two or three individuals $100 million while everybody else can't send their kid to

951
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:59,840
college. If they can do that. So just to return, just to address this point about the particular

952
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:07,040
implementation of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union, why did Stalinism,

953
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:12,800
for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, in human suffering? Is there any elements

954
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:23,040
within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system

955
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:29,040
that led to that bloodshed? I don't think so. I think there are many things that led to the

956
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:37,840
bloodshed and so all that Stalin's regimes did. And, you know, I spent 10 years in my life

957
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:46,240
with another economist writing a book about that to try to explain from a Marxist position

958
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:52,720
the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. You might want to take a look at it sometime, but

959
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:58,000
there, I'm going to say a few things now, but all of those things are spelled out

960
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:07,440
in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc., in that work. Let me start with, you know,

961
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:18,320
playing a little bit with Hegel. The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union

962
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:24,000
was really not so much what the Soviet Union did, but what the rest of the world did.

963
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:30,880
I mean, you had a really interesting move, and I'll give you a parallel from today.

964
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:40,880
The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed. World War I just, it fell apart.

965
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:47,120
The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already been in trouble. There was a

966
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:53,520
revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. I mean, if you know Russian history,

967
01:49:53,520 --> 01:50:01,760
which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917.

968
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:09,840
And in some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize

969
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:17,440
the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. You know, earlier on with Karensky,

970
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:24,000
the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people more

971
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:31,040
skeptical and would not have been called Marxists, probably, by history. They couldn't, they tried.

972
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:36,960
They couldn't. Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.

973
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:46,160
The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken this

974
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:53,920
immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes,

975
01:50:54,560 --> 01:51:02,160
but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power and in a big country. And they freaked out.

976
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:09,760
If you know American history, this country, the leadership of this country, went completely berserk.

977
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:16,880
I mean, we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s

978
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:27,840
were a time of palmerades in Boston, the Sakhal Vanzetti trials, really grim hostility. And you

979
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:34,000
had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution. The U.S.,

980
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:41,840
Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops. So what you had right away was

981
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:50,400
a notion in the West that this was, this was unthinkable. This was, there was a great professor

982
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:58,400
at Princeton, Meyer, forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all American foreign

983
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:07,920
policy since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about

984
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:14,480
Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven't figured out. That was a big

985
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:23,280
change back in 1989 and 90, you know, Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least

986
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:27,680
they're not lending. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case.

987
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:38,720
So you had one factor was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global, I mean,

988
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:45,200
Rosa Luxemburg is, I mean, I assume you know the, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets

989
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:51,840
of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenin's, by the way, but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into

990
01:52:51,840 --> 01:53:00,240
bits, killed. So you are attributing some, some of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the

991
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:05,440
rest of the world turned away. Turned against. Turned against, sort of, you turn against is the

992
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:11,360
better way. Very, yeah, I mean, not in order of importance, but it's, it's a very important part

993
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:18,160
of the psychology of being, you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite

994
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:23,440
as much evidence that indeed there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it.

995
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:30,960
Look, you could see the effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first,

996
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,480
that you could have socialism in one country. That was thought to be

997
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:42,080
ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism. Marx was, Marx was against capitalism everywhere.

998
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:48,400
It was, you know, workers of the world unite, not workers of Russia unite, workers of the,

999
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:55,680
he had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms with the fact that the

1000
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:02,320
revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin, was tried in Munich, was tried in

1001
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:10,160
Budapest, was tried in Seattle here, they all failed. They all failed, and he's left. So,

1002
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:17,520
the French would say, tout ça, right, you know, all alone. That's one. The second thing is economic

1003
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:24,960
isolation. Russia's a poor country and it needed what it got before the war, which were heavy

1004
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:30,080
investments from the French and the Germans, particularly, but others too. Now this was all

1005
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:37,040
cut off. And you can see the replay with the sanctions program. It's, we're gonna do it again,

1006
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:41,680
we're gonna do it again. We have to do, we have, the world is different and the sanctions don't

1007
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:49,360
work, but they're gonna try them. Because it's the history. But that culture was, today is

1008
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:54,800
completely different. Russia's a different place today, but Russia has China and that changes

1009
01:54:54,800 --> 01:55:00,160
everything. And they don't get that here yet, but they will. Yeah, there's a very complicated

1010
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:08,960
dynamic with China, even with India. Yep. Or Turkey. Brazil. Sorry to say human nature may

1011
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:15,120
change at a slower pace than the geopolitical. That has occurred to me as well. I get that point.

1012
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:21,520
So is there a, can you steel man the case or consider the case that there's something about

1013
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:28,400
the implementation of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working

1014
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:36,080
class and the workers unite, that naturally leads to formation of a dictatorial force,

1015
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:46,240
a dictator that says, let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details

1016
01:55:46,240 --> 01:55:52,560
of how to run the democracy of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose.

1017
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,120
And then that naturally leads to a dictator and there's naturally inhuman nature,

1018
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:05,040
power and absolute power as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever

1019
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:12,080
you focus on Marx's ideals, you're going to end up with a dictator and often when you give too

1020
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:16,160
much power to anyone, human, a small number of people, you're going to get into a huge amount

1021
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:22,480
of trouble. You've put things together there that I would, I think if you, if you give,

1022
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:31,360
put as a word, yeah, as German, the, if you, I remember, I told you my mother was born in

1023
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:37,920
Germany. And then your dad is French. Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know you're European.

1024
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:45,600
It's a city on the border of France and Germany. If you come from, Alsatians, Alsace in Germany.

1025
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:51,440
So they're German speaking. Yeah, they're both. It's bilingual because it's been back and forth

1026
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:57,040
so many times in medieval days already that it literally, you go from one store to another,

1027
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:02,400
the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German, but they all speak both languages

1028
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:09,200
because you don't speak either of them. I speak Russian. Russian, but not German.

1029
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:14,000
Ukrainian, no, it took French for four years in high school, but I've forgotten all of it.

1030
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:19,120
I remember the romance and the spirit of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can

1031
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:29,280
remember. If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long

1032
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:38,880
period of time and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks

1033
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:43,760
and it stays and you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution

1034
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:51,040
and you will discover it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people

1035
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:59,520
don't. If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism

1036
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:04,400
and that it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was Zeus

1037
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:10,880
and Diana and all the others and they were very human like, but instead we have one who is the

1038
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:19,120
absolute beginning and what are you doing? You're teaching people an authority line

1039
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:25,040
that comes from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings, if in your feudal manner

1040
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:31,600
the Lord sits called to the landlord, he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on

1041
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:38,160
and you do this for thousands of years, you can make a Russian revolution in 1917,

1042
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:44,960
but if you imagine you've gotten away from all that people assume without ever thinking about it,

1043
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:54,480
you're going to have trouble. Stalin is figured here as the originator of his situation. He

1044
01:58:54,480 --> 01:59:01,040
wasn't. He never had that power. He may have thought that, but I don't. He's the product.

1045
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,120
Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn't that kind of guy. You know, he's a

1046
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:15,600
baseball playing lawyer. That's what he was, but they made him into Tala. You're the product of

1047
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:22,480
history. No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the literature. It was the structures and

1048
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:31,200
institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has its own rhythm and doesn't follow the

1049
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:35,520
calendar of a political revolution. That's the fundamental question. Is there something about

1050
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:44,400
communism that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?

1051
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:51,120
No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what

1052
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:56,720
they find familiar to what seems to make sense and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example

1053
01:59:56,720 --> 02:00:02,720
from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party

1054
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:11,280
of private enterprise and minimum government. Income Trump runs for office in 2016, is elected.

1055
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:19,680
Okay, what does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most massive

1056
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:27,440
government intervention in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades. Nobody says anything.

1057
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:38,880
The Republicans cave and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on anything.

1058
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:44,160
He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.

1059
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:50,080
That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman

1060
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:55,040
course in economics, which everybody knows. Everybody who teaches these courses knows.

1061
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:02,000
It doesn't matter. He's still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come

1062
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:13,680
to a point where it can't solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all

1063
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:22,400
of the laissez-faire and all of the individualism. Suddenly the Republican Party is gone and now

1064
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:27,520
they're going to make an abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with

1065
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:35,680
your uterus. What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power.

1066
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:43,280
They're hoping what? Do they like the government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro-government

1067
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:51,440
and it wasn't in Russia. They were in a desperate fix. He took advantage.

1068
02:01:52,640 --> 02:02:01,040
To which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the

1069
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:11,280
national socialism party of German workers, hence the Nazi party, the fascist party in the 30s

1070
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:17,360
and the 40s at the head of whom was Hitler, which had just recently learned he was

1071
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:23,680
employing number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party

1072
02:02:23,680 --> 02:02:30,160
and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history of

1073
02:02:30,160 --> 02:02:38,000
the 20th century? What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the national

1074
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:51,600
socialist party of German workers, workers. National socialist German worker party.

1075
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:58,880
Worker party. National socialist German worker party. Here's the history. Did he care about the

1076
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:04,880
workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message? The only thing that Marxism

1077
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:11,920
did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power, but had nothing, no

1078
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:15,840
other. He didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything about it, nor did the people around

1079
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:21,520
him. Here's the story of what happened there, which I know largely through my own family and

1080
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:28,240
plus my own history of the work that I did. The most successful socialist party in Europe

1081
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:35,440
was the German party. It started around 1870. Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were

1082
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:43,360
leaders, Ferdinand LaSalle and other his daughters. By the end of the century, it was the second most

1083
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:51,040
important party in Germany. Nobody understood it. It was over. It was almost as big a shock to the

1084
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:58,000
Europeans as was the Russian Revolution in 1917. Here was a political party that was now in

1085
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:07,760
every German city, in every German town, powerful and enjoying its rise up. That's my family is

1086
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:16,320
involved in this. I mean, I really do know the story. It meant that starting around 1968,

1087
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:26,640
if you wanted to have any kind of presence in the German working class, you had to use the word

1088
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:32,960
socialist. You had to. Otherwise, they wouldn't pay attention. The other parties called themselves

1089
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:39,760
Catholic. Germany is divided. The northern two thirds is Protestant. The southern third is

1090
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:45,600
Catholic. Munich and Bavaria is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant.

1091
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:52,640
You could be in the Catholic party. That was the south. Or you could be in various conservative

1092
02:04:53,440 --> 02:05:00,000
Prussian. If you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing in Germany,

1093
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:06,640
a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time, Germany was the major

1094
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:12,640
competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and

1095
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:22,080
US taking over from Britain's empire. The German working class was it. Anybody who wanted to approach

1096
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:29,840
the working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.

1097
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:37,760
Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word socialist in their party,

1098
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:43,680
but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't anything to do with the Soviet Union

1099
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:49,920
or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first four letters

1100
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,560
of national, national in German, and they ZI's how you spell national in the German

1101
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:01,520
national socialism, but definitely not communists. That's right. They killed communists. They fought

1102
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:08,960
communists in the street. They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each other's existence

1103
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:15,040
and their life. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and Gypsies

1104
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:20,080
and all the other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were the number one

1105
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:26,640
and socialist right behind them. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of 1933,

1106
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:33,840
that's when Hitler takes power. The last elections, two of them in 1932, the socialist and communist

1107
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:41,760
to vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany. So he appealed to the German manufacturers,

1108
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,480
the German capitalists, and he said, the communists and socialists are going to win.

1109
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:53,920
And you're just the capitalists. You have too few people. You need a mass space,

1110
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:56,160
and I'm the only one that can do that.

1111
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,600
So it was just the populist message that he used.

1112
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:07,360
That's right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,

1113
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:12,000
the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,

1114
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,880
you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have done it. He had

1115
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:23,680
called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as a little

1116
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:29,760
funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German, for them that mattered.

1117
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:38,480
So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism, which he immediately does.

1118
02:07:40,640 --> 02:07:46,800
Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word.

1119
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:52,240
You know, it's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,

1120
02:07:52,560 --> 02:08:00,880
we are not a democracy. We are a republic, which is like saying, I'm not a banana. I'm a fruit.

1121
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:07,840
You have to explain to these people a banana. So you have to explain to people, yes,

1122
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:14,080
we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic,

1123
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:18,560
because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have to go through

1124
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:24,000
that with people, so they kind of get it. And certain words have power beyond their actual

1125
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:31,440
meaning that's used in communication, whether it's negative, like racist or positive, like freedom

1126
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:36,720
of speech or Democrat or Democrat with a D. Yeah. And then you use that to mean something.

1127
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:43,760
Who knows? Or negative, what, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist or something, whatever that

1128
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:48,240
means that's not even used as any kind of philosophical or economic sense.

1129
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:52,080
So let's fast forward to today. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.

1130
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:59,040
There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic

1131
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:04,080
socialism and maybe let's try to start to sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly

1132
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:14,400
mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's from these parts. So maybe if you can comment on

1133
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:23,680
Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism? Are they representing those

1134
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:34,400
ideas well in both economic and the political sense? Okay. Where do I begin? The socialist

1135
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:42,800
movement predates Marx was always larger than Marx and has gone on to develop separately after

1136
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:50,320
Marx's death. So can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line

1137
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:58,880
between Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to

1138
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:05,040
maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?

1139
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:16,560
Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics and as I said earlier,

1140
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:29,120
devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism and that's its strength, how it does that,

1141
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:36,720
how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works, that is really the

1142
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:44,880
forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism

1143
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:51,360
figures it's there so that people who aren't Marxist are nonetheless aware of Marxism,

1144
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:59,600
like it more or less, study it more or less, but it's a broader notion that I like to use

1145
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:07,600
this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really

1146
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:17,120
there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world

1147
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:24,080
think are adequate. We are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who thought they

1148
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:28,560
could do better than slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism.

1149
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:36,160
We've made progress. Fuedalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a progress over both of

1150
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:45,360
them and progress hasn't stopped and we are the people who in a variety of ways want the progress

1151
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:54,640
to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow the best beyond which

1152
02:11:54,640 --> 02:12:02,320
we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of the word, a reactionary way

1153
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:09,200
of thinking and we're that large community. Many of us are not interested in economics all that

1154
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:17,840
much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example, because we want to do

1155
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:25,920
something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to kill itself physically

1156
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:33,840
and we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that, etc. So that's for me

1157
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:42,160
a kind of difference. It's a little difficult to say because there's no other figure like Marx

1158
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:50,080
that has an equal impact, an equal place within the broad socialist tradition.

1159
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:59,840
The only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition, but that's very specialized

1160
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:06,240
and that's a whole other kind of conversation. Whatever you say, the influence of the great

1161
02:13:06,240 --> 02:13:16,080
anarchist thinkers, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorrell, and others still doesn't amount to the impact that

1162
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:27,360
Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but up to this point that's a way of

1163
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:31,600
understanding the relationship. Yeah, that's interesting that some of the ideas within

1164
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:38,880
anarchism, and of course it's one of the more varied disciplines, because there's such,

1165
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:45,280
maybe by definition, such variety in their thinkers, but they kind of stand for a

1166
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:55,840
dismantling of a power center and that, if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas

1167
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:02,880
of socialism. Absolutely. So where you have the... There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas

1168
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:11,760
and in Marxist ideas that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation

1169
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:21,120
from Lenin. People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin and it was made by Lenin,

1170
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:26,480
positive. In other words, Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for.

1171
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:32,400
We want to create the conditions under which there is a... Because you remember, the

1172
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:38,400
communists or whatever, they wouldn't call that at first in Russia before the revolution. They

1173
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:43,680
were just socialists. They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right.

1174
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:49,280
They had no love for the government. The government was their literal everyday enemy and

1175
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:56,160
being critical of government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the whole...

1176
02:14:56,800 --> 02:15:02,400
Being a Marxist, you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is

1177
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:08,480
you're struggling against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially

1178
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:14,560
because if you understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.

1179
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:21,920
One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia and he goes back centuries.

1180
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:26,880
It's a huge book, three or four inches thick and I'm one of the few people who've read it.

1181
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:36,000
He's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of feudalism,

1182
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,920
including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe. The development of a powerful central

1183
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:49,440
state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on, which ought to be suggestive

1184
02:15:49,440 --> 02:15:57,360
that maybe the turn to powerful governments here in the United States or in Europe is maybe also

1185
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:06,240
because this system is exhausted and can't go on and has to marshal every last bit of power it can

1186
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:13,040
not to be lost in history. It would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union

1187
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:18,960
would look like if Lenin never died. A lot of people have asked that question over the years,

1188
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:24,160
a lot of people. The area is stalling, sliding in in the middle of the night,

1189
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:30,240
erasing the withering away of the state part. Yes, exactly. So just to return briefly back

1190
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:35,440
to AOC and Bernie Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent

1191
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,920
some of these ideas and they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism? Right.

1192
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:45,680
The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC, and it's particularly true about Bernie,

1193
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:53,840
because AOC is much younger and Bernie's an older man. Bernie, being roughly my age,

1194
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:02,960
has been around formatively as a student, as an activist, then coming up through the ranks in

1195
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:10,320
Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all the rest. He lived through, for lack of a better term,

1196
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:17,280
I would call Cold War America. And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945-6

1197
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:28,320
to the present, I mean really never stopped, was a Manichaean worldview. The United States is good,

1198
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:33,760
it defines democracy, and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the opposite

1199
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:44,160
of democracy should be called. Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks

1200
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:53,280
of academic individuals, it was impossible to talk, have a conversation. I mean,

1201
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:59,920
I can't tell, just make it very personal. The number of times I would raise my hand in my classes

1202
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:08,720
at Harvard or Stanford or Yale, and I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,

1203
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:14,240
because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me, except by people

1204
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:23,040
who trashed it, other than that, and I didn't want that. So I would ask a question, and I would see

1205
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:28,800
in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't much care for, and those who were good teachers

1206
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:34,880
that I liked, fear. It was just fear. They didn't want to go there. They didn't want to answer my

1207
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:40,880
question. And after a while, I got to know some of them, and I found out why, because you don't

1208
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:45,360
know how the rest of the class is going to understand this. Either they would have to say,

1209
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:50,160
I don't know, which would be the honest truth for many of them, but a professor does not want to

1210
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:57,520
say in a classroom, I don't know, that it's not cool. Or if they knew, they'd have to say something

1211
02:18:58,240 --> 02:19:02,400
that indicated they didn't know really much, and they weren't even going to do that.

1212
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:09,920
Or they would know something, and maybe that would be because they were interested. They did not want

1213
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:17,280
the rest of the students to begin to say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, he's interested.

1214
02:19:17,600 --> 02:19:22,000
Mm-mm. This is not good for your career. You don't know how this is going to

1215
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,760
play out. Who's going to say what to whom? And I could see in their faces what I later learned,

1216
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:33,440
because they told me, don't come to my office hours. We're in the office. We can talk about it.

1217
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:35,680
But that's how bad it was.

1218
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,240
Is it not still?

1219
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:44,720
Pretty much. In my field, the great so-called debate. I mean, I find it boring, but the great

1220
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:51,840
debate for my colleagues is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics.

1221
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:58,080
Neoclassical, the government should stay out of the economy, less a fair or liberalism.

1222
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:03,840
And the Keynesian saying, no, you crazy neoclassical. If you do that, you'll have great depressions,

1223
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:08,960
and the system will collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems,

1224
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:14,080
to fix the weaknesses. And they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs.

1225
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:19,600
One of the very few things they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out.

1226
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:27,760
That they can find common ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own.

1227
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:37,360
Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means that all of the complicated developments

1228
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:44,880
within Marxism and within socialism of the post-World War II period,

1229
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:52,640
the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to the average American person,

1230
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:58,240
but to the average American academic, to the average American who thinks of himself or herself

1231
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:05,760
as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet

1232
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:13,520
history to have no idea. Or saying, there's this man, Lukacs, a Hungarian Marxist. He really had

1233
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:20,880
interest in, or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the

1234
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:28,080
Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? Why, you like Gramsci

1235
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:34,560
as a literary critic, but they didn't even know. They don't even know. It's been erased.

1236
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:41,120
It's a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the

1237
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:47,520
Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings,

1238
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:53,840
many of which are very interesting and complicated. Anyway, so what you're going to have in this

1239
02:21:53,840 --> 02:22:02,240
country is a slow awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War.

1240
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:08,000
I never expected, to be very honest with you, that I would live to see. I knew it would come

1241
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:14,720
because of these things always do, but I didn't expect to see it. So I have been surprised

1242
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:20,640
as have a lot of us that when it starts to happen, it happens fast.

1243
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:30,320
So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from the Cold War to accept the ideas.

1244
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:35,040
Always a socialist. We all knew. And everybody who paid attention, he denied it.

1245
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:44,320
But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous, to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont.

1246
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:50,080
Vermont is one of the smallest states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you

1247
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:56,160
that there are more cows than people in Vermont, etc. etc. So here from this little state,

1248
02:22:56,160 --> 02:23:02,880
this elderly gentleman with a New York City accent runs for all and says, I'm a socialist.

1249
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:07,040
And when they attack him, he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist.

1250
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:14,400
Now he had been. It wasn't a secret that suddenly got out. But the great question, and I don't mind

1251
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:19,440
telling you because I went to the right schools, I know a lot of people, you know,

1252
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:25,680
Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official

1253
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:30,560
of the Democratic Party and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?

1254
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:39,120
Makes no difference. They get 1% of the vote. He was wrong. They had no idea what was coming.

1255
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:45,040
But the truth is, I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it. I thought his 1% was probably

1256
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:50,800
right. So we were both wrong. Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president

1257
02:23:50,800 --> 02:24:01,200
one day? Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one, it's fast. Number two,

1258
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:11,360
it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,

1259
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:19,680
calm, non-confrontational socialism you can imagine. So not AOC or Bernie.

1260
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:23,360
No, no, they are not confrontational in my judgment.

1261
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:27,040
In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.

1262
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:34,400
They're feisty personally. But not ideologically. You know, she is, Bernie is also,

1263
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:40,640
you know, in honest moments, and they're both really are pretty honest folks,

1264
02:24:40,640 --> 02:24:47,920
at least in my experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates

1265
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:55,760
as democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular

1266
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:03,440
government tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working

1267
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:10,400
class than you do now. That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means by socialism.

1268
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:16,560
When he talks about it, and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot. Okay,

1269
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:23,680
that's consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism. And that's where we're going to

1270
02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:29,280
start in a country coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon, it's already happening. There'll

1271
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:35,600
be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are

1272
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:42,800
comfortable with. You can already see the shoots of it now. You know, AOC voted together with

1273
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:48,960
most of the others to support the money for Ukraine. Okay, that lot of people in the socialist

1274
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:53,520
movement do not support that. And that's going to have, you know, I don't know exactly how

1275
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:59,360
that's going to work out. But that should give people an idea. There are disagreements and they're

1276
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:06,720
going to fester and they're going to grow. People in the socialist sphere don't support money

1277
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:12,000
from the United States in the large amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because of,

1278
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,400
it's a fundamentally, the military industrial complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing?

1279
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:21,920
No, there are some people for whom that's the issue. Then there are people for whom

1280
02:26:22,560 --> 02:26:28,400
this is, you know, it's guns and butter and why are we, why are we over there when we have such

1281
02:26:28,400 --> 02:26:34,560
needs at home that are being neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what we

1282
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:40,800
talked about at the beginning, who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between

1283
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:48,880
Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine and what are we

1284
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:55,680
doing here? We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate

1285
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:59,840
a settlement, don't kill large numbers of Ukraine. I mean, everybody's willing to fight

1286
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:05,200
to the last Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you doing? You're supposed to be in

1287
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:11,040
favor of peace, you know, and for the United States, which just finished invading and occupying

1288
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:15,840
Afghanistan and Iraq to be against another country invading. I mean, who in the world

1289
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:21,600
is going to take this seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade, it's good and you invade,

1290
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:29,600
it's terrible. What? You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? What's going on here?

1291
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:33,440
All of these questions are being active, by the way, not just by socialists,

1292
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:39,360
by lots of other people too, inside the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party.

1293
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:45,920
You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They

1294
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,640
don't want the money spent there, they don't want the weapons sent there, they don't like the whole

1295
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:58,080
policy and Trump wobble. So, Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the

1296
02:27:58,080 --> 02:28:05,440
right and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that

1297
02:28:05,440 --> 02:28:16,240
AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War

1298
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:24,640
isolation from the whole, you know, when I explained to people the contribution made,

1299
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:30,640
for example, to modern Marxism, I'll give you an example, by the French philosopher

1300
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:36,880
Louis Althusser, I don't know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of

1301
02:28:36,880 --> 02:28:43,920
the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there

1302
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:52,160
were a university that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton and MIT. It would be the university.

1303
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:59,120
Well, the École Normale in France in Paris is the. He was a tenured professor who became the

1304
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:04,560
rector. The rector is like the president of the university. An active member of the French

1305
02:29:04,560 --> 02:29:10,400
Communist Party, most of his adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War.

1306
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:15,040
That was unthinkable in this country. You could not in a million years, right?

1307
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:23,760
So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring a version of postmodernism

1308
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:32,240
into Marxism with enormous impact all over the world when he traveled, not just in Europe,

1309
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:36,000
all over, right? So if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for you.

1310
02:29:36,880 --> 02:29:48,480
Althusser, Luis, Althusser. Look him up. You'll see tons of stuff.

1311
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:53,840
By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works in English.

1312
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:59,600
By the way, the textbook I wrote in Economics, in case you're ever interested,

1313
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:05,520
was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories,

1314
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:11,920
Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That's an MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that's right.

1315
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:16,800
And by the way, when we think, I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between

1316
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:25,040
Marxian economics and Marxist. I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that.

1317
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:33,920
I only use it because Marxist uses a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian uses an adjective

1318
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:39,840
to qualify, but I don't mean some great difference. There's a last point I would like to make about

1319
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:49,440
AOC and Bernie. That's also general. I'm a historian too. And I know that the transition

1320
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:56,400
out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred

1321
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:03,680
in fits and starts. So for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate, serfs would run away,

1322
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:09,360
then run into a town. How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because they had

1323
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:16,080
run away from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding

1324
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:23,760
what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the business of buying and

1325
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:29,520
then reselling stuff and living off the difference. But you know, I could make more money if I produced

1326
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:36,080
some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody else. So I'm going to make you a deal.

1327
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:40,960
I'm going to give you money once a week. I'll give you money what we would later call a wage.

1328
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:45,280
And you come here and under my supervision, you make this crap that I'm going to then sell.

1329
02:31:45,840 --> 02:31:54,080
And this all works out. In other words, there were efforts unconscious, not self-aware,

1330
02:31:54,880 --> 02:32:02,000
to go out of feudalism to a new system. Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart.

1331
02:32:02,800 --> 02:32:11,680
Some of them lasted weeks or months or years, but it took a long time before the conditions were

1332
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:19,680
ready for a kind of a general switch. And once that was done, it grew on itself and became the

1333
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:26,720
global capitalist system we have today. That's the only model we have. So for me, that's what

1334
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:35,120
I see when I look at socialism. I see the Paris commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a

1335
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:42,000
few weeks. I see Russia. That was an attempt lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you will fill in the

1336
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:50,080
blank, I see these are all early experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things

1337
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:56,000
never to do again. The good, the bad. What do you build on? How do you learn?

1338
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:01,120
And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition, when it's serious, that's what it does.

1339
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:06,240
In your ideas, sort of capitalism was a significant improvement over the feudalism.

1340
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:13,920
And we are coming to an age and over slavery, and we're coming to an age where capitalism

1341
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:21,120
will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is how fundamentally broken. It's better than

1342
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,840
the things that came before it, but there's going to be things yet better and they will be grounded

1343
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:35,440
in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just a linger briefly on the way Marxism is used

1344
02:33:35,440 --> 02:33:42,880
as a term on Twitter? There's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly, but

1345
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:52,880
cultural Marxism or the criticisms of universities being infiltrated by cultural Marxists.

1346
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:01,680
I'm not exactly sure. I don't pay close enough attention, but it's woke. There's a kind of

1347
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:11,040
woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text? Who's the Karl Marx of

1348
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:21,040
wokeness? All I do know is that there's certain characteristics of woke ideology, which is

1349
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:30,960
hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys. Basically, everyone is a bad guy,

1350
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:36,720
except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying that they're the good guy.

1351
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:48,560
That applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics, identity politics, all that kind of

1352
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:57,600
stuff. Is there any parallels between Marxian economics and Marxist ideology and whatever

1353
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:06,400
is being called Marxism on Twitter? No, not much. One of the consequences of the taboo

1354
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:13,200
after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words.

1355
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:20,000
It's like calling somebody, well, I won't use bad language, but using a four-letter word to

1356
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:25,760
describe somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many

1357
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:32,640
circles, this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn't

1358
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:39,920
have a particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is

1359
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:50,320
somebody who is concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation and gender and all of those

1360
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:58,720
things and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms and I don't like any of these people,

1361
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:06,080
so I slap the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism because it isn't Marxism about

1362
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:12,880
getting more money or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists

1363
02:36:12,880 --> 02:36:18,400
somehow are concerned about. So this is odd since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always

1364
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:24,240
been interested in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci,

1365
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:31,440
that's what they're famous for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture.

1366
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:38,640
Gramsci writes a great length about the Catholic Church about theater and painting in Italy and

1367
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:43,360
on and on. I mean, this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't

1368
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:51,040
know what the names are. It's a label that summarizes kind of a shorthand. I'm against all of this. I

1369
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:57,520
don't want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country and it always has been or sexism or

1370
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:06,960
phobia against gay people or whatever it is that's agitating them, Marxism or socialism. I mean,

1371
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:14,720
it's just, it's like socialism is the post office. It is a mentality. Well, but I don't blame them.

1372
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:22,560
I mean, it's childish. It's mean-spirited, but it comes out of the fact no one ever sat them down

1373
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:28,640
and said, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of things that people kind of share and

1374
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:37,040
these big differences. Look, an intelligent society, which this country is, could have and should have

1375
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:43,760
done that. It was fear and a kind of terror that made them behave in the way they did and we're now

1376
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:52,000
seeing it. Having said that, there is such a thing as cultural Marxism. What that is is simply those

1377
02:37:52,000 --> 02:38:04,720
Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing how it is that a particular culture is on the one hand

1378
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:11,040
shaped by capitalism and on the other hand, it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive

1379
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:19,680
and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the interaction between the class struggle on the job

1380
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:28,320
and attitude towards sexuality or movements in music or whatever else culture. And there are

1381
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:36,240
Georg Lukacs, this Hungarian, great name in there, the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci,

1382
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:41,920
and a modern name just died a couple of years ago, a British intellectual named Stuart Hall,

1383
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:50,480
H-A-L-L. If I were teaching, which I have done, a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three

1384
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:58,720
major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you articles and books to read of their stuff,

1385
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:03,120
because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many others.

1386
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:08,160
So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism creates

1387
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:15,120
and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes. And Marxists are particularly those who like

1388
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:20,640
to look at that interaction. In other words, they're interested in how capitalism shapes culture

1389
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:26,960
and how culture shapes capitalism. There's another name, I forgot. Stuart Hall is British,

1390
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:38,160
Gramsci is Italian, Lukacs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N.

1391
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:44,880
He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that developed in

1392
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:51,120
Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in cultural questions.

1393
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:57,440
It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and

1394
02:39:57,440 --> 02:40:03,680
politics. There were people who said, you're leaving out very important parts of modern society

1395
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:10,160
that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that impetus to open

1396
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:16,800
Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand that this cult,

1397
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:21,280
and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different meaning

1398
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:30,240
from this. This is just bad-mouthing. That's all. Let me ask a more personal question. So

1399
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:36,640
for most of the 20th century, no, not most, but a large many decades in the United States

1400
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:42,320
as a consequence of the Cold War and before being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be.

1401
02:40:42,880 --> 02:40:49,840
Have you had dark periods in your own life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind,

1402
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:57,520
where it was difficult, like self-doubt, difficult to know, like, what the hell am I doing when

1403
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:03,280
you're surrounded by colleagues and people? You said prestigious universities, both personal

1404
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:10,800
interests of career, but also as a human being when everybody, you know, kind of looks at you

1405
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:17,360
funny because you're studying this thing. Did that ever get you real low?

1406
02:41:17,360 --> 02:41:22,880
No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.

1407
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:26,000
If I were you, I'd be asking me that question, too.

1408
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:28,800
And what's wrong with you?

1409
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:35,520
Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am.

1410
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:42,560
I really don't. But the truth is, no, I have, if my wife were sitting here, she'd tell you

1411
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:48,160
what she tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true.

1412
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:54,320
But then again, luck never is the only explanation for things that's part of it.

1413
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:02,880
What can I say? I didn't choose the time of my birth. I didn't choose

1414
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:06,960
the communities in which I grew up or the schools I attended or anything else.

1415
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:11,680
No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on Marxian economics.

1416
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:17,040
But you know, again, I'm haggled. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.

1417
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:22,400
On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation

1418
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:29,040
when you do that is very different. I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook,

1419
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:35,200
taking notes of what the great professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam.

1420
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:45,360
I don't have an exam. I'm doing something slightly risqué, you know, kind of romantically different

1421
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:53,200
and oppositional. I was able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to

1422
02:42:53,280 --> 02:43:00,160
outside of the classroom situation, other students who felt enough similar to me

1423
02:43:00,160 --> 02:43:05,440
that we could get together and read these books and talk about them. I had a number of really

1424
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:13,200
fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me of their time and their effort to teach me

1425
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:19,280
along the way. And I've had the benefit that because I went to all these fancy schools,

1426
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:26,400
I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture. And when I have been put in

1427
02:43:26,400 --> 02:43:32,480
difficult positions, I often waive my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They're

1428
02:43:32,480 --> 02:43:39,760
back away. They're back away. Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic

1429
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:45,440
prestige. But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken

1430
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:53,600
by this. You have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.

1431
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:58,080
Well, I would put it, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little differently.

1432
02:43:58,080 --> 02:44:06,160
I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system.

1433
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:12,720
And nothing has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development

1434
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:26,240
just kept giving me more and more evidence. And I must say over the last 10 years,

1435
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:33,280
what's really changed the last 10 years. I mean, I can't describe to you how big that changes.

1436
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:35,760
And that may be more important than anything else we've discussed.

1437
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:45,600
Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or a radio thing or

1438
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:52,960
give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months, I'd be invited

1439
02:44:52,960 --> 02:45:00,800
and I would do it. Like academics often do. I now do two to three to four interviews every day.

1440
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:08,000
So does a hunger, wow, is there a hunger? It's fascinating.

1441
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:12,640
And I want to be honest with you. As I say at the end of some of my talks,

1442
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:17,360
I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause from the podium, you know,

1443
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:24,720
that I lean into the microphone and I say with as much smile as I can get, I'm having a time of my

1444
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:34,240
life. And that's the truth. I never expected, look, I'm used to teaching a classroom,

1445
02:45:34,240 --> 02:45:40,560
a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students, or a regular undergraduate

1446
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:46,240
class with 30 or an occasional introductory course with a few hundred. I've done all of those

1447
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:55,520
things many times, but an audience, you know, that I can count in the hundreds of thousands

1448
02:45:55,520 --> 02:46:04,560
on YouTube and all of that. No, that's new. Is there advice you can give given your bold and

1449
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:11,760
nonstandard career and life advice you can give to high school students, college students about

1450
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:17,440
how to have a career like that, or maybe how to have a career or a life they can be proud of?

1451
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:28,800
Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely

1452
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:37,440
better than they were when I had to do it. And I could do it. And I can, I'm happy I did it.

1453
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:42,160
Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made that I've never regretted.

1454
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:53,760
And I've never regretted being a critic of this society. Never. I find it edifying. I find it,

1455
02:46:55,200 --> 02:47:00,560
I mean, the gratitude people expressed to me for helping them see kind of what's going on

1456
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:06,000
is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you? So that feels you,

1457
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:12,880
pointing out that the emperor has no clothes, it feels you, that's a life not just important.

1458
02:47:13,360 --> 02:47:19,760
Because most of the people who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the

1459
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:26,240
vocabulary and some of them do, would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that

1460
02:47:26,240 --> 02:47:33,120
outfit that I was wearing. I thought it and they did. And all they needed was a little extra,

1461
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:40,960
this information or that factoid or this logic. And they have that. And I remember having that too.

1462
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:47,840
When I had a teacher who made something clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude.

1463
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:55,280
And now I get that gratitude, a good bit. And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm not

1464
02:47:55,360 --> 02:48:04,720
sure I could get it any other way. And I have learned and I'm walking proof that being a

1465
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:12,480
critic of society and doing it systematically and sharing it with other people makes for a

1466
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:22,080
very good life, a very good life. Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature

1467
02:48:22,160 --> 02:48:27,680
is that life comes to an end. Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?

1468
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:36,800
Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes. Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought, you know,

1469
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:45,680
death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead, you know. I worry more about my

1470
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:50,960
wife. I'm very attached to my wife. I might mention to you, I got married when I was 23

1471
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:59,680
years old and that's my wife to this day. So I'm lucky because if you get married to anybody

1472
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:09,200
at age 23, it's either luck or it isn't. What role has love played in your life? Enormous.

1473
02:49:11,440 --> 02:49:16,560
Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mind

1474
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:24,320
who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,

1475
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:33,440
find another life income and job and the disruption goes real deep for any refugee. So

1476
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:40,240
my mother and father were both refugees. They met as refugees.

1477
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:50,720
So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had to be, I was the first child of their,

1478
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:57,920
I have a younger sister, but I was the first child and, you know, there's a lot of psychological

1479
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:04,640
pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm, but you've got to do

1480
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:11,520
what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do. It's the closest

1481
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:18,080
they're going to get to what they had hoped and my parents were both university students.

1482
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:23,360
My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.

1483
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:32,640
So I had to perform, you know. I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get all

1484
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:37,440
A's. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to do all

1485
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:44,800
these because everything had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that way.

1486
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:49,200
But that's functional in this dysfunctional society.

1487
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:55,440
But on top of that, that's an achievement within the game of this particular society,

1488
02:50:55,440 --> 02:51:00,640
but then love seems to be a thing that's greater than that game. Is that something

1489
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:06,320
that made you a better person? How was it made you a better Marxian and a better...

1490
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:12,480
Everything because my wife, my wife by profession is a psychotherapist.

1491
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,240
Excellent. I love it.

1492
02:51:14,240 --> 02:51:16,160
And I needed it. Yeah.

1493
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:21,120
And so I married it. I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but I think,

1494
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:25,920
as I look back on it, that was more than a little what was going on.

1495
02:51:26,720 --> 02:51:32,080
And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life

1496
02:51:32,800 --> 02:51:40,800
that my family never talked about, never dealt with, never, at least explicitly

1497
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:43,200
engaged in any of that.

1498
02:51:43,200 --> 02:51:46,800
Because it was all about survival, the immigrant challenges, survival.

1499
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:53,040
Survive, survive. And you're so busy that you tell yourself you can't do that.

1500
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:58,240
Of course, you can. And there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those problems.

1501
02:51:58,240 --> 02:52:05,520
But the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way. And my parents did that.

1502
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:11,760
One last question. What's the meaning of life, Richard Wolff? Why are we here?

1503
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:13,280
I will quote you, Mr. Marx.

1504
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:15,360
Let's go.

1505
02:52:16,320 --> 02:52:25,760
Life is struggle. And for me, I have found that to be true, that the struggle,

1506
02:52:27,280 --> 02:52:31,840
whether it is to build a relationship with your child, I have two children,

1507
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:39,280
whether it's to build one with your spouse, whether it's to understand a complicated argument

1508
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:46,800
and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this relationship

1509
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:53,040
to a student or to an audience. These are, it's a struggle to do all those things.

1510
02:52:53,600 --> 02:53:03,760
But that network of struggles, that makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.

1511
02:53:04,480 --> 02:53:06,640
And meaningful. And very meaningful.

1512
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:11,040
And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully. You're one of the great communicators

1513
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:16,240
and educators out there today. And it's a huge honor that you have sit with me for so many hours.

1514
02:53:16,240 --> 02:53:21,200
Thank you. This is awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.

1515
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,520
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1516
02:53:26,320 --> 02:53:29,280
And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.

1517
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:34,080
The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.

1518
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:37,760
The point, however, is to change it.

1519
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:45,200
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
