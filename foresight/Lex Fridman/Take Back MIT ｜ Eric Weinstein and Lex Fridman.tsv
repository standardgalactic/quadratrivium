0	11160	This idea of disk, distributed idea suppression complex, is that what's bringing the elons
11160	13040	of the world down?
13040	17600	You know, it's so funny, like he's asking Joe Rogan, like, is that a joint?
17600	19760	You know, it's like, well, what will happen if I smoke it?
19760	21560	What will happen to the stock price?
21560	24480	What will happen if I scratch myself in public?
24480	29760	What will happen if I say what I think about Thailand, or COVID, or who knows what?
29760	31920	And everybody's like, don't say that.
31920	32920	Say this.
32920	33920	Go do this.
33920	34920	Go do that.
34920	36320	Well, it's crazy making.
36320	38200	It's absolutely crazy making.
38200	46520	And if you think about what we put through, people through, we need to get people who
46520	52920	can use FU money, the FU money they need to insulate themselves from all of the people
53040	54040	who know better.
54040	59320	Because my nightmare is that, why did we only get one elon?
59320	62740	What if we were supposed to have thousands and thousands of elons?
62740	66560	And the weird thing is, like, this is all that remains.
66560	70520	You're looking at, like, Obi-Wan and Yoda.
70520	78000	And it's like, this is the only, this is all that's left after Order 66 has been executed.
78000	82320	And that's the thing that's really upsetting to me, is we used to have elons five deep.
82320	87080	And then we could talk about elon in the context of his cohort.
87080	91800	But this is like, if you were to see a giraffe in the Arctic with no trees around, you'd
91800	93920	think, why the long neck?
93920	96640	What a strange sight, you know?
96640	99120	How do we get more elons?
99120	100280	How do we change things?
100280	106320	So I think they use, so we know MIT and Harvard.
106320	111560	So maybe returning to our previous conversation, my sense is that the elons of the world are
111560	114760	supposed to come from MIT and Harvard.
114760	116520	And how do you change?
116520	120720	Let's think of one that MIT sort of killed.
120720	123360	Have any names in mind?
123360	126120	Aaron Schwartz leaps to my mind.
126120	127120	Yeah.
127120	128120	Okay.
128120	137120	Are we MIT supposed to shield the Aaron Schwartz's from, I don't know, journal publishers?
137120	141840	Or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that we can throw 35-year sentences in
141840	144880	his face or whatever it is that we did that depressed him?
144880	145880	Okay.
145880	147360	So here's my point.
147360	153520	I want MIT to go back to being the home of Aaron Schwartz.
153520	160840	And if you want to send Aaron Schwartz to a state where he's looking at 35 years in
160840	164600	prison or something like that, you are my sworn enemy.
164600	166000	You are not MIT.
166000	167000	Yeah.
167160	178560	You are the traitorous, irresponsible, middle-brow, pencil-pushing, green-eye-shade fool that
178560	182240	needs to not be in the seat at the presidency of MIT.
182240	183240	Period.
183240	184240	The end.
184240	187280	Get the fuck out of there and let one of our people sit in that chair.
187280	193360	And the thing that you've articulated is that the people in those chairs are not the way
193440	200000	they are because they're evil or somehow morally compromised is that it's just that's the distributed
200000	201000	nature.
201000	202920	Is that there's some kind of aspect of the system that's just...
202920	206720	These are people who wed themselves to the system.
206720	208800	They adapt every instinct.
208800	215280	And the fact is that they're not going to be on Joe Rogan smoking a blunt.
215280	216360	Let me ask a silly question.
216360	220320	Do you think institutions generally just tend to become that?
220320	222080	No.
222080	223880	We get some of the institutions.
223880	224880	We get Caltech.
224880	226640	Here's what we're supposed to have.
226640	228000	We're supposed to have Caltech.
228000	230040	We're supposed to have Reed.
230040	233200	We're supposed to have Deep Springs.
233200	234400	We're supposed to have MIT.
234400	237680	We're supposed to have a part of Harvard.
237680	242520	And when the sharp elbow crowd comes after the sharp mind crowd, we're supposed to break
242520	246040	those sharp elbows and say, don't come around here again.
246040	250920	So what are the weapons that the sharp minds are supposed to use in our modern day?
251040	252560	To reclaim MIT.
252560	255200	What is the future?
255200	256760	Are you kidding me?
256760	259720	First of all, assume that this is being seen at MIT.
259720	260720	Hey, everybody.
260720	261720	Definitely is.
261720	262720	Okay.
262720	264400	Hey, everybody.
264400	266480	Try to remember who you are.
266480	270080	You're the guys who put the police car on top of the great dump.
270080	272280	You guys came up with the great breast of knowledge.
272280	275600	You created a Tetris game in the green building.
275600	278680	Now, what is your problem?
278680	280600	They killed one of your own.
280600	284160	You should make their life a living hell.
284160	289880	You should be the ones who keep the memory of Aaron Schwartz alive and all of those hackers
289880	292880	and all of those mutants.
292880	297400	You know, it's like it's either our place or it isn't.
297400	305400	And if we have to throw 12 more pianos off of the roof, right, if Harold Edgerton was
305400	314880	taking those photographs, you know, with Slow Mo back in the 40s, if Noam Chomsky is on
314880	319280	your faculty, what the hell is wrong with you kids?
319280	323520	You are the most creative and insightful people and you can't figure out how to defend Aaron
323520	324520	Schwartz.
324520	325520	That's on you guys.
325520	330120	So, some of that is giving more power to the young, like you said, to the brave, to the
330120	331120	bold.
331120	333640	No, taking power from the feeble and the middle brown.
333760	335680	Yeah, but what is the mechanism?
335680	336680	To me, I don't know.
336680	338160	Do you have some nine-volt batteries?
338160	339160	No.
339160	341160	It's a copper wire?
341160	343160	I tend to...
343160	344760	Do you have a capacitor?
344760	351240	I tend to believe you have to create an alternative and make the alternative so much better that
351240	355920	it makes MIT obsolete unless they change.
355920	359360	And that's what forces change, so as opposed to somehow...
359360	362240	Okay, so use projection mapping.
362240	363520	What's projection mapping?
363520	368040	Where you take some complicated edifice and you map all of its planes and then you actually
368040	372440	project some unbelievable graphics, reskinning a building, let's say, at night.
372440	373440	That's right.
373440	374440	Yeah.
374440	375440	Okay, so you want to do some graffiti art with light?
375440	376680	You basically want to hack the system.
376680	377680	No, I'm saying...
377680	379680	Look, listen to me, Len.
379680	381880	We're smarter than they are.
381880	382880	And they...
382880	383880	You know what they say?
383880	387320	They say things like, I think we need some geeks.
387320	389240	Get me two PhDs.
389240	390480	Right.
390480	392240	You treat PhDs like that.
392240	399320	That's a bad move, because PhDs are capable and we act like our job is to peel grapes
399320	400320	for our betters.
400320	406280	Yeah, that's a strange thing and you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat
406280	414680	basically the greatest minds in the world, which is like at the prime, which is PhD students.
414680	417960	We pay them nothing.
417960	418960	I'm done with it.
418960	419960	Yeah.
419960	420960	Right?
420960	421960	We got to take what's ours.
422680	423680	Yeah.
423680	430160	Take back MIT, become ungovernable, become ungovernable.
430160	435680	And by the way, when you become ungovernable, don't do it by throwing food.
435680	439160	Don't do it by pouring salt on the lawn like a jerk.
439160	444680	Do it through brilliance, because what you Caltech and MIT can do, and maybe Rensselaer
444680	449960	Polytechnic or Worcester Polytech, I don't know, Lehigh, God damn it, what's wrong with
449960	451120	you technical people?
451120	454200	You act like you're a servant class.
454200	459320	It's unclear to me how you reclaim it, except with brilliance, like you said.
459320	463320	But to me, that the way you reclaim it with brilliance is to go outside the system.
463320	468960	Aaron Schwartz came from the Elon Musk class, what you guys are going to do about it, right?
468960	475080	The super capable people need to flex, need to be individual, they need to stop giving
475080	480120	away all their power to a zeitgeist or a community or this or that.
480120	483000	You're not indoor cats, you're outdoor cats, go be outdoor cats.
483000	485000	Do you think we're going to see this kind of change happen?
485000	489040	You were the one asking me before, like what about the World War II generation?
489040	493480	What I'm trying to say is that there's a technical revolt coming.
493480	494480	You want to talk about this?
494480	495480	But I'm trying to lead it.
495480	496480	Really?
496480	497480	I'm trying to see.
497480	498480	No, you're not trying to lead it.
498480	499480	I'm trying to get a blueprint here.
499480	500480	All right, Lex.
500480	501480	Yeah.
501480	506120	How angry are you about our country pretending that you and I can't actually do technical
506120	512440	subjects so that they need an army of kids coming in from four countries in Asia?
512440	515960	It's not about the four countries in Asia, it's not about those kids.
515960	520240	It's about lying about us, that we don't care enough about science and technology, that
520240	527280	we're incapable of it, as if we don't have Chinese and Russians and Koreans and Croatians.
527280	529480	We've got everybody here.
529480	533720	The only reason you're looking outside is that you want to hire cheap people from the
533720	537720	family business because you don't want to pass the family business on.
537720	539320	You know what?
539320	541320	You didn't really build the family business.
541320	543600	It's not yours to decide.
543600	547860	You the boomers and you the silent generation, you did your bit, but you also fouled a lot
547860	551680	of stuff up and you're custodians.
551680	552880	You are caretakers.
552880	554600	You were supposed to hand something.
554600	560400	What you did instead was to gorge yourself on cheap foreign labor, which you then held
560400	564960	up as being much more brilliant than your own children, which was never true.
564960	572080	See, but I'm trying to understand how we create a better system without anger, without revolution.
572080	578160	Not by kissing and hugs.
578160	583040	I don't understand within MIT what the mechanism of building a better MIT is.
583040	584720	We're not going to pay all severe.
584720	586000	Aaron Schwartz was right.
586000	588640	JSTOR is an abomination.
589280	595040	Who within MIT, who within institutions is going to do that when, just like you said,
595040	597560	the people who are running the show are more senior.
597560	598560	I don't know.
598560	601560	Did Frank Wilczek just speak out?
601560	604420	So you're basically individuals that step up.
604420	610080	One of the surprising things about Elon is that one person can inspire so much.
610080	611400	He's got academic freedom.
611400	613920	It just comes from money.
613920	616920	I don't agree with that.
616920	617920	You think money?
617920	618920	Okay.
618920	619920	So, yes.
619920	620920	Certainly.
620920	621920	Sorry.
621920	622920	And testicles.
622920	623920	Yes.
623920	628920	But I think that testicles is more important than money or guts.
628920	630440	I do agree with you.
630440	634300	You speak about this a lot that because the money in the academic institutions has been
634300	639840	so constrained that people are misbehaving and horrible.
639840	644520	But I don't think that if we reverse that and give a huge amount of money, people will
644520	645600	all of a sudden behave well.
645600	646840	I think it also takes guts.
646840	648400	No, you need to give people security.
648400	649400	Security, yes.
649400	655960	Like, you need to know that you have a job on Monday when on Friday you say, I'm not
655960	659320	so sure I really love diversity and inclusion.
659320	661080	And somebody's like, wait, what?
661080	662560	You didn't love diversity?
662560	665240	We had a statement on diversity and you wouldn't sign?
665240	668240	Are you against the inclusion part or are you against diversity?
668240	669960	Do you just not like people like you?
669960	673160	You're like, actually, that has nothing to do with anything.
673160	675080	You're making this into something that it isn't.
675080	680000	I don't want to sign your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab.
680000	681120	Get out of my lab.
681120	683160	It all begins from the middle finger.
683160	685600	Get out of my lab.
685600	688800	The administrators need to find other work.
688800	689800	Yeah.
689800	698040	Listen, I agree with you and I hope to seek your advice and wisdom as we change this because
698040	699040	I'd love to see.
699040	703480	I will visit you in prison if that's what you're asking.
703480	705120	I think prison is great.
705120	709280	You get a lot of reading done and good working out.
709280	717160	Well, let me ask something I brought up before is the Nietzsche quote of, beware that when
717160	721440	fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster for when you gaze long into the
721440	725360	abyss, the abyss gazes into you.
725360	729240	Are you worried that your focus on the flaws in the system that we've just been talking
729240	735320	about has damaged your mind or the part of the mind of your mind that's able to see the
735320	739560	beauty in the world in the system?
739560	746560	Because you have so sharply been able to see the flaws in the system, you can no longer
746560	748480	step back and appreciate its beauty.
748480	754600	Look, I'm the one who's trying to get the institutions to save themselves by getting
754600	760360	rid of their inhabitants, but leaving the institution like a neutron bomb that removes
760360	765560	the unworkable leadership class, but leaves the structures.
765560	768320	So the leadership class is really the problem.
768320	769320	The leadership class is the problem.
769320	771960	But the individual like the professors, the individual scholars.
771960	778200	The professors are going to have to go back into training to remember how to be professors.
778200	782280	People are cowards at the moment because if they're not cowards, they're unemployed.
783240	787880	Yeah, that's one of the disappointing things I've encountered is, to me, tenure.
789400	791000	But nobody has tenure now.
794040	803640	Whether they do or not, they certainly don't have the kind of character and fortitude that I was
803640	805880	hoping to see.
805880	806600	But they'd be gone.
806840	813880	But you're dreaming about the people who used to live at MIT.
816040	819320	You're dreaming about the previous inhabitants of your university.
820120	826760	And if you looked at somebody like Isidore Singer is very old, I don't know what state he's in,
826760	829400	but that guy was absolutely the real deal.
829400	833560	And if you look at Noam Chomsky, tell me that Noam Chomsky has been muzzled.
834600	835160	Right?
835160	835400	Yeah.
836040	841080	Now, what I'm trying to get at is you're talking about younger, energetic people.
841080	848200	But those people, like when I say something like, I'm against, I'm for inclusion and I'm
848200	853480	for diversity, but I'm against diversity and inclusion, TM, like the movement.
855320	857320	Well, I couldn't say that if I was a professor.
859240	861800	Oh my God, he's against our sacred document.
861800	866840	Okay. Well, in that kind of a world, do you want to know how many things I don't agree with you
866840	867480	on?
867480	871640	Like we could go on for days and days and days, all of the nonsense that you've parroted
871640	872920	inside of the institution.
873800	876200	Any sane person has no need for it.
876200	878200	They have no want or desire.
880520	883640	Do you think you have to have some patience for nonsense
884680	887240	when many people work together in a system?
887240	890200	How long has string theory gone on for and how long have I been patient?
891080	893240	Okay, so you're talking about, there's a limit to patience.
893240	897880	You're talking about like 36 years of modern nonsense in string theory.
897880	900760	So you can do like eight to 10 years, but not more.
900760	902440	I can do 40 minutes.
904360	905080	This is 36 years.
905080	906840	Well, you've done that over two hours already.
906840	908280	No, but I appreciate it.
908280	913880	But it's been 36 years of nonsense since the anomaly cancellation in string theory.
913880	916680	It's like, what are you talking about about patience?
916680	919800	I mean, Lex, you're not even acting like yourself.
921000	923480	Well, you're trying to stay in the system.
923480	932600	I'm not trying to see if perhaps, so my hope is that the system just has a few assholes in it,
932600	938520	which you highlight and the fundamentals of the system are broken.
938520	941640	Because if the fundamentals of the systems are broken,
941640	944680	then I just don't see a way for MIT to succeed.
945640	950120	Like, I don't see how young people take over MIT.
950120	950760	I don't see how...
952760	954040	By inspiring us.
955320	957560	You know, the great part about being at MIT,
958280	964040	like when you saw the genius in these pranks, the heart, the irreverence.
966040	968120	And we were talking about Tom Lehrer the last time.
968680	971560	Tom Lehrer was as naughty as the day is long.
971560	972280	Agreed?
972280	973160	Agreed.
973160	974600	Was he also a genius?
974600	975640	Was he well-spoken?
975640	976920	Was he highly cultured?
977720	982680	He was so talented, so intellectual that he could just make fart jokes morning, noon, and night.
982680	983320	Yeah.
983320	983560	Okay.
984280	989640	Well, in part, the right to make fart jokes, the right to, for example, put a functioning phone
989640	995400	booth that was ringing on top of the great dome at MIT has to do with, we are such bad asses that
995400	996760	we can actually do this stuff.
997720	999640	Well, don't tell me about it anymore.
999640	1000600	Go break the law.
1001560	1006040	Go break the law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute you.
1006600	1010920	Break the law in a way that lets us know that you're calling us out on our bullshit,
1010920	1017160	that you're filled with love, and that our technical talent has not gone to sleep.
1017160	1018360	It's not incapable.
1019080	1023400	You know, and if the idea is, is that you're going to dig a moat around the university and
1023400	1028840	fill it with tiger sharks, that's awesome, because I don't know how you're going to do it.
1028840	1034600	But if you actually manage to do that, I'm not going to prosecute you under a reckless endangerment.
1036120	1037080	That's beautifully put.
1037960	1039960	I hope those, first of all, they'll listen.
1040680	1043960	I hope young people at MIT will take over in this kind of way.
1045000	1053240	In the introduction to your podcast episode on Jeff Epstein, you give to me a really moving
1053240	1060120	story, but unfortunately for me, too brief about your experience with a therapist and
1060120	1067400	the lasting terror that permeated your mind. Can you, can you go there? Can you tell?
1068040	1072440	No, thanks. I mean, I appreciate what you're saying. I said it obliquely. I said enough.
1074680	1081960	There are bad people who cross our paths, and the current vogue is to say, oh, I'm a survivor.
1083960	1087080	I'm a victim. I can do anything I want.
1088440	1093400	This is a broken person, and I don't know why I was sent to a broken person as a kid.
1093960	1098920	And to be honest with you, I also felt like in that story, I say that I was able to say no,
1099720	1102440	you know, and this was like the entire weight of authority.
1103720	1109480	And he was misusing his position, and I was also able to say no.
1109800	1115080	No. What I couldn't say no to was having him re-inflicted in my life.
1116280	1121080	Right, so you were sent back a second time. I tried to complain about what had happened,
1121080	1128760	and I tried to do it in a way that did not immediately cause horrific consequences to
1128760	1137640	both this person and myself, because we don't have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior.
1138200	1145240	We have nuclear weapons. We don't have any way of saying this is probably not a good place
1145240	1151640	or a role for you at this moment as an authority figure, and something needs to be worked on.
1151640	1159000	So in general, when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that way, our immediate instinct
1159000	1167240	is to treat the person as, you know, Satan. And we understand why we don't want our children
1167240	1176120	to be at risk. Now, I personally believe that I fell down on the job and did not call out the
1176120	1181000	Jeffrey Epstein thing early enough because I was terrified of what Jeffrey Epstein represents,
1181000	1187320	and this recapitulated the old terror trying to tell the world this therapist is out of control.
1188040	1193400	And when I said that, the world responded by saying, well, you have two appointments booked,
1193400	1196920	and you have to go for the second one. So I got reinflicted into this
1198040	1202120	office on this person who was now convinced that I was about to tear down his career and his
1202120	1205080	reputation. It might have been on the verge of suicide for all I know. I don't know.
1206040	1211400	But he was very, very angry, and he was furious with me that I had breached a sacred confidence
1211400	1217960	of his office. What kind of ripple effects has that had to the rest of your life,
1219240	1224360	the absurdity and the cruelty of that? I mean, there's no sense to it.
1226120	1229560	Well, see, this is the thing people don't really grasp, I think.
1229560	1240440	There's an academic who I got to know many years ago named Jennifer Fried, who has a theory of
1241400	1246840	betrayal, which she calls institutional betrayal. And her gambit is that when you were betrayed by
1246840	1253480	an institution that is sort of like a fiduciary or a parental obligation to take care of you,
1254440	1260360	that you find yourself in a far different situation with respect to trauma than if you
1260360	1268040	were betrayed by somebody who's a peer. And so I think that in my situation,
1270280	1279720	I kind of repeat a particular dynamic with authority. I come in not following all the rules,
1279880	1286120	trying to do some things, not trying to do others, blah, blah, blah. And then I get into a weird
1286120	1290920	relationship with authority. And so I have more experience with what I would call institutional
1290920	1300680	betrayal. Now, the funny part about it is that when you don't have masks or PPE in a influenza-like
1300680	1307720	pandemic, and you're missing ICU beds and ventilators, that is ubiquitous institutional
1308520	1315080	betrayal. So I believe that in a weird way, I was very early. The idea of, and this is like
1315640	1322600	the really hard concept, pervasive or otherwise universal institutional betrayal,
1322600	1327960	where all of the institutions, you can count on any hospital to not charge you properly for
1327960	1333640	where their services are. You can count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that
1333640	1339960	will be maximally beneficial to the people who take it. You know that your financial professionals
1339960	1345640	are not simply working in your best interests. And that issue had to do with the way in which
1345640	1351400	growth left our system. So I think that the weird thing is, is that this first institutional
1351400	1357400	betrayal by a therapist left me very open to the idea of, okay, well, maybe the schools are bad,
1357400	1361800	maybe the hospitals are bad, maybe the drug companies are bad, maybe our food is off,
1361800	1367880	maybe our journalists are not serving journalistic ends. And that was what allowed me to sort of go
1367880	1374280	all the distance and say, huh, I wonder if our problem is that something is causing all of our
1374280	1381240	sense-making institutions to be off. That was the big insight. And tying that to a single etiology,
1382200	1387240	what if it's just about growth? They were all built on growth, and now we've promoted people who
1387240	1393320	are capable of keeping quiet that their institutions aren't working. So the privileged
1394280	1400280	silent aristocracy, the people who can be counted upon not to mention a fire when a raging fire
1400280	1407800	is tearing through a building. But nevertheless, how big of a psychological burden is that?
1408520	1414520	It's huge. It's terrible. It's crushing. It's very comforting to be the parental,
1415080	1423640	I mean, I don't know, I treasure, I mean, we were just talking about MIT. I can intellectualize
1423640	1428440	and agree with everything you're saying, but there's a comfort, a warm blanket of being within the
1428440	1435480	institution. And up until Aaron Schwartz, let's say. In other words, now, if I look at
1436040	1440760	the provost and the president as mommy and daddy, you did what to my big brother?
1441080	1451240	You did what to our family? You sold us out in which way? What secrets left for China?
1451800	1458200	You hired which workforce? You did what to my wages? You took this portion of my grant for what
1458200	1464120	purpose? You just stole my retirement through a fringe rate. What did you do? But can you still,
1464120	1471320	I mean, the thing is about this view you have, is it often turns out to be sadly correct?
1471320	1476360	Well, this is the thing. But let me just, in this silly, hopeful thing,
1477400	1482040	do you still have hope in institutions? Can you within your, psychologically?
1482040	1487480	Yes. I'm referring not intellectually, because you have to carry this burden. Can you still have
1487480	1495080	a hope like within you? When you sit at home alone, and as opposed to seeing the darkness
1495080	1500200	within these institutions, seeing a hope. Well, but this is the thing I want to confront,
1501640	1508200	not for the purpose of a dust-up. I believe, for example, if you've heard episode 19,
1508200	1515720	that the best outcome is for Carol Greider to come forward as we discussed in episode 19.
1515800	1517240	Would your brother, Brett, want to start an episode?
1517240	1523160	And say, you know what? I screwed up. He did call. He did suggest the experiment.
1523800	1529160	I didn't understand that it was his theory that was producing it. Maybe I was slow to grasp it.
1530280	1539880	But my bad, and I don't want to pay for this bad choice on my part, let's say,
1540200	1544760	for the rest of my career. I want to own up, and I want to help make sure that
1546200	1548120	we do what's right with what's left.
1548120	1551720	And that's one little case within the institution that you would like to see made?
1551720	1557560	I would like to see MIT very clearly come out and say, you know, Margot O'Toole was right when
1557560	1566120	she said David Baltimore's lab here produced some stuff that was not reproducible with
1566200	1573160	Teresa Minishikari's research. I want to see the courageous people. I would like to see the
1573160	1579560	Aaron Schwartz wing of the computer science department. Yeah, let's think about it.
1580440	1585240	Wouldn't that be great if we said, you know, an injustice was done, and we're going to write
1585240	1591160	that wrong just as if this was Alan Turing? Which I don't think they've righted that wrong.
1591720	1596840	Well, then let's have the Turing Schwartz wing. The Turing Schwartz, they're starting a new
1596840	1600280	college of computing. It wouldn't be wonderful to call it the Turing Schwartz.
1600280	1605000	I would like to have the Madame Wu wing of the physics department, and I'd love to have the
1605000	1610120	Emmy Nerder statue in front of the math department. I mean, like, you want to get excited about
1610120	1614760	actual diversity and inclusion? Yeah. Well, let's go with our absolute best people who
1614760	1620840	never got theirs because there is structural bigotry, you know? But if we don't actually
1620840	1625800	start celebrating the beautiful stuff that we're capable of when we're handed heroes and we fumble
1625800	1635160	them into the trash, what the hell? I mean, Lex, this is such nonsense. We're just pulling our head
1636680	1644120	out. You know, on everyone's seekum should be tattooed. If you can read this, you're too close.
1644760	1655160	Beautifully put, and I'm a dreamer just like you. So I don't see as much of the darkness
1656360	1663720	genetically or due to my life experience, but I do share the hope. For my tea,
1663720	1668520	the institution that we care a lot about. You both do. Yeah. And Harvard institution,
1668520	1673880	I don't give a damn about, but you do. I love Harvard. I'm just kidding. I love Harvard,
1673880	1677640	but Harvard and I have a very difficult relationship. And part of what, you know,
1677640	1684440	when you love a family that isn't working, I don't want to trash. I didn't bring up the name of the
1684440	1691960	president of MIT during the Aaron Schwartz period. It's not vengeance. I want the rot cleared out.
1691960	1698840	I don't need to go after human beings. Yeah. Just like you said, with the disc formulation,
1699400	1703720	the individual human beings don't necessarily carry them.
1705800	1711160	It's those chairs that are so powerful that in which they sit. It's the chairs, not the humans.
1711160	1712440	It's not the humans.
