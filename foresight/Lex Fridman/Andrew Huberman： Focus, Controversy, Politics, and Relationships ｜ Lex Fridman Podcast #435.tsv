0	4720	Hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure. Can you read the quote once more?
5680	8400	Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with
13040	17840	The following is a conversation with Andrew Huberman his fifth time on the podcast
18480	26720	He is the host of the Huberman lab podcast and is an amazing scientist teacher human being and
27200	30080	Someone i'm grateful to be able to call a close friend
30960	39840	Also, he has a book coming out next year that you should pre-order now called protocols and operating manual for the human body
40800	47200	This is the lex freeman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends
47600	49600	Here's andrew Huberman
50400	54320	You think there's ever gonna be a day when you walk away from podcasting? Definitely
55120	56720	I mean I
56720	58000	came up
58000	60480	within and then on the periphery of
61360	63200	skateboard culture
63200	65120	And for the record, I was not a great skateboarder
65280	67840	I always have to say that because skateboarders are relentless
68400	70320	If you call something you didn't do or whatever
71040	73840	I mean, I could do a few things and I loved the community
74400	79280	And I still have a lot of friends in that community jim feebo at deluxe. You can look him up
79360	82240	He's kind of the man behind the whole scene. I know tony
82480	89760	hawk, dany whale these guys I got to see them come up and get big and stay big in many cases start huge companies like
89840	91840	Danny and calling the case our dc
93040	98960	Some people have a long life and something some don't but one thing I observed and learned a lot from in skateboarding
100400	104160	At the level of observing the skateboarders and then the ones that started companies
104960	106960	and then what I also
106960	108960	observed in science
109040	111040	and still observe is
111120	113120	You do it for a while
113200	115200	You do it at the highest possible level
115440	116720	for you
116720	118320	and then at some point
118320	120320	You pivot and you start
120320	122560	supporting the young talent coming in
123120	125840	In fact, the greatest scientists people like richard axl
126240	127680	Catherine do lock
127680	130560	There are many other labs in neuroscience carl diceroth
131520	134320	They're not just known for doing great science. They're known for
135120	138320	Mentoring some of the best scientists that then go on to start their own labs
138800	140800	and I think in podcasting
140800	144720	I am very fortunate. I got in in a fairly early wave not the earliest wave
145120	148400	But thanks to your suggestion of doing a podcast fairly early wave
148720	153680	And I'll continue to go as long as it feels right and I feel like I'm doing good in the world and providing good
154080	156080	But I'm already starting to scout talent
156880	161120	My company that I started with rob more psychom media
161760	165040	A couple other guys in there too. Mike play back our photographer ian macky
166160	168160	chris ray martin fobes
168720	172560	We are a company that produces podcasts right now. That's huberman lab podcast
172640	175840	But we're launching a new podcast perform a dr. Andy galpin
176000	176800	Nice
176800	182000	And we want to do more of that kind of thing finding a really great talent highly qualified people credential people
182480	183760	and I've got
183760	186720	A new kind of obsession with scouring the internet
187360	192240	Looking for the young talent in science in health and related fields
192800	194960	And so will there be a final episode of the
195600	196880	hlp
196880	198880	Yeah, I mean bullet buster cancer
200080	204720	Aside, you know someday they'll be the very last and thank you for your interest in science
205120	206480	And i'll clip out
206480	210880	Yeah, I love the idea of walking weight and not be dramatic about it
211200	215760	Right when it feels right you can leave and you can come back whenever the fuck you want, right?
216160	218080	John steward did this well with the daily show
218640	223920	I think that was during the 2016 election when everybody wanted him to stay on and he just walked away
224320	226320	Dave chappelle for different
226320	230800	Reasons walked away disappeared came back gave away so much money
231200	236320	Didn't care and then came back and was doing like stand-up in the park in the middle of nowhere
237520	244880	Genius you have habib who undefeated walks away at the very top of of a sport. Is he coming back? No
245600	250160	It's the least we don't know. Yeah, right. You don't know. I don't know if he bears everywhere or words
250880	256080	Yeah, I think you know, it's um, it's always a call, you know, you know the last
257120	262400	Few years have been tremendous growth. We launched in january 2021 and even this last year
262960	264960	2024 has been huge growth
265600	268400	you know in all sorts of ways it's been wild and
269280	271280	We have some short form content planned
272160	277040	That's 30 minute shorter episodes that really distill down the critical elements. We're also
278000	280960	Thinking about moving to other venues besides podcasting
281280	286320	so there's always the thought and the discussion but when it comes to like when to hang up your cleats, you know, it's like
287360	291040	There just comes a natural time where you can do more to mentor the next generation coming in
291760	294960	Then focusing on self and so there will come a time for that
295600	298880	And I think it's critical. I mean, again, I saw this in skateboarding like danny
299520	306480	And callin and danny's brother daemon started dc with ken block the driver who unfortunately passed away a little while ago
306720	308400	rally car driver
308400	309200	and
309200	312080	They eventually sold it. I think to quicksilver or something like that, but
312880	315920	They're all phenomenal talents in their respective areas
316480	318480	but they brought in the next
319200	324000	You know on the next line of amazing riders for the plan b thing, you know, paul rodriguez for skateboarders
324000	326000	They know who this is now in science
326800	333360	There are scientists like fine men for instance. I don't know if anyone can name one of his mentor offspring
334000	336000	So there are scientists who are phenomenal
336560	342560	Like beyond world class, right multi-generational world class who don't make good mentors
342720	345680	I'm not saying he wasn't a good mentor, but that's not what he's known for and then there are
346720	352080	scientists who are known for being excellent scientists and and great mentors and I think there's no higher
352720	356880	Um celebration to be had at the end of one's career if you can look back and like hey
356880	361040	I put some really important knowledge into the world people made use of that knowledge
361440	363440	And guess what you spawned all these
364400	366000	other
366000	368000	scientific offspring or sport
368640	370640	offspring or
370640	371600	podcast offspring
371600	376720	I mean in some ways we look to rogan and to some of the other earlier podcasts is like they
377120	381520	You know, they paved the way ronda patrick first science podcast out there
382400	383440	so
383440	385440	You know it eventually
385600	390560	The baton passes but fortunately right now everybody's active and it and it feels really good
391360	393760	Yeah, well you're talking about the healthy way to do it, but there's also
395440	396640	Uh
396640	399360	a different kind of way where you have uh, something like uh
400240	404400	Grisha gregory perlman the mathematician who refused to accept the fields medal
404640	410000	So he's one of the greatest living mathematicians and he just walked away from mathematics and rejected the fields medal
410240	412240	What did he do after he left mathematics?
412720	413920	life
413920	419920	Private 100% I respect that he's become essentially a recluse is these photos of him
420400	426080	Looking very broke like he could use the money. He he turned away the money. He turned away everything
426720	428720	you know, there's there's
429120	430560	You just have to listen to the inner voice
430640	436000	You have to listen to yourself and make the decisions that don't make any sense for the rest of the world and make sense to you
436240	442960	I mean bob dillon didn't show up to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. That's punk. Yeah. Yeah, he probably grew in
443440	445280	no variety for that
445360	449360	Yeah, maybe just doesn't like going in sweden, but it seemed like a big fun trip
449440	453200	I think they do it in a nice time of years, but hey, that's his right. He earned that right
453520	457840	I think the best artists aren't doing it for the prize. They aren't doing it for the fame or the money
457920	462880	They're doing it because they love the heart. Yeah, that's the the rick ruven thing. He got a verb it through
463520	465520	Download your inner thing
466400	468400	I don't think we've talked about this that
468800	470800	this obsession that I have about how
471680	472960	rick
472960	474160	has this
474160	476880	way of being very very still in his body
478080	480080	But keeping his mind very active
480880	482560	as a practice
482560	484560	When spent some time with him in italy last june
485360	488640	And we would tread water and his pool in the morning and listen to
489440	491440	history of rock and roll and hundred songs
492240	494960	Um amazing podcast by the way. It is yeah
495360	499920	And um, and then he would spend a fair amount of time during the day, you know in this kind of meditative state
500000	502000	Where his mind is very active body very still
502720	509600	And then carl dice roth when he came on my podcast talked about how he forces himself to sit still and think in complete sentences late at night
509600	511600	after his kids go to sleep
511600	512880	and
512880	515840	You know, there's a state of mind rapid eye movement sleep
516320	522000	Where your body is completely paralyzed and the mind is extremely active and people credit rapid eye movement sleep with some of the more
522560	526400	elaborate emotion filled dreams and the source of many ideas
527040	529040	and there are other examples
529120	531120	Einstein
531520	535680	People described him as taking walks around the princeton campus then pausing
536560	537360	and
537360	542800	Would ask him what was going on and the idea that his mind was continuing to churn forward at a high rate
543600	545600	um
545920	553200	So, you know, this is far from controlled studies, but we're talking about some incredible minds and creatives who have a practice of
554080	556980	Stilling the body while keeping the mind deliberately very active
557860	562340	Very similar to rapid eye movement sleep. And then there are a lot of people who also report, you know
562340	564900	Great ideas coming to them in the shower while running
565780	570420	So it can be the opposite as well where the body is very active and the and the mind is perhaps more on
571300	575940	Kind of like a default mode network not really focusing on any one specific thing
576180	581460	You know interesting as a there's a bunch of physicists and mathematicians have talked to they talk about
582180	583940	sleep deprivation
584020	587860	And going crazy hours through the night obsessively pursuing a thing
588420	591540	And then the solution to the problem comes when they finally get
592100	598740	rest right and and we know we just did this sixth episode special series on sleep with matt walker
599780	601300	we know
601300	602820	that
602820	607540	When you deprive yourself of sleep and then you get sleep you get a rebound in rapid eye movement sleep
607540	609700	You get a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep
610340	615060	And matt talks about this in the podcast and he did an episode on sleep and
615780	620740	Creativity sleep and memory and rapid eye movement sleep comes up multiple times in that series
622020	628580	There's also some very interesting stuff about cannabis withdrawal and rapid eye movement sleep people are coming off cannabis often will suffer from
629860	633220	Insomnia, but when they finally do start sleeping they like dream like crazy
634260	637940	Cannabis is a very controversial topic right now. Oh, yeah, I saw that what happened
637940	639940	There's a bunch of drama around
640340	645620	Episode you did on cannabis. Yeah, we did a episode about cannabis talked about the health
646340	650180	Benefits and the potential risks right it's neither here nor there
650980	655700	It depends on the person depends on the age depends on genetic background a number of other things
657780	659060	We
659060	664420	published that episode well over a year ago and it had no issues online so to speak
664900	668500	And then a clip of it was put to x where you know
669380	672180	The real action occurs as you know your favorite
672340	673460	box
673460	678020	Yeah, yeah, the the the four ounce gloves as opposed to the 16 ounce gloves
678500	682020	That is x versus instagram or youtube
682900	684900	there was
684980	691780	Kind of an immediate dog pile from a few people in the cannabis research field to phds and mds
691860	695220	Yeah, there were people on our side. There were people on our side. I mean
696100	698420	You know the the statement that got
699060	704180	Things riled up the most was this notion that for certain individuals
705140	707060	there's a
707060	714420	High potential for inducing psychosis with high thc containing cannabis for certain individuals not all
715700	717700	That sparked some issues
718980	720980	There was really a split, you know
722020	724020	See this in different fields it
724740	728820	There was one person in particular who came out swinging with language that
729380	732820	In my opinion is not like of the sort that you would use at a university
733780	735300	venue
735300	741220	Especially among colleagues, but that's fine. You know, we're all grown-ups. Well for me from my perspective. It was strangely rude
741860	743620	and it
743620	745860	had an era of like elitism
747140	749140	that
749140	750820	to me
750820	756260	Was it the source of the problem during covet that led to the distrust of science
756740	763940	And the the popularization of disrespecting science because so many scientists spoke with an arrogance and a douche baggery
764340	769140	That I wish we would have a little bit less of yeah, it's tough because most academics
769780	772420	Don't understand that people outside the university system
773540	774580	are
774580	776580	they don't they're not familiar with
777380	779300	like the inner workings of science and
780260	786100	And the culture and so you have to be very careful how you present when you're a university professor
787140	790180	And when yeah, so, you know, he came out swinging at some, you know
790740	795220	A four letter word type language and he was obviously upset about so I simply said what I would say anywhere
795540	797860	Which was hey look you come on the podcast. Let's chat
798660	799540	and
799540	802820	Why don't you give your tell me where I'm wrong and let's discuss and
803940	804900	and
804900	806500	Fortunately, he agreed
806500	812500	And initially he said well, no, how can I be sure you're not going to misrepresent me and so I said we got on a
813220	818340	Dm then an email then eventually phone call and just said hey listen like you're welcome to record the whole conversation
818900	824420	We've never done a gotcha on my podcast and let's just get to the heart of the matter. I think this this little controversy is
825060	826740	perfect
826740	829700	kindling for for a really great discussion and
830500	834180	And he had some other conditions that we worked out and and I and I felt like
834660	838900	Cool like he's really interested although you get a very different person on the phone than you do on twitter
839300	842580	I will say he's been very collegial and that conversation is on the schedule
843060	846020	I said it will fly you out or put you up. He said no he wants to fly himself
846100	849300	He really wants to make sure that there's like kind of a space between
850020	850740	um
850740	855300	I think some of the perception of science and health podcasts in the academic community is that
855940	859220	It's all designed to sell something. No, we run ads so it can be free to everyone else
859540	864740	Yeah, but I think look in the end. Um, he agreed and I'm excited for the conversation
865300	867300	It was interesting because
867540	869780	In the wake of that little exchange
871460	877220	There's been a bunch of press from traditional press about cannabis has now surpassed alcohol
877620	879780	in many in many cultures as
880420	884500	Within the united states as when I say cultures. I mean demographics
885220	887220	The united states as the as the drug of choice
887780	888580	um
888580	892900	There have been people highlighting the issues of potential psychosis in high thc containing
893620	894820	and so it's
894820	899700	Kind of interesting to see how traditional media is sort of on board certain elements that you know, I put forward and
900180	904660	I think there's some controversy as to whether or not the different strains the indicas and sativas
904740	909140	I have are biologically different, etc. So we'll get down into the weeds pun intended
910020	914340	During that one and I'm excited. It's the first time that we've responded to
915300	917300	A direct criticism online about
917860	923060	Um scientific content in a way that really promoted like oh here the idea of inviting a particular guest
923460	926580	And so it's great. Let's get a guest to um his expert in cannabis
926660	931700	I I believe I could be wrong about this that he's a behavioral neuroscientist is slightly different training
931780	935220	but look he seems highly credentialed to be fun and we
936260	938260	You know, we welcome that kind of exchange
938980	939860	I
939940	942660	I'm not being diplomatic. I'm just saying like it's cool. Like he's coming on
942740	944740	No, you you know, and he was friendly on the phone, right?
944980	948820	Like he literally came out online and was like basically like kind of like fu
949300	953460	Like f this and fu, but you get someone on the phone. It's like, hey, how's it going? And then like, oh, yeah
953540	959460	Well, you know, I there was an immediate apology of like, hey, listen. I came out. Normally. I'm like not like that
959540	964340	But online, you know, you got a different. Yeah. Okay, so it's a little bit like it's a little bit like jiu-jitsu, right?
964420	967460	People say all sorts of things I guess but if they if you're like, all right, well
967940	970020	Let's go then it's probably a different story
970420	975060	You know, it's not like jiu-jitsu because the jiu-jitsu people don't talk shit because they know what the consequences are
975380	979860	Let me let me just say on mic and off mic. You have been very respectful towards this person
981060	985220	And I'm look up to you and respect you and admire the fact that you have been
985620	992180	That said to me that guy was being a dick and when you graciously politely invited him on the podcast
992180	998260	He was still talking down to you the whole time. So I really admire and look forward to listening to you talk to him
998340	1000340	But I hope others
1000340	1001700	don't do that
1001700	1003460	like you are
1003460	1004820	a positive
1004820	1006580	humble voice
1006580	1012980	Exploring all the interesting aspects of science like you want to learn if there you've got anything wrong
1014180	1017060	You want to learn about it the way he was being a dick
1017780	1019380	I was just
1019380	1023780	Hurt a little bit not because of him but because like there's some people I really really admire
1024340	1027460	Brilliant scientists that are not their best cells
1028100	1034020	On twitter on x definitely. I don't understand what happens to their brain. Well, they regress
1034660	1039460	They they regress and and they also are protected, you know, you know, when you remove the
1040180	1044340	I mean no scientific argument should ever come to physical blows, right?
1044580	1049220	But when you remove the real world thing of being right in front of somebody, um
1049380	1053620	People will throw all sorts of stones at a distance, you know an over a wall
1054100	1055380	and they've got their
1055380	1059460	Their wife or their husband or their boyfriend or their dog or their cat to go cuddle with them afterwards
1060100	1060980	um
1060980	1063780	But you get in a room and it's like, you know
1064420	1066420	confrontational people
1066980	1068980	In real life are are pretty rare
1068980	1073860	But hopefully if they do it they're like willing to back it up with knowledge in this case, right?
1073860	1078260	We're not talking about physical altercation. Yeah, he kept coming and he kept putting on conditions
1078260	1080660	How do I know you want this and I was like, well, you can record the conversation
1080660	1085540	How do I know you want that? Listen, we'll pay for you to come out. How do you know and eventually he just kind of relented?
1086100	1087460	and um
1087460	1089780	And it to his credit, you know, he's agreed to come on
1089940	1091220	I mean he still has to show up
1091220	1094980	But once he does, you know, we'll treat him right like we would any other guest
1095060	1100020	Yeah, you treat people really well and I I just hope that people are a little bit nicer on the internet
1100100	1104340	Yeah, well, you know x is an interesting one because you it thickens your skin
1105060	1109380	You know to just to go on there. I mean you have to be ready to deal with sure
1109460	1117780	But I can still criticize people for for being douchebags because like that's still not good inspiring behavior like especially for scientists
1118820	1121380	That should be sort of symbols of
1122420	1125140	Scientific thinking which requires intellectual humility
1125940	1130740	Humility is a big part of that and twitter is a good place to illustrate that
1131300	1135460	Yeah, eight years ago. I used to I was a student in ta then
1136340	1142020	Instructor and then directed a cold spring harbour course on visual neuroscience. These are summer courses that
1142980	1145140	Explore different topics and at night we would host
1145860	1149060	Um, what we hoped were battles in front of the students
1149780	1155460	Where you'd get two people on it, you know, would it be neural prosthetics or molecular tools that would first, you know
1156420	1158340	Restore vision to the blind kind of arguments
1158340	1161540	You know, kind of like it's kind of a silly argument because there's gonna be a combination of both, right?
1162100	1163060	but
1163060	1164900	You'd get these great arguments
1164900	1172180	But the arguments were always couched in data and occasionally you'd get somebody would go like or would curse or something
1172180	1175460	But it was the rare very um very well placed
1176020	1179220	You know, um insult it wasn't you know coming out swinging
1179700	1183060	Um, I think ultimately, you know twitter is a record of people's behavior
1183220	1188500	That the internet is a record of people's behavior and here i'm not talking about news reports about people's behavior
1188500	1190500	I'm talking about how people show up
1190900	1196980	Online up is really important. You've always carried yourself with a ton of composure and respect and
1197460	1200660	You know, you just you would hope that people would grow from that example
1200660	1204260	Well, I'll tell you that the the podcasters that i'm scouting it's their energy
1204500	1209540	But it's also how they treat other people how they respond to comments and um, you know
1209620	1215060	We're blessed to have pretty significant reach when we put out a podcast like someone else's podcast
1215060	1221220	It goes far and wide so like a skateboard team like a laboratory where you're selecting people to be in your lab
1221700	1225700	You're you want to pick people that you would enjoy working with and they're collegial
1227060	1230420	Etiquette and etiquette is is lacking nowadays
1231220	1233220	But you're in the suit and tie bringing it back
1233620	1234980	bringing it back
1234980	1237700	Uh, you said that your conversation with james hollis
1238340	1241460	A union psychoanalyst had a big impact on you. What do you mean?
1242500	1244340	james hollis is a
1244340	1246020	84 year old union
1246020	1249860	psychoanalyst who's written 17 books including under Saturn shadow
1250420	1256660	Which is on the healing and trauma of men the eating eden project. Excuse me, which is about relationships and creating a life
1257220	1262180	I discovered james hollis in an online lecture that was recorded. I think in san diego. It's on youtube
1262260	1264500	The audio is terrible called creating a life
1265300	1268980	And this was somewhere in the 2011 to 2015 span
1269060	1272820	I can't remember and I was on my way to europe and I called my girlfriend at the time
1272900	1275380	I was like, I just found the most incredible lecture i've ever heard
1276260	1277620	and I
1277620	1279300	he talks about
1279300	1280500	the shadow
1280500	1282500	he talks about
1282980	1289620	Your developmental upbringing and how you either align with or go 180 degrees off your
1290420	1293940	Parents tendencies and values in certain areas. He talked about
1294580	1298740	The specific questions to ask of oneself at different stages of life to live a full life
1298820	1302020	so it's always been a dream of mine to meet him and to record a podcast
1302900	1303940	and
1303940	1307780	He wasn't able to travel so our team went out to dc and sat down with him
1307780	1311220	we rarely do that nowadays people come to our studio and
1312180	1318820	He came in he had some surgeries recently and he kind of came in with some assistance from a you know a cane and then
1319300	1321300	sat down and just
1321380	1324420	Just blew my mind it from start to finish
1324980	1326980	He didn't miss a syllable
1327060	1330020	and every sentence that he spoke was
1330660	1333860	like a quotable sentence of with real potency and
1335380	1337620	Actionable items. I think one of the things that was most
1338500	1339860	striking
1339860	1344260	To me was how he said when we take ourselves out of stimulus and response
1345220	1350020	And we just force ourselves to spend some time in the quiet of our thoughts
1350980	1356100	While walking or while seated or while lying down doesn't have to be meditation, but it could be
1357140	1358500	that
1358500	1363780	We access our unconscious mind in ways that reveals to us who we really are and what we really want
1363860	1368180	And that if we do that practice repeatedly 10 minutes a day here 15 minutes a day there
1369060	1371060	that we start to really touch into
1371620	1377540	Our unique gifts and the things that make us each us and the directions we need to take
1378260	1384740	But that so often we just stay in stimulus response. We just do do do do do, which is great. We have to be productive
1385460	1387460	um, but we miss those
1387460	1388340	um
1388340	1390340	important messages and
1390900	1392900	interestingly he also
1392900	1399060	Put forward this idea of what is this like get up shut up suit up. Yeah something like that like get out of bed suit up
1399780	1404820	And shut up and get to work. He also has that in him kind of a Goggins type mindset
1405220	1410580	So be able to turn off all this self-reflection and self analysis and just get shit done get shit done
1410820	1416660	But then also take dedicated time and stop and just let stuff geyser to the surface from the unconscious mind
1416980	1419860	and he quotes shakespeare and he quotes yung and he quotes
1420580	1424420	Everybody through history with with incredible accuracy and um
1425380	1427380	and in exactly the way
1428260	1433220	Needed to drive home a point, but that conversation to me was one that I really felt like okay, you know
1433940	1436260	If I don't wake up tomorrow for whatever reason
1437060	1441460	That one's in the can and I feel really great about it. It's it to me. It's the most important
1442500	1444500	guest recording we've ever done
1444980	1446820	um
1446820	1449540	In particular because he has wisdom
1450420	1452420	And while I hope he lives to be
1452580	1454580	204
1454580	1459700	Chances are he's got another what 20 30 years with us. Hopefully
1460340	1465540	More but I really really wanted to capture that information and get it out there
1465540	1467540	So I'm very very proud of that one
1467860	1468820	um
1468820	1474500	And he's the kind of guy that anyone listens to him young old male female whatever and you're gonna get something of value
1475220	1477220	What do you think about this idea?
1478260	1480100	of the shadow
1480100	1481460	that uh
1481460	1483460	The good the bad that we were press
1483940	1489300	That hides from plain sight when we analyze ourselves. That's there. You think there's like a ocean
1490420	1492420	We don't have direct access to yes
1493540	1499540	Yeah, young said it we have all things inside of us and we do and some people are more in touch with those than others and
1499940	1503060	Some people it's repressed. I mean does that mean that we could all be
1504020	1506900	You know horrible people or marvelous people
1507700	1510100	Benevolent people perhaps I think that
1510740	1512740	um
1512820	1516980	Thankfully more often than not people lean away from the like violent and
1517780	1521460	harmful parts of their their shadow, but I think spending time
1522340	1524180	thinking about
1524180	1526180	you know ones
1527220	1532980	Shadow shadows is super important. How how else are we going to grow otherwise?
1533460	1536660	you know, we have these unconscious blind spots of denial or
1537380	1538500	um
1538500	1540900	Repression or whatever, you know, the psychiatrists tell us
1541700	1547060	But yeah, it clearly exists within all of us. I mean, we have neural circuits for rage. We all do we have neural circuits for
1548100	1549220	altruism
1549220	1551700	um, and no one's born without these things
1552260	1555300	and some people they're atrophied and some people they're hypertrophied but
1557060	1559460	Looking inward and and recognizing what's there is
1560260	1561220	key
1561220	1565940	Or positive things like creativity. Maybe that's what rick rubin is accessing when he goes silent
1566420	1568420	Silent body active mind
1569060	1571060	That's interesting. What is it for you?
1571860	1573860	What place do you go to?
1574020	1579300	That generates ideas that helps you generate ideas. I have a lot of new practices around this
1579380	1584100	I mean, I'm all like always exploring for protocols. I have to it's like in my nature
1584660	1585540	um
1585540	1591300	When when I went and spent time with rick, I I tried to adopt his practice of staying very still and just letting stuff
1591540	1594900	You know come to the surface or the dystherothian way of
1596020	1598980	Formulating complete sentences and while being still in the body
1599940	1601300	what I
1601300	1605140	I found works better is what my good friend tim armstrong
1605700	1611300	Does to write music he writes music every day. He's a music producer. He's obviously a singer guitar player for rancid
1611940	1613940	um, and he's helped
1613940	1615940	dozens and dozens and dozens of
1616020	1618260	female pop artists and punk rock artists
1618980	1621780	write great songs and many of the
1622580	1625460	famous songs that you've heard from other artists
1625940	1627940	Tim helped them write
1628020	1628980	Tim
1628980	1633780	Wakes up sometimes in the middle of the night and what he does is he'll start drawing or painting
1634180	1639060	So what he's done and joni mitchell talks about this too. You find some creative outlet
1640100	1641380	that's
1641380	1643620	like 15 degrees off center from your
1644340	1649860	Main creative outlet and you do that thing. So for me, that's drawing. I like doing anatomical drawings
1650580	1654820	Neuroscience based drawing drawn neurons that kind of thing and if I do that for a little while
1655700	1661140	My mind starts churning on the the nervous system and biology and then I come up with
1662660	1664660	Areas I'd like to explore for the podcast
1664980	1667860	Ways I'd like to address certain topics right now
1667860	1673620	I'm very interested in autonomic control of beautiful paper came out that shows that anyone can learn to control their pupil sizes
1673860	1677300	And without changing luminance through a bio feedback mechanism
1677860	1679860	um, and that gives them
1680180	1683060	control over their so-called automatic autonomic nervous system
1683700	1688500	And I've been looking at what the circuitry is and it's it's beautiful. So I'll draw the circuitry
1689220	1692340	That we know underlies autonomic function and as I'm doing that I'm thinking
1692340	1696180	Oh, like what about autonomic control and those people that supposedly can control their pupil size
1696180	1699780	Then you go in and there's a paper published in nature press one of the nature journals
1699780	1701540	And there's a recent paper on this like oh cool
1701540	1706180	And then we talk about this and then how could this be put into a kind of a post or how could this?
1706740	1711540	You know, so doing things that are about 15 degrees off center from your main thing is a great way to access
1711620	1715620	I believe that the circuits for in tim's case painting goes to songwriting
1716740	1718740	I think for
1718740	1723300	Joni Mitchell that was also the case, right? I think it was drawing and painting to singing and songwriting
1723940	1725940	For rick. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's
1726260	1730580	listening to podcasts. I don't know that that's his business. Do you have anything that you like to
1731460	1735780	Focus on that allows you then an easier transition into your main creative work
1736020	1739220	No, I'd really like to focus on emptiness and silence
1739460	1746100	So I pick the dragon. I have to slay. So whatever the problem I have to work on and I just sit there
1747620	1750420	And stare at I love how fucking linear you are
1750980	1754580	And I just and if there's no if you're tired, I'll just sit
1755380	1757780	I believe in the in the power of just waiting
1758500	1759620	and
1759620	1761620	Usually I'll stop being tired
1761860	1765780	Or the energy rises from somewhere or an idea pops from somewhere
1765780	1770420	But there needs to be a silence and an emptiness. It's an empty room. Just me and the dragon and
1771140	1777460	We wait, that's it. Like if it's a usually with programming you're thinking about a particular design like how do I design this thing
1778900	1780900	To solve this problem
1780980	1785060	Any cognitive enhancers? I've got it quite the gallery in front of me. Well, that's right. Yeah
1785460	1788900	Should we walk through this? Yeah, this is not there's not a sales thing. It's just
1789380	1795060	Um, I tend to do this bounce back and forth your refrigerator just happened to have a lot of different choices
1795060	1799860	So water all my refrigerator. I know right. There's no food in there. There's water
1800660	1805380	There's element which they now have canned. Yeah, and yes, they're a podcast sponsor for both of us
1805380	1808340	But that's not why I cracked one of these open. I like them provide their they're cold
1808500	1813540	And that's by the way, my least favorite flavors. I was saying that's that's the reason it's still left in the fridge
1813700	1817860	The cherry one is really good. The black cherry. There's an orange one
1818020	1822500	Yeah, I pushed the um the sled this morning and pulled the sled for my workout at the gym
1822500	1830340	And and it was hot today here in austin. So um some salt is good and then matina urba mate zero sugar full confession
1830340	1836260	I helped develop this i'm a partial owner, but I love urba mate half argentine been drinking mate since i was a
1836260	1841540	Little kid there's actually a photo somewhere on the internet when i'm like three sitting on my grandfather's lap sipping mate out the
1841540	1845940	Gourd and then this my fun interesting. This is just a little bit of coffee
1847060	1852260	With a scoop of brian johnson gave me cocoa just like pure unsweetened cocoa
1852660	1855220	So I put that in chocolate and I like it it just for the taste
1855300	1860500	Well, actually nukes my appetite and since i'm we're not going out to dinner tonight until later. I figure that's good
1861220	1865700	Yeah, brian's an interesting one, right? He's really pushing this this thing the optimization of everything
1865860	1868660	Although he just heard his ankle. He posted a photo. He heard his ankle
1868660	1873940	So now he's injecting bpc body protection compound 157 which many many people are taking by the way
1874020	1876020	I did an episode on peptides
1876340	1880660	I should just say, you know bpc 157 one of the known effects in animal models
1881220	1886020	Is angiogenesis like development of new vasculature, which can be great
1886820	1890980	In some context, but also if you have a tumor you don't really want to vascularize that tumor anymore
1891460	1894260	So I worry about people taking bpc 157 continually
1895060	1896900	but um
1896900	1902420	And there's very little human data. I think there's like one study and it's a lousy one. So a lot of animal data
1903220	1905220	Some of the peptides
1905300	1908980	Are interesting. However, there's one that I've experimented with a little bit called pinealyn
1909540	1914020	Which um, I find even if I've just taken it twice a week before sleep
1914660	1917300	Then it times it seems to do something to the
1918180	1922020	Circadian timekeeping mechanism because then on other days when I don't take it
1922580	1926660	I get unbelievably tired at that time that normally I would do the injection
1926980	1931140	These are things that I'll experiment with for a couple weeks and then typically stop maybe try something else
1931220	1933220	but I stay out of
1933700	1936660	Things that really stimulate any of like a major hormone pathways
1937300	1941460	When it comes to peptides, there's actually a really good question of how do you experiment?
1941940	1944500	Like how long do you try to think to figure out if it works for you?
1944740	1949300	Well, I'm very sensitive to these things. So I and I have been doing a lot of things for a long time
1949300	1952900	So if I add something in it's always one thing at a time and I notice right away
1952900	1956580	If it does not make me feel good like there's a lot of excitement about some of the
1957140	1959140	so-called growth hormone secretogogs
1959540	1961540	hypermoralin, testemoralin, sermoralin
1962260	1965140	Um, I've experimented a little bit with those in the past and they've
1965780	1967780	Nuked my rap and eye movement sleep
1968100	1971620	But given me a lot of deep sleep, which doesn't feel good to me, but other people like them
1972820	1974180	I also
1974180	1975300	just
1975300	1977060	Generally try and avoid
1977060	1981060	Taking peptides that tap into these hormone pathways because you can run into all sorts of issues
1981060	1982740	But some people take them safely
1982740	1984500	But usually after about four or five days
1984500	1990180	I know if I like something or I don't and then I move on, but I am not super adventurous with these things
1990180	1994660	I know people that will take cocktails of peptides with multiple things. They'll try anything
1995140	1997140	That's not me and I do blood work
1997540	2000660	um, but also I'm you know, I'm mainly
2001380	2004820	reading papers and podcasting and um, I'm
2005380	2009540	Teaching a course next spring. Stanford. I'm gonna do a big undergraduate course
2010180	2013140	um, so I'm trying to develop that course and things like that so
2013220	2020500	Um, I don't need to lift more weight or run further than I already do which is not that much weight or far as it is
2020740	2025300	All right, you're not going to the olympics. You're not trying to no truly maximize some aspect of your performance
2025300	2030260	No, and I'm not and I'm not trying to get down below whatever, you know, seven percent body fat or something
2030260	2032260	I don't have those kinds of goals
2032260	2038580	So hydration electrolytes caffeine in the form of mate and then this coffee thing and then and then here's one that I think
2038900	2042740	I brought out for discussion. This is a piece of Nicarat. They're not a sponsor
2043380	2044260	um
2044260	2046260	nicotine is an interesting compound
2046740	2048740	it will raise blood pressure
2048740	2050740	and it um
2051220	2056900	Is probably not safe for everybody, but you know, the nicotine is gaining in popularity like crazy mainly these um
2057620	2062420	Pouches that people put in the lip not we're not talking about. I'm smoking vaping dipping or snuffing
2063380	2064500	you know, my
2064500	2067940	interest in nicotine started this was in 2010
2068020	2074660	I was visiting columbia medical school and I was in the office of the great neurobiologist richard axl won the noble prize
2075620	2080260	Co-recipient with linda buck for the um discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction
2080980	2087540	Brilliant guy. He's probably in his late 70s now probably. Yeah, and he kept popping nicorette in his mouth
2087940	2091300	And I was like, what's this about and he said, oh, well, this was just anecdote, right?
2091300	2095780	But he said but he said this he said, oh, well, you know, it protects against Parkinson's and Alzheimer's
2095780	2098500	I said it does and he goes, yeah, I don't know if he was kidding or not
2098500	2101780	He's known for making jokes and then he said that when he used to smoke
2102260	2103940	It really helped his focus and creativity
2103940	2107700	But then he quit smoking because he went lung cancer and he found that he couldn't focus as well
2107700	2110740	So he would choose nicorette. So occasionally like right now
2111380	2114580	Well, each I do a half a piece, but I'm not russian
2115140	2118020	So I'm a little, you know, you know, did you spot the whole thing in your mouth?
2118820	2121460	So I'll do a couple milligrams every now and again
2122180	2126180	And it definitely sharpens the mind on an empty stomach in particular, but you fast all day
2126180	2131620	You're still doing one meal a day one meal a day. Yeah. Yeah, I did a nicotine pouch with Rogan at dinner
2132180	2134580	And I got high. Yeah, that's a lot
2135220	2137060	That's like usually six or eight milligrams
2137700	2139220	I know people that
2139220	2141220	get a canister of zin
2141380	2146660	Take one a day pretty soon. They're taking a canister a day. So you have to be very careful. I will only allow myself
2147620	2149620	two pieces of nicorette total
2150020	2151300	per week
2151300	2153300	And you will notice that
2153300	2157220	You know in the day after you use it, you know, sometimes your your throat will feel a little bit like
2157700	2160100	Like a little spasmy like you might want to cough once or twice
2160900	2165700	And so, you know, if you're a singer or your podcast or something you have to do a long podcast
2165780	2168900	You want to just be mindful of but yeah, you're supposed to kind of like keep it in your cheek and
2169620	2171620	Now here we go, but it did make me
2172660	2178180	Intensely focused in a way that was a little bit scary because um the nucleus basalis
2178980	2184900	Is in the you know, basal forebrain nucleus has cholinergic neurons that radiate out
2186020	2190020	axons little wires that release acetylcholine into the neocortex and elsewhere
2190820	2192820	and when you focus on one particular
2193300	2198740	Topic matter or one particular area of your visual field or listening to something and focusing visually
2199380	2206820	We know that there's a an elaboration of the amount of acetylcholine release there and it binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor sites there
2206900	2209220	So it's a kind of an attentional modulation
2210020	2213620	by acetylcholine. So you're getting in with nicotine. You're getting a
2214660	2216340	Exogenous or artificial
2216340	2217700	heightening of that
2217700	2222020	circuitry and the time I had talk of Carlson on the podcast. He told me that apparently
2222580	2224580	It helps him as he said publicly
2225860	2227860	keep his
2228420	2232020	Love life vibrant really it caused a visa constriction
2232100	2235940	Like he literally said it makes his dick very hard. He said that publicly also
2235940	2238900	Okay, well as little as I want to think about Tucker Carlson's
2239940	2241460	sex life
2241460	2243140	no disrespect
2243140	2245140	uh the
2246020	2251940	Major effect of nicotine on the vascular my understanding is that it causes vasoconstriction not vasodilation
2252740	2254740	drugs like cialis to dallafill
2255860	2258820	Viagra etc vasodilators they allow more blood flow
2259780	2260820	Um
2260820	2268740	Nicotine does the opposite less blood flow to the periphery, but provided dosages are kept low and I don't recommend people use it frequently
2269380	2273940	Or at all and I don't recommend young people use it, you know, um, you know
2274820	2280660	25 and younger brain's very plastic at that time and um, and certainly smoking dipping
2281380	2285620	Vaping it's nothing aren't good because you're gonna run into we were running into trouble
2286420	2291700	For other reasons, but in any case, um, well and even there vaping is a controversial topic
2293140	2295700	Probably safer than smoking but has its own issues and
2296340	2299060	I said something like that and boy did I catch a lot of heat for that
2299220	2302340	You can't say anything as a health science educator not piss somebody off
2302980	2306900	You know, it just depends on where the the center of mass is and how far outside that you are
2307700	2310020	For me the caffeine is the main thing
2310500	2316340	And actually it's a it's a really big part of my life and one of the things you recommend that people wait a bit in the morning
2316420	2318420	Oh, yeah to consume caffeine if
2319220	2320740	they
2320740	2324420	Experience a crash in the afternoon that this is one of the misconceptions. I
2325300	2326820	um
2326820	2331380	I regret maybe even discussing it for people that crash in the afternoon
2333620	2338420	Oftentimes if they delay their caffeine by 60 and 90 minutes in the morning, they will offset some of that
2339380	2343060	But if you eat a lunch that's too big or you didn't sleep all the night before you're not gonna avoid that
2343620	2344820	afternoon crash
2344820	2349780	But I'll wake up sometimes and go straight to hydration caffeine, especially if I'm gonna work out. Here's a weird one
2350980	2352980	If I exercise before
2354420	2356100	8 30 a.m
2356100	2358660	Especially if I start exercising when I'm a little bit tired
2359140	2361140	I get energy that lasts all day
2361860	2366420	If I wait until my peak of energy, which is mid morning 10 a.m. 11 a.m.
2366420	2372500	And I started exercising then I'm basically exhausted all afternoon and I don't understand why I mean it depends on the intensity of the
2372500	2375380	Workout, but so I like to be done showered
2376260	2377300	and
2377300	2381220	Heading into work by 9 a.m. But I don't always meet that much
2381220	2384980	So you're saying it doesn't affect your energy if you start out with exercising
2385220	2391780	I think you can get energy and wake yourself up with exercise if you start early and it and then that fuels you all day long
2392180	2395380	I think that if you wait until you're feeling at your best to train
2396500	2400980	Sometimes that's detrimental because then in the afternoon when you're doing like the work we get paid for
2401620	2407860	Like research podcasting, etc. Then oftentimes, you know, your your brain isn't firing as well
2408100	2413780	That's interesting. I haven't really rigorously tried that wake up and just start running or this is the gioco thing
2414100	2420660	And then there's this phenomenon called entrainment where if you force yourself to exercise or eat
2421140	2427140	Or socialize or if you bright light at a certain time of day for three to seven days in a row pretty soon
2427460	2430740	There's an anticipatory circuit that gets generated. This is why
2431540	2433540	anyone in theory can become a morning person
2434100	2436660	to some degree or another and this is also
2438340	2442260	Beautiful example of why you wake up before your alarm clock goes off, you know
2442260	2443860	People wake up and all of a sudden it goes off
2443860	2449060	It wasn't because it clicked it's because you have this incredible timekeeping mechanism that exists in sleep
2449620	2451860	And there's some papers that have been published in the last couple of years
2452340	2459300	Nature neuroscience and elsewhere showing that people can answer math problems in their sleep simple math problems, but math problems nonetheless
2461380	2466020	This does not mean that if you ask your partner a question in sleep that they're going to answer accurately
2466660	2468660	like they might screw up the whole
2470020	2476660	A cumulative probability of 20 across multiple months. All right, listen, what happened? What happened? Here's the deal
2477220	2483060	A few years back. I did a four and a half hour after editing four and a half hour episode on male and female fertility
2485300	2487300	The entire recording took 11 hours
2487860	2489140	and
2489140	2492340	At one point during the and by the way, I'm very proud of that episode
2492500	2495140	There's many couples have written to me
2495860	2501300	And said they now have children as a consequence of that episode and my first question is what were you doing during the episode?
2501940	2506580	But in all seriousness, um, we should say that it's four and a half hours
2507300	2508500	and
2508500	2512980	People then they should listen to the episode. You're it's extremely technical episode
2513220	2519380	Like you're not stopped dropping facts and and referencing huge number of papers. It must be exhaust
2519460	2523220	I don't understand how you can possibly that's about sperm health sperma genesis. It talks about
2523780	2527860	The ovulatory cycle it talks about things people can do that are that are considered
2528340	2533540	Absolutely supported by science that talks about some of the things kind of out on the edge a little bit that are a little bit more experimental
2533540	2535860	It talks about IVF. It talks about xt. It talks about
2535860	2540500	Um, all of that it talks about frequency of pregnancy as a function of age
2541540	2542980	et cetera
2542980	2547780	um, but there's this one portion there in the podcast where I'm talking about the
2548500	2550660	uh, probability of a successful pregnancy
2551220	2553220	as a function of age and
2554100	2555300	so
2555300	2559220	There was a clip that was cut in which I was describing cumulative
2559860	2560740	probability
2560740	2565300	And by the way, we've published cumulative probability historians in many of my laboratory's papers
2565300	2568820	Including one that was a nature article in 2018. So we run these all the time
2568820	2573300	And yes, I know the difference between independent and cumulative probability. Okay, that's like I do
2574020	2576180	um, the way the clip was cut
2577220	2582740	And what I stated unfortunately combined to like a pretty great gaffe
2583380	2585780	Where I say you're just adding percent
2585780	2590420	I said you just adding percentages 20 20 to 120 percent and then I made us kind of
2591220	2594500	Unfortunately, my humor isn't always so good and I made a joke. I said
2595060	2599780	um 120 percent, but that's a different thing altogether. What I should have said was
2600740	2603140	um, that's impossible
2603140	2605460	You know and here here's how it actually works
2605460	2611220	but then that it continues where I then described the cumulative probability histogram for um
2612100	2618260	Successful pregnancy, but somewhere in the early portion. I I misstated something right. I made a math error
2618820	2622900	Um, which implied I didn't understand the difference between independent and cumulative probability
2623540	2630260	Which I do and it got picked up and and run and people had a really good laugh with that one at my expense
2631060	2634100	And so what I did in response to it was rather than
2634740	2636740	Just say everything I just said now
2636740	2637620	I said
2637620	2639780	I just came out online and said hey folks
2640420	2641940	In an episode
2641940	2644420	They did this on fertility. I made a math error
2644980	2647620	Here is the formula for cumulative probability
2648420	2652260	Successful pregnancy at that age. Here's the graph. Here's the you know, and I
2652820	2657060	Offered it as a teaching moment in two ways one for people to understand cumulative probability
2657380	2660660	It was sort of interesting to a number of people that had come out critiquing the gaffe
2661380	2666820	also, um like biology and folks came out pointing out that they didn't understand cumulative probability
2666820	2671060	So there was a lot of posturing, you know, the dog pile oftentimes people are quick to dog pile
2671220	2674740	They didn't understand but a lot of people did understand some smart people out there, obviously
2675700	2678420	I called my dad and he was just laughing. He goes. Oh, this is good
2678660	2682100	This is like the old school way of of hammering academics. Um
2682820	2684820	But the point being there was a teaching moment
2685460	2691460	Um, give me an opportunity to say hey, I made a mistake. I also made a mistake in another podcast where I
2692180	2698340	Did a micron to millimeter conversion and or centimeter conversion, but and we always correct these in the show note captions
2698340	2700340	We correct them in the audio now
2700340	2705780	um, unfortunately on youtube, it's harder to correct you can't go and edit in segments we put in the captions, but
2706740	2710340	That was the one teaching moment if you make a mistake that's substantive and relate to data
2710500	2713540	You you apologize and correct a mistake use this teaching moment
2713540	2715540	The other one was to say, hey, you know
2716260	2720420	In all the thousands of hours of content we've put out. I'm sure I've made some small errors
2720500	2725940	I think I once said serotonin 1m and dopamine and you know, you're going you're you're riffing and
2726740	2728740	It's a reminder to be careful
2728980	2734420	To edit double check but the internet usually edits for us and then we go make corrections
2734500	2738980	But it didn't feel good at first but ultimately, you know, I can laugh at myself about it
2740580	2742900	Long ago at Berkeley when I was teeing my first
2743780	2748180	Class it was a biopsychology class between 1998 or 1999
2749060	2751060	I was drawing the pituitary
2751300	2755540	Gland it which is you know, it has an interior and a posterior lobe actually is a medial lobe too
2756020	2760180	I have five six hundred students in that lecture hall and I drew it was chalkboard
2760180	2764500	And I drew the two lobes of the pituitary and I said my back was to the audience
2764500	2767220	I said, you know, and so they just sort of hang there
2767940	2772020	And everyone just erupted in laughter because it looked like a scrotum with two testicles
2772500	2774500	And I remember thinking like oh my god
2774900	2777380	I don't think I can turn around like in face this
2778100	2781540	You know and like I only got to turn around sooner or later
2781540	2785540	So I turned around and we just all had a big laugh together. It was embarrassing
2785940	2789300	I'll tell you one thing though. They never forgot about the two lobes of the pituitary
2789780	2793460	Yeah, and you haven't forgotten about that either right. There's a high
2794020	2797060	High salience for these kinds of things and it also was
2797940	2799940	kind of fun to see
2800500	2803700	How excited people get to see people trip
2804100	2807620	It's like an elite sprinter trips and does something stupid like, you know
2807620	2812100	Runs the opposite direction out of the blocks or something like that and and or uh, you know
2812740	2814580	I recall it one world cup
2814580	2819380	Match years ago a guy scored against his own team. I think they killed the guy. Do you remember that?
2820100	2823780	Some South American or Central American team. Yeah, and they killed the guy
2824820	2826820	But yeah, let's let's look it up. I just said
2827540	2829540	World cup. Yeah, he was gunned down
2830500	2836820	Andres Escobar, yeah scored against his own team in 1994 world cup in the United States
2837620	2845140	Just 27 years old playing for the Colombia national team. Yeah, last name Escobar. It's a good name
2845540	2847540	I think it would protect you
2847700	2849700	listen, you know, so
2849860	2851860	There are some gaffes that get
2852180	2853860	people
2853860	2854980	killed
2854980	2856500	right, so
2856500	2858100	you know
2858180	2860820	How forgiving are we for online mistakes?
2860820	2864740	You know, I said just the nature of the mistakes people were quite gracious about the
2865380	2868580	the gaff and some weren't and you know, it's interesting that
2870900	2872420	We
2872420	2874980	As you know public health science educators
2876820	2881620	You know, we'll do long podcast sometimes and and you need to be really careful. What's great is AI
2883300	2886100	Allows you to check these things now more readily
2887060	2888100	so
2888100	2890100	that's cool and
2891140	2895140	There are ways that it's now going to be more self-correcting. I mean, you know, I think
2895780	2900180	There's there's a lot of errors out there on the internet and people are finding them and it's cool
2900260	2905460	Like things are getting cleaned up. Yeah, but mistakes nevertheless will happen. Are you do you feel the pressure?
2906500	2908020	of
2908020	2910020	Not making mistakes. Sure
2910180	2914580	I mean, you know, I try and get things right to the best of you know, to the best of my ability
2915140	2920420	Um, I check with experts. It's kind of interesting when people really don't like something that was said in a podcast
2921220	2927860	A lot of times I chuckle because I'm you know at Stanford. We have some amazing scientists, but I talk to them else people elsewhere
2928900	2930740	um, and
2930740	2932740	it's always interesting to me
2933780	2935780	how
2936580	2938900	You know, I'll get divergent information
2939700	2944660	And then I'll find the overlap in the Venn diagram and I have this like question
2944660	2946820	Do I just stay with the overlap in the Venn diagram?
2947380	2953060	They I didn't episode on oral health. I didn't know this until I researched that episode, but
2953700	2955060	Oral health is
2955060	2960660	critically related to heart health and brain health that there's a bacteria that causes cavities streptococcus, you know
2961620	2962580	that
2962580	2966020	can make its way into other parts of the body through the mouth that
2966900	2973060	Can cause serious issues. There's the idea that some forms of dementia some forms of heart disease are start in the mouth
2973220	2974260	basically
2974260	2976260	I talked to no fewer than four
2977140	2981540	Dentists dental experts and there was a lot of convergence. I also learned that
2982580	2985780	Teeth can demineralize that's the formation of cavities
2985780	2989860	They can also remineralize as long as the cavity isn't too deep it can actually fill itself back in
2990260	2992900	Especially if you provide the right substrates for it
2993300	2999380	That saliva is this incredible fluid that has all this capacity to remineralize teeth provided the milieu is right
2999940	3004100	Things like alcohol-based mouth washes killing off some of the critical things you need
3004420	3007220	This is fascinating and I put out that episode thinking oh, I'm not a dentist
3007220	3013060	I'm not an oral health episode. I talked to a pediatric dentist. There's a terrific one doctor downscore stacy
3013700	3015700	staci on
3015700	3017940	Instagram does great content talk to some others
3018500	3019700	Um
3019700	3024420	And like and then I just waited for the attack. I was like here we go and it didn't come
3025140	3027140	And dentists were thanking me. I was like, whoa
3027540	3028660	You know
3028660	3033860	That's a rare thing more often than not if I do an episode about say psilocybin or mdma
3034660	3037700	You get some people liking it or adhd and the drugs for adhd
3037700	3040740	We did a whole episode on the riddle and vivants adder all stuff
3041060	3045940	You get people saying thank you, you know, I prescribe this to my kid and it really helps and and this and
3046660	3047540	But they're
3047540	3051140	Private about the fact that they do it because they get so much attack from other people
3052100	3053140	so
3053140	3055140	I like to find the center of mass
3055540	3057060	report that
3057060	3059060	Try and make it as clear as possible
3059220	3062260	And then I know that there's some stuff where I'm going to catch shit
3063220	3065780	What's frustrating for me is when
3066420	3071300	Like I see claims that I'm like against fluoridization of water, which I'm not right
3071300	3075620	Like we talked about the benefits of fluoride it builds a hyper strong bonds within the teeth
3075940	3077700	I went and looked at some of the
3077700	3082020	the literally the crystal struck not excuse me not the crystal structure, but the they
3083140	3090500	Essentially the like micron and sub micron structure of teeth is incredible and where fluoride can get in there and form these super strong bonds
3091380	3096100	And you can also form them with things like hydroxyapatite. And why is there fluoride in water? Well, it's the best
3096260	3097140	Okay
3097140	3099620	You get you say some things that are interesting
3099620	3102740	But then somehow it gets turned into like your against fluoridization
3102740	3108260	Which I'm not or I've been accused of being against sunscreen. I wear mineral based sunscreen on my face
3108980	3111860	I don't want to get skin cancer or I use a physical barrier
3112340	3115780	There is a cohort of people out there that think that all sunscreens are bad. I'm not one of them
3115780	3117780	I'm not what's called a sunscreen truther
3117780	3122820	But then you get attacked for like if you so we're talking about there are certain sunscreens that are problematic
3123380	3129300	So what and ronda patricks now starting to get vocal about this and so there are certain topics. It's interesting for which
3130260	3132260	You have to listen
3133060	3134660	carefully to
3134660	3141380	What somebody is saying, but there's a lump or or lumping as opposed to splitting of of what health educators say
3141860	3147780	And so it just seems like like with politics. There's this like urgency to just put people into a camp of
3149060	3155460	Expert versus like renegade or something and it's not like that. It's just not like that. So the short answer is I really strive
3156100	3160900	Really strive to get things right, but I know that I'm going to piss certain people off and you've taught me
3162180	3163460	and
3163460	3165460	joe's taught me and
3165860	3169940	Other podcasters have taught me that like if you worry too much about it
3171220	3174900	Um, then you aren't going to get the newest information out there like peptides
3174900	3178820	There's very little human data unless you're talking about by lisi or the melana
3179140	3181540	You know the stuff in the alpha melana site stimulating hormone stuff
3181540	3185060	which are prescribed for female libido to enhance female libido or
3185780	3191140	Um, sermorellen which is for certain growth hormone deficiencies with with rare exception. There's very little human data
3192100	3195060	But people are still super interested and a lot of people are taking and doing these things
3195060	3197620	So you you want to get the information out do you try to
3198900	3202820	Not just look at the science but research what the communities are talking with the various communities
3202820	3208340	They're talking about like maybe research what the conspiracy theorists are talking about just so you know
3209300	3213540	All the armies that are going to be attacking your castle
3213940	3215140	Yes, so like for instance
3215140	3220820	There's a community of people online that believe that like if you consume seed oils or something that like
3221380	3225380	You're setting up your skin for sunburn and if you don't you know, like there's all these like
3226020	3229780	Theories, but I liked so I like to know what the theories are. I like to know what the extremes are
3230420	3237700	But I also like to know what the standard conversation is, but there's generally more agreement than disagreement. I think where um
3239300	3243300	You know, I've been kind of bullish actually is you know, or like supplements like people go
3243300	3246340	Oh supplements. Well, there's food supplements like a protein powder
3246500	3249540	Just different than a vitamin and then they are compounds
3249620	3251620	There are compounds that have real benefit
3251780	3254740	But people get very nervous about the fact that they're not regulated
3255220	3262020	But some of them are are vetted with for potency and for um safety with with more rigor than others
3262500	3264900	You know, and it's interesting to see
3265860	3267300	How
3267300	3269300	people who take care of themselves
3270340	3274100	And put a lot of work into that are often attacked that's been interesting
3274180	3281620	Also, one of the most controversial topics nowadays is ozampic munjaro. I'm very middle of the road on this. I don't understand why the
3282740	3286020	Quote-unquote health wellness community is so against these things
3286020	3290180	I also don't understand why they have to be looked at as the only route for some people
3290180	3295620	They've really helped them lose weight and yes, there can be some muscle loss and other lean lean body loss
3296020	3299220	But that can be offset with resistance training. They've helped a lot of people
3299700	3302260	And other people are like, no, this stuff is terrible
3302260	3306260	I think the most interesting thing about ozampic munjaro is that they are glp one
3306340	3308820	They're in the glp one pathway glucagon like peptide one
3309460	3313780	and it was discovered in healer monsters, which is a
3314420	3315540	uh
3315540	3320260	Lizard basically and someone what the now the now the entomologists will dive on me
3320660	3323540	It's a big big lizard looking thing that doesn't eat very often
3323940	3326820	And they figured out that there's this peptide that allows it to
3327700	3329700	curb its own appetite
3330180	3332180	At the level of the brain and the gut
3332180	3336180	And it has a lot of homology to sequence homology to what we now call glp one
3336500	3341860	So I love anytime there's animal biology links to cool human biology links to a drug
3341860	3347540	That's powerful that can help people with obesity and type 2 diabetes and there's evidence that can even curb some addictions
3348180	3349300	um
3349300	3350820	Those are newer data
3350820	3356260	But I don't see is it either or in fact, I've been a little bit disappointed at the way that the um
3356340	3360580	Whatever you want to call it health wellness biohacking community has like slammed on ozampic munjaro
3360580	3362900	It's like they're like just get out and run and listen
3363060	3367300	There are people who are carrying substantial amounts of weight that running could injure them
3367380	3372180	They get on these drugs and they can improve and then hopefully they're also doing resistance training and eating better
3372180	3374180	And then you know, you're bringing all the elements together
3374420	3378420	Well, why do you think the criticism has happened? Is it that ozampic became super popular?
3378420	3382740	So people are misusing it or that kind of thing? No, I think what it is is that people
3383620	3389700	Think if it's a pharmaceutical, it's bad. Yeah, and then or if it's a supplement
3389700	3395780	It's bad depending on which camp they're in and and it wouldn't be wonderful to kind of like fill in the gap between this divide, you know
3396340	3399620	um, what I would like to see in politics and in health is
3400100	3406500	Um, neither right nor left, but what we can just call a league of reasonable people that looks at things on an issue by issue basis
3407300	3412660	And fills in the center because I think most people are in that are I don't want to say center in a political way
3412660	3417540	But I think most people are reasonable. They want to be reasonable, but that's not what sells clicks
3418100	3420420	That's not what that's not what drives interest
3420980	3425540	Um, but I'm a very like like I look at issue by issue person by person
3425940	3429940	I don't like in group out group stuff. I never have I've got friends from all walks of life
3429940	3434420	I said this another podcast and it always sounds like a like a political statement, but like the the
3435300	3437060	push towards like
3437060	3443380	You know polarization is it's so frustrating if there's one thing that's discouraging to me as I get older each year
3443940	3446180	I'm like, wow, are we ever going to get out of this?
3446660	3447460	like
3447460	3449220	polarization
3449220	3451300	Speaking of which, how are you going to vote for the presidential election?
3453220	3460100	I'm still trying to figure out how to interview the people involved and do it. Well, what do you think the role of podcast is going to be in this
3460420	3461940	year's election
3461940	3463460	I would love
3463460	3465460	a long-form conversations to happen with
3466980	3471540	With the candidates. I think it's going to be huge. I would love trump to go on rogan
3472420	3475300	I would I'm embarrassed to say this, but I would love to
3476260	3479780	Honestly, we'd love to see Joe Biden go on Joe Rogan also
3479940	3485540	I would imagine that both would go on but separately separately. I think it's I think a debate
3486500	3490900	Joe does debates, but I think Joe at his best is one-on-one conversation really intimate
3491780	3498100	Um, I I just wish that Joe Biden would actually do long-form conversations. I thought he had done it
3498260	3500260	It wasn't me. I think it was on
3500340	3504740	Jay Shetty's podcast. He did Jay Shetty. He did he did a few but what I mean long form. I mean
3506020	3509460	Um, really long form like two three hours and more relaxed
3509460	3514100	It was much more orchestrated because what happens when it's the interviews a little bit too short
3514820	3516820	It becomes into this generic
3518340	3520340	Political type of
3520420	3525460	NBC cnn type of interview you get a set of questions and you don't get to really
3526100	3527700	Feel the human
3527700	3533380	Expose the human to the light in it the full we talked about the shadow the good the bad and the ugly
3533460	3536740	So I think there's something magical about two three four hours
3537940	3541860	But it doesn't have to be that long, but it has to have that feeling to it
3542420	3547220	Where there's not people standing around and everybody's nervous and you're going to be
3547860	3549060	Uh
3549060	3552980	Strictly sticking to the question answer type of feel but just shooting shit
3553060	3559700	Which Rogan is the best by far in the world at that. I don't think people really appreciate
3561060	3562580	how
3562580	3563940	skilled
3563940	3565220	he is
3565220	3567060	at what he does
3567060	3571860	And the number I mean the three or four podcasts per week plus plus the ufc announcement saying plus
3572580	3574580	comedy tours and stadiums plus
3575860	3576900	you know
3576900	3579380	doing comedy shows in the the middle of the week plus
3580180	3582260	You know husband and a father and a friend and
3582820	3585620	Jiu-Jitsu the guys got like superhuman levels of output
3586180	3590340	I I agree that long-form conversation is a whole other business
3590660	3594260	And I think that people want and deserve to know the people that are
3595140	3599380	Running for office at a in a different way and to really get to know them
3601140	3603140	Well, listen, you know, I I guess you
3604180	3607140	I mean, is it clear that he's going to do jail time or maybe he gets away?
3607140	3612180	No, I don't think I'm because I was gonna say I mean that does that mean you're gonna be podcasting from imprisonment
3612260	3614260	Yeah, we're going to back down going to
3615060	3621140	Figure out how to commit a crime so I can get in prison. Please don't please though. Well, that's I'm sure they have visitors
3621780	3625780	Right. That just doesn't feel an authentic way to get the interview. But yeah, I understand
3626500	3630580	You wouldn't be able to wear that suit. You'd be wearing a different suit. That's true. Yeah
3631220	3635540	Um, it's gonna be interesting and and you do I'm not just saying this because you're my friend
3635540	3642900	But you would do a marvelous job. I think you should sit down with all of them separately to keep it civil and um and see what
3643060	3644820	What happens?
3644820	3646820	Here's one thing that I found really interesting
3647460	3649460	In this whole political landscape
3649620	3652820	When I'm in Los Angeles, I often get invited to these like
3653380	3656340	They're not dinners, but gatherings where you know a local
3656820	3659700	Um, you know, a bunch of podcasters will come together
3659860	3663380	But a lot of people from the entertainment industry big agencies
3664020	3667380	Big tech like big big tech many of the people have been on this podcast
3668260	3669140	and
3669140	3674980	They'll host a discussion or debate and what you find if you look around the room and you talk to people is that
3675460	3677460	About half the people in the room
3677780	3682820	Are very left leaning and very outspoken about that and they'll tell you exactly who they want to see in the
3683460	3685620	When the presidential race and the other half
3686180	3689700	We'll tell you that they're for the other side a lot of people that
3691780	3695060	People assume are on one side of the aisle or the other
3695700	3700340	Are in the exact opposite side now some people are very open about who that who they're for but
3700820	3702820	it's been very interesting to see how
3703140	3705140	Um when you get people one on one
3705140	3710180	They're like telling you they want x candidate to win or y candidate to win and sometimes like really?
3710340	3716740	I can't believe it like you like yep, and so it's what people think about
3717780	3719620	um
3719620	3721620	People's political lean is as often
3722100	3724260	Exactly wrong and and that's been
3724740	3726180	eye-opening for me
3726180	3728980	And I've seen that um in university campuses too
3729620	3735300	And and so it's going to be really really interesting to see what happens in in november in addition to that as you said
3735540	3737540	Most people are close to the center
3737540	3739540	Despite what twitter makes it seem like
3739860	3743380	Most people whether they're sent a lot to center right they're kind of close to the center
3743620	3747460	Yeah, I mean here's to me the most interesting question who is going to be the next
3748580	3750580	big candidate in years to come
3751060	3753300	Like who's that going to be right now? I don't I don't
3754340	3759860	I don't see or know of that person. Who's it going to be? Yeah, the young promising candidates. We're not seeing them
3760660	3763300	We're not seeing like who another way to ask that question
3763860	3765620	Who would want to be?
3765620	3767060	Well, that's the issue right?
3767060	3770900	You know it who wants to live in this 12 hour news cycle where you're just trying to
3771380	3776740	You know dunk on the other team so that nobody notices like that you're the shit that you fucked up
3777300	3782580	You know like that that's not like that's not only not fun or interesting. It also is just like
3783540	3787300	it's got to be psychosis inducing at some point and
3788100	3790100	I think that
3790660	3793140	You know god willing we're gonna you know
3793780	3795380	some young
3795380	3798500	guy or woman is like on this and refuses to
3799300	3801060	to back down
3801060	3804260	And was just like determined to be president and will make it happen
3804260	3806660	But like I don't even know who the
3808020	3810020	Bible candidates are
3810340	3814020	Maybe you lex, you know, we should ask sagar sagar would know
3814740	3816340	Yeah, yeah
3816340	3818340	Maybe sagar himself
3818420	3822420	Sagar's show is awesome. Yeah, he and crystal do a great thing. He's incredible
3822420	3826420	Especially since they have somewhat divergent opinions on things. Yeah, that's what makes it so cool. He's great
3826420	3830580	He looks great in a suit looks real sexy. He's taking real good care of himself. I think he's getting married soon
3831300	3837620	Congratulations sagar forgive me for not remembering your wife a future wife's name. He uh, he won my heart by giving me
3838980	3843860	A biography of hitler as a president. That's what he gave you. Yeah, I gave you a hatchet
3845220	3849780	With a poem and that just shows the fundamental difference with a poem inscribed in it
3850900	3852900	Which was pretty damn good
3853220	3856580	I realized everything we bring up on the screen is like really
3857540	3860260	Depressing like the soccer player getting killed
3861140	3866180	Can we bring up something happy? Uh, sure. Let's go to uh nature's metal instagram
3866740	3872980	Those are pretty intense. We actually did a collaborative post on a on a shark thing. Really? Yeah, what kind of shark thing?
3873140	3878100	so to generate the fear vr stimulus for my lab in 20
3880180	3884340	Was it yet 2016 we went down to guadalupe island off the coast of mexico
3884580	3886980	Me and a guy named michael muller who's a very famous
3887860	3891940	portrait photographer, but also takes photos of sharks and
3892980	3894580	we
3894580	3895700	used
3895700	3899860	360 video to build vr of great white sharks brought it back to the lab
3900340	3902340	We published that study in current biology
3902900	3904900	in 2017 went back down there
3906100	3907220	um
3907220	3908420	and
3908420	3910260	That was the year that
3910260	3912260	I exited the cage
3912260	3914740	That you lower the cage with a crane and that year I exited the cage
3914740	3919220	I had a whole mess with a air failure the day before I was breathing from a hookah line while in the cage
3919220	3921220	I had no scuba on divers were out
3921700	3926420	The thing got bow constricted up and I had an air failure and I had to actually share air and it was a whole mess
3926740	3927860	Story for another time
3927860	3932660	But the next day because I didn't want to get ptsd and it was pretty scary the next day I cage exited
3933220	3936260	Um with some other divers and it turns out with these great white sharks
3937140	3939940	In guadalupe the the water's very clear and you can swim toward them
3940100	3943700	And then they'll they'll veer off you if you swim toward them. Otherwise, they see you as prey
3944340	3949060	Well in the evening you've brought all the cages up and you're hopefully all alive
3950020	3951700	and we
3951700	3957140	We're hanging out fishing for a tuna. Uh, we had a one of the the crew on board had
3957620	3958820	um
3958820	3963940	A line in the water was fishing for tuna for dinner and a shark took the tuna off the line
3964100	3970020	And it's a it's a very dramatic take and you can see the the just absolute
3970420	3974420	Size of these great white sharks the the waters there are filled with them. That's the one
3974660	3980420	But so this video just the neural link link was shot by matt mcdougall
3980820	3984500	Who is the um head neurosurgeon at neural link there it is takes it now
3984500	3989220	Believe it or not looks like it missed like it didn't get the fish it actually just cut that thing like a band saw
3989860	3991860	So i'm up on the deck with matt
3992260	3996660	Yeah, and so when you look at it from the side you you really get a sense of this
3997140	3999860	Of the the girth of this freaking thing
4000740	4002740	So as it comes up
4003860	4007860	Size of that thing and they move through the water with such speed just a couple
4008340	4011140	So when you're in the cage and the cage is lowered down below the surface
4011860	4015380	There they're going around you're not allowed to chum the water there. Some people do it
4015940	4016820	um
4016820	4019860	But and then when you cage eggs sit they're like, well, what are you doing out here?
4019860	4022980	And then you know they you swim toward them they veer off
4023380	4026980	But what's interesting is that if you look at how they move through the water
4027460	4030020	All it takes for one of these great white sharks when it sees
4030500	4033620	A tuna or something it wants to eat is like two flicks of the tail
4034580	4039140	And it becomes like a missile. It's just unbelievable economy of effort
4039700	4045860	And ocean ramsey who is in my opinion the greatest of all cage exit shark divers this woman who dealt with
4046340	4048340	enormous great white sharks
4048340	4053300	She really understands their behavior when they're aggressive when they're not going to be aggressive. She and her husband Juan
4053380	4057860	I believe his name is do they understand how the tiger sharks differ from the great white sharks?
4057940	4059700	We were down there basically
4059700	4064420	Like not understanding any of this we never should have been there and actually the air failure of the day before
4064900	4066900	Plus cage eggs in the next day
4067140	4071380	I told myself after coming up from the cage exit. That's it. I'm no longer taking risks with my life
4071460	4073540	I want to live got back across the border
4074020	4078020	Um a couple days later and I was like, that's it. I don't take risks with my life any longer
4078180	4081700	But yeah, mcdougal not mcdougal shot that video and then it went
4082420	4083860	quote-unquote viral
4083860	4088180	through uh, nature is metal we passed them that video actually, uh
4088980	4090340	I saw a video
4090340	4094500	Where an instructor was explaining how to behave with a shark in the water
4094900	4098020	And that you don't want to be swimming away because then you're acting like a prey
4098660	4103620	And then you want to be acting like a predator by looking at it and swimming towards it right towards them and they'll bank off
4103700	4105700	Now if you don't see them they're ambush predators
4106020	4110100	You know, you're swimming in the surface and apparently if they get close you should just like guide them away by
4110740	4113700	Like grabbing them and moving some people will actually roll them
4114340	4117140	Um, but if they're coming in full speedy, you're not going to roll the shark
4117460	4123700	But here we are back to dark stuff again. I like the shark attack map and the shark attack map shows that
4124180	4127780	Um, you know, northern california. There were a couple actually a guy's head got taken off
4128420	4132740	Um, he was swimming north of san francisco. There's been a couple of northern, uh, california
4132740	4137140	That was really tragic, but most of them are in florida in australia florida
4137700	4142820	The surfrider foundation shark attack map. There it is. Yeah, they have a great map. There you go
4142900	4146980	So they look like they have all the scars on them. So if you if you zoom in on
4147860	4150340	I mean, look at this if you go to the north america
4150980	4155380	Um, look at skulls. There's there's a yeah where they're where they're deadly attacks
4155860	4160420	Um, but in yeah, northern california. Sadly, this is really tragic if you zoom in on this one
4161140	4163140	Um, I read about this
4163620	4165620	This guy if you can click the link
4166260	4172020	50-year-old male he was in chest high water. This is just tragic. I feel so sad for him and his family
4172660	4174660	you know, he's just um
4174740	4177060	Three members of the party chose to go in he was you know
4177780	4182180	Nine gai was in his chest high water 25 to 50 yards from shore
4183140	4188020	Great breached water seized his head and that was it, you know, so it does happen. It's very infrequent
4188580	4189780	um
4189780	4196340	If you don't go in the ocean, it's a very very very low probability. Um, but but if it doesn't happen
4197540	4199540	Six times in a row
4199700	4205460	120 chance. Yeah, who do you think wins a saltwater crocodile or a shark? Okay?
4205780	4211220	I do not like saltwater crocodiles. They scare me to no end moller michael moller who dove all over the world
4211300	4213060	He sent me a picture of him
4213060	4215060	diving uh with
4215620	4221540	Salty saltwater crocs in cuba. It was a smaller one. But goodness christ. Have you seen the size of some of those saltwater crocs?
4221860	4226580	Yeah, um, I'm thinking that I'm thinking the the sharks are so agile. They're amazing
4226980	4229380	They've head cammed one or body cammed one
4230100	4232100	moving through the kelp bed
4232580	4238100	And you look and it's just they're so agile moving through the water and and it's looking up at the surface like the camera's
4238180	4242100	Looking at the surface and you just realize if you're out there, um, you're not
4242580	4249300	In your swimming and you get hit by a by a shark you're not gonna talk shit and say that a salty has way
4250020	4252260	more bite force, but according to the internet
4253140	4256180	Recently data indicates that the shark has a stronger bite
4256900	4262660	So I was I was assuming that a crocodile would have a a stronger bite force and therefore agility doesn't matter
4262740	4264580	But apparently a shark
4264580	4269300	Yeah, and turning one of those big salties this is probably not that you know turning around
4269300	4273140	It's like a battleship. I mean those sharks are unbelievable. They hit from all sorts. Oh, and they
4274180	4275220	They do this thing
4275220	4280500	We saw this you're out of the cage or in the cage and you and you'll look at one and you'll see its eye kind of like
4281140	4282580	Looking at you. They can't really fove it
4282580	4287940	But they'll look at you and you're tracking it and then you'll look down and you'll realize that one's coming at you
4287940	4290180	They're they're they're ambush prayers. They're working together
4290820	4293220	They're fascinating. I like I like how you know
4294020	4296020	That they can't fovee
4296020	4300980	You're already considering the vision system there. Yeah, it's a very permanent eyes on the very primitive eyes on the side of the head
4300980	4304980	Their vision is decent enough. They're mostly obviously sensing things with their
4305540	4308020	Electro sensing in the water, but also
4309060	4311060	Oh faction
4311060	4313060	Yeah, I spend far too much time
4313140	4318020	Thinking about and learning about the the visual systems of different animals if you get me going on this like we'll be here all night
4318180	4321780	See, this is what I have this my blood out too. I saw this in a store and I got it
4322820	4324820	Because this is from a shark
4325140	4330100	Goodness. Yeah, I can't say I ever saw one of teeth this big, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful
4331060	4333060	Yeah, it's probably you know
4333220	4336580	Probably your blood pressure just goes and you you don't feel feel a thing. Yeah
4337780	4341620	Before we went down for the cage exit a guy in our crew
4342260	4344260	pat dosos
4344660	4346500	Very experienced diver
4346500	4348740	asked one of the south african divers that
4349300	4353620	So, you know, like what's the contingency plan if like somebody catches a bite and they were like
4354500	4358580	He was like every man for himself and they're like basically saying like if somebody catches a bite like that's it
4358900	4360660	Yeah, you know
4360660	4362660	Anyway, I thought we were gonna bring up something happy
4363300	4368500	Oh, that is happy. Well, we nature is beautiful. Yeah, what nature is beautiful. Uh, we lived
4370100	4374900	But you know that there are there are happy things you brought up nature is metal. This is this is the difference between
4375540	4376740	russian
4376740	4380580	Yeah, americans and americans is like maybe there's actually a good time to bring up
4381380	4383620	Your ayahuasca journey. I've never done ayahuasca
4385140	4387300	But i'm curious about it. I'm also curious about
4387940	4389940	ibogaine iboga
4390740	4394500	But you told me that you did ayahuasca and
4395460	4400580	That for you, it wasn't the dark scary ride that it is for everybody else. Yeah, it was an incredible experience for me
4400820	4408180	I did it twice actually and have you done high dose psilocybin? Never. No, I just did small dose psilocybin a couple times
4408740	4412260	So I was you know nervous about it. I was very yeah, I understand myself
4412340	4416820	I've done high dose psilocybin. It's terrifying, but I've always gotten something very useful out of it
4417220	4422980	So, I mean I was nervous about like whatever demons might hide in the shadow in the yungi in the shadow
4423460	4425460	like I was I was nervous
4425860	4430020	But I think it turns out. I don't know what the lesson is to draw from that but my experience
4430420	4432180	Be boys russian
4432180	4435860	It must it must be the russian thing. I mean, there's also something to the jungle
4436500	4440820	There it strips away all the bullshit of life and you're just there
4442180	4445860	I I forgot the outside civilization exists. I forgot time because like
4446820	4448660	When you don't have your phone
4448660	4454180	You don't have meetings or calls or whatever you you lose the sense of time the sun comes up the sun comes down
4454420	4459220	That's the the fundamental biological timer. You know every mammalian species
4460020	4463460	has a short wavelength. So you think like blue uv type but like
4464340	4468900	Absorbing cone and a longer wavelength absorbing cone and the and it does this interesting
4469540	4475300	Subtraction to designate when it's morning and evening because when the sun is low in the sky, you've got short wavelength and long wavelength light
4475860	4478660	Like when you look at a sunrise, it's got blues and yellows orange and yellows
4478660	4482260	You look in the evening reds orange and and blues and in the middle of the day
4482340	4487220	It's like full spectrum light now. It's always full spectrum light but because of some atmospheric
4488820	4492660	Elements and because of the low solar angle you like that difference between
4493700	4498420	The different wavelengths of light is is the fundamental signal that the neurons in your eye pay attention to
4498500	4504020	And signal to your circadian timekeeping mechanism like we are that the core of our brain and the suprachiasmatic nucleus we are
4504660	4505700	we are
4505700	4506980	like
4506980	4508580	Wired to be
4508580	4515300	Entrained to the rising and setting of the sun like that's the biological timer which makes perfect sense because you know obviously as the planets
4515860	4518260	Um as the planets spin and revolve
4518260	4523940	I also wonder like how that is affected by you know in the rainforest the sun is not visible often
4524020	4528260	So you're under the cover of the trees. So maybe that affects
4528580	4530180	Well, there are social rhythms
4530180	4536980	They're feeding rhythms sometimes in in terms of some species will signal the timing of activity of other species and
4537460	4538500	um
4538500	4541460	But yet getting out from the canopy is is critical
4541860	4546740	Of course, even under the canopy during the daytime, there's far more photons than at night
4546900	4550820	You know, there's always when i'm telling people to get sunlight in their eyes in the morning and in the evening
4551060	4555460	People say there's no light no sunlight this time here. I'm like it go outside on a really overcast day
4555460	4561220	It's far brighter than it is at night, right? So um, there's still lots of sunlight even if you can't see the sun as an object
4561220	4563220	but I I love
4564180	4569940	Time perception shifts and you mentioned that in the jungle it's linked to the rising and setting of the sun
4570180	4573700	You also mentioned that on ayahuasca you zoomed out from from the earth
4573860	4578660	These are like to me the most interesting aspects of having a human brain as opposed to another brain
4578820	4582420	Of course, only ever had a human brain, but which is that you can
4583300	4585300	consciously set your
4585700	4586820	time
4586820	4589460	Domain window like you can we can be focused here
4589460	4592500	We can be focused on all of austin or we can be focused on the entire planet
4592900	4594900	You can make those choices consciously
4595460	4601460	But in the time domain it's it's hard like different activities bring us into fine slicing a more or more broad binning of time
4601780	4603620	depending on what we're doing
4603620	4607380	programming or exercising or researching or podcasting but
4607860	4609860	um, just how unbelievably
4610180	4612740	um fluid the human brain is in terms of its
4613540	4618900	The aperture of of the time space window of our cognition and of our experience
4619220	4622020	And I I feel like this is perhaps one of the more valuable
4622500	4628740	Tools that we have access to that we don't really leverage as much as we should which is when things are really hard
4629220	4630180	you
4630180	4635460	Need to zoom out and see it as one element within your whole lifespan and that there's more to come
4636340	4637940	um
4637940	4643220	You know, I mean people commit suicide because they can't see beyond the time domain they're in or they think it's going to go on forever
4643700	4651060	Um, when we're happy we rarely think this is going to last forever, but uh, which is interesting contrast in its own right
4651140	4653140	but I think that
4653780	4656820	Psychedelics while I have very little experience with them
4656820	4659860	I have saw them and it sounds like they're just a very interesting
4660420	4662820	Window into the the different apertures
4663460	4666100	Well, how to surf that wave is probably a skill
4667220	4671380	One of the things I was prepared for and I think it's important is not to resist
4672180	4673780	I think
4673780	4677940	I understand what it means to resist the thing a powerful wave and it's not going to be good
4678020	4683940	So you have to be able to surf it so I was ready for that to relax through it. Maybe because I'm quite good at that
4684580	4686580	from
4686980	4689460	knowing how to relax and all kinds of disciplines
4690340	4692180	playing piano and uh
4692180	4697540	Guitar when I was super young and then through jiu-jitsu knowing the value of relaxation and through all kinds of sports
4697860	4704980	Should be able to relax the body fully just accept whatever happens to you that process is probably why it was a very positive experience for me
4705460	4709140	Do you have any interest in iboga? I'm very interested in ibogaine iboga
4709540	4712420	There's a colleague of mine and researcher at Stanford Nolan Williams
4712420	4716260	Who's been doing some transcranial magnetic stimulation and brain imaging on people who have
4716820	4719060	taken the ibogaine ibogaine
4719620	4720900	um
4720900	4727860	As I understand it gives a 22 hour psychedelic journey where no hallucinations with eyes open, but you close your eyes and you get a
4728500	4732500	um a very high resolution image of actual events that happened in your life
4732580	4735940	But then you have agency within those movies. I think you have to be
4736660	4740180	Of healthy heart to be able to do it. I think you have to be on a heart rate monitor. It's not trivial
4740180	4742180	It's not like these other psychedelics
4742980	4744980	But there's a wonderful group
4745940	4747940	called veteran solutions
4748020	4749700	um that
4749700	4753140	has used iboga combined with some other psychedelics
4753700	4755700	um in the veterans community to
4756580	4759940	to great success for things like PTSD and
4760500	4766020	It's a group. I've really tried to support in in any way that I can mainly by being vocal about the great work they're doing
4766580	4770500	but um, you hear incredible stories of people who are just like
4771460	4777060	Like near cratered in their life or zombied by PTSD and other things post war
4777540	4781380	um get back a lightness or achieve a lightness and a clarity
4782020	4787220	Um that they didn't feel they had so I'm very curious about these compounds. Um, the state of Kentucky
4787220	4790740	We should check this but um, I believe it's taken money from the
4791300	4798500	Opioid crisis settlement for ibogaine research. I mean, so this is like no longer. Yes. If you look here, let's see
4799460	4801620	Did they do it? Oh, no. No. Oh, no
4802180	4806180	They backed away Kentucky backs away from the plan to fund opio treatment research
4806340	4808180	They were going to use the money
4808180	4815300	To treat opio. Now officials are backing off 50 billion. What is on its way over the coming years 50 billion dollars
4815540	4819220	50 billion dollars is on its way to state and local government over the coming years
4819220	4825700	The pool of funding comes from multiple legal statements with pharmaceutical companies that profited from manufacturing or selling opioid
4826180	4829860	Painkillers, Kentucky has some of the highest number of deaths from the opioid
4829860	4833700	So they were going to do psychedelic research with ibogaine
4835460	4837860	Supporting research on illegal illegal folks
4838420	4841220	Psychedelic drug called ibogaine. Well, I guess they backed away from it. Well
4843220	4845220	Sooner or later, we'll get some happy news up on the
4846180	4848180	Internet during this episode
4848340	4852580	Talk about the the the shark and the crocodile fighting. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true
4852740	4855380	And you survived the jungle. Well, that's the the thing
4855460	4860020	I was I was I was writing to you on what's that multiple times because I was going to put on the internet
4860020	4863300	Are you okay? And if you're like alive and then I was going to just like put it to twitter
4863620	4868580	Just like he's alive, but then of course you're far too classy for that. So you just came back alive
4870580	4872580	Well jungle or not
4872660	4877060	One of the lessons is also, you know, when you hear the call for adventure
4877220	4884260	Just fucking do it. I was gonna ask you it's kind of silly question, but like give me a
4885060	4887060	Small fraction of things on your bucket list
4888100	4890100	Bucket list. Yeah
4891220	4893060	Go to mars
4893060	4895060	Yeah, what's what's the status of that?
4895860	4900580	I don't know. I'm being patient about the whole thing red planet ran that cartoon of you guys
4901220	4906260	Going to my that was pretty funny. That's true. That was pretty funny. One where Goggins is already up there. Yeah
4906420	4908420	That's a great. That's a funny one
4908820	4912820	Probably also true. Uh, I would love I would love to die in mars
4915460	4919220	But I just love humanity reaching onto the stars and doing this
4919940	4924180	Bold adventure and taking big risks and exploring. I love exploration
4924820	4929300	What about seeing different animal species? I'm a huge fan of this guy Joel Sartori
4929940	4935220	Um, where he he has this photo arc project where he takes portraits of all these different animals
4935460	4938900	If people aren't already following him on instagram. He's doing some really important work
4939540	4940980	um
4940980	4942500	this guy's
4942500	4944500	instagram is
4944900	4949300	Amazing like portraits. Well, look at it. Look at these portraits the amount of um,
4949860	4955220	I must say personality because we don't want to project anything onto them. But yeah, the the like the eyes
4955940	4960740	And he'll occasionally put him a movie. No, there's a little owl. I delight in things like this
4961220	4965860	I've got some content coming on animals and animal neuroscience and eyes
4966500	4968900	And now dogs or all kinds of all animals
4969380	4971380	um, and I'm very interested
4972180	4974180	in um
4974340	4978180	Kids content that that incorporates animals. We have some things brewing there
4978180	4980340	Like I could look at this kind of stuff all day long
4980340	4985300	Look at that bat like bats people think about bats is kind of like little flickering a little annoying disease carrying things
4985300	4987300	But look how beautiful that little sucker is
4987300	4990100	How's your uh podcast with the cookie monster coming?
4990740	4993940	Oh, yeah, we've been in discussions with cookie the um
4994900	5002180	It's uh, can't say too much about that. But um, cookie monster embodies dopamine, right? Cookie monster wants cookie
5002340	5006100	Right wants cookie right now, you know, like it was that it was that one tweet cookie monster
5006100	5008180	I bounce because cookies come from all directions
5008580	5015140	You know, it's like it's just embodying the the desire for for something and and which is an incredible aspect of ourselves
5015140	5017540	The other one is you remember a little while ago
5018260	5020260	Elmo put out a tweet
5020420	5023380	Hey, how's everyone doing out there and it went viral
5023940	5027620	And you know the surgeon general of the united states have been talking about the loneliness crisis
5027780	5033060	He came on the podcast and you know a lot of people have been talking about problems with loneliness mental health issues with loneliness
5033620	5037140	Elmo puts out a tweet. Hey, how's everyone doing out there? And
5038260	5039860	Everyone gravitates toward it, you know
5039860	5046180	So that the different sesame street characters really embody the different that kind of aspects of self through very like narrow
5046660	5048660	Neural circuit perspective
5049140	5053860	You know snuffle off against the shy and um oscar the grouch it's grouchy, right and the count
5054340	5060420	Won a tool the archetypes of yeah, the archetypes is very young in once again. Yeah, and I think that um
5061140	5065780	You know the creators of sesame street clearly either understand that or it's an unconscious genius to that
5065780	5071220	So yeah, there are some things brewing on on uh conversations with sesame street characters
5071620	5075780	It's not I know you'd like to talk to vladimir putin. I'd like to talk to cookie monster
5076180	5082580	It illustrates the differences in our like a sophistication or something. Well, that's illustrates a lot. Yeah
5084740	5086740	But yeah, I also I love animation
5086820	5092500	So I'm not anime. That's not my thing but animation. So I'm very interested in the use of animation to get
5092980	5095940	Uh science content across so there are a bunch of things brewing
5096260	5098260	but um, but anyway, I delight in
5098820	5104340	Sartori's work and and and it's there's a conservation aspect to it as well. But I think that um
5104980	5109780	Mostly want to thank you for finally putting up something that like where something is not being killed or like let some sad
5110180	5115780	Sad outcome. Well, these are all really positive. They're really cool. They're really cool and every once in a while look at look at that
5116340	5118340	mountain line
5118740	5122420	But I also like to look at these and and some of them remind me of certain people
5123220	5127380	Right, so let's just scroll through like for instance. I think when we don't try and process it too much
5127460	5132020	So like like okay, look at this cat this is amazing
5132020	5136020	Like I feel like that somebody I feel like this is like a like someone I met once
5136660	5139700	as a curiosity and curiosity and a playfulness
5140100	5141700	um carnivore
5141700	5143700	Carnivore frontalized eyes
5143700	5148340	Found in forces the area right so then you go down, you know, it's like
5149300	5151620	This beautiful fish neon pink
5152020	5158820	Right, so it reminds you of some of the like the influencers you see on instagram, right? Except this one's natural. Just kidding. Um
5159700	5162900	Uh, let's see no filter. Um filter. Yeah
5163380	5164660	um
5164660	5166660	Let's see like I feel like
5166820	5170580	Bears I'm a big fan of bears. Yeah bears are beautiful. This one kind of reminds me of you a little bit
5170660	5173140	There's like a stoic nature to it a curiosity
5173540	5177940	So you can kind of feel like the essence of animals. You don't even have to do psychedelics to get there
5178580	5181540	Oh, look at that. He's like the behind the scenes of how it's actually yeah
5182500	5184500	and then there's um
5185300	5187300	Wow, yeah
5187300	5190900	Yeah, the in the jungle the diversity of life was also stark
5191460	5196660	From a scientific perspective just the the fact that most of those species are not identified was fascinating
5196820	5201300	Right. It was like a little every little every little insect is a kind of discovery
5202180	5204340	Right. I mean one of the reasons I love new york city so much
5204900	5210020	Just by its problems at times is that um everywhere you look there's life
5210020	5214900	It's like a tropical reef if you've ever done scuba diving or snorkeling you look on a tropical reef and it's like
5215140	5218340	There's some little crab working on something and like everywhere you look there's life
5218580	5221860	You know the bay area if you go scuba diving or snorkeling it's like a kelp bed
5221860	5226100	You know the bay area is like a kelp bed every once in a while some big fish goes by it's like a big IPO
5226820	5228820	But like most of the time not a whole lot happens
5229460	5232980	Actually, the bay area it's interesting as I've been going back there more and more recently
5233540	5234500	um
5234500	5240180	There are really cool little subcultures starting to pop up again. Nice. Um
5241140	5245620	There's incredible skateboarding the gx-1000 guys are these guys that that bomb down hills
5245940	5246900	They're in
5246900	5250740	Nuts like they're just going like that's just speed not tricks
5250980	5254180	You gotta see gx-1000 these guys going down hills in san francisco
5254580	5260340	They are wild and occasionally unfortunately occasionally someone will get hit by a car, but gx-1000
5261060	5263940	Look into intersections. They have spotters. You can see someone there
5264900	5266900	Um, oh, I see there's uh
5267700	5273220	Into traffic. Yeah into traffic. So in san francisco. Yeah, this is crazy. Like this is unbelievable and
5273780	5275460	um, and they're
5275460	5277460	They're just wild
5277620	5279460	But in any case
5279460	5284100	What's on your bucket list that you haven't done? Well, I'm working on a book. So I'm actually going to
5284900	5288260	Head to a cabin for a couple weeks and right which I've never done
5288980	5290980	People talk about doing this, but I'm gonna do that
5291700	5297380	That's I'm excited for that just the mental space of really dropping into writing like jack dickelson in the shining cabin
5297460	5299860	Let's hope not. Okay. Let's hope not, you know before
5300660	5304260	I mean only started doing public facing anything for posting on instagram in 2019
5304260	5308500	But I used to head up to walla la on the northern coast of california
5309060	5311060	um, sometimes by myself
5311140	5315540	um to a little cabin there and spend a weekend by myself and just
5316180	5319140	Read and write papers and things like that. I used to do that all the time
5319540	5322100	I I I missed that so some of that
5322420	5328500	Um, I'm trying to spend a bit more time with my relatives in argentina relatives in on the east coast
5328900	5334260	See my parents more. They're in good health. Thankfully. I want to get married and have a family. That's an important priority
5334740	5339140	And put a lot of a lot of work in there. Yeah, that's a big one. Yeah. Yeah, I'm putting a lot of work
5339700	5341940	Into the the the runway on that
5342500	5344500	um, what are advice
5345140	5346820	for people about
5346820	5352580	That or give advice to yourself about how to find love in this world how to find how to build a family
5353540	5356580	Get there and and then I'll listen to it someday and see if I hit the marks
5357220	5358260	um
5358260	5360340	Yeah, but well, obviously pick the right partner
5360340	5363540	But also like do the work on yourself. No know yourself
5364420	5366820	That the oracle know thyself and I think
5367780	5369780	um, listen
5370420	5374100	I have a friend. He's a new friend, but he's a friend uh who I met
5374820	5376580	for uh a meal
5376580	5379140	He's a very very well known actor overseas
5379700	5383780	And his stuff has made it over here and um, we become friends and we went to lunch
5384260	5388660	And we were talking about work and being public facing and all this kind of thing and
5389380	5393060	And then I said you have kids, right? He says he has four kids. I was like, oh, yeah, you know
5393140	5397300	I see your posts with the kids. You seem really happy. He said he just looked at me leaned in and he said
5398020	5400020	It's the best gift
5400020	5402020	you'll ever give yourself
5402260	5407060	And he also said and pick your partner the mother of your kids
5407860	5409220	very carefully
5409220	5416100	So, you know, that's good advice coming from excellent advice coming from somebody who's, you know, very successful in work and family
5416420	5420660	So that's the only thing I can pass along. We hear this from friends for ours as well, but
5421540	5425460	um kids are amazing and family is amazing and um
5426180	5428180	You know, that's the different
5428180	5432500	People all these people who want to like be immortal and like live to be 200 or something, you know
5433460	5437140	There's also the the old fashioned way of you know, having children that
5438100	5440100	Live on and evolve a new legacy
5440340	5446100	But they have, you know, half your dna. So that's exciting. Yeah, I think you make an amazing dad. Thank you
5446260	5450500	It seems like a fun thing and you know, I've also gotten advice from friends who are
5452180	5454500	Super high performing and have a lot of kids
5455220	5457220	They'll say just don't overthink it
5457620	5459300	All right, start having kids
5459300	5462340	Let's go right. Well the chaos of kids is kind of the like
5463060	5466260	You can either bury you or it can or it can give you energy
5466820	5472420	But I grew up in a big pack of boys always doing like wild and crazy things and so that kind of energy is great
5472500	5474980	And and if it's not a big pack of wild boys, it's you know
5475700	5480100	You have daughters and they can be you know, different form of chaos sometimes same form of chaos
5480740	5482900	Um, how many kids do you think you want? Hmm?
5484340	5486740	You know, it's either two or five
5487700	5492100	Yeah, very different dynamics. You're one of two, right? You know the other yeah
5492820	5494820	Um, I mean, I'm very close with my sister
5494820	5499540	I couldn't imagine having another sibling because it there's so much richness there. We talk almost every day
5500500	5502740	Sorry, you know three four times a week, you know
5503380	5506180	Sometimes just briefly but we're we're tight, you know, we're
5506980	5508980	Really look out for one another
5509220	5510180	um
5510180	5513860	She's an amazing person like truly an amazing person and has like
5514420	5517060	Raised her daughter in an amazing way. She's like
5517780	5519620	You know, my niece is like
5519620	5523060	Going to head to college in a year or two and like my sister's done an amazing job
5523140	5527380	And her dad's done a great job too. They they both really put a lot into
5528180	5529060	um
5529060	5533460	The family aspect and she has to spend time with a really amazing person in the
5534020	5539620	In peru in the amazon jungle and he is one of 20 kids. Wow. So he's got
5540820	5544820	It's mostly guys. That's just a lot of brothers and I think two sisters
5545620	5550100	I just said jonathan height on the podcast the guy who's talking about the anxious generation causing the american mind
5550100	5553060	He's great, but he was saying that you know in order to keep kids healthy
5553060	5556820	They need to not be on social media or have smartphones until they're 16
5557700	5559700	I've actually been thinking a lot about
5560500	5564020	Getting a bunch of friends onto neighboring properties, you know, everyone talks about this
5564420	5570260	Not creating a commune or anything like that, but I think I think jonathan's right. We were more or less
5570660	5574020	Our brain wiring does best when we I'm raised in
5574580	5578340	Small village type environments where kids can forage the whole free range kids idea
5578580	5582980	And I grew up skateboarding and building forts and dirt clawed wars and all that stuff
5583780	5587140	Um, it would be so strange to have a childhood without that
5588420	5590420	Yeah, and I think more and more
5590740	5597380	As we wake up to the negative aspects of the digital interaction will put more and more value to in-person interaction
5597540	5600660	So I mean it's cool to see for instance kids in new york city
5601140	5604740	I'm just kind of moving around the city with so much sense of agency. It's really really cool
5604900	5606900	The suburbs like where I grew up
5607460	5612740	Like as soon as we could get out take the 7f bus up to san francisco and hang out with you know
5612820	5615380	Wild ones like you know while there were dangers
5615460	5618740	I mean we couldn't wait to get out of the suburbs the moment that you know
5618820	5624900	Forts and dirt clawed wars and stuff didn't didn't cut it. We just like wanted into the city. So I um bucket list
5624980	5629700	I will probably move to a major city not los angeles or san francisco
5630340	5631620	um
5631620	5633620	In the next few years
5633700	5635060	new york city
5635060	5640980	Potentially there's all such different flavors of experiences. Yeah, so I'd love to live in new york city for a while
5641140	5643380	I've always wanted to do that and I and I will do that
5643620	5646740	I've always wanted to also have a place in a very rural
5647220	5652180	Some area so colorado montana are high on my list right now and to be able to
5652820	5656900	Pivot back and forth between the two would be great just for such different experiences
5657060	5659060	I and also I like a very physical life
5659060	5664180	So the idea of getting up in the sun with the sun in the montana or colorado type environment
5664820	5666100	um
5666100	5669860	And I've been doing some putting some effort towards finding a spot
5670660	5672900	Um for that and new york city to me
5673060	5677060	I know it's got its issues and people say it wasn't what it was. Okay. I get it but listen
5677140	5679940	I've never lived there. So for me would be entirely new and um
5680900	5682180	You know
5682180	5684020	Schultz seems full of life
5684020	5687620	There is an energy to that city and he represents that I mean there's yeah
5688100	5691140	And and the full diversity of weird that is
5692020	5694420	represented in new york city is great. Yeah, you walk down this tree
5694420	5697620	There's like a person with like a cat on their head and no one gives a shit. Yeah, that's great
5697780	5701220	All right, San Francisco used to be like that the joke was like
5701860	5705540	You have to be naked and on the fire and San Francisco before someone takes it but now it's changed
5705780	5711940	But again, it recently I've noticed that San Francisco. It's not just about the skateboarders. It's there's um some community
5712180	5715780	Houses of people in tech that are super interesting. There's some community housing
5716340	5718340	of people not in tech
5718660	5725300	That I've learned about him and um known people have lived there and and it's it's cool like there's stuff happening
5725940	5731700	Um in these cities that's new and different. I mean, that's what youth is for they're supposed to evolve evolve things out
5732900	5734340	uh
5734340	5737380	So amidst all that you still have to get shit done. I've been really
5738020	5740020	obsessed with tracking time recently
5740420	5744900	Like making sure I have daily activities of habits that I'm maintaining
5745860	5747860	and I'm very
5747940	5754020	Religious about making sure I get shit done. Do you use an app or something like that? No, just google sheets
5754260	5758180	So basically a spreadsheet and I'm tracking daily and I write scripts that
5758820	5762100	That uh, whenever I achieve a goal it glows green
5763060	5769540	Yeah, do you track your workouts and all that kind of stuff too? No, just the fact that I got the workout done
5769700	5774100	Yeah, so I just it's a checkmark thing. So I I'm really really big
5775060	5779860	On making sure I do a thing. It doesn't matter how long it is. I have a rule for myself that I
5780660	5784500	Do a set of tasks, uh for at least five minutes every day
5786020	5790660	And it turns out that many of them I do way longer, but just even just doing it
5791460	5794020	I have to do it every day and there's currently
5794980	5796420	11 of them
5796420	5799140	It's just a thing like one of them is playing guitar, for example
5799540	5805220	So do you do that kind of stuff? Do you do uh, like daily habits? Yeah, I do my um
5806500	5809060	I wake up if I don't feel I slept enough
5810180	5813060	I do this non-sleep-deep-rest yoga nidra thing that I've talked about a bunch
5813060	5816500	We actually released a few of those tracks as audio tracks on spotify
5817060	5817700	um
5817700	5822980	10 minute 20 minute ones puts me back into a state that feels like sleep and I feel very rested
5822980	5827860	Actually matt walker and I are gonna run a study. He's just submitted the IRB to run a study on nsdr
5827860	5832260	And what is actually doing to the brain? There's some evidence of increases in dopamine, etc
5832260	5835380	But those are older studies still cool studies, but um, so I'll do that
5835940	5837940	get up hydrate and if I've
5838500	5841220	Got my act together. I punched some caffeine down
5842260	5844900	Like some matina some coffee maybe another matina and
5845860	5850580	Resistance train three days a week run three days a week and then take one day off
5851140	5851860	um
5851860	5855780	And like to be done by 839 and then I want to get into some real work
5855780	5858580	I actually have a sticky note on my computer
5858900	5863620	It's like just like reminding me how good it feels to accomplish some real work and then I go into it right now
5863620	5865380	It's the book writing
5865380	5867380	researching a podcast and just
5867380	5869380	fight tooth and nail to stay off
5870100	5874020	Social media text message. What's app youtube all that?
5874740	5877540	Get something done. How long can you go? Can you go like?
5878420	5879700	three hours
5879700	5885300	Just deep focus if I hit a groove. Uh, yeah 90 minutes to three hours if I'm really in a groove
5885780	5886980	um
5886980	5892260	That's tough for me. I start the day actually that's why I'm afraid I'd really prize that
5892740	5897380	Those morning hours I start with the work. Yeah, and it's it's it's uh
5899060	5902420	I'm trying to hit the four hour mark of deep focus great
5902820	5907540	I love it. Then it often can't work. It's important. I'm really really deeply. Yeah
5908180	5913300	It's it's often torture actually. It's really really difficult. Oh, yeah the agitation but I've
5913940	5917860	Sat across the table from you a couple years ago when I was out here in austin doing some work
5917940	5921940	And I was working on stuff you were and I noticed you're just like stare at your notebook sometimes just like
5922740	5924420	pen at the
5924420	5929780	Same position and then you'll get back into it like there are those won't you're building that hydraulic pressure and then go
5930500	5935380	Yeah, I try and get something done of value then it the communications start and
5936180	5943460	Talking to my podcast producer. My team is everything. I mean like the the magic potion in the podcast is rob more
5944020	5945380	right
5945380	5948260	Who's in the has been in the room with me every single solo
5948820	5953460	Costello used to be in there with us because that's it people have asked journalists have asked can they sit in friends have asked
5953940	5954820	Nope
5954820	5956340	just rob
5956340	5957300	and
5957300	5961700	For guests interviews. He's there as well. And I talk to rob all the time
5962740	5965460	all the time we talk multiple times per day and
5966420	5967460	You know in life
5967460	5972900	I've I've made some errors in certain relationship domains in my life in terms of partner choice and things like that and
5973540	5978420	Certainly don't blame all of it on them. But you know, I played my role but but in terms of picking
5979220	5980740	business partners
5980740	5983220	And friends like you know to work with I mean rob
5983300	5989220	It's just it's been bull's-eyes and it's just rob has been amazing my play back our photographer and the guys I mentioned earlier like
5990020	5991140	We just
5991140	5993140	Communicate as much as we need to
5993140	5998980	And we pour over every decision like near neuroticism before we make we put anything out there and
5999780	6003220	So including like even created decisions of like topics to cover all that
6003380	6007140	Yeah, like a photo for the book jacket the other day Mike shoots photos then
6007860	6010020	And then we look at them. We pour over them together
6010980	6015380	Logo for the perform podcast with Andy Gallop and then we're launching like is that the right contour Mike's the real
6015380	6019380	He's got the aesthetic thing because he was at DC so long as a portrait photographer
6020020	6022020	And his cute with close friends with
6022100	6023300	Ken block
6023300	6029140	To Jim conna like all the car jumping in the city stuff like I mean Mike is a master. He's a he's a true master of that stuff
6029620	6031540	and um
6031540	6037220	And we just pour over every little decision, but even which sponsors, you know, there are dozens of ads now
6037220	6041860	By the way that that whole josser-sizer thing of me saying oh a guy went from a two to a seven
6042020	6043780	I never said that that's AI
6043780	6049540	Like I would never call it number off somebody a two to a seven. Are you kidding me? It's crazy. So it's AI if you bought the thing
6049620	6050900	I'm sorry
6050900	6055700	But like our sponsors we list the sponsors that we have and why on our website and like the decision
6055700	6058580	Do we work with this person or not? Do we still like the product?
6058580	6063300	I mean we've we've got ways with sponsors because of like changes in the product or change, you know
6064180	6066180	Most time it's amicable all good
6066500	6070500	But you know like just every detail and that just takes a ton of time and energy
6070980	6072580	but I try and
6072580	6076500	Work mostly on content and my team is constantly trying to keep me out of the other discussions
6078020	6084500	But I because I obsess but um, yeah, you you have to you have to have a team of some sort someone that you can run
6084500	6087860	Things bot for sure, but one of the challenges the larger the team is
6088660	6094020	And I I'd like to be involved in a lot of different kinds of stuff including engineering stuff robotics work research
6096020	6101220	All of those interactions at least for me take away from the deep work the deep focus
6101860	6103700	Unfortunately, I get
6103700	6108260	Drained by social interaction even with the people I love and really respect and all that kind of stuff
6108580	6111620	You're an introvert. Yeah, like fundamentally an introvert. So
6112740	6115220	To me it's a trade-off getting shit done versus
6115940	6120340	Collaborating and I have to choose wisely because without collaboration without a great team
6120580	6122580	Which I'm fortunate enough to be a part of
6123220	6124820	Like you wouldn't get anything really done
6124900	6128980	But as an individual contributor to get stuff done like to do the hard work of
6129700	6133700	Researching or programming all that kind of stuff. You need the hours of deep work
6133940	6135940	I used to spend a lot more time alone
6136020	6139700	That's that's on my bucket list spend a bit more time dropped into work alone
6140420	6142420	it I think social media like
6143300	6145300	It causes our brain to go the other direction
6145620	6150180	I try and answer some comments and then and then get back to work. I'm really
6151220	6153220	After going to the jungle, I
6153620	6155620	appreciate not using the device
6156500	6158500	I've played with the idea of
6158740	6163220	Like spending certainly maybe like one week a month not using social media at all
6164020	6169220	I used it. So after that morning block, I'll eat some lunch and I'll usually do something while I'm doing lunch or something
6169220	6172900	And then a bit more work and that real work deep work and then
6173700	6178180	Around 2 30 I do a non-sleep deep rest to go short nap wake up. Boom
6178740	6181780	Maybe a little more caffeine and then lean into it
6182340	6186900	Again, and then you know if you I find if you really put in the deep work
6187300	6190820	Two or three bouts per day by about five or six p.m. It's over
6191060	6195860	I was down at Jaco's place not that long ago and in the evening did a sauna session with him and
6196340	6198660	Some family members of his and some of their friends
6199220	6202580	And it's really cool like they all work all day and train all day and then in the evening
6202660	6206900	They get together and they they sauna and cold plunge. I'm really into this
6207620	6209380	whole thing of
6209380	6211220	gathering with other people
6211220	6216100	At a specific time of day. I have a gym at my house and I you know tim will come over and train or
6216580	6217780	you know
6217780	6220980	That we've kind of slowed that down in recent months, but I think
6221940	6227140	Gathering in groups once a day being alone for part of the day. It's like very fundamental stuff
6227140	6231700	We're not saying anything that hasn't been said millions of times before but how often do people actually do that?
6232260	6236900	And and and call the party, you know, like be the person to like bring people together if it's not happening
6236900	6238500	That's something I've really had to learn
6238500	6242020	Even though I'm an introvert like hey, I'm like gather people together
6242020	6245060	You came through town the other day and there's a lot of people at the house
6245620	6248980	Yeah, Brad actually I was playing because I was getting a massage when you walked in
6249940	6251780	I don't sit around getting massages very often
6251780	6256980	But I was getting one that day and then everyone came in and the dog came in like everyone's piled in. It was very sweet
6258020	6261460	Again, no devices, but choose wisely the people
6262260	6264660	You gather with right right and I was clothed
6266260	6268980	Thank you for clarifying. I wasn't which is very weird
6270500	6272020	Uh
6272020	6276900	Yeah, yeah, the the the frenzy surround yourself with that. That's another thing. It's like
6277860	6282020	I understood that from my Alaska and from just the experience in the jungle is like
6282740	6284740	Just select the people
6285380	6288100	Just be careful how you allocate your time. I just saw on
6289140	6293780	Somewhere Conor McGregor has this good line. I wrote it down about loyalty
6294660	6297300	He said don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with
6299060	6303860	That guy's I mean, he's being on loyalty all the shit talk all of that set that aside
6304500	6306500	To me like loyalty is really big
6306580	6311060	because then if you invest in certain people in your life and they stick by you and you stick by them and
6311860	6317140	What what else is life about? Yeah, well hardship will show you who your real friends are. That's for sure
6317860	6318980	and
6318980	6321300	um, you know, we're fortunate to have a lot of them
6321380	6327460	It'll also show you who you know, who really like has put in the time to try and understand you and
6328260	6332260	And understand people like people are complicated. I love that. So
6332820	6334820	Can you read the quote once more?
6335300	6337940	Don't eat with people you wouldn't starve with
6340500	6343620	Yeah, so in that way a hardship is a gift
6346980	6351780	It shows you definitely and it makes you stronger. It definitely makes you stronger
6353380	6358660	Let's go get some food. Yeah, you're one meal a day guy. Yeah, I actually ate something earlier
6358660	6363140	But it was like a protein shake and a couple pieces of bil-tongue. I hope we're eating a steak
6363700	6369140	I hope so too. I'm full of nicotine and caffeine. Yeah. What do you think? How you feel? I feel good
6369380	6372740	Yeah, I was I was thinking you'd probably like I only did a half a piece
6373220	6377220	And I won't have more for a while, but a little too good. Yeah
6379060	6382260	Thank you for talking once again, brother. Yeah, thanks so much Lex. Um
6382660	6387380	It's been a great ride this podcast thing and you're the reason I started the podcast you inspired me to do it
6387380	6392900	You told me to do it. I did it and you've also been an amazing friend. You showed up in some
6393540	6401940	Some very challenging times and you've shown up for me publicly. You've shown up for me in my home and my life and you know
6403300	6408340	It's an honor to have you as a friend. Thank you. I love you brother. Love you too
6409860	6413620	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Andrew Huberman to support this podcast
6413620	6418980	Please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung
6419940	6423380	Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life
6423940	6425940	And you will call it fate
6426820	6429700	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
