1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
As you've said, quantum computing, at least in the 1990s, was a profound story at the

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,080
intersection of computer science, physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,240
So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing that represents more than just the

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
quantum computer.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Yes.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,180
But can we start at the very basics?

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,320
What is quantum computing?

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Yeah.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,960
So it's a proposal for a new type of computation, let's say a new way to harness nature to

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,560
do computation that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,840
Now, the principles of quantum mechanics have been in place since 1926.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,160
They haven't changed.

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,160
What's new is how we want to use them.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,720
So what does quantum mechanics say about the world?

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,720
The physicists, I think, over the generations convinced people that that is an unbelievably

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,080
complicated question and just give up on trying to understand it, not being a physicist,

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,700
I can let you in on a secret, which is that it becomes a lot simpler if you do what we

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,640
do in quantum information theory and take the physics out of it.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,320
So the way that we think about quantum mechanics is as a generalization of the rules of probability

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,480
themselves.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,760
So you might say there was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today or something.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,840
You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance.

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
That would be nonsense.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,920
Much less would you say that there was an I% chance, a square root of minus 1% chance.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:49,200
Now the central discovery that quantum mechanics made is that fundamentally the world is described

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,960
by the possibilities for what a system could be doing are described using numbers called

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:07,040
amplitudes, which are like probabilities in some ways, but they are not probabilities.

28
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,640
For one thing, they can be positive or negative.

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,680
In fact, they can even be complex numbers.

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,080
And if you've heard of a quantum superposition, this just means that some state of affairs

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,000
where you assign an amplitude, one of these complex numbers, to every possible configuration

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,420
that you could see a system in on measuring it.

33
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:34,640
So for example, you might say that an electron has some amplitude for being here and some

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,360
other amplitude for being there.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,560
Now if you look to see where it is, you will localize it.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,320
You will sort of force the amplitudes to be converted into probabilities.

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,320
That happens by taking their squared absolute value.

38
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,400
And then you can say either the electron will be here or it will be there.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,000
Knowing the amplitudes, you can predict at least the probabilities that you'll see each

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,100
possible outcome.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,440
But while a system is isolated from the whole rest of the universe, the rest of its environment,

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,160
the amplitudes can change in time by rules that are different from the normal rules of

43
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,560
probability and that are alien to our everyday experience.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,400
So anytime anyone ever tells you anything about the weirdness of the quantum world or

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,360
assuming that they're not lying to you, they are telling you yet another consequence of

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,100
nature being described by these amplitudes.

47
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,140
So most famously, what amplitudes can do is that they can interfere with each other.

48
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,660
So in the famous double slit experiment, what happens is that you shoot a particle like

49
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,740
an electron, let's say, at a screen with two slits in it.

50
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,500
And you find that on a second screen, now there are certain places where that electron

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,460
will never end up after it passes through the first screen.

52
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,780
And yet if I close off one of the slits, then the electron can appear in that place.

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,580
So by decreasing the number of paths that the electron could take to get somewhere, you

54
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,260
can increase the chance that it gets there.

55
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,220
Now how is that possible?

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,620
Well it's because, as we would say now, the electron has a superposition state.

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,620
It has some amplitude for reaching this point by going through the first slit.

58
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,540
It has some other amplitude for reaching it by going through the second slit.

59
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,780
But now if one amplitude is positive and the other one is negative, then I have to add

60
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
them all up.

61
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,500
I have to add the amplitudes for every path that the electron could have taken to reach

62
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,900
this point.

63
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,420
And those amplitudes, if they're pointing in different directions, they can cancel each

64
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,660
other out.

65
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,980
That would mean the total amplitude is zero and the thing never happens at all.

66
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,500
If I close off one of the possibilities, then the amplitude is positive or it's negative

67
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,460
and now the thing can happen.

68
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,980
So that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.

69
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,820
And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is.

70
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:22,420
A quantum computer is a computer that tries to exploit exactly these phenomena, superposition,

71
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,380
amplitudes, and interference in order to solve certain problems much faster than we know

72
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,820
how to solve them otherwise.

73
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,780
So it's the basic building block of a quantum computer is what we call a quantum bit or

74
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,980
a qubit.

75
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,620
That just means a bit that has some amplitude for being zero and some other amplitude for

76
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,620
being one.

77
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,220
So it's a superposition of zero and one states.

78
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,220
But now the key point is that if I've got, let's say, a thousand qubits, the rules of

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,380
quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal that I do not just need one amplitude.

80
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,660
I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.

81
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,260
In general, I need an amplitude for every possible setting of all thousand of those

82
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,620
bits so that what that means is two to the 1,000 power amplitudes.

83
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,380
If I had to write those down, or let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,

84
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,500
if I had to write down two to the 1,000 complex numbers, that would not fit within the entire

85
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,860
observable universe.

86
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,900
And yet, quantum mechanics is unequivocal that if these qubits can all interact with

87
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:34,580
each other, and in some sense, I need two to the 1,000 parameters, amplitudes to describe

88
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,300
what is going on.

89
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,740
Now, I can tell you where all the popular articles about quantum computing go off the

90
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:49,100
rails is that they say what I just said, and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer

91
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,220
works is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.

92
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,820
That sounds too good to be true, and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.

93
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,420
The problem is I could make a superposition over every possible answer to my problem,

94
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,780
even if there are two to the 1,000 of them, I can easily do that.

95
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,540
The trouble is for a computer to be useful, you've got at some point, you've got to look

96
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,420
at it and see an output.

97
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,580
And if I just measure a superposition over every possible answer, then the rules of quantum

98
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,540
mechanics tell me that all I'll see will be a random answer.

99
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,940
If I just wanted a random answer, well, I could have picked one myself with a lot less

100
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
trouble.

101
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:37,740
So the entire trick with quantum computing, with every algorithm for a quantum computer,

102
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,780
is that you try to choreograph a pattern of interference of amplitudes, and you try to

103
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,740
do it so that for each wrong answer, some of the paths leading to that wrong answer

104
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,860
have positive amplitudes, and others have negative amplitudes.

105
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,380
So on the whole, they cancel each other out, whereas all the paths leading to the right

106
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,980
answer should reinforce each other, should have amplitudes pointing the same direction.

107
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,100
So the design of algorithms in this space is the choreography of the interferences.

108
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Precisely.

109
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,100
That's precisely what it is.

110
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,220
Take a brief step back, and you mentioned information.

111
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,220
So in which part of this beautiful picture that you've painted is information contained?

112
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,580
Oh, well, information is at the core of everything that we've been talking about.

113
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:34,300
I mean, the bit is the basic unit of information, since Claude Shannon's paper in 1948, and

114
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:40,060
of course, people had the concept even before that, he popularized the name.

115
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,820
But a bit is zero or one, so that's the basic element of information.

116
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,820
That's right.

117
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,780
And what we would say is that the basic unit of quantum information is the qubit, is the

118
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:57,100
object, any object that can be maintained and manipulated in a superposition of zero

119
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,860
and one states.

120
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,980
Now sometimes people ask, well, but what is a qubit physically?

121
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:09,700
And there are all these different proposals that are being pursued in parallel for how

122
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,780
you implement qubits.

123
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,580
There is superconducting quantum computing that was in the news recently because of Google's

124
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:25,700
quantum supremacy experiment, where you would have some little coils where a current can

125
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,260
flow through them in two different energy states.

126
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,460
One representing a zero, another representing a one.

127
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,700
And if you cool these coils to just slightly above absolute zero, like a hundredth of a

128
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,980
degree, then they superconduct and then the current can actually be in a superposition

129
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,460
of the two different states.

130
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,340
So that's one kind of qubit.

131
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,780
Another kind would be just an individual atomic nucleus, it has a spin.

132
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,460
It could be spinning clockwise, it could be spinning counterclockwise, or it could be in

133
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,940
a superposition of the two spin states.

134
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,380
That is another qubit.

135
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,900
Because just like in the classical world, you could be a virtuoso programmer without

136
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,100
having any idea of what a transistor is, or how the bits are physically represented inside

137
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,060
the machine, even that the machine uses electricity.

138
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,860
You just care about the logic.

139
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,420
It's sort of the same with quantum computing.

140
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,260
Cubits could be realized by many, many different quantum systems, yet all of those systems

141
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:34,900
will lead to the same logic, the logic of qubits and how you measure them, how you change

142
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,340
them over time.

143
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,060
And so the subject of how qubits behave and what you can do with qubits, that is quantum

144
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
information.

145
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:52,060
So just to linger on that, so the physical design implementation of a qubit does not

146
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,220
interfere with that next level of abstraction that you can program over it.

147
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,860
So it truly is, the idea of it is, is it okay?

148
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,700
Well, to be honest with you, today they do interfere with each other.

149
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,460
That's because all the quantum computers we can build today are very noisy.

150
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,820
And so the qubits are very far from perfect, and so the lower level sort of does affect

151
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,660
the higher levels, and we sort of have to think about all of them at once.

152
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,380
But eventually, where we hope to get is to what are called error-corrected quantum computers,

153
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,980
where the qubits really do behave like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them

154
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,980
to.

155
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,500
And in that future, a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about or think about

156
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:46,860
today, but in that future, the logic of it really does become decoupled from the hardware.

157
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,540
So if noise is currently like the biggest problem for quantum computing, and then the

158
00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:01,380
dream is error-correcting quantum computers, can you just maybe describe what does it mean

159
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,620
for there to be noise in the system?

160
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Absolutely.

161
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,980
So yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific than noise.

162
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,380
So the fundamental problem, if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer of any

163
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,740
appreciable size, is something called decoherence.

164
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,100
And this was recognized from the very beginning when people first started thinking about this

165
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,820
in the 1990s.

166
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:32,420
Now what decoherence means is sort of the unwanted interaction between your qubits, the state

167
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,180
of your quantum computer, and the external environment.

168
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,060
And why is that such a problem?

169
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,460
I talked before about how when you measure a quantum system, so let's say if I measure

170
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,540
a qubit that's in a superposition of zero and one states to ask it, are you zero or

171
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
are you one?

172
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,980
Well, now I force it to make up its mind.

173
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,820
And now probabilistically, it chooses one or the other.

174
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,300
And now it's no longer a superposition, there's no longer amplitudes, there's just some probability

175
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,140
that I get a zero and there's some that I get a one.

176
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,620
And now the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me who's looking.

177
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,300
In fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.

178
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,620
Any kind of interaction with the external world that leaks out the information about

179
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,860
whether this qubit was a zero or a one, sort of that causes the zero-ness or the oneness

180
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:35,420
of the qubit to be recorded in the radiation in the room, in the molecules of the air,

181
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:42,180
in the wires that are connected to my device, any of that, as soon as the information leaks

182
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,940
out, it is as if that qubit has been measured.

183
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,340
It is the state has now collapsed.

184
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,340
Another way to say it is that it's become entangled with its environment.

185
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,140
But from the perspective of someone who's just looking at this qubit, it is as though

186
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,740
it has lost its quantum state.

187
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,220
What this means is that if I want to do a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits

188
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,380
sort of fanatically well-isolated from their environment, but then at the same time, they

189
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,220
can't be perfectly isolated because I need to tell them what to do.

190
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,020
I need to make them interact with each other for one thing and not only that, but in a

191
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,580
precisely choreographed way.

192
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,260
That is such a staggering problem.

193
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,580
How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe, but then also tell them exactly

194
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
what to do?

195
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:39,300
I mean, there were distinguished physicists and computer scientists in the 90s who said

196
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,860
this is fundamentally impossible.

197
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,100
The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits to the degree of accuracy that

198
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,220
you're talking about.

199
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:57,180
What changed the views of most of us was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s,

200
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,540
which was called the theory of quantum error correction and quantum fault tolerance.

201
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,860
The upshot of that theory is that if I want to build a reliable quantum computer and scale

202
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:15,940
it up to an arbitrary number of as many qubits as I want and doing as much on them as I want,

203
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,860
I do not actually have to get the qubits perfectly isolated from their environment.

204
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,740
It is enough to get them really, really, really well-isolated.

205
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:33,340
Even if every qubit is leaking its state into the environment at some rate, as long as that

206
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:41,740
rate is low enough, I can encode the information that I care about in very clever ways across

207
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:48,180
the collective states of multiple qubits in such a way that even if a small percentage

208
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,140
of my qubits leak, well, I'm constantly monitoring them to see if that leak happened.

209
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,660
I can detect it and I can correct it.

210
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,460
I can recover the information I care about from the remaining qubits.

211
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,900
You can build a reliable quantum computer even out of unreliable parts.

212
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,660
In some sense, that discovery is what set the engineering agenda for quantum computing research

213
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,940
from the 1990s until the present.

214
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:25,260
The goal has been engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable but reliable enough

215
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:31,140
that you can then use these error-correcting codes to have them simulate qubits that are

216
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,980
even more reliable than they are.

217
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,020
The error-correction becomes a net win rather than a net loss.

218
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:44,420
And then once you reach that crossover point, then your simulated qubits could in turn simulate

219
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,460
qubits that are even more reliable and so on until you've just effectively, you have arbitrarily

220
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,500
reliable qubits.

221
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,220
So long story short, we are not at that break-even point yet.

222
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,900
We're a hell of a lot closer than we were when people started doing this in the 90s, like orders

223
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,980
of magnitude closer.

224
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,260
But the key ingredient there is the more qubits, the better.

225
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,460
Well, the more qubits, the larger the computation you can do, right?

226
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:15,020
I mean, qubits are what constitute the memory of your quantum computer, right?

227
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,820
But also for the error-correcting mechanism.

228
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,500
Yes.

229
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,700
So the way I would say it is that error-correction imposes an overhead in the number of qubits.

230
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,460
And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems with building a scalable quantum

231
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:29,980
computer.

232
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,500
If you look at the error-correcting codes, at least the ones that we know about today, and you

233
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:43,820
look at what would it take to actually use a quantum computer to hack your credit card number,

234
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,780
which is the most famous application people talk about, right?

235
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,340
Let's say to factor huge numbers and thereby break the RSA crypto system.

236
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,460
Well, what that would take would be thousands of several thousand logical qubits.

237
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,460
But now with the known error-correcting codes, each of those logical qubits would need to

238
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,700
be encoded itself using thousands of physical qubits.

239
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,340
So at that point, you're talking about millions of physical qubits.

240
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,020
And in some sense, that is the reason why quantum computers are not breaking cryptography

241
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,540
already.

242
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,260
It's because of these immense overheads involved.

243
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,140
So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?

244
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,180
Well, it's multiplicative.

245
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,100
I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits that you need in your abstract

246
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,140
quantum circuit, you multiply it by a thousand or so.

247
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,820
So there's a lot of work on inventing better, trying to invent better error-correcting codes.

248
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,900
OK, that is the situation right now.

249
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:45,900
In the meantime, we are now in what the physicist John Preskell called the noisy intermediate

250
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,980
scale quantum or NISC era.

251
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,140
And this is the era.

252
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,660
You can think of it as sort of like the vacuum, you know, we're now entering the very early

253
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,100
vacuum tube era of quantum computers.

254
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,740
The quantum computer analog of the transistor has not been invented yet.

255
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,180
Right.

256
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,780
That would be like true error correction, right?

257
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,780
Where, you know, we are not or something else that would achieve the same effect.

258
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,300
Right. We are not there yet.

259
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:16,180
And but where we are now, let's say, as of a few months ago, you know, as of Google's

260
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:21,020
announcement of quantum supremacy, you know, we are now finally at the point where even

261
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,500
with a non-error corrected quantum computer with, you know, these noisy devices, we can

262
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,460
do something that is hard for classical computers to simulate.

263
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,060
OK, so we can eke out some advantage.

264
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,500
Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something beyond what a classical computer

265
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,260
can do that is also useful to someone that we still don't know?

266
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,700
People are going to be racing over the next decade to try to do that by people.

267
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,500
I mean, Google, IBM, you know, a bunch of startup companies and, you know,

268
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,780
a and research labs and research labs and governments.

269
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,700
And yeah, you just mentioned a million things.

270
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,300
Well, I'll backtrack for a second.

271
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,820
Yes, sure. Sure.

272
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,260
So we're in these vacuum tube days.

273
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,700
Yeah, just entering.

274
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,860
And just entering. Wow. OK.

275
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,060
So yeah, how do we escape the vacuum?

276
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,660
So how do we get to how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?

277
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,340
Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?

278
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,460
Is there is there breakthroughs in on the physics side that they're needed on the

279
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,780
computer science side?

280
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,940
What is there?

281
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:35,420
And is it a financial issue where much larger, just sheer investment and excitement is needed?

282
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,260
So, you know, those are excellent questions.

283
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,620
My guess. My guess would be all of the above.

284
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,100
I mean, my guess, you know, I mean, you know, you can say fundamentally,

285
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,820
it is an engineering issue, right?

286
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,420
The theory has been in place since the 90s.

287
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,060
You know, at least, you know, you know, this is what, you know, error correction

288
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,180
would look like, you know, we do not have the hardware that is at that level.

289
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,780
But at the same time, you know, so you could just, you know, try to power through,

290
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,220
you know, maybe even like, you know, if someone spent a trillion dollars

291
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,140
on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right?

292
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,140
Then conceivably, they could just, you know, build a an error corrected

293
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,100
quantum computer as it was envisioned back in the 90s, right?

294
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,780
I think the more plausible thing to happen is that there will be further

295
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,820
theoretical breakthroughs and there will be further insights

296
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,420
that will cut down the cost of doing this.
