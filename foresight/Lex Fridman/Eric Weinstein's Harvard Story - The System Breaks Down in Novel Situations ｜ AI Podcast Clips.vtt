00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
Without naming names, can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at Harvard?

00:11.120 --> 00:16.040
Maybe in a way that tells the bigger story of the struggle of young, bright minds that

00:16.040 --> 00:23.340
are trying to come up with big, bold ideas within the institutions that we're talking

00:23.340 --> 00:24.340
about?

00:24.340 --> 00:26.840
You can start.

00:27.160 --> 00:40.900
In part, it starts with coffee with a couple of Croatians in the math department at MIT.

00:40.900 --> 00:48.560
We used to talk about music and dance and math and physics and love and all this kind

00:48.560 --> 00:54.800
of stuff as Eastern Europeans love to and I ate it up.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.820
My friend, Gordana, who was an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduate

01:00.820 --> 01:06.840
student at Harvard, said to me, I'm probably going to do a bad version of her accent.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.840
Here we go.

01:07.840 --> 01:14.000
Eric, will I see you tomorrow at the secret seminar?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.600
And I said, what secret seminar?

01:16.600 --> 01:19.120
Eric, don't joke.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.840
I said, I'm not used to this style of humor, Gordana.

01:24.800 --> 01:34.000
The secret seminar that your advisor is running, I said, what are you talking about?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.960
Your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.000
I think it was like the churned Simon's invariant.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.640
Not sure what the topic was again, but she gave me the room number and the time and she

01:45.640 --> 01:47.320
was like not cracking a smile.

01:47.320 --> 01:50.880
I've never known her to make this kind of a joke and I thought this was crazy and I

01:50.880 --> 01:52.680
was trying to have an advisor.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.560
I didn't want an advisor, but people said you have to have one, so I took one.

01:57.560 --> 02:03.520
And I went to this room like 15 minutes early and there was not a soul inside it.

02:03.520 --> 02:09.520
It was outside of the math department and it was still in the same building, the Science

02:09.520 --> 02:11.840
Center at Harvard.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.040
And I sat there and I let five minutes go by, I let seven minutes go by, 10 minutes

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
go by, there's nobody.

02:17.040 --> 02:20.480
I thought, okay, so this was all an elaborate joke.

02:21.240 --> 02:27.280
And then like three minutes to the hour, this graduate student walks in and like sees me

02:27.280 --> 02:29.200
and does a double take.

02:29.200 --> 02:35.960
And then I start to see the professors in geometry and topology start to file in.

02:35.960 --> 02:41.640
And everybody's like very disconcerted that I'm in this room.

02:41.640 --> 02:48.960
And finally, the person who was supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and

02:48.960 --> 02:53.440
sees me and goes, why does it ghost?

02:53.440 --> 03:01.040
And I realized that the secret seminar is true, that the department is conducting a

03:01.040 --> 03:06.680
secret seminar on the exact topic that I'm interested in, not telling me about it.

03:06.680 --> 03:12.000
And that these are the reindeer games that the Rudolphs of the department are not invited

03:12.000 --> 03:13.440
to.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.400
And so then I realized, okay, I did not understand it.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.160
There's a parallel department.

03:20.160 --> 03:31.200
And that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which I came to understand that

03:31.200 --> 03:43.360
the game that I had been sold about publication, about blind refereeing, about openness and

03:43.360 --> 03:48.800
public transmission of information was all a lie.

03:48.800 --> 03:55.200
I came to understand that at the very top, there's a second system that's about closed

03:55.200 --> 04:04.320
meetings and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest

04:04.320 --> 04:06.600
of us don't understand.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.600
And that in large measure, that is the thing that I won't submit to.

04:11.640 --> 04:16.040
And so when you ask me questions like, well, why wouldn't you feel good about talking to

04:16.040 --> 04:17.040
your critics?

04:17.040 --> 04:18.040
Or why wouldn't you feel...

04:18.040 --> 04:19.800
The answer is, oh, you don't know.

04:19.800 --> 04:25.600
If you stay in a nice hotel, you don't realize that there is an entire second structure inside

04:25.600 --> 04:32.640
of that hotel where there's usually a workers' cafe in a resort complex that isn't available

04:32.640 --> 04:34.480
to the people who are staying in the hotel.

04:34.480 --> 04:42.560
And then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are parallel structures.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.160
So that's what I found, which was, in essence, just the way you can stay hotels your whole

04:47.160 --> 04:51.520
life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're not

04:51.520 --> 04:53.800
supposed to see as the guest.

04:53.800 --> 04:59.160
There is a second structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respect

04:59.160 --> 05:04.240
to how people get dinged, how people get their grants taken away, how this person comes

05:04.240 --> 05:08.160
to have that thing named after them.

05:08.160 --> 05:15.520
And by pretending that we're not running a parallel structure, I have no patience for

05:15.520 --> 05:16.920
that anymore.

05:16.920 --> 05:22.960
So I got a chance to see how the game, how hardball is really played at Harvard.

05:22.960 --> 05:30.400
And I'm now eager to play hardball back with the same people who played hardball with me.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.160
Let me ask two questions on this.

05:33.160 --> 05:41.080
So one, do you think it's possible, I call those people assholes, that's the technical

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
term.

05:42.080 --> 05:47.080
Do you think it's possible that that's just not the entire system, but a part of the

05:47.080 --> 05:48.080
system?

05:48.080 --> 05:54.400
Sort of that there's, you can navigate, you can swim in the waters and find the groups

05:54.400 --> 05:57.200
of people who do aspire to open this.

05:57.200 --> 06:04.280
The guy who rescued my PhD was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.760
Right, but are there people outside of this?

06:08.760 --> 06:09.760
Is he an asshole?

06:09.760 --> 06:15.120
Well, yes, I was, it was a bad, no, but I'm trying to make this point, which is this isn't

06:15.120 --> 06:18.640
my failure to correctly map these people.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.640
It's yours.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.720
You have a simplification that isn't going to work.

06:23.720 --> 06:30.120
I think, okay, as long as it was the wrong term, I would say lacking of character and...

06:30.120 --> 06:33.160
What would you have had these people do?

06:33.160 --> 06:34.280
Why did they do this?

06:34.280 --> 06:36.680
Why have a secret seminar?

06:36.680 --> 06:40.440
I don't understand the exact dynamics of a secret seminar, but I think the right thing

06:40.440 --> 06:45.080
to do is to, I mean, to see individuals like you.

06:45.080 --> 06:50.560
There might be a reason to have a secret seminar, but they should detect that an individual

06:50.560 --> 06:55.960
like you, a brilliant mind who's thinking about certain ideas could be damaged by this.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.440
I don't think that they see it that way.

06:58.440 --> 07:03.200
The idea is we're going to sneak food to the children we want to survive.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.360
Yeah, so that's highly problematic, and there should be people within that room.

07:07.360 --> 07:12.360
But I'm trying to say, this is the thing, the ball that can't is thrown, but won't be caught.

07:12.360 --> 07:21.000
The problem is they know that most of their children won't survive, and they can't say

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
that.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
I see.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.120
Sorry to interrupt.

07:25.120 --> 07:31.000
You mean that the fact that the whole system is underfunded, that they naturally have to

07:31.000 --> 07:32.800
pick favorites?

07:32.800 --> 07:39.500
They live in a world which reached steady state of some level, let's say, in the early

07:39.900 --> 07:41.400
70s.

07:41.400 --> 07:48.300
In that world, before that time, you have a professor like Norman Steenrod, and you'd

07:48.300 --> 07:52.500
have 20 children that is graduate students, and all of them would go on to be professors,

07:52.500 --> 07:55.700
and all of them would want to have 20 children.

07:55.700 --> 08:01.660
You start taking higher and higher powers of 20, and you see that the system could not,

08:01.660 --> 08:05.260
it's not just about money, the system couldn't survive.

08:05.260 --> 08:11.620
The way it's supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhD

08:11.620 --> 08:19.620
programs, and we should let the small number of truly top places populate mostly teaching

08:19.620 --> 08:23.620
and research departments that aren't PhD producing.

08:23.620 --> 08:27.500
We don't want to do that because we use PhD students as a labor force.

08:27.500 --> 08:33.420
The whole thing has to do with growth, resources, dishonesty.

08:33.700 --> 08:40.500
In that world, you see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world, the key question is where

08:40.500 --> 08:45.700
are we going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out?

08:45.700 --> 08:51.020
My problem was I wasn't interested in dying.

08:51.020 --> 08:57.020
You clearly highlight that there's aspects of the system that are broken, but as an individual,

08:57.020 --> 09:03.220
is your role to exit the system or just acknowledge that it's a game and win it?

09:03.220 --> 09:08.180
My role is to survive and thrive in the public eye.

09:08.180 --> 09:16.100
In other words, when you have an escapee of the system, like yourself, such as, and that

09:16.100 --> 09:18.740
person says, you know, I wasn't exactly finished.

09:18.740 --> 09:21.020
Let me show you a bunch of stuff.

09:21.020 --> 09:26.140
Let me show you that the theory of telomeres never got reported properly.

09:26.140 --> 09:31.860
Let me show you that all of marginal economics is supposed to be redone with a different

09:31.860 --> 09:33.580
version of the differential calculus.

09:33.580 --> 09:37.980
Let me show you that you didn't understand the self-dual Yang-Mills equations correctly

09:37.980 --> 09:46.140
in topology and physics because they're in fact much more broadly found and it's only

09:46.140 --> 09:48.900
the mutations that happen in special dimensions.

09:48.900 --> 09:54.900
There are lots of things to say, but this particular group of people, like if you just

09:54.900 --> 10:00.580
take, where are all the Gen X and Millennial University presidents?

10:01.300 --> 10:01.820
Right.

10:01.820 --> 10:02.300
Okay.

10:02.300 --> 10:06.740
They're all in a holding pattern.

10:06.740 --> 10:15.860
Now, why in the story of telomeres was it an older professor and a younger graduate student?

10:15.860 --> 10:20.460
It's this issue of what would be called interference competition.

10:20.460 --> 10:25.980
So, for example, orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blowholes so that

10:25.980 --> 10:30.100
they suffocate because the needed resource is air.

10:30.140 --> 10:30.500
Okay.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.100
Well, what do the universities do?

10:32.140 --> 10:38.460
They try to make sure that you can't be viable, that you need them, that you need their grants.

10:38.540 --> 10:46.060
You need to be zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the

10:46.060 --> 10:47.380
locals love to play.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.660
Well, my point is, okay, what's the cost of this?

10:51.060 --> 10:55.460
How many people died as a result of these interference competition games?

10:56.300 --> 11:00.820
You know, when you take somebody like Douglas Prasher who did green fluorescent protein and

11:00.820 --> 11:03.260
he drives a shuttle bus, right?

11:03.260 --> 11:06.860
Because his grant runs out and he has to give away all of his research and all of that

11:06.860 --> 11:10.980
research gets a Nobel Prize and he gets to drive a shuttle bus for $35,000 a year.

11:11.260 --> 11:12.260
What do you mean by died?

11:12.260 --> 11:14.700
Do you mean their career, their dreams, their passions?

11:14.700 --> 11:19.020
Yeah, the whole, as an academic, Doug Prasher was dead for a long period of time.

11:19.860 --> 11:29.180
Okay, so as a person who's escaped the system, can't you at this, because you also have in

11:29.180 --> 11:35.100
your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be useful, maybe not?

11:35.420 --> 11:35.940
Let's hope.

11:36.820 --> 11:41.420
Can't you also play the game enough, like with the children?

11:41.620 --> 11:48.180
So like publish and but also if you told me that this would work, really what I want to do,

11:48.260 --> 11:55.140
you see, is I would love to revolutionize a field with an H index of zero.

11:58.380 --> 12:02.900
Like we have these proxies that count how many papers you've written, how cited are the papers

12:02.900 --> 12:03.420
you've written.

12:04.540 --> 12:05.740
All this is nonsense.

12:06.180 --> 12:06.860
That's interesting.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.260
Sorry, what do you mean by a field with an H index?

12:09.260 --> 12:12.700
So totally new field H index is count somehow.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.060
How many papers have you gotten that get so many citations?

12:15.060 --> 12:15.260
Yeah.

12:16.260 --> 12:18.220
Let's say H index undefined.

12:20.300 --> 12:27.980
Like for example, I don't have an advisor for my PhD, but I have to have an advisor as

12:27.980 --> 12:35.660
far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks who advised whom down the line.

12:37.140 --> 12:40.300
So I am my own advisor, which sets up a loop, right?

12:40.580 --> 12:42.300
How many students do I have an infinite number?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.980
Your descendants, they don't want to have that story.

12:46.220 --> 12:51.020
So I have to be, I have to have formal advisor, Raoul bot, and my Wikipedia entry, for example,

12:51.020 --> 12:53.580
says that I was advised by Raoul bot, which is not true.

12:55.100 --> 13:00.220
So you get fit into a system that says, well, we have to know what your H index is.

13:00.220 --> 13:04.860
We have to know, you know, where are you a professor if you want to apply for a grant?

13:04.860 --> 13:06.380
It makes all of these assumptions.

13:07.260 --> 13:11.260
What I'm trying to do is in part to show all of this is nonsense.

13:11.340 --> 13:14.380
This is proxy BS that came up in the institutional setting.

13:14.940 --> 13:19.660
And right now, it's important for those of us who are still vital, like Elon, it would

13:19.660 --> 13:24.220
be great to have Elon as a professor of physics and engineering, right?

13:24.220 --> 13:31.980
It seems ridiculous to say, but just as a shot in the arm, you know, like, it'd be

13:31.980 --> 13:36.940
great to have Elon at Caltech, even one day a week, one day a month.

13:37.180 --> 13:37.900
One day a month.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.260
Okay, well, why can't we be in there?

13:41.260 --> 13:42.140
It's the same reason.

13:42.140 --> 13:43.820
Well, why can't you be on the view?

13:43.820 --> 13:45.260
Why can't you be on Bill Martin?

13:45.260 --> 13:48.060
We need to know what you're going to do before we take you on the show.

13:48.060 --> 13:48.700
On the show.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.140
Well, I don't want to tell you what I'm going to do.

13:51.100 --> 13:54.860
Do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit?

13:54.860 --> 13:56.300
I can dance the dance fun.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.100
To be on the view.

13:57.100 --> 13:57.660
Oh, come on.

13:58.380 --> 13:58.940
So you can.

13:58.940 --> 13:59.500
Yeah, you do.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.140
You're not, you're not.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.180
I can do that fine.

14:01.180 --> 14:04.220
Here's where it's, the place that it goes south is,

14:05.180 --> 14:09.580
there's like a set of questions that get you into this more adversarial stuff.

14:09.580 --> 14:13.500
And you've in fact asked some of those more adversarial questions this setting.

14:14.460 --> 14:17.180
And they're not things that are necessarily aggressive, but they're

14:17.180 --> 14:19.100
things that are making assumptions.

14:20.140 --> 14:20.540
Right.

14:20.540 --> 14:20.860
Right.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.220
Well, so when you make, I have a question, it's like, you know, Lex,

14:24.220 --> 14:25.420
are you avoiding your critics?

14:27.020 --> 14:29.580
You know, it's just like, okay, well, why did you frame that that way?

14:29.580 --> 14:33.740
Or the next question would be like, do you think that you should have a

14:34.060 --> 14:37.100
special exemption and that you should have the right to break rules and everyone else

14:37.100 --> 14:37.900
should have to follow them?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.540
Like that question I find innervating.

14:40.540 --> 14:40.860
Yeah.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.780
It doesn't really come out of anything meaningful.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.900
It's just like, we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other person

14:45.900 --> 14:48.700
to show that we're not captured by their madness.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.700
That's not the real question you want to ask me.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.100
If you want to get really excited about this, you want to ask,

14:53.740 --> 14:55.020
do you think this thing is right?

14:56.060 --> 14:56.700
Yeah.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.500
Weirdly, I do.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.620
Do you think that it's going to be immediately seen to be right?

15:00.620 --> 15:01.100
I don't.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.780
I think it's going to, it's going to have an interesting fight and it's going to have

15:04.780 --> 15:06.460
an interesting evolution.

15:06.460 --> 15:10.140
And well, what do you hope to do with it in non-physical terms?

15:10.140 --> 15:17.020
Oh, gosh, I hope it revolutionizes our relationship of, well, with people outside

15:17.020 --> 15:20.540
of the institutional framework and it reinflicts us into the institutional

15:20.540 --> 15:24.620
framework where we can do the most good to bring the institutions back to health.

15:25.820 --> 15:28.940
You know, it's like, these are positive uplifting questions.

15:28.940 --> 15:33.900
If you had Frank Wilczek, you wouldn't say, Frank, let's be honest,

15:33.900 --> 15:39.580
you have done very little with your life after the original huge show that you used to break

15:39.580 --> 15:40.460
under the physics scene.

15:40.460 --> 15:45.340
Like, we weirdly ask people different questions based upon how they sit down.

15:45.340 --> 15:46.860
Yeah, that's very strange, right?

15:46.860 --> 15:54.620
But you have to understand that, so here's the thing, I get these days a large number

15:54.700 --> 15:59.260
of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory of everything for AGI.

16:00.540 --> 16:10.940
And I use my own radar, BS radar, to detect unfairly, perhaps, whether they're full of

16:10.940 --> 16:11.500
shit or not.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.420
I love where you're going with this, by the way.

16:15.980 --> 16:24.940
And my concern, I often think about, is there's elements of brilliance in what people write

16:24.940 --> 16:31.900
to me and I'm trying to, right now, as you made it clear, the kind of judgments and

16:31.900 --> 16:38.780
assumptions we make, how am I supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system

16:38.780 --> 16:44.620
and think about what you're doing, because my radar is saying you're not full of shit.

16:45.980 --> 16:48.540
But I'm also not completely outside of the system.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.100
That's right.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.940
You've danced beautifully.

16:50.940 --> 16:56.620
You've actually got all the credibility that you're supposed to get, all the nice little

16:56.620 --> 17:01.340
stamps of approval, not all, but a large enough amount.

17:03.580 --> 17:12.220
I mean, it's hard to put into words exactly why you sound, whether your theory turns out to

17:12.220 --> 17:16.940
be good or not, you sound like a special human being.

17:17.660 --> 17:18.380
I appreciate that.

17:18.380 --> 17:18.940
And thank you very much for this.

17:18.940 --> 17:19.740
In a good way.

17:19.740 --> 17:20.140
No, no, no.

17:20.780 --> 17:25.180
So, but what am I supposed to do with that flood of emails from AGI folks?

17:25.180 --> 17:26.380
Why do I sound different?

17:27.180 --> 17:27.660
I don't know.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.140
And I would like to systemize that.

17:30.140 --> 17:30.620
I don't know.

17:31.820 --> 17:38.460
Look, when you're talking to people, you very quickly can surmise.

17:39.340 --> 17:40.860
Am I claiming to be a physicist?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.060
No, I say it every turn.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.380
I'm not a physicist, right?

17:45.180 --> 17:48.860
When I say, when you say something about bundles, you say, well, can you explain it differently?

17:48.860 --> 17:54.780
And I, you know, I'm pushing around on this, this area, that lever over there.

17:55.500 --> 17:59.500
I'm trying to find something that we can play with and engage.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.980
And, you know, another thing is, is that I'll say something at scale.

18:04.860 --> 18:09.180
So if I was saying completely wrong things about bundles on the Joe Rogan program,

18:09.180 --> 18:12.300
you don't think that we wouldn't hear a crushing chorus?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.020
Yes.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.740
And, you know, same thing with geometric unity.

18:15.740 --> 18:20.620
So I put up this, this video from this Oxford lecture.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.540
I understand that it's not a standard lecture,

18:24.060 --> 18:28.860
but you haven't heard, you know, the most brilliant people in the field say,

18:28.860 --> 18:30.460
well, this is obviously nonsense.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.380
They don't know what to make of it.

18:34.460 --> 18:37.020
And they're going to hide behind, well, he hasn't said enough details.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.140
Where's the paper?

18:38.140 --> 18:38.860
Where's the paper?

18:38.940 --> 18:41.020
I've seen the criticism.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.380
I've gotten the same kind of criticism.

18:42.380 --> 18:47.420
I've published a few things and like, especially stuff related to Tesla,

18:48.620 --> 18:50.540
that we did studies on Tesla vehicles.

18:50.540 --> 18:55.260
And the kind of criticism I've gotten was showed that they're completely...

18:55.260 --> 18:55.740
Oh, right.

18:55.740 --> 19:00.220
Like the guy who had Elon Musk on his program twice is going to give us an accurate assessment.

19:00.220 --> 19:01.100
Yeah, exactly.

19:01.100 --> 19:01.740
Exactly.

19:01.740 --> 19:03.420
It's just very low level.

19:03.420 --> 19:07.740
Like without actually ever addressing the content.

19:08.860 --> 19:16.300
You know, Lex, I think that in part you're trying to solve a puzzle that isn't really your puzzle.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.980
I think you know that I'm sincere.

19:17.980 --> 19:20.460
You don't know whether the theory is going to work or not.

19:21.180 --> 19:24.700
And you know that it's not coming out of somebody who's coming out of left field.

19:25.260 --> 19:26.700
Like the story makes sense.

19:26.700 --> 19:32.700
There's enough that's new and creative and different in other aspects where you can check me

19:33.660 --> 19:38.940
that your real concern is, are you really telling me that when you start breaking the rules,

19:38.940 --> 19:43.340
you see the system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive?

19:43.340 --> 19:44.140
And the answer is yes.

19:45.500 --> 19:50.620
And I had to break the rules in part because of learning issues because I came into this field,

19:50.620 --> 19:53.900
you know, with a totally different set of attributes.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.620
My profile just doesn't look like anybody else's remotely.

19:57.500 --> 20:03.260
But as a result, what that did is it showed me what is the system true to its own ideals?

20:03.260 --> 20:05.500
Or does it just follow these weird procedures?

20:05.500 --> 20:09.980
And then when you take it off the rails, it behaves terribly.

20:09.980 --> 20:14.700
And that's really what my story, I think, does is it just says, well,

20:14.700 --> 20:19.980
he completely takes the system into new territory where it's not expecting to have to deal with

20:19.980 --> 20:22.380
somebody with these confusing sets of attributes.

20:22.380 --> 20:26.780
And I think what he's telling us is he believes it behaves terribly.

20:26.780 --> 20:32.940
Now, if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests and, you know,

20:32.940 --> 20:36.780
a winner of math competitions and you put them in a PhD program,

20:37.740 --> 20:39.020
they're probably going to be okay.

20:40.300 --> 20:48.140
I'm not saying that the system, you know, breaks down for everybody under all circumstances.

20:48.220 --> 20:51.740
I'm saying when you present the system with a novel situation,

20:52.460 --> 20:57.260
at the moment, it will almost certainly break down with probability approaching 100%.

20:59.500 --> 21:06.780
But to me, the painful and the tragic thing is it sorry to bring out my motherly instinct,

21:07.340 --> 21:08.860
but it feels like it's too much.

21:09.580 --> 21:12.620
It could be too much of a burden to exist outside the system.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.540
Maybe, bi psychologically.

21:14.540 --> 21:22.220
First of all, I've got a podcast that I kind of like and I've got amazing friends.

21:22.220 --> 21:26.380
I have a life which has more interesting people passing through it than I know what to do with.

21:27.180 --> 21:31.500
And they haven't managed to kill me off yet, so so far so good.
