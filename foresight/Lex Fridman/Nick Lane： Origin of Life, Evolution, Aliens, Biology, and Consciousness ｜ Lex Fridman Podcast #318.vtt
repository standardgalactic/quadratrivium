00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.080
And amazingly, most of these reactions are exagonic, which is to say they release energy.

00:10.080 --> 00:15.760
This, if you have hydrogen and CO2 and you put them together in a falcon tube and you warm it up

00:15.760 --> 00:20.320
to say 50 degrees centigrade and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it, nothing's

00:20.320 --> 00:26.560
going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable, two gases hydrogen and CO2 is less

00:26.560 --> 00:32.400
stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out. Why doesn't that happen?

00:32.400 --> 00:35.760
It's because of the kinetic barriers. It's because that's where you need the spark.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.360
The following is a conversation with Nick Lane, a biochemist at University College London

00:43.360 --> 00:49.040
and author of some of my favorite books on biology, science and life ever written,

00:49.600 --> 00:54.000
including his two most recent title transformer, the deep chemistry of life and death,

00:54.480 --> 01:03.120
and the vital question, why is life the way it is? This is the Lux Friedman podcast to support it.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.800
Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.880
Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious, the most interesting question

01:13.760 --> 01:20.160
that we little humans can ask of ourselves. How did life originate on earth?

01:20.560 --> 01:26.880
You could ask anybody working on the subject and you'll get a different answer from all of them.

01:26.880 --> 01:32.080
They will be pretty passionately held opinions and their opinions grounded in science,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.680
but they're still really at this point, their opinions, because there's so much stuff to know

01:38.800 --> 01:44.800
that all we can ever do is get a kind of a small slice of it and it's the context which matters.

01:44.800 --> 01:52.240
So I can give you my answer. My answer is from a biologist's point of view. That has been missing

01:52.240 --> 01:58.560
from the equation over decades, which is, well, what does life do on earth? Why is it this way?

01:58.560 --> 02:04.720
Why is it made of cells? Why is it made of carbon? Why is it powered by electrical charges on

02:04.720 --> 02:10.400
membranes? There's all these interesting questions about cells that if you then look to see, well,

02:10.400 --> 02:15.520
is there an environment on earth, on the early earth, four billion years ago that kind of matches

02:15.520 --> 02:19.520
the requirements of cells? Well, there is one. There's a very obvious one. It's basically created

02:19.520 --> 02:26.960
by whenever you have a wet rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents which generate hydrogen

02:26.960 --> 02:34.000
gas in bucket loads and electrical charges on kind of cell-like pores that can drive the kind of

02:34.080 --> 02:43.280
chemistry that life does. So it seems so beautiful and so obvious that I've spent the last 10 years

02:43.280 --> 02:47.680
or more trying to do experiments. It turns out to be difficult, of course. Everything's more

02:47.680 --> 02:51.680
difficult than you ever thought it was going to be. But it looks, I would say, more true

02:51.680 --> 02:56.080
rather than less true over that 10-year period. I think I have to take a step back every now and

02:56.080 --> 03:01.280
then and think, hang on a minute, where's this going? I'm happy it's going in a sensible direction.

03:02.240 --> 03:08.240
And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas. I mean, I'm often accused of being

03:09.760 --> 03:16.240
too focused on life on earth, too kind of narrow-minded and inward-looking, you might say.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.600
I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells, and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,

03:21.600 --> 03:26.320
ah, yeah, but life can be anything. I have no imagination. And maybe they're right. But

03:27.280 --> 03:31.920
unless we can say why life here is this way, and if those reasons are fundamental reasons,

03:31.920 --> 03:37.600
or if they're just trivial reasons, then we can't answer that question. So I think they're

03:37.600 --> 03:41.600
fundamental reasons, and I think we need to worry about them. Yeah, there might be some deep truth

03:41.600 --> 03:49.200
to the puzzle here on earth that will resonate with other puzzles elsewhere that will solving

03:49.200 --> 03:54.640
this particular puzzle will give us that deeper truth. So to this puzzle, you said

03:55.440 --> 04:06.080
vents, hydrogen, wet, so chemically, what is the potion here? How important is oxygen? You're

04:06.080 --> 04:10.320
the book about this. Yeah. And I actually just came straight here from a conference where I was

04:10.320 --> 04:14.560
chairing a session on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life. Of course, it matters.

04:15.280 --> 04:21.360
But it matters most to the origin of life to be not there. As I see it, we have this,

04:22.400 --> 04:28.800
I mean, life is made of carbon, basically, primarily, organic molecules with carbon,

04:28.800 --> 04:34.480
carbon bonds. And the building block, the Lego brick that we take out of the air or take out of

04:34.480 --> 04:40.400
the oceans is carbon dioxide. And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules, we need to strap

04:40.480 --> 04:46.880
on hydrogen. And so we need, and this is basically what life is doing, it's hydrogenating carbon

04:46.880 --> 04:50.400
dioxide, it's taking the hydrogen that bubbles out of the earth in these hydrothermal vents,

04:50.400 --> 04:56.720
and it sticks it on CO2. And it's kind of really as simple as that. And actually,

04:56.720 --> 05:03.360
thermodynamically, the thing that I find most troubling is that if you do these experiments

05:03.360 --> 05:07.840
in the lab, the molecules you get are exactly the molecules that we see at the heart of biochemistry

05:07.840 --> 05:15.520
in the heart of life. Is there something to be said about the earliest origins of that little

05:17.680 --> 05:23.280
potion, that chemical process? What really is the spark there?

05:24.640 --> 05:33.040
There isn't a spark. There is a continuous chemical reaction. And there is kind of a spark,

05:33.040 --> 05:37.360
but it's a continuous electrical charge, which helps drive that reaction.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.320
So literally spark?

05:39.840 --> 05:45.280
Well, the charge at least, but yes. I mean, a spark in that sense is we tend to think of,

05:45.280 --> 05:50.080
in terms of Frankenstein, we tend to think in terms of electricity, and one moment you zap

05:50.080 --> 05:55.280
something and it comes alive. And what does that really mean? You've come alive, and now what's

05:55.280 --> 06:02.720
sustaining it? Well, we are sustained by oxygen, by this continuous chemical reaction. And if you

06:02.720 --> 06:06.960
put a plastic bag on your head, then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.800
So it's some way of being able to leverage a source of energy?

06:10.800 --> 06:15.600
Well, the source of energy at the origin of life is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.040
And amazingly, most of these reactions are hexagonic, which is to say they release energy.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.720
If you have hydrogen and CO2, and you put them together in a falcon tube, and you warm it up

06:26.720 --> 06:30.240
to say 50 degrees centigrade, and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,

06:30.880 --> 06:37.120
nothing's going to happen. But thermodynamically, that is less stable, two gases hydrogen and CO2

06:37.120 --> 06:41.840
is less stable than cells. What should happen is you get cells coming out.

06:43.760 --> 06:48.320
So why doesn't that happen is because of the kinetic barriers is because that's why you need

06:48.320 --> 06:54.960
the spark. Is it possible that life originated multiple times on earth? The way you describe it,

06:54.960 --> 07:01.440
you make it sound so easy. There's a long distance to go from the first bits of

07:01.440 --> 07:07.520
prebiotic chemistry to say molecular machines like ribosomes. Is that the first thing that you would

07:07.520 --> 07:13.760
say is life? Like if I introduce you to the two of you at a party, you would say that's a living

07:13.760 --> 07:22.000
thing? I would say as soon as we introduce genes information into systems that are growing anyway,

07:22.000 --> 07:29.280
so I would talk about growing protocells. As soon as we introduce even random bits of

07:29.280 --> 07:35.600
information into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example, doesn't have to have

07:35.600 --> 07:40.160
any information. It can be completely random sequence. But if it's introduced into a system

07:40.160 --> 07:45.040
which is in any case growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself, then any changes in that

07:45.040 --> 07:50.720
sequence that allow it to do so better or worse are now selected by perfectly normal natural

07:50.720 --> 07:59.120
selection. So that's when it becomes alive to my mind. That's encompassed into an object

08:00.320 --> 08:05.680
that keeps information and involves that information over time or changes that information

08:05.680 --> 08:11.120
over time in response to the. So it's always part of a cell system from the very beginning.

08:11.120 --> 08:16.800
So is your sense that it started only once because it's difficult or is it possibly started

08:16.880 --> 08:22.720
multiple occasions on earth? It's possible it started multiple occasions. There's two

08:22.720 --> 08:30.320
provisos to that. One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really for life to start. So as soon

08:30.320 --> 08:35.360
as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere, then life isn't going to keep starting over. So I often get

08:35.360 --> 08:39.600
asked by people, why can't we have life starting? If it's so easy, why can't life start in these

08:39.600 --> 08:44.400
vents now? And the answer is if you want hydrogen to react with CO2 and there's oxygen there,

08:44.400 --> 08:48.640
hydrogen reacts with oxygen instead. It's just, you know, you're getting explosive reaction that

08:48.640 --> 08:53.440
way is rocket fuel. So it's never going to happen. But the other for the origin of life earlier than

08:53.440 --> 08:58.960
that, all we know is that there's a single common ancestor for all of life. There could have been

08:58.960 --> 09:05.600
multiple origins and they all just disappeared. But there's a very really interesting deep split

09:05.600 --> 09:11.120
in life between bacteria and what are called archaea, which look just the same as bacteria.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.920
And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly. And they are very different in their biochemistry.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.720
And so any explanation for the origin of life has to account as well for why they're so different

09:22.720 --> 09:28.320
and yet so similar. And that makes me think that life probably did arise only once.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.040
Can you describe the difference that's interesting there? Well, how they're similar,

09:33.040 --> 09:38.640
how they're different? Well, they're different in their membranes primarily. They're different

09:38.720 --> 09:43.200
in things like DNA replication. They use completely different enzymes and the genes behind it for

09:43.200 --> 09:49.040
replicating DNA. So they both have membranes, both have DNA replication. Yes. The process

09:49.040 --> 09:54.800
of that is different. They have, they both have DNA. The genetic code is identical in them both.

09:54.800 --> 10:01.840
The way in which it's transcribed into RNA into the copy of a gene and the way that that's then

10:01.840 --> 10:06.960
translated into a protein, that's all basically the same in both these groups. So they clearly share

10:07.040 --> 10:11.360
a common ancestor. It's just that they're different in fundamental ways as well. And if you think

10:11.360 --> 10:18.640
about, well, what kind of processes could drive that divergence very early on? I can think about

10:18.640 --> 10:23.200
these in terms of membranes, in terms of the electrical charges on membranes. And it's that

10:23.200 --> 10:28.080
that makes me think that there were probably many unsuccessful attempts and only one really

10:28.080 --> 10:34.880
successful attempt. Can you explain why that divergence makes you think there's one common

10:34.880 --> 10:40.320
ancestor? Okay, can you describe that intuition? I'm a little bit unclear about why the divert,

10:40.320 --> 10:46.880
like the leap from the divergence means there's one. Do you mean like the divergence indicates

10:46.880 --> 10:54.640
that there was a big invention at that time from one source? Yes. If you've got, as I imagine it,

10:54.640 --> 11:01.600
you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent. Let's say there are millions of vents and

11:01.600 --> 11:07.760
millions of potential common ancestors living in all of those vents, but only one of them makes it

11:07.760 --> 11:13.360
out first. Then you could imagine that that cell is then going to kind of take over the world and

11:13.360 --> 11:18.160
wipe out everything else. And so what you would see would be a single common ancestor for all of

11:18.160 --> 11:24.640
life, but with lots of different vent systems all kind of vying to create the first life forms,

11:24.640 --> 11:30.080
you might say. So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism? We're always talking about populations

11:30.080 --> 11:36.960
of cells, but yes, these are celled organisms. But the fundamental life form is a single cell,

11:37.520 --> 11:45.760
right? So they're always together, but they're alone together. There's a machinery in each

11:45.760 --> 11:53.200
one individual component that if left by itself would still work. Yes, it's the unit of selection

11:53.200 --> 11:58.320
is a single cell, but selection operates over generations and changes over generations in

11:58.320 --> 12:02.560
populations of cells. So it would be impossible to say that a cell is the unit of selection

12:02.560 --> 12:06.640
in the sense that unless you have a population, you can't evolve, you can't change.

12:07.360 --> 12:16.240
Right. But there was one Chuck Norris, it's an American reference cell that made it out of the

12:16.240 --> 12:22.560
vents, right? Or like the first one. So imagine then that there's one cell gets out and it takes

12:22.560 --> 12:26.640
over the world. It gets out in the water, it's like floating around. We're deep in the ocean

12:26.640 --> 12:34.800
somewhere. But actually two cells got out and they appear to have got out from the same vent

12:35.440 --> 12:40.080
because they both share the same code and everything else. So unless all the, you know,

12:40.080 --> 12:45.520
we've got a million different common ancestors in all these different vents. So either they all have

12:45.520 --> 12:52.560
the same code and two cells spontaneously merged from different places or two different cells,

12:52.560 --> 12:58.560
fundamentally different cells came from the same place. So either way, what are the constraints

12:58.560 --> 13:03.680
that say not just one came out or not half a million came out, but two came out? That's kind

13:03.680 --> 13:09.360
of a bit strange. So how did they come out? Well, they come out because what you're doing inside

13:09.360 --> 13:14.800
event is you're relying on the electrical charges down there to power this reaction between hydrogen

13:14.800 --> 13:19.280
and CO2 to make yourself grow. And when you leave the vent, you've got to do that yourself. You've

13:19.280 --> 13:23.680
got to power up your own membrane. And so the question is, well, how do you power up your own

13:23.680 --> 13:29.600
membrane? And the answer is, well, you need to pump, you need to pump ions to give an electrical

13:29.600 --> 13:34.480
charge on the membrane. So what do the pumps look like? Well, the pumps look different in these two

13:34.480 --> 13:39.440
groups. It says if they both emerge from a common ancestor, as soon as you've got that ancestor,

13:39.440 --> 13:46.320
things move very quickly and divergently. Why does the DNA replication look different? Well,

13:46.320 --> 13:49.680
it's joined to the membrane. The membranes are different. The DNA replication is different

13:49.680 --> 13:53.120
because it's joined to a different kind of membrane. So there's interesting,

13:54.240 --> 13:58.240
this is detail, you may say, but it's also fundamental because it's about the two

13:58.240 --> 14:02.960
big divergent groups of life on earth that seem to have diverged really early on.

14:02.960 --> 14:10.160
It all started from one organism. And then that organism just start replicating the heck out of

14:10.160 --> 14:19.280
itself with some mutation of the DNA. So there's a competition through the process of evolution.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.760
They're not like trying to beat each other up. They're just trying to live the way.

14:23.760 --> 14:28.560
They're just replicators. Yeah. Well, let's not minimize their...

14:28.560 --> 14:28.880
Yeah.

14:28.880 --> 14:33.760
They're just trying to chill. They're trying to relax up in the... But there's no sense of trying

14:33.760 --> 14:39.520
to survive. They're replicating... I mean, there's no sense in which they're trying to do anything.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.720
They're just a kind of an outgrowth of the earth, you might say.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.520
Of course, the aliens would describe us humans in that same way.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.120
They might be right.

14:47.120 --> 14:53.360
This primitive life. It's just ants that are hairless, mostly hairless.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.320
Overgrown ants.

14:54.320 --> 15:01.280
Overgrown ants. Okay. What do you think about the idea of panspermia, that the theory that

15:01.280 --> 15:08.560
life did not originate on earth and was planted here from outer space? Or pseudo panspermia,

15:08.560 --> 15:12.880
which is like the basic ingredients, the magic that you mentioned was planted here

15:12.880 --> 15:14.000
from elsewhere in space?

15:14.720 --> 15:17.280
I don't find them helpful. That's not to say they're wrong.

15:18.880 --> 15:23.920
So, pseudo panspermia, the idea that the chemicals, the amino acids, the nucleotides are

15:23.920 --> 15:27.920
being delivered from space. Well, we know that happens. It's unequivocal. They're delivered on

15:27.920 --> 15:33.040
meteorites, comets, and so on. So, what do they do next? That's to me the question.

15:33.040 --> 15:37.520
Well, what do they do is they stock a soup, like presumably they land in a pond or in an ocean or

15:37.520 --> 15:42.640
wherever they land. And then you end up with a best possible case scenario is you end up with

15:42.640 --> 15:46.560
a super-nucleotides and amino acids. And then you have to say, so now what happens? And the

15:46.560 --> 15:52.320
answer is, oh, well, they have to go become alive. So, how did they do that? You may as well say,

15:52.320 --> 16:00.080
then a miracle happened. I don't believe in soup. I think what we have in event is a continuous

16:00.080 --> 16:05.280
conversion, a continuous growth, a continuous reaction, a continuous converting a flow of

16:05.280 --> 16:09.520
molecules into more of yourself, you might say, even if it's a small bit. So, you've got

16:10.640 --> 16:15.760
a kind of continuous self-organization and growth from the very beginning. You never have that in

16:15.760 --> 16:24.080
a soup. Isn't the entire universe and living organisms in the universe? Isn't it just soup

16:24.080 --> 16:28.080
all the way down? Isn't it all soup? No, no. I mean, soup almost by definition doesn't have a

16:28.080 --> 16:34.640
structure. But soup is a collection of ingredients that are like randomly... Yeah, but they're not

16:34.640 --> 16:40.080
random. They're not. I mean, we have chemistry going on here. We have metal grains forming,

16:40.080 --> 16:44.640
which are, you know, effective oil-water interactions. Okay, so it feels like there's a

16:44.640 --> 16:49.120
direction to a process, like a directive process. There are directions to processes, yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.520
And if you're starting with CO2 and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together

16:55.520 --> 17:00.880
and they react, what are they going to make? Well, they make carboxylic acids, which include

17:00.880 --> 17:06.400
the fatty acids that make up the cell membranes. And they form directly into bilayer membranes.

17:06.400 --> 17:11.280
They form like soap bubbles. It's spontaneous organization caused by the nature of the

17:11.280 --> 17:15.840
molecules. And those things are capable of growing and are capable in effect of being

17:15.840 --> 17:20.720
selected even before there are genes. We have that. So, we have a lot of order. And that order is

17:20.720 --> 17:26.000
coming from thermodynamics. And the thermodynamics is always about increasing the entropy of the

17:26.000 --> 17:31.440
universe. But if you have oil and water and they're separating, you're increasing the entropy of

17:31.440 --> 17:36.320
the universe, even though you've got some order, which is the soap and the water are not missable.

17:36.320 --> 17:44.800
Now, to come back to your first question about panspermia properly, that just pushes the question

17:44.800 --> 17:49.600
somewhere else. That just, even if it's true, maybe life did start on earth by panspermia. But

17:49.680 --> 17:55.920
so, what are the principles that govern the emergence of life on any planet? It's an assumption

17:55.920 --> 18:02.720
that life started here. And it's an assumption that it started in a hydrothermal vent or it started

18:02.720 --> 18:07.920
in a terrestrial geothermal system. The question is, can we work out a testable sequence of events

18:07.920 --> 18:12.320
that would lead from one to the other one, and then test it and see if there's any truth in it

18:12.320 --> 18:17.760
or not? With panspermia, you can't do any of that. But the fundamental question of panspermia is,

18:17.760 --> 18:29.040
do we have the machine here on earth to build life? Is the vents enough? Is oxygen and hydrogen

18:29.600 --> 18:35.760
and whatever the heck else we want and some source of energy and heat, is that enough to build life?

18:37.280 --> 18:44.640
Well, that's, of course, you would say that as a human. But there could be aliens right now

18:44.640 --> 18:54.560
chuckling at that idea. Maybe you need some special sauce. Your sense is we have everything here.

18:54.560 --> 19:00.080
I mean, this is precisely the question. I like to, when I'm talking in schools, I like to start

19:00.080 --> 19:06.080
out with the idea of, we can make a time machine. We go back four billion years. And we go to these

19:06.080 --> 19:10.640
environments that people talk about. We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent. We go to a kind of

19:10.640 --> 19:18.000
Yellowstone Park type place environment. And we find some slime that looks like we can

19:18.000 --> 19:22.480
test it. It's made of organic molecules. It's got a structure, which is not obviously cells, but

19:24.400 --> 19:30.480
is this a stepping stone on the way to life or not? How do we know? Unless we've got an

19:30.480 --> 19:34.480
intellectual framework that says, this is a stepping stone, and that's not a step. We'd

19:34.480 --> 19:38.480
never know. We wouldn't know which environment to go to, what to look for, how to say this.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.760
So all we can ever hope for, because we're never going to build that time machine,

19:41.760 --> 19:46.880
is to have an intellectual framework that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,

19:46.880 --> 19:54.000
how we go from a sterile inorganic planet to living cells as we know them. And in that framework,

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
every time you have a choice, it could be this way, or it could be that way, or there's lots of

19:58.720 --> 20:05.120
possible forks down that road. Did it have to be that way? Could it have been the other way,

20:05.200 --> 20:07.600
and would that have given you life with very different properties?

20:08.880 --> 20:13.920
And so if you come up with a, it's a long hypothesis, because as I say, we're going from

20:13.920 --> 20:18.000
really simple prebiotic chemistry all the way through to genes and molecular machines. That's

20:18.000 --> 20:22.960
a long, long pathway, and nobody in the field would agree on the order in which these things

20:22.960 --> 20:26.800
happened, which is not a bad thing, because it means that you have to go out and do some experiments

20:26.800 --> 20:29.840
and try and demonstrate that it's possible or not possible.

20:29.840 --> 20:40.960
It's so freaking amazing that it happened though. It feels like there's a direction to the thing.

20:41.920 --> 20:49.280
Can you try to answer from a framework perspective of what is life?

20:51.040 --> 20:59.040
So you said there's some order, and yet there's complexity. So it's not perfectly ordered.

20:59.040 --> 21:05.120
It's not boring. There's still some fun in it. And it also feels like the processes have a direction

21:06.240 --> 21:13.040
through the selection mechanism. They seem to be building something always better, always

21:13.040 --> 21:18.080
improving. I mean, maybe it's- I mean, that's a perception. That's our romanticization of

21:18.080 --> 21:22.800
things are always better. Things are getting better. We'd like to believe that.

21:22.800 --> 21:26.720
I mean, you think about the world from the point of view of bacteria, and bacteria are the first

21:26.720 --> 21:31.680
things to emerge from whatever environment they came from, and they dominated the planet very,

21:31.680 --> 21:36.640
very quickly. And they haven't really changed. Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.

21:36.640 --> 21:43.680
So if about four billion years ago, bacteria started to really run the show, and then nothing

21:43.680 --> 21:48.080
happened for a while. Nothing happened for two billion years. Then after two billion years,

21:48.080 --> 21:53.920
we see another single event origin, if you like, of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells,

21:54.000 --> 21:58.800
cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside. Another singular origin, it only

21:59.360 --> 22:02.880
happened once in the history of life on Earth. Maybe it happened multiple times, and there's no

22:02.880 --> 22:08.080
evidence, everything just disappeared. But we have to at least take it seriously, that there's

22:08.720 --> 22:14.400
something that stops bacteria from becoming more complex, because they didn't. That's a fact that

22:14.400 --> 22:19.920
they emerged four billion years ago, and something happened two billion years ago, but the bacteria

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
themselves didn't change. They remain bacterial. So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory

22:26.000 --> 22:30.400
towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it. It's very easy to imagine that without

22:30.400 --> 22:34.880
photosynthesis arising, or without eukaryotes arising, that a planet could be full of bacteria

22:34.880 --> 22:39.840
and nothing else. We'll get to that, because that's a brilliant invention. And there's a few

22:39.840 --> 22:46.240
brilliant invention along the way. But what is life? If you were to show up on Earth, but to

22:46.320 --> 22:51.440
take that time machine, and you said, asking yourself the question, is this a stepping stone

22:51.440 --> 22:58.160
towards life? As you step along, when you see the early bacteria, how would you know it's life?

23:00.320 --> 23:03.920
This is really important question when you go to other planets and look for life.

23:06.320 --> 23:11.520
What is the framework of telling a difference between a rock and a bacteria?

23:12.160 --> 23:16.480
I mean, the question's kind of both impossible to answer and trivial at the same time,

23:16.480 --> 23:20.560
and I don't like to answer it, because I don't think there is an answer. I think we're trying to

23:20.560 --> 23:27.760
describe the process at the same time. There's lots of at least 40 or 50 different definitions

23:27.760 --> 23:33.760
of life out there, and most of them are obviously bad in one way or another.

23:34.320 --> 23:40.800
I mean, there's freaks. I can never remember the exact words that people use, but there's a NASA

23:41.680 --> 23:48.400
working definition of life, which more or less says a system which is capable of a

23:48.400 --> 23:51.680
self-sustaining system capable of evolution or something along those lines.

23:52.560 --> 23:57.600
And I immediately have a problem with the words self-sustaining, because it's sustained by the

23:57.600 --> 24:02.400
environment. And I know what they're getting at. I know what they're trying to say, but I pick a

24:02.400 --> 24:07.360
hole in that. And there's always wags who say, but by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.160
Only a pair of rabbits would be alive, because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.

24:12.720 --> 24:19.040
There are all kinds of pedantic, silly, but also important, objections to any hypothesis.

24:19.040 --> 24:25.200
The real question is what is... We can argue all day, or people do argue all day about,

24:25.200 --> 24:30.880
is a virus alive or not? And it depends on the content. But most biologists could not agree

24:30.880 --> 24:34.160
about that. So then what about a jumping gene, a retro element or something like that? It's even

24:34.160 --> 24:41.520
simpler than a virus, but it's capable of converting its environment into a copy of itself.

24:42.960 --> 24:46.880
And that's about as close... This is not a definition, but this is a kind of a description of life,

24:47.440 --> 24:54.160
is that it's able to parasitize the environment, and that goes for plants as well as animals and

24:54.160 --> 25:02.320
bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy of themselves, information on the

25:02.320 --> 25:08.000
exact copy of themselves. By the way, it doesn't really have to be a copy of itself, right? It just

25:08.000 --> 25:17.200
has to be... You have to create something that's interesting. The way evolution is... So it is

25:17.200 --> 25:23.280
extremely powerful process of evolution, which is basically make a copy yourself and sometimes mess

25:23.280 --> 25:27.680
up a little bit. Okay, that seems to work really well. I wonder if it's possible to

25:28.400 --> 25:33.760
mess up big time as a standard, as the default. It's called a hopeful monster. And

25:35.840 --> 25:41.840
in principle, it can. Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due a reemergence. This

25:41.840 --> 25:45.440
is some amazing work from Michael Levin. I don't know if you came across him, but

25:46.240 --> 25:52.800
if you haven't interviewed him, you should interview him. Yeah, yeah, I'm talking to him in

25:52.800 --> 26:00.160
a few days. Oh, fantastic. So I mentioned there's two people that, if I may mention,

26:00.880 --> 26:06.560
Andre Capati is a friend who's really admired in the AI community, said you absolutely must talk

26:07.200 --> 26:13.520
to Michael and to Nick. So this, of course, I'm a huge fan of yours, so I'm really fortunate

26:13.520 --> 26:18.640
that we can actually make this happen. Anyway, your second. Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work

26:19.280 --> 26:23.200
basically about the way in which electrical fields control development.

26:24.720 --> 26:29.120
And he's done some work with planarian worms, so flatworms, where he'll tell you all about

26:29.120 --> 26:32.640
this. So I won't say any more than the minimum, but basically you can cut their head off and they'll

26:32.640 --> 26:38.880
redevelop a different, a new head. But the head that they develop depends if you knock out just one

26:41.280 --> 26:45.200
iron pump in a membrane, so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,

26:45.280 --> 26:50.080
you can come up with a completely different head. It can be a head which is similar to those that

26:50.080 --> 26:54.640
diverged 150 million years ago, or it can be a head which no one's ever seen before, a different

26:54.640 --> 27:00.880
kind of head. Now, that is really, you might say a hopeful monster. This is a kind of leap into a

27:00.880 --> 27:06.160
different direction. The only question for natural selection is, does it work? Is the change itself

27:06.720 --> 27:10.960
feasible as a single change? And the answer is yes, it's just a small change to a single gene.

27:11.040 --> 27:14.800
And the second thing is it gives rise to a completely different morphology.

27:14.800 --> 27:23.440
Does it work? And if it works, that can easily be a shift. But for it to be a speciation, for it to

27:24.400 --> 27:31.920
continue, for it to give rise to a different morphology over time, then it has to be perpetuated.

27:31.920 --> 27:40.400
So that shift, that change in that one gene has to work well enough that it is selected and it

27:40.400 --> 27:45.680
goes on. And copied enough times to where you can really test it. So the likelihood it would be

27:45.680 --> 27:50.320
lost, but there will be some occasions where it survives. And yes, the idea that we can have

27:50.320 --> 27:56.560
sudden fairly abrupt changes in evolution I think is time for a rebirth. What about this idea that

27:57.520 --> 28:05.040
kind of trying to mathematicalize a definition of life and saying how many steps, the shortest

28:05.040 --> 28:08.880
amount of steps it takes to build the thing, almost like an engineering view of it?

28:10.160 --> 28:16.160
I like that view, because I think that in a sense that's not very far away from what a

28:16.160 --> 28:20.400
hypothesis needs to do to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life. You need to spell out,

28:20.400 --> 28:26.480
here's each step, and here's the experiment to do for each step. The idea that we can do it in the

28:26.480 --> 28:31.680
lab, some people say, well, we'll have created life within five years, but ask them what they

28:31.680 --> 28:38.880
mean by life. We have a planet four billion years ago with these vent systems across the entire

28:38.880 --> 28:42.720
surface of the planet, and we have millions of years if we wanted. I have a feeling that we're

28:42.720 --> 28:47.920
not talking about millions of years. I have a feeling we're talking about maybe millions of

28:47.920 --> 28:52.080
nanoseconds or picoseconds. We're talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.

28:53.840 --> 29:00.960
But we still need to constrain those steps, but we've got a planet doing similar chemistry. You

29:00.960 --> 29:06.480
asked about a trajectory. The trajectory is the planetary trajectory. The planet has properties.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.920
See, it's basically got a lot of iron at the center of it. It's got a lot of electrons at the

29:09.920 --> 29:14.640
center of it. It's more oxidized on the outside, partly because of the sun, and partly because

29:14.640 --> 29:20.480
the heat of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases. The planet is a battery, it's a giant battery.

29:22.080 --> 29:26.480
We have a flow of electrons going from inside to outside in these hydrothermal vents, and that's

29:26.480 --> 29:32.560
the same topology that a cell has. A cell is basically just a microversion of the planet.

29:35.360 --> 29:39.840
There is a trajectory in all of that, and there's an inevitability that certain types of chemical

29:39.840 --> 29:46.160
reaction are going to be favored over others. There's an inevitability in what happens in water,

29:46.160 --> 29:51.840
the chemistry that happens in water. Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes and

29:51.840 --> 30:00.080
will form insoluble structures. Nobody really understands water very well. It's another big

30:00.080 --> 30:05.600
question for experiments on the origin of life. What do you put it in? What kind of structure do

30:05.600 --> 30:10.880
we want to induce in this water? Because the last thing it's likely to be is just bulk water.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.240
How fundamental is water to life, would you say?

30:14.240 --> 30:20.960
I would say pretty fundamental. I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life to start any other

30:20.960 --> 30:30.160
way, but water is everywhere. Water is extremely good at what it does, and carbon works in water

30:30.160 --> 30:35.600
especially well. Carbon is everywhere. Those things together make me think probabilistically,

30:35.600 --> 30:41.120
if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them would be carbon-based and living in water.

30:41.920 --> 30:47.280
Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water elsewhere and some carbon,

30:48.000 --> 30:53.680
no, just a puddle of water. Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication that life

30:55.600 --> 31:03.840
either exists here or has once existed here? No. So it doesn't work the other way.

31:05.280 --> 31:10.720
I think you need a living planet. You need a planet which is capable of turning over its surface. It

31:10.720 --> 31:17.360
needs to be a planet with water. It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons from inside

31:17.360 --> 31:21.920
to the outside. It needs to turn over its surface. It needs to make that water work and turn it into

31:21.920 --> 31:26.160
hydrogen. So I think you need a living planet. But once you've got the living planet, I think the

31:26.160 --> 31:32.480
rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way. So if you were to run Earth over a million times,

31:33.040 --> 31:41.600
up to this point, maybe beyond, to the end. Let's run it to the end. What is it? How much

31:41.600 --> 31:47.280
variety is there? You kind of spoke to this trajectory that the environment dictates

31:48.240 --> 31:56.320
like chemically, I don't know in which other way, spiritually, like dictates kind of the

31:56.320 --> 32:04.000
direction of this giant machine that seems chaotic, but it does seem to have order in the

32:04.000 --> 32:12.400
steps it's taking. How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge? How often will something

32:12.400 --> 32:17.200
like humans emerge? How much variety do you think there would be? I think at the level of bacteria,

32:17.920 --> 32:22.800
not much variety. I think we would get, that's how many times you say you want to run it a

32:22.800 --> 32:27.840
million times. I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.

32:29.360 --> 32:34.160
Because I think there's some level of inevitability that a wet rocky planet will give rise through

32:35.200 --> 32:41.040
the same processes to something very, I think this is not something I'd have thought a few years ago,

32:41.040 --> 32:45.200
but we're working with a PhD student of mine, Stuart Harrison. He's been thinking about the

32:45.200 --> 32:50.960
genetic code, and we've just been publishing on that. There are patterns that you can discern

32:51.040 --> 32:56.480
in the code, or he has discerned in the code, that if you think about them in terms of we start

32:56.480 --> 33:00.720
with CO2 and hydrogen, and that these are the first steps of biochemistry, you come up with a code

33:00.720 --> 33:06.000
which is very similar to the code that we see. It wouldn't surprise me any longer if we found

33:06.000 --> 33:10.400
life on Mars and it had a genetic code that was not very different to the genetic code that we have

33:10.400 --> 33:16.160
here without it just being transferred across. There's some inevitability about the whole of

33:16.160 --> 33:22.480
the beginnings of life in my view. That's really promising because if the basic chemistry is tightly

33:22.480 --> 33:30.400
linked to the genetic code, that means we can interact with other life if it exists out there.

33:30.400 --> 33:36.000
Well, that's potentially... That's really exciting if that's the case. Okay, but then bacteria...

33:36.000 --> 33:43.920
We've got bacteria. How easy is photosynthesis? Much harder, I would say.

33:44.800 --> 33:51.600
Let's actually go there. Let's go through the inventions. What is photosynthesis and why is

33:51.600 --> 33:57.680
it hard? Well, there are different forms. Basically, you're taking hydrogen and you're

33:57.680 --> 34:01.920
sticking it onto CO2 and it's powered by the sun. The question is where are you taking the hydrogen

34:01.920 --> 34:07.600
from? And in photosynthesis that we know in plants, it's coming from water. So you're using the power

34:07.600 --> 34:12.400
of the sun to split water, take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2, and the oxygen is a waste

34:12.400 --> 34:18.800
product and you just throw it out, throw it away. So it's the single greatest planetary pollution

34:18.800 --> 34:25.520
event in the whole history of the earth. The pollutant being oxygen. Yes. It also made possible

34:25.520 --> 34:30.480
animals. You can't have large active animals without an oxygenated atmosphere, at least not

34:31.600 --> 34:36.000
in the sense that we know on earth. So that's a really big invention in the history of earth.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.880
Huge invention, yes. And it happened once. There's a few things that happen once on earth and you're

34:40.880 --> 34:45.520
always stuck with this problem. Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly that it precluded

34:45.520 --> 34:50.480
the same thing happening ever again? Or are there other reasons? And we really have to look at each

34:50.480 --> 34:57.600
one in turn and think, why did it only happen once? In this case, it's really difficult to split

34:57.600 --> 35:02.160
water. It requires a lot of power and that power, you're effectively separating charge across a

35:02.160 --> 35:07.040
membrane and the way in which you do it, if it doesn't all rush back and kind of cause an explosion

35:07.040 --> 35:14.720
right at the site, requires really careful wiring. And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right

35:14.720 --> 35:21.040
because the plants that we see around us, they have chloroplasts. Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria

35:21.040 --> 35:25.760
ones. Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria that can do that type of photosynthesis.

35:25.760 --> 35:31.840
So there's plenty of opportunity. So not even many bacteria. So who invented photosynthesis?

35:32.080 --> 35:34.960
The cyanobacteria or their ancestors. And there's not many...

35:36.000 --> 35:41.520
No other bacteria can do what's called oxygenic photosynthesis. Lots of other bacteria can split.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.760
You can take your hydrogen from somewhere else. You can take it from hydrogen sulfide bubbling

35:45.760 --> 35:50.800
out of a hydrothermal vent, grab your two. Hydrogens, the sulfur is the waste now.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
You can do it from iron. You can take electrons. So the early oceans were probably full of iron.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.680
You can take an electron from ferrous iron, so iron 2 plus and make it iron 3 plus,

36:01.680 --> 36:07.600
which now precipitates as rust. And you take a proton from the acidic early ocean,

36:07.600 --> 36:12.240
stick it there. Now you've got a hydrogen atom, stick it onto CO2. You've just done the trick.

36:12.240 --> 36:18.480
The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron. And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.

36:18.480 --> 36:23.280
One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis is so much better is the waste product is oxygen,

36:23.280 --> 36:30.320
which just bubbles away. That seems like extremely unlikely. And it's extremely

36:30.320 --> 36:34.880
essential for the evolution of complex organisms because of all the oxygen.

36:36.080 --> 36:42.000
Yeah. And that didn't accumulate quickly either. So it's converting, what is it?

36:42.000 --> 36:49.200
It's converting energy from the sun and the resource of water into the resource needed for

36:49.200 --> 36:54.480
animals. Both resources needed for animals. We need to eat and we need to burn the food.

36:54.480 --> 37:00.480
And we're eating plants, which are getting their energy from the sun, and we're burning it with

37:00.480 --> 37:04.560
their waste product, which is the oxygen. So there's a lot of kind of circularity in that.

37:04.560 --> 37:14.880
But without an oxygenated planet, you couldn't really have predation. You can have animals,

37:14.880 --> 37:18.640
but you can't really have animals that go around and eat each other. You can't have ecosystems,

37:18.640 --> 37:24.320
as we know them. Well, let's actually step back. What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells,

37:24.320 --> 37:29.840
prokaryotes? What are each of those and how big of an invention is that?

37:30.960 --> 37:34.800
I personally think that's the single biggest invention in the whole history of life.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.600
Exciting. So what are they? Can you explain?

37:37.600 --> 37:41.920
Yeah. So I mentioned bacteria and archaea. These are both prokaryotes.

37:42.960 --> 37:46.960
They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus. If you look at them under a microscope,

37:46.960 --> 37:50.560
you don't see much going on. If you look at them under a super resolution microscope,

37:50.560 --> 37:55.440
then they're fantastically complex. In terms of their molecular machinery, they're amazing.

37:55.440 --> 38:00.320
In terms of their morphological appearance under a microscope, they're really small

38:01.440 --> 38:05.600
and really simple. The earliest life that we can physically see on the planet are

38:05.600 --> 38:10.960
stromatolites, which are made by things like cyanobacteria and their large superstructures.

38:10.960 --> 38:17.280
Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other and you end up with quite large structures

38:17.280 --> 38:22.960
that you can see in the fossil record. But they never came out with animals.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.560
They never came out with plants. They came out with multicellular things,

38:26.560 --> 38:30.800
filamentous cyanobacteria, for example. They're just long strings of cells.

38:31.360 --> 38:37.200
But the origin of the eukaryotic cell seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis.

38:37.360 --> 38:43.360
So one cell gets inside another cell. I think that that's transformed the energetic possibilities

38:43.360 --> 38:49.360
of life. So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell, which can have a much larger

38:49.920 --> 38:56.240
nucleus with many more genes, all supported. If you think about it, you could think about it as

38:56.240 --> 39:00.320
multi-bacterial power without the overhead. So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria

39:00.320 --> 39:04.960
living in it. And those bacteria are providing it with the energy currency it needs. But each

39:04.960 --> 39:11.760
bacterium has a genome of its own, which costs a fair amount of energy to express, to kind of turn

39:11.760 --> 39:17.200
over and convert into proteins and so on. What the mitochondria did, which are these

39:18.240 --> 39:23.760
power packs in our own cells, they were bacteria once and they threw away virtually all their

39:23.760 --> 39:29.120
genes. They've only got a few left. So mitochondria is, like you said, is the bacteria that got inside

39:29.120 --> 39:34.240
a cell and then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to survive inside the cell and then

39:34.240 --> 39:40.560
kept what? So what we end up with, so it kept always a handful of genes in our own case, 37 genes.

39:41.440 --> 39:46.880
But there's a few protists, which are single cells, things that have got as many as 70 or 80

39:46.880 --> 39:52.800
genes. So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number. And you can think of it as a

39:52.800 --> 39:58.720
paired down power pack where the control unit has really been kind of paired down to almost nothing.

39:58.720 --> 40:03.760
So you're putting out the same power, but the investment in the overheads is really paired

40:03.760 --> 40:09.680
down. That means that you can support a much larger nuclear genome. So we've gone up in the

40:09.680 --> 40:13.840
number of genes, but also the amount of power you have to convert those genes into proteins.

40:14.800 --> 40:19.280
We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes, but in terms of the size of genomes and

40:19.280 --> 40:24.000
your ability to make the building blocks, make the proteins, we've gone up a hundred thousand

40:24.000 --> 40:31.200
fold or more. So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution. And it's interesting

40:31.200 --> 40:36.400
then that the only, the only two occasions that complex life has arisen on earth, plants and

40:36.400 --> 40:43.120
animals, fungi, you could say are complex as well, but they don't form such complex morphology as

40:43.120 --> 40:49.120
plants and animals. Start with a single cell. They start with an oocyte and a sperm fused together

40:49.120 --> 40:54.080
to make as I got. So you start development with a single cell and all the cells in the organism

40:54.080 --> 40:59.920
have identical DNA. And you switch off in the brain, you switch off these genes and you switch on

40:59.920 --> 41:02.720
those genes and the liver, you switch off those and you switch on a different set.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.520
And the standard evolutionary explanation for that is that you've, you know, you're

41:07.520 --> 41:11.840
restricting conflict. You don't have a load of genetically different cells that are all fighting

41:11.840 --> 41:17.280
each other. And so it works. The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms and they're

41:17.280 --> 41:22.480
all genetically different. And effectively, they're incapable of that level of cooperation.

41:23.200 --> 41:29.760
They would get in the fight. Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention

41:31.120 --> 41:38.000
of getting this bacteria inside and becoming an engine, which the mitochondria is? Why was that?

41:38.000 --> 41:42.080
Why do you assign it such great importance? Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty

41:42.080 --> 41:46.800
of how was to achieve a great importance in terms of the impact they had on life?

41:46.880 --> 41:54.080
Both. It had a huge impact on life because if that had not happened, you can be certain

41:54.080 --> 41:58.080
that life on earth would be bacterial only. And that took a really long time to...

41:58.080 --> 42:02.640
It took two billion years. And it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge.

42:02.640 --> 42:07.280
So it looks as if it's genuinely difficult. And if you think about it then from just an

42:07.280 --> 42:14.240
informational perspective, you think bacteria have got, they structure their information

42:14.240 --> 42:18.960
differently. So a bacterial cell has a small genome, you might have 4,000 genes in it,

42:18.960 --> 42:24.640
but a single E. coli cell has access to about 30,000 genes. Potentially, it's got a kind of

42:24.640 --> 42:29.840
metagenome where other E. coli out there have got different gene sets and they can switch them

42:29.840 --> 42:36.160
around between themselves. And so you can generate a huge amount of variation and they've got more...

42:36.160 --> 42:42.640
An E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome. We own 20,000 genes or something.

42:43.200 --> 42:49.920
So... And they've had 4 billion years of evolution to work out what can I do and what can't I do

42:49.920 --> 42:54.240
with this metagenome. And the answer is you're stuck. You're still bacteria.

42:54.240 --> 43:01.200
So they have explored genetic sequence space far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did

43:01.200 --> 43:05.840
because they've had twice as long at least and they've got much larger populations.

43:05.840 --> 43:10.640
And they never got around this problem. So why can't they? It seems as if you can't solve it

43:10.640 --> 43:18.640
with information alone. So what's the problem? The problem is structure. If cells...

43:18.640 --> 43:22.080
If the very first cells need an electrical charge on their membrane to grow

43:22.880 --> 43:27.520
and in bacteria, it's the outer membrane that surrounds the cell, which is electrically charged.

43:28.160 --> 43:32.240
You try and scale that up and you've got a fundamental design problem. You've got an

43:32.240 --> 43:37.280
engineering problem. And there are examples of it and what we see in all these cases is what's

43:37.280 --> 43:41.200
known as extreme polyploidy, which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies of their

43:41.200 --> 43:49.200
complete genome, which is energetically hugely expensive and you end up with a large bacteria with

43:50.240 --> 43:56.800
no further development. What you need is to incorporate these electrically charged power

43:56.800 --> 44:03.200
pack units inside with their control units intact. And for them not to conflict so much

44:03.200 --> 44:07.840
with the host cell that it all goes wrong. Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.

44:07.840 --> 44:14.160
And then you change the topology of the cell. Now, you don't necessarily have any more DNA

44:14.160 --> 44:19.840
than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy. But what you've got is an asymmetry. You now have a

44:19.840 --> 44:26.640
giant nuclear genome surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes that do all the...

44:26.640 --> 44:31.520
And they're the control units that are doing all the control of energy generation.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.200
Could this have been done gradually or does it have to be done?

44:36.000 --> 44:40.080
The power pack has to be all intact and ready to go and work.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.760
I mean, it's a kind of step change in the possibilities of evolution, but it doesn't

44:43.760 --> 44:49.360
happen overnight. It's going to still require multiple, multiple generations. So it could take

44:49.360 --> 44:53.360
millions of years. It could take shorter time. This is another thing I would like to put the

44:53.360 --> 44:57.520
number of steps and try and work out what's required at each step. And we are trying to do

44:57.520 --> 45:02.160
that with sex for example. You can't have a very large genome unless you have sex at that point.

45:02.160 --> 45:06.800
So what are the changes to go from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?

45:08.320 --> 45:13.040
What do you need to do? Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA as if it's loose

45:13.040 --> 45:18.560
change to fusing cells together, lining up the chromosomes, recombining across the chromosomes

45:18.560 --> 45:23.520
and then going through two rounds of cell division to produce your gametes? All eukaryotes do it that

45:23.520 --> 45:30.400
way. So again, why switch? What are the drivers here? So there's a lot of time, there's a lot of

45:30.400 --> 45:35.680
evolution, but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell, what you've got is a new

45:35.680 --> 45:42.000
design. You've got new potential that you didn't have before. So the cell living inside another cell,

45:42.000 --> 45:52.640
that design allows for better storage of information, better use of energy, more delegation,

45:52.720 --> 45:58.640
like a hierarchical control of the whole thing. And then somehow that leads to ability to have

45:58.640 --> 46:03.920
multi-cell organisms. I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily, but you've

46:03.920 --> 46:09.920
got a system where you can have a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus. You

46:09.920 --> 46:16.000
can have a much larger genome. And that allows multicellularity, yes, because it allows you...

46:16.960 --> 46:25.120
It's a funny thing, but to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes switched on in my brain

46:25.120 --> 46:29.680
and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something, you've got to have all those genes

46:29.680 --> 46:35.360
in the egg cell at the very beginning. And you've got to have a program of development

46:35.360 --> 46:39.200
which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes and switch on those genes and you guys,

46:39.200 --> 46:42.880
you do that. But all the genes are there at the beginning. That means you've got to have a lot

46:42.960 --> 46:46.800
of genes in one cell and you've got to be able to maintain them. And the problem with bacteria is

46:46.800 --> 46:51.600
they don't get close to having enough genes in one cell. So if you were to try and make a

46:51.600 --> 46:55.680
multicellular organism from bacteria, you'd bring different types of bacteria together and hope

46:55.680 --> 47:00.480
they'll cooperate and the reality is they don't. That's really, really tough to do. Yeah. We know

47:00.480 --> 47:05.360
they don't because it doesn't exist. We have the data, as far as we know. I'm sure there's a few

47:05.360 --> 47:10.480
like special ones and they get off quickly. I'd love to know some of the most fun things bacteria

47:10.480 --> 47:17.120
have done since. I mean, they can do some pretty funky things. This is big, this is broad brush

47:17.120 --> 47:24.160
joke that I'm talking about. Yes, generally speaking. So how was another fun invention?

47:24.960 --> 47:30.800
Us humans seem to utilize it well, but you say it's also very important early on is sex.

47:31.600 --> 47:38.800
So what is sex? Just asking for a friend. And when was it invented and how hard was it

47:38.800 --> 47:44.800
to invent? Just as you were saying, and why was it invented? Why, how hard was it and when?

47:45.600 --> 47:49.600
I have a PhD student who's been working on this and we've just published a couple of papers on

47:49.600 --> 47:54.640
sex. Yes, yes, yes. What do you publish? Does biology? Is it biology, genetics, journals?

47:55.440 --> 48:00.080
This is actually PNAS, which is Proceedings of the National Academy.

48:00.080 --> 48:07.120
Broad, big pictures. Everyone's interested in sex. The job of biologist is to make sex dull.

48:07.440 --> 48:12.240
Yes. Yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it. Okay. So when was it invented?

48:13.120 --> 48:20.240
It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago. All eukaryotes share the same basic

48:20.240 --> 48:25.280
mechanism that you produce gametes. The gametes fuse together. So a gamete is the egg cell and

48:25.280 --> 48:31.680
the sperm. They're not necessarily even different in size or shape. So the simplest eukaryotes produce

48:31.680 --> 48:35.200
what are called motile gametes. They're all like sperm and they all swim around. They find

48:35.200 --> 48:39.920
each other. They fuse together. They don't have kind of much going on there beyond that.

48:39.920 --> 48:47.200
And then these are haploid, which is to say we all have two copies of our genome and the gametes

48:47.200 --> 48:51.840
have only a single copy of the genome. So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,

48:51.840 --> 48:57.520
which is to say you now have two copies of your genome. And what you do is you line them all up

48:58.880 --> 49:03.840
and then you double everything. So now we have four copies of the complete genome.

49:03.920 --> 49:07.600
And then we crisscross between all of these things. So we take a bit from here and stick it on there

49:07.600 --> 49:13.840
and a bit from here and we stick it on here. That's recombination. And then we go through two rounds

49:13.840 --> 49:18.400
of cell division. So we divide in half. So now the two daughter cells have two copies and we

49:18.400 --> 49:23.440
divide in half again. Now we have some gametes, each of which has got a single copy of the genome.

49:24.400 --> 49:30.880
And that's the basic ground plan for what's called meiosis and syngamy. That's basically sex.

49:31.520 --> 49:35.120
And it happens at the level of single-celled organisms and it happens pretty much the same

49:35.120 --> 49:39.680
way in plants and pretty much the same way in animals and so on. And it's not found in any bacteria.

49:40.240 --> 49:44.160
They switch things around using the same machinery and they take up a bit of DNA

49:44.160 --> 49:48.160
from the environment. They take out this bit and stick in that bit and it's the same molecular

49:48.160 --> 49:52.640
machinery they're using to do it. So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,

49:52.640 --> 49:59.600
this kind of imperative to find each other. What is that? Like is that? Well, you've got a few cells

49:59.600 --> 50:07.200
together. So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria. I mean, it's kind of simple when you've

50:07.200 --> 50:11.520
figured it out and figuring it out. This is not me. This is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.

50:12.960 --> 50:20.080
And in effect, if you're doing lateral, you're a Nikolaicel. You've got 4,000 genes. You want to

50:20.080 --> 50:27.680
scale up to a eukaryotic size. I want to have 20,000 genes. And I need to maintain my genome

50:27.680 --> 50:32.720
so it doesn't get shot to pieces by mutations. And I'm going to do it by lateral gene transfer.

50:32.720 --> 50:38.800
So I know I've got a mutation in a gene. I don't know which gene it is because I'm not sentient,

50:38.800 --> 50:43.200
but I know I can't grow. I know all my regulation systems are saying something wrong here,

50:43.200 --> 50:46.560
something wrong. Pick up some DNA. Pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.

50:47.680 --> 50:51.200
If you've got a small genome, the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA from the

50:51.200 --> 50:56.400
environment is much higher than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes. To do that, you've

50:56.400 --> 51:00.640
effectively got to be picking up DNA all the time, all day long, and nothing else. And you're

51:00.640 --> 51:04.320
still going to get the wrong DNA. You've got to pick up large chunks. And in the end, you've got

51:04.320 --> 51:17.440
to align them. You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase. So there is a kind of incentive.

51:18.560 --> 51:22.640
If you want to have a large genome, you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.

51:22.640 --> 51:26.880
That will happen with bacteria. There's another reason why bacteria can't have a large genome.

51:26.880 --> 51:30.320
But as soon as you give them the power pack, as soon as you give you carotid cells the power pack

51:30.320 --> 51:34.640
that allows them to increase the size of their genome, then you face the pressure that you've

51:34.640 --> 51:38.240
got to maintain its quality. You've got to stop it just mutating away.

51:38.240 --> 51:45.840
What about sexual selection? So the finding, I don't like this one. I don't like this one. This

51:45.840 --> 51:52.320
one seems all right. At which point does it become less random?

51:52.720 --> 51:55.920
It's hard to know. Because eukaryotes just float around.

51:55.920 --> 52:01.120
I mean, is there sexual selection in single celled eukaryotes? The probably is. It's just

52:01.120 --> 52:03.440
that I don't know very much about it. By the time we get on to it.

52:03.440 --> 52:08.560
If you don't hang out with the eukaryotes. Well, I do all the time, but I can't communicate with

52:08.560 --> 52:16.480
them yet. A peacock or something. This is not quite what I work on, but the standard answer

52:17.280 --> 52:24.880
is that it's female mate choice. She is looking for good genes. If you can have a tail that's like

52:24.880 --> 52:29.840
this and still survive, still be alive, not actually have been taken down by the nearest

52:29.840 --> 52:33.680
predator, then you must have got pretty good genes. Because despite this handicap,

52:34.560 --> 52:38.160
you're able to survive. So those are like human interpretable things,

52:38.160 --> 52:42.160
like with a peacock. But I wonder, I'm sure echos of the same thing

52:42.960 --> 52:50.160
are there with more primitive organisms. Basically, your PR, like how you advertise

52:50.160 --> 52:57.040
yourself that you're worthy of. So one big advertisement is the fact that you survived

52:57.040 --> 53:05.440
it all. Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom. And this can be a cyanobacteria.

53:05.440 --> 53:11.120
It's going to be in bacteria. So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate or something

53:11.120 --> 53:16.720
into the ocean and everything goes green, you end up with all this algae growing there.

53:18.080 --> 53:22.640
A viral infection or something like that can kill the entire bloom overnight.

53:23.200 --> 53:28.480
And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight. It's that most of the cells in that

53:28.480 --> 53:33.680
bloom kill themselves before the virus can get onto them. And it's through a form of cell death

53:33.680 --> 53:37.680
called programmed cell death. And we do the same things. This is how we have the different,

53:37.920 --> 53:42.000
the gaps between our fingers and so on is how we craft synapses in the brain.

53:43.520 --> 53:50.480
It's fundamental again to multicellular life. They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.

53:51.200 --> 53:57.600
How do they know who dies? The answer is they will often put out a toxin. And that toxin

53:58.240 --> 54:04.400
is kind of a challenge to you. Either you can cope with the toxin or you can't. If you can cope with

54:04.400 --> 54:11.120
it, you form a spore and you will go on to become the next generation. You form a kind of a resistance

54:11.120 --> 54:17.600
spore. You sink down a little bit. You get out of the way. You can't be attacked by a virus if

54:17.600 --> 54:22.400
you're a spore or at least not so easily. Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin, you pull the

54:22.400 --> 54:28.560
plug and you trigger your death apparatus and you kill yourself. It's truly life and death

54:29.120 --> 54:34.080
solution. Yeah. So it's really, it's a challenge. And this is a bit like sexual selection. It's not

54:34.480 --> 54:39.520
they're all pretty much genetically identical, but they've had different life histories. So

54:39.520 --> 54:45.440
have you had a tough day? Did you happen to get infected by this virus or did you run out of iron

54:45.440 --> 54:51.280
or did you get a bit too much sun? Whatever it may be, if this extra stress of the toxin just

54:51.280 --> 54:55.120
pushes you over the edge, then you have this binary choice. Either you're the next generation

54:55.120 --> 55:00.000
or you kill yourself now using the same machinery. It's also actually exactly the way I approach

55:00.000 --> 55:06.400
dating, but that's probably why I'm single. Okay. What about if we can step back DNA?

55:07.280 --> 55:13.760
Just mechanism of storing information. RNA, DNA. Yeah. How big of an invention was that? That seems

55:13.760 --> 55:23.280
to be, that seems to be fundamental to like something deep within what life is, is the ability,

55:23.280 --> 55:29.360
as you said, to kind of store and propagate information. But then you also kind of infer

55:29.920 --> 55:35.440
with your and your students' work that there's a deep connection between the chemistry and the

55:35.440 --> 55:42.800
ability to have this kind of genetic information. So how big of an invention is it to have a nice

55:42.800 --> 55:48.640
representation, a nice hard drive for info to pass on? Huge, I suspect. I mean, but

55:49.200 --> 55:54.320
when I was talking about the code, you see the code in RNA as well. And RNA almost certainly came

55:54.320 --> 56:01.440
first. And there's been an idea going back decades called the RNA world because RNA in theory can

56:02.000 --> 56:07.200
copy itself and can catalyze reactions. So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.

56:07.760 --> 56:12.640
The DNA, it's possible, is not that special. So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work,

56:12.640 --> 56:18.240
really. And the code lies in RNA. The code lies in the interactions between RNA and amino acids.

56:18.240 --> 56:23.680
And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example, which is just kind of a giant ribosome,

56:23.680 --> 56:32.400
which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA. So getting to RNA, I suspect it's probably not

56:32.400 --> 56:39.600
that hard. But getting from RNA, how do you, you know, there's multiple different types of RNA

56:39.600 --> 56:44.640
now. How do you distinguish? This is something we're actively thinking about. How do you distinguish

56:44.640 --> 56:50.480
between, you know, a random population of RNA? Some of them go on to become messenger RNA. This

56:50.480 --> 56:56.800
is the transcript of the code, of the gene that you want to make. Some of them become transfer RNA,

56:56.800 --> 57:01.680
which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid that's going to be polymerized.

57:01.680 --> 57:06.960
Some of them become ribosomal RNA, which is the machine which is joining them all up together.

57:07.600 --> 57:12.640
How do they discriminate themselves? And, you know, there's some kind of phase transition going on

57:12.640 --> 57:18.400
there. I don't know. It's a difficult question. And we're now in the region of biology where

57:18.400 --> 57:23.200
information is coming in. But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does. But the

57:23.200 --> 57:29.520
largest genome supported by RNA are RNA viruses like HIV, for example. They're pretty small.

57:30.800 --> 57:36.560
And so there's a limit to how complex life could be unless you come up with DNA, which

57:36.560 --> 57:42.560
chemically is a really small change. But how easy it is to make that change? I don't really know.

57:42.560 --> 57:47.920
As soon as you've got DNA, then you've got an amazingly stable molecule for information storage.

57:48.800 --> 57:53.680
And you can do absolutely anything. But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was? I don't know

57:53.680 --> 58:00.800
either. How much possibility is there for variety in ways to store information? Because it seems

58:00.800 --> 58:06.560
to be very specific characteristics about the programming language of DNA.

58:06.560 --> 58:14.560
Yeah. There's a lot of work going on on what's called Zeno DNA or RNA. Can we replace the bases

58:14.560 --> 58:20.640
themselves, the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA? Can we replace the backbone? Can we replace,

58:20.640 --> 58:26.000
for example, phosphate with arsenate? Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose with

58:26.000 --> 58:32.800
a different sugar? And the answer is yes, you can. Within limits, there's not an infinite

58:32.800 --> 58:38.000
space there. Arsenate doesn't really work if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate. It's

58:38.000 --> 58:46.240
probably quite hard to replace phosphate. It's possible to do it. The question to me is why is

58:46.240 --> 58:51.680
it this way? Is it because there was some form of selection that this is better than the other

58:51.680 --> 58:55.520
forms and there were lots of competing forms of information storage early on and this one was

58:55.520 --> 59:00.000
the one that worked out? Or was it kind of channeled that way, that these are the molecules that

59:00.000 --> 59:06.080
you're dealing with and they work? And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way that we're

59:06.160 --> 59:14.000
channeled towards ribose, phosphate, and the bases that are used. But there are 200 different

59:14.000 --> 59:18.320
letters kicking around out there that could have been used. It's such an interesting question. If

59:18.320 --> 59:23.040
you look at in the programming world in computer science, there's a programming language called

59:23.040 --> 59:28.640
JavaScript, which was written super quickly. It's a giant mess, but it took over the world.

59:29.600 --> 59:36.640
It sounds very biological. It was kind of a running joke that surely this can't be.

59:37.760 --> 59:42.480
It's a terrible programming language. It's a giant mess. It's full of bugs. It's so easy to

59:42.480 --> 59:49.280
write really crappy code, but it took over all of front-end development in the web browser.

59:49.280 --> 59:54.320
If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website, it's usually running JavaScript,

59:54.960 --> 59:59.680
and it's now taking over much of the back end, which is like the serious heavy-duty

59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.800
computational stuff, and it's become super fast with the different compilation engines

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:09.200
that are running it. So it's like, it really took over the world. It's very possible that this

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.920
initially crappy, derided language actually takes everything over. And then the question is,

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:24.240
did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript, or was JavaScript just the first

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:29.840
programming language that ran on the browser and still sticky? The first is the sticky one,

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.400
and so it wins over anything else because it was first. I don't think that's answerable,

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:42.880
right? But it's good to ask that. I suppose in the lab, you can't run it with programming

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:52.080
languages, but in biology, you can probably do some kind of small-scale evolutionary test

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:58.080
to try to infer which is which. Yeah. I mean, in a way, we've got the hardware and the software

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:04.400
here, and the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself, and then the software, perhaps,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.400
is more about the code. Did the code have to be this way? Could it have been a different way?

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.360
People talk about the optimization of the code, and there's some suggestion for that.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.000
I think it's weak, actually. But you could imagine, you could come out with a million

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.600
different codes, and this would be one of the best ones. Well, we don't know this.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.920
Well, I mean, people have tried to model it based on the effect that mutations would have.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.520
So no, you're right. We don't know it because that's a single assumption that a mutation is

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.280
what's being selected on there, and there's other possibilities, too.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.120
I mean, there does seem to be a resilience and a redundancy to the whole thing.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:50.400
Yes. It's hard to mess up, and the way you mess it up often is likely to produce interesting

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.800
results. Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.960
Yeah. Well, I mean, biology is underpinned by this kind of mess, as well. You look at the

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.480
human genome, and it's full of stuff that is really either broken or dysfunctional or was

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.600
a virus once, whatever it may be, and somehow it works, and maybe we need a lot of this mess.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.160
We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.880
So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.320
We talked about sex. What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:33.120
How, when was that invented? And poetic and biological ways of putting it,

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:41.600
how do you describe predator-prayer relationship? Is it a beautiful dance, or is it a violent atrocity?

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.680
Well, I guess it's both, isn't it? I mean, when does it start? It starts in bacteria. You see

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.800
these amazing predators. Delivibrio is one that, in Margolis, used to talk about a lot.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:58.640
It's got a kind of a drill piece that drills through the wall and the membrane of the bacterium,

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:03.440
and then it effectively eats the bacterium from just inside the periplasmic space,

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.280
and makes copies of itself that way. So that's straight predation. There are predators among

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:14.400
bacteria. So predation in that, sorry to interrupt, means you murder somebody and use their body as

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.000
a resource in some way. Yeah.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.440
But it's not parasitic in that you need them to be still alive?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.320
No, no. I mean, predation is you kill them, really.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:26.880
You murder.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:29.280
The parasite is, you kind of live on them.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:35.600
Okay. So, but it seems the predator is the really popular tool.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:43.520
So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years before the Cambrian explosion,

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.160
there is what's known as the Ediacaran fauna, or sometimes they call Vendobionts,

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.720
which is a lovely name. And it's not obvious that they're animals at all.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:00.400
They're stalked things. They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves with kind of fractal

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:09.760
branching patterns on them. And the thing is, they're found sometimes geologists can figure out

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.000
the environment that they were in and say, this is more than 200 meters deep because

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.560
there's no sign of any waves. There's no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.800
They were more than 200 meters deep. So they're definitely not photosynthetic.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.960
These are animals. And they're filter feeders. And we know sponges and corals and things are

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:33.840
filter feeding animals. They're stuck to the spot. And little bits of carbon that come their way.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.080
They filter it out and that's what they're eating.

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.960
So no predation involved in this beyond stuff just dies anyway. And it feels like a very gentle,

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.160
rather beautiful, rather limited world, you might say. There's not a lot going on there.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:55.280
And something changes. Oxygen definitely changes during this period. Other things

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.920
may have changed as well. But the next thing you really see in the fossil record is the Cambrian

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:05.360
explosion. And what do we see there? We're now seeing animals that we would recognize.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:11.200
They've got ice. They've got claws. They've got shells. They're plainly killing things or running

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:20.400
away and hiding. And so we've gone from a rather gentle but limited world to a rather vicious,

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:30.000
unpleasant world that we recognize and which leads to kind of arms races, evolutionary arms races.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.640
Which again is something that when we think about a nuclear arms race, we think, Jesus,

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:41.040
we don't want to go there. It's not done anybody any good. In some ways, maybe it does do good.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:49.760
I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms. But predation as a mechanism forces organisms to

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:56.240
adapt change to be better to escape or to kill. If you need to eat, then you've got to eat. And

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:03.520
a cheetah is not going to run at that speed unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:10.080
So it leads to much greater feats of evolution would ever have been possible without it. And in

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:18.320
the end, to a much more beautiful world. And so it's not all bad by any means. But the thing is,

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:23.280
you can't have this if you don't have an oxygenated planet because it's all in the end. It's about

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:28.320
how much energy can you extract from the food you eat. And if you don't have an oxygenated planet,

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:34.080
you can get about 10% out, not much more than that. And if you've got an oxygenated planet,

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.960
you can get about 40% out. And that means you can have instead of having one or two

01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:44.400
trophic levels, you can have five or six trophic levels. And that means things can eat things that

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.520
eat other things and so on. And you've gone to a level of ecological complexity, which is completely

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.240
impossible in the absence of oxygen. This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote,

01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.640
that for every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.400
The history of life on earth, unfortunately, is that of violence, just the trillions and

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:16.960
trillions of multi cell organisms that were murdered in the in the struggled.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.840
It's a sorry statement. But yes, it's basically true.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:26.240
And that somehow is a catalyst from an evolutionary perspective for creativity,

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.640
for creating more and more complex organisms that are better and better at surviving.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:35.120
Survival of the fittest, if you just go back to that old phrase, means death the weakest.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.280
Now, what's fit, what's weak, these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.560
But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:51.280
One way to die is the constraints, the scarcity of the resources in the environment.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.640
But that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism for death

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.240
than other creatures roam about in the environment. When I say environment,

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.920
I mean like the static environment. But then there's the dynamic environment of

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.760
bigger things trying to eat you and use you for your energy.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.480
It forces you to come up with a solution to your specific problem

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.720
that is inventive and is new and hasn't been done before.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:25.920
And so it forces, I mean, literally change, literally evolution on populations,

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.280
they have to become different.

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.600
And it's interesting that humans have channeled that into more,

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.040
I mean, I guess what humans are doing is they're inventing

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.280
more productive and safe ways of doing that.

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.480
You know, this whole idea of morality and all those kinds of things,

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.840
I think they ultimately lead to competition versus violence.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:56.400
Because I think violence can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:02.400
But if you channel that into more controlled competition in the space of ideas,

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.080
in the space of approaches to life, maybe you can

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.160
be even more productive than evolution is, because evolution is very wasteful.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.560
Like the modern murder required to really test a good idea,

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.280
genetically speaking, is just a lot. Many, many, many generations.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.840
Morally, we cannot base society on the way that evolution works.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.200
That's an invention, right?

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.320
But actually, in some respects, we do, which is to say,

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.880
this is how science works. We have competing hypotheses

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.280
that have to get better, otherwise they die.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.480
It's the way that society works. In ancient Greece,

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.480
we had the Athens and Sparta and city-states,

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:45.280
and then we had the Renaissance and nation-states.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.840
And universities compete with each other.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:48.320
Yes.

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:51.680
Tremendous amount of companies competing with each other all the time.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.440
It drives innovation.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.040
And if we want to do it without all the death that we see in nature,

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.760
then we have to have some kind of societal level control that says,

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.200
well, there's some limits, guys, and these are what the limits are going to be.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.880
And society as a whole has to say, right, we want to limit the amount of death here,

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.720
so you can't do this and you can't do that.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.960
And who makes up these rules and how do we know?

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.440
It's a tough thing, but it's basically trying to find a moral basis

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.960
for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.720
and keeping the innovation and the richness of it.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.760
And I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal,

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.320
probably curve out of it, murder is illegal,

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.160
except when it's done to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.160
So we still have wars.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.400
But we are struggling with this idea that murder is a bad thing.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.400
It's so interesting how we're channeling the best of the evolutionary imperative

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.600
and trying to get rid of the stuff that's not productive.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.560
So trying to almost accelerate evolution,

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:07.280
the same kind of thing that makes evolution creative, we're trying to use that.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.560
I think we naturally do it.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.480
I mean, I don't think we can help ourselves do it.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.560
Capitalism as a form is basically about competition and differential rewards.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:25.120
But society, and I keep using this word moral obligation,

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.760
we cannot operate as a society if we go that way.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:35.120
It's interesting that we've had problems achieving balance.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.640
So for example, in the financial crash in 2009,

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.200
do you let banks go to the wall or not?

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.880
This is kind of question.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.960
In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall,

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:49.280
and in that sense, you don't need the regulation because they just die.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.240
Whereas if we as a society think about what's required for society as a whole,

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.400
then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.360
In which case, you then have to impose some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.040
in an evolutionary manner exploit.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.720
Yeah, we've been struggling with this kind of idea of capitalism,

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.600
the cold brutality of capitalism that seems to create so much beautiful things in this world,

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:26.480
and then the ideals of communism that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:30.400
We struggle with ideas of, well, maybe we didn't do it right.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.600
How can we do things better?

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.840
And then the ideas are the things we're playing with as opposed to people.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.960
If a PhD student has a bad idea, we don't shoot the PhD student.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.920
We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.120
You have a very humane lamp.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.520
Yeah, I don't know how you guys do it.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.280
You know, the way I run things, it's always life and death.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:54.560
Okay, so it is interesting about humans that there is an inner sense of morality,

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:02.320
which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:08.880
If we think about the invention of early invention of sex and early invention of predation,

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.240
what was the thing invented to make humans?

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.560
What would you say?

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.120
I mean, I suppose a couple of things I'd say.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.080
Number one is you don't have to wind the clock back very far, five, six million years or so,

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.560
and let it run forwards again.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.240
And the chances of humans, as we know them, is not necessarily that high.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:35.200
Now, you know, imagine, as an alien, you find planet Earth and it's got everything

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.280
apart from humans on it, it's an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet,

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:43.520
but nothing that we would recognize as extremely intelligent life,

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.680
kind of space-faring civilization.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.600
So when we think about aliens, we're kind of after something like ourselves,

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.680
or after a space-faring civilization.

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.760
We're not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.880
Amazing though they are.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:05.520
But the additional kind of evolutionary steps to go from large complex mammals, monkeys, let's say,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.960
to humans doesn't strike me as that longer a distance.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.400
It's all about the brain.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.040
And where's the brain and morality coming from?

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.320
It seems to me to be all about groups, human groups and interactions between groups.

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.760
The collective intelligence of it.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.640
Yes, the interactions really.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.920
And there's a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas who's done a lot of really beautiful work,

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.440
I think, on this kind of question.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.040
So I talk to him every now and then, so my view is influenced by him.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.480
But a lot seems to depend on population density.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.560
The more interactions you have going on between different groups,

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.320
the more transfer of information, if you like, between groups,

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.520
so people moving from one group to another group,

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.840
almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.040
The more expertise you're able to develop and maintain,

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.400
the more culturally complex your society can become.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:09.200
And groups that have become detached, like on Easter Island, for example,

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.520
very often degenerate in terms of the complexity of their civilization.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.080
Is that true for complex organisms in general?

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.560
Population density is often productive.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:19.760
Really matters.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.000
But in human terms, I don't know what the actual factors were

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.560
that were driving a large brain.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.720
But you can talk about fire.

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.880
You can talk about tool use.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.080
You can talk about language.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.720
And none of them seem to correlate especially well

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:42.800
with the actual known trajectory of human evolution in terms of cave art and these kind of things.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.520
That seems to work much better just with population density

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:50.480
and a number of interactions between different groups.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.760
All of which is really about human interactions.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.560
Human-human interactions and the complexity of those.

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.160
But population density is the thing that increases the number of interactions.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.320
But then there must have been inventions

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:14.560
forced by that number of interactions that actually led to humans.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:21.360
So like Richard Rangham talks about that it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.760
male. So that's what collaboration looks like is they, when you're living together,

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:34.480
they don't like, our early ancestors don't like the dictatorial aspect of a single individual

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.440
at the top of a tribe.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.720
So they learn to collaborate how to basically create a democracy of sorts,

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:47.200
a democracy that prevents, minimizes or lessens the amount of violence,

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:54.960
which essentially gives strength to the tribe and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.320
I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things about humans is where all of those things.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.280
I mean, we are deeply social as a species and we're also deeply selfish.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.400
And it seems to me the conflict between capitalism and communism,

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.120
it's really just two aspects of human nature, both of which are.

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:11.760
Yeah, both.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.080
We have both and we have a constant kind of vying between the two sides.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.120
We really do care about other people beyond our families, beyond our immediate people.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:23.920
We care about society and the society that we live in.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:28.480
And you could say that's a drawing towards socialism or communism.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.640
On the other side, we really do care about ourselves.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.640
We really do care about our families about working for something that we gain from.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.920
And that's the capitalist side of it.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.000
They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:43.200
In terms of violence and interactions between groups,

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.120
yes, all this dynamic of if you're interacting between groups,

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.240
you can be certain that they're going to be burning each other

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:53.360
and all kinds of physical, violent interactions as well,

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:57.760
which will drive the kind of cleverness of how do you resist this?

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.800
Let's build a tower.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.560
Let's see, what are we going to do to prevent being overrun

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.880
by those marauding gangs from over there?

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:10.640
And you look outside humans and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.280
And they're very, very different structures to society.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.280
Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure and bonobos.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.800
There's basically a female society where the males are predominantly excluded

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:24.640
and only brought in at the behest of the female.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.200
We have a lot in common with both of those groups.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:31.200
And there's again tension there.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.800
And probably chimps more violent, so bonobos probably more sex.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.560
That's another tension.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.160
How serious do we want to be?

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.200
How much fun do we want to be?

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.840
Asking for a friend again, what do you think happened to Neanderthals?

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.880
What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals, homo sapiens?

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.080
Do you think we murdered them?

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.640
How do we murder them?

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.920
How do we out-compete them?

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:01.200
Or do we out-mate them?

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.000
I don't know.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.280
I mean, I think there's unequivocal evidence that we mated with them.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.680
We always try to mate with everything.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.480
Yes, pretty much.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.240
There's some interesting.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.280
The first sequences that came along were in mitochondrial DNA.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.960
And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:22.080
What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA was very different

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.280
to human mitochondria.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:23.840
Oh, that's so interesting.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.960
You could do a clock on it.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.400
And they said the divergent state was about 600,000 years ago

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.160
or something like that, so not so long ago.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.920
And then the first full genomes were sequenced,

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.200
maybe 10 years after that.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.520
And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.240
So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.880
And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.320
But we don't know.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.120
Is that possible?

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.760
So can you explain the difference between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.520
I've talked before about the mitochondria,

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.360
which are the power packs in cells.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.800
These are the paired down control units is their DNA.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.760
So it's passed on by the mother only.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:10.480
And in the egg cell, we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.320
There's only 37 genes left.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.040
And they do basically the control unit of energy production.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.400
That's what it's doing.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.520
It's a basic old school machine that does.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:24.800
And it's got genes that were considered to be effectively trivial

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:28.640
because they did a very narrowly defined job.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.920
But they're not trivial in the sense that that narrowly defined job is about

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.320
everything that is being alive.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.080
So they're much easier to sequence.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.680
You've got many more copies of these things.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:41.120
And you can sequence them very quickly.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.240
But the problem is because they go down only the maternal line from mother to daughter,

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.520
your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.680
Doesn't matter any kids we have, they get their mother's mitochondrial DNA.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.800
Except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.240
And so it tells a different story.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.760
And it's not a story which is easy to reconcile always.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:11.360
And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least is that there was one way

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:17.440
traffic of genes probably going from humans into Neanderthals rather than the other way around.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.760
Why did the Neanderthals disappear?

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:20.720
I don't know.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:26.400
I mean, I suspect that they were probably less violent, less clever,

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:31.520
less populace, less willing to fight.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.400
I don't know.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.760
I mean, I think I already drove them to extinction at the margins of Europe.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.880
And it's interesting how much if we ran earth over and over again,

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:47.360
how many of these branches of intelligent beings that have figured out some kind of

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.680
how to leverage collective intelligence, which ones of them emerge,

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.600
which one of them succeed?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:57.040
Is it the more violent ones?

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:01.040
Is it the more isolated ones?

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.840
You know, like what dynamics result to more productivity?

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:05.440
And I suppose we'll never know.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.640
The more complex the organism, the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:10.960
Yes.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.240
And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.520
Yeah, the truth might be very painful.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.720
What about if we actually step back a couple of interesting things that we humans do?

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:27.920
One is object manipulation and movement.

01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:31.120
And of course, movement was something that was done.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.280
That was another big invention, being able to move around the environment.

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.960
And the other one is this sensory mechanism, how we sense the environment.

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.760
One of the coolest, high definition ones is vision.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:49.680
How big are those inventions in the history of life on earth?

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:56.560
Vision, movement, again, extremely important, going back to the origin of animals,

01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:00.400
the Cambrian explosion where suddenly you're seeing eyes in the fossil record.

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:06.800
It's not necessarily, again, lots of people historically have said what use is half an eye.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:17.120
You can go in a series of steps from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.360
to an eyeball with a lens and so on.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.280
If you assume no more, then I don't remember this.

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.080
This was a specific model that I have in mind, but it was one percent change or half a percent

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.360
change for each generation.

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:31.440
How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.880
And the answer is half a million years.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.520
It doesn't have to take long.

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:36.800
That's not how evolution works.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.560
That's not an answer to the question.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:44.000
It just shows you can reconstruct the steps and you can work out roughly how it can work.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:48.000
So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.000
But once you have one, then there's no way to hide.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.040
And again, we're back to predator-prey relationships.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.240
We're back to all the benefits that being able to see brings you.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.560
And if you think philosophically what bats are doing with eco-location and so on,

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:04.160
I have no idea.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.920
But I suspect that they form an image of the world in pretty much the same way that we do.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.080
It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:15.600
So I suppose the other thing about sight, there are single-celled organisms that have got

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:21.520
a lens and a retina and a cornea and so on.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.720
Basically, they've got a camera tied by in a single cell.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.680
They don't have a brain.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.480
What they understand about their world is impossible to say, but they're capable of coming

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.800
out with the same structures to do so.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.800
So I suppose, then, is that once you've got things like eyes, then you have a big driving

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:43.760
pressure on the central nervous system to figure out what it all means.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:48.160
And we come around to your other point about manipulation, sensory input and so on, about

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:54.960
you have a huge requirement to understand what your environment is and what it means

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.000
and how it reacts and where you should run away and where you should stay put.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.960
Actually, on that point, I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:15.040
who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution, to say that there's not necessarily a

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:22.160
strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:30.080
So objective reality, that our perception actually is very different from what's objectively real.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:37.520
We're living inside an illusion and we're basically the entire set of species on earth,

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:41.920
I think, I guess, are competing in a space that's an illusion that's distinct from,

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.160
that's far away from physical reality as it is defined by physics.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:48.720
I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.960
I mean, we have a sensory input, which is a fraction of what we could have a sensory input on,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.160
and we interpret it in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:03.600
So yes, it's an illusion in that sense, but the tree is physically there,

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:09.760
and if you walk into that tree, it's not purely a delusion of some physical reality to it.

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:17.040
So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is, but because it's just a slice,

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.720
you're missing a big picture.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.400
But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily need to be a slice,

01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.320
it could be a complete fabrication that's just consistent amongst the species,

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:34.560
which is an interesting, or at least it's a humbling realization that our perception

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:39.840
is limited and our cognitive abilities are limited.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:44.880
And at least to me, it's argument from evolution.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.720
I don't know how much, how strong that is as an argument,

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.320
but I do think that life can exist in the mind.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.480
Yes.

01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:59.520
In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game,

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:05.760
and you can have a vibrant life inside that place, and that place is not real in some sense,

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.880
but you can still have a vibrant, all the same forces of evolution,

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:13.360
all the same competition, the dynamics of between humans you can have,

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:22.800
but I don't know if, I don't know if there's evidence for that being the thing that happened on

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.040
Earth. It seems that Earth...

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.360
I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny that you could have exactly the world that you

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:36.400
talk about, and it would be very difficult to, you know, the idea in Matrix movies and so on,

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.920
that the whole world is completely a construction, and we're fundamentally deluded.

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:50.000
It's difficult to say that's impossible or couldn't happen, and certainly we construct

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.840
in our minds what the outside world is, but we do it on input and that input,

01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.240
I would hesitate to say it's not real, because it's precisely how we do understand the world.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.000
We have eyes, but if you keep someone, apparently this kind of thing happens,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.560
someone kept in a dark room for five years or something like that, and they never see properly

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:18.000
again, because the neural wiring that underpins how we interpret vision never developed,

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.360
you know, you need, when you watch a child develop, it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:30.320
table and it hurts, and now you've got two inputs, you've got one pain from this sharp edge, and

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:34.240
number two, you've touched it and realized it's there, it's a sharp edge, and you've got the

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.320
visual input, and you put the three things together and think, I don't want to walk into a table again,

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:44.240
so you're learning, and it's a limited reality, but it's a true reality, and if you don't learn

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.760
that properly, then you will get eaten, you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive,

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:55.840
and same if you're in some kind of, let's say, computer construction of reality,

01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:02.640
I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws that this is what reality is inside this,

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.440
then you play by those laws. Yeah, well, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent,

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.480
so just like you said in the lab, the interesting thing about the simulation question,

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:18.080
yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation, but also, yes, it's possible to do

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:23.040
these kinds of experiments in the lab now, more and more, to me, the interesting question is,

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:29.840
how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be for us to not be able to tell the difference?

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:40.000
A more interesting question to me is, how realistic or interesting does a virtual reality world need

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:46.160
to be in order for us to want to stay there forever, or much longer than physical reality,

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:54.080
prefer that place, and also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs, but prefer it in a deep,

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:59.920
meaningful way, in a way we enjoy life. I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix,

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:06.400
I imagine that it's possible to delude the mind sufficiently that you genuinely,

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:11.520
in that way, do think that you are interacting with the real world when, in fact, the whole

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:18.640
thing's a simulation. How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that? Well, it needs to

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:26.720
convince you that all your sensory input is correct and accurate and joins up and makes sense. Now,

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:31.600
that sensory input is not something that we're born with, we're born with a sense of touch,

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:35.040
we're born with eyes and so on, but we don't know how to use them, we don't know what to make of them.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:41.840
We go around, we bump into trees, we cry a lot, we're in pain a lot, we're basically

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:47.520
booting up the system so that it can make head a tail of the sensory input that it's getting,

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:51.280
and that sensory input is not just a one-way flux of things, it's also you have to walk into

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.920
things, you have to hear things, you have to put it together. Now, if you've got just babies

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.480
in the matrix who are slotted into this, I don't think they have that kind of sensory input,

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.840
I don't think they would have any way to make sense of New York as a world that they're part of,

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.640
the brain is just not developed in that way. Well, I can't make sense of New York in this

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:18.000
physical reality either, but yeah, I mean, but you said pain and the walking into things, well,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.760
you can create a pain signal, and as long as it's consistent that certain things result in pain,

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.400
you can start to construct a reality, there are some, maybe, maybe you disagree with this,

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:35.200
but I think we are born almost with a desire to be convinced by our reality,

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:40.160
like a desire to make sense of our reality. Oh, I'm sure we are, yes.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.040
So there's an imperative, so whatever that reality is given to us, like the table hurts,

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:53.120
fire is hot, I think we want to be deluded in a sense that we want to make a simple,

01:31:53.120 --> 01:32:00.800
like Einstein simple theory of the thing around us, we want that simplicity. And so maybe the

01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:05.760
hunger for the simplicity is the thing that could be used to construct a pretty dumb simulation

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.640
that tricks us. So maybe tricking humans doesn't require building a universe.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.840
No, I don't, I mean, this is not what I work on, so I don't know how close to it we are,

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:21.920
but I agree with you that, yeah, I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do,

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:27.600
but is it possible in principle? I think it would be very difficult,

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:34.800
but I don't see why in principle it wouldn't be possible, and I agree with you that we try to

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:38.640
understand the world, we try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have, and we try to come

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:46.480
out with a hypothesis that explains what's going on. I think though, that we have huge input from

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:52.240
the social context that we're in, we don't do it by ourselves, we don't kind of blunder around in a

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:58.080
universe by ourselves and understand the whole thing, we're told by the people around us,

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:01.840
what things are and what they do, and you know, languages coming in here and so on. So

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:06.480
it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation to simulate all of that.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:14.080
Yeah, simulate all of that, including the social construct, the thing, the spread of ideas and

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:18.560
the exchange of ideas, I don't know, but those questions are really important to understand

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:24.080
as we become more and more digital creatures. It seems like the next step of evolution is us

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:29.920
becoming partial, all the same mechanisms we've talked about are becoming more and more plugged

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:37.520
into the machine. We're becoming cyborgs, and there's an interesting interplay between wires

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:46.080
and biology, you know, zeros and ones and the biological systems, and I don't think you can just,

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:51.360
I don't think we'll have the luxury to see humans as disjoint from the technology we've

01:33:51.360 --> 01:34:00.480
created for much longer. We are an organism that's... Yeah, I mean, I agree with you, but

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:09.280
we come really with this to consciousness and is there a distinction there? Because what you're

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:14.160
saying, the natural end point says we are indistinguishable, that if you are capable of building

01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:22.880
an AI which is sufficiently close and similar, that we merge with it, then to all intents and

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:31.680
purposes, that AI is conscious as we know it. And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:42.160
And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book, because 10 years ago, I wrote a chapter

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:48.480
in a book called Life Ascending about consciousness, and the subtitle of life ascending was the 10

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:52.240
great inventions of evolution, and I couldn't possibly write a book with a subtitle like

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.920
that that did not include consciousness, and specifically consciousness as one of the great

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.760
inventions. And it was in part because I was just curious to know more, and I read more for that

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.320
chapter. I never worked on it, but I've always... How can anyone not be interested in the question?

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:15.200
And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows, and B, there are two main

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:22.160
schools of thought out there with a big skew in distribution. One of them says,

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:28.080
oh, it's a property of matter. It's an unknown law of physics, panpsychism, everything is conscious,

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:32.320
the sun is conscious, it's just a matter of... Or a rock is conscious, it's just a matter of

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.240
how much. And I find that very unpersuasive. I can't say that it's wrong, it's just that

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.280
I think we somehow can tell the difference between something that's living and something that's not.

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:51.200
And then the other end is it's an emergent property of a very complex central nervous system.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:59.200
And I never quite understand what people mean by words like emergence. I mean,

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:07.680
there are genuine examples, but I think we very often tend to use it to plaster over ignorance.

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.760
As a biochemist, the question for me then was, okay, it's a concoction of a central nervous

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:23.760
system. A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling, to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of

01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:30.720
love, or anger, whatever it may be. So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms in the

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:36.800
central nervous system? Which bit of the wiring gives rise to... And I've never seen anyone answer

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:42.800
that question in a way that makes sense to me. And that's an important question to answer.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:47.360
I think if we want to understand consciousness, that's the only question to answer, because

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:54.080
certainly an AI is capable of out thinking and it's only a matter of time. Maybe it's already

01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:01.200
happened. In terms of just information processing and computational skill, I don't think we have any

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:08.480
problem in designing a mind which is at least the equal of the human mind. But in terms of

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:13.440
what we value the most as humans, which is to say our feelings, our emotions, our

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:22.880
sense of what the world is in a very personal way, that's, I think, means as much or more to

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.800
people than their information processing. And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily will

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:34.400
become conscious, because I think it's the property of life. Well, let's talk about it more. You're

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.320
an incredible writer. One of my favorite writers. So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:46.480
What You Write About Consciousness. I think therefore I am, said Descartes, is one of the

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.360
most celebrated lines ever written. But what am I exactly? And artificial intelligence can think

01:37:53.360 --> 01:38:00.720
too, by definition, and therefore is. Yet few of us could agree whether AI is capable in principle

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:08.480
of anything resembling human emotions of love or hate, fear and joy of spiritual yearnings

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:16.400
for oneness or oblivion or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger. The problem is we don't know

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:22.240
what emotions are, as you were saying. What is the feeling in physical terms? How does a

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:27.200
discharging neuron give rise to a feeling of anything at all? This is the hard problem of

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:34.080
consciousness, the seeming duality of mind and matter, the physical makeup of our innermost self.

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.640
We can understand in principle how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:44.000
could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence. But we can't answer in principle

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.160
whether such a supreme intelligence would experience joy or melancholy. What is the quantum

01:38:50.160 --> 01:39:01.840
of solace? Speaking to the question of emergence, you know, there's just technical, there's an

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:09.920
excellent paper on this recently about the kind of phase transition emergence of performance in

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:16.560
neural networks on the problem of NLP, natural language processing. So language models, there

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:24.720
seems to be this question of size. At some point, there is a phase transition as you grow the size

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.640
of the neural network. So the question is sort of somewhat of a technical question that you can

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:36.320
philosophize over. The technical question is, is there a size of a neural network that starts to

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:42.160
be able to form the kind of representations that can capture a language and therefore be able to,

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.480
not just language, but linguistically capture knowledge that's sufficient to solve a lot of

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:55.280
problems in language, like be able to have a conversation. And there seems to be not a gradual

01:39:55.360 --> 01:40:01.120
increase, but a phase transition. And they're trying to construct the science of where that is,

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:05.840
like what is the good size of a neural network? And why does such a phase transition happen?

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:15.520
Anyway, that sort of points to emergence that there could be stages where a thing goes from being,

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:25.680
you're a very intelligent toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away and looks out

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.080
the window, sighing, having an existential crisis. I was thinking of Marvin, the paranoid

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:41.520
android. Well, no, Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky. So easily programmed.

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.680
Easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis. You're almost basically, what is it, notes from

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:55.360
underground, but just constantly complaining about life. No, they're capturing the full

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:00.800
roller coaster of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss, the connection,

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:09.040
the empathy and all that kind of stuff. And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression,

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.320
all that kind of stuff. They're capturing all of that and be able to experience it deeply.

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:19.200
Like it's the most important thing you could possibly experience today. The highest highs,

01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:26.640
the lowest lows, this is it. My life will be over. I cannot possibly go on that feeling,

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:33.680
and then like after a nap, you're feeling amazing. That might be something that emerges.

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.240
So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:45.120
First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.080
But we do know that that's actually true for many people much of the time. Maybe I'd be depressed

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:55.120
if you have an app and you do, in fact, feel better. Oh, you are actually asking the technical

01:41:55.120 --> 01:42:01.680
question there. So there's a biological answer to that. And so the question is whether AI needs

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:07.280
to have the same kind of attachments to its body, bodily function, preservation

01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:16.080
of the brain's successful function, self-preservation essentially, in some deep biological sense.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.600
I mean, to my mind, it comes back around to the problem we were talking about before,

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:27.360
about simulations and sensory input and learning what all of this stuff means.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:35.760
And life and death, that biology, unlike society, has a death penalty over everything.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:43.280
And natural selection works on that death penalty, that if you make this decision wrongly,

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:52.880
you die. And the next generation is represented by beings that made a slightly different decision

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.400
on balance. And that is something that's intrinsically

01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:06.960
difficult to simulate in all its richness, I would say. So what is...

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:18.160
Death in all its richness, our relationship with death, or the whole of it. So when you say

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:25.520
richness, of course, there's a lot in that, which is hard to simulate. What's part of the

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:31.920
richness that's hard to simulate? I suppose the complexity of the environment and your position

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.000
position of an organism in that environment, in the full richness of that environment over its

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.160
entire life, over multiple generations, with changes in gene sequence over those generations,

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.240
so slight changes in the makeup of those individuals over generations.

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:57.280
But if you take it back to the level of single cells, which I do in the book, and ask how does a

01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:04.000
single cell, in effect, know it exists as an unit, as an entity? I mean, no, in inverted commas,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:10.080
obviously, it doesn't know anything. But it acts as a unit, and it acts with astonishing

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:18.720
precision as a unit. And I had suggested that that's linked to the electrical fields on the

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.760
membranes themselves, and that they give some indication of how am I doing in relation to my

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:30.800
environment as a kind of real-time feedback on the world. And this is something physical,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.200
which can be selected over generations, that if you get this wrong,

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:46.560
it's linked with this set of circumstances that I've just, as an individual, I have a moment

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:53.440
of blind panic and run. As a bacterium or something, you have some electrical discharge that says

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:59.040
blind panic, and it runs, whatever it may be. And you associate over generations, multiple

01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:07.040
generations, that this electrical phase that I'm in now is associated with a response like that.

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:13.760
And it's easy to see how feelings come in through the back door, almost, with that kind of

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:22.000
giving real-time feedback on your position in the world in relation to how am I doing.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.680
And then you complexify the system, and yes, I have no problem with a phase transition.

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:40.560
And can all of this be done purely by the language, by the issues with how the system

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:47.680
understands itself? Maybe it can, I honestly don't know. But the philosophers for a long time have

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:54.880
talked about the possibility that you can have a zombie intelligence, and that there are no

01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:01.280
feelings there, but everything else is the same. I mean, I have to throw this back to you, really.

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:06.880
How do you deal with a zombie intelligence? So, first of all, I can see that from a biologist

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:13.760
perspective, you think of all the complexities that led up to the human being, the entirety of

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:19.280
the history of four billion years, that in some deep sense, integrated the human being into this

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:26.800
environment, and that dance of the organism and the environment, you could see how emotions arise

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.720
from that, and then emotions are deeply connected and creating a human experience, and from that,

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:40.320
you mix in consciousness and the full mess of it, yeah. But from a perspective of an intelligent

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:48.160
organism that's already here, like a baby that learns, it doesn't need to learn how to be a

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:54.240
collection of cells or how to do all the things he needs to do. The basic function of a baby,

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:59.520
as it learns, is to interact with this environment, to learn from its environment, to learn how to fit

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:07.040
in to this social society. And the basic response of the baby is to cry a lot of the time.

01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:14.880
To cry, well, to convince the humans to protect it, or to discipline it, to teach it, whatever.

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:22.000
I mean, we've developed a bunch of different tricks, how to get our parents to take care of us,

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.840
to educate us, to teach us about the world. Also, we've constructed the world in such a way

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:32.400
that it's safe enough for us to survive in, and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:37.280
lessons, like the tables are still hard with corners, so it can still run into them. It hurts

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:44.160
like hell. So AI needs to solve that problem, not the problem of constructing this super complex

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:54.000
organism that leads up to run the whole, to make an apple pie, to build the whole universe,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.080
you need to build the whole universe. I think the zombie question is something

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:11.120
I would leave to the philosophers, because, and I will also leave to them the definition of love

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:17.920
and what happens between two human beings when there's a magic that just grabs them,

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:22.880
like nothing else matters in the world, and somehow you've been searching for this feeling,

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:29.440
this moment, this person, your whole life. That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun

01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:34.960
with that one, and also say that that's just, you can have a biological explanation, you can have

01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:41.120
all kinds of, it's all fake, it's actually, I'm Rand, we'll say it's all selfish, there's a lot

01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:44.720
of different interpretations, I'll leave it to the philosophers. The point is the feeling,

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:54.320
sure as hell feels very real, and if my toaster makes me feel like it's the only toaster in the

01:48:54.320 --> 01:49:01.360
world, and when I leave and I miss the toaster, and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster,

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:07.680
and my life is meaningful, and joyful, and the friends I have around me get a better version

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:13.280
of me, because that toaster exists. That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.280
Is that psychologically different to having a dog?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:16.400
No, no.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:21.200
Because, I mean, most people would dispute whether we can say a dog, I would say a dog is

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.400
undoubtedly conscious, but some people would say it doesn't.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.800
But there's degrees of consciousness and so on, but people are definitely much more uncomfortable

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.960
saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog, and there's still a deep connection,

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:40.000
and you could say our relationship with the dog has more to do with anthropomorphism,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.320
like we kind of project the human being onto it.

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:42.880
Maybe.

01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:45.760
We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:51.840
Yes, but you can look into the dog's eyes and you can see that it's sad that it's delighted

01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.720
to see you again. I don't have a dog, by the way, I don't know, it's not that I'm a dog.

01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.800
Dogs are actually incredibly good at using their eyes to do just that.

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.880
They are. Now, I don't imagine that a dog is remotely as close to being intelligent as an AI

01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.920
intelligence, but it's certainly capable of communicating emotionally with us.

01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.480
But here's what I would venture to say, we tend to think because AI plays chess well,

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.960
and is able to fold proteins now well, that it's intelligent.

01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:25.760
I would argue that in order to communicate with humans, in order to have emotional intelligence,

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:28.880
it actually requires another order of magnitude of intelligence.

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.320
It's not easy to be flawed.

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:41.920
Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same as the full complexity of human-to-human interaction.

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:48.320
That's actually, we humans just take for granted the things we're really good at.

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:52.000
Non-stop people tell me how shitty people are at driving.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:55.680
No, humans are incredible at driving.

01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:01.360
Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation, we're incredible at this.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:07.200
People tend to discount the things we all just take for granted.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:13.680
And one of those things that they discount is our ability, the dance of conversation and

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:18.320
interaction with each other, the ability to morph ideas together,

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:21.840
the ability to get angry at each other, and then to miss each other,

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:27.600
like to create attention that makes life fun and difficult and challenging in a way that's

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:33.440
meaningful. That is a skill that's learned, and AI would need to solve that problem.

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:39.920
I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is AI cannot become meaningfully

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:46.960
emotional, let's say, until it experiences some kind of internal conflict that is unable to reconcile

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:54.000
these various aspects of reality or its reality with a decision to make.

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:59.440
And then it feels sad necessarily because it doesn't know what to do.

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:03.600
I certainly can't dispute that. That may very well be how it works.

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.760
I think the only way to find out is to do it.

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:10.000
To build it, yeah, and leave it to the philosophers if it actually feels sad or not.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.360
The point is, the robot will be sitting there alone having an internal conflict,

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.280
an existential crisis, and that's required for it to have a deep,

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:23.920
meaningful connection with another human being. Now, does it actually feel that? I don't know.

01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:28.960
But I'd like to throw something else at you, which troubles me on reading it.

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:36.240
Noah Harar is book 21, Lessons for the 21st Century, and he's written about this kind of

01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.560
thing on various occasions. And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:47.200
And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm and do it better than humans.

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:51.520
So there will be AI better at writing music that we appreciate, the Mozart ever called,

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.400
or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on. Because biochemistry is a algorithmic,

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:59.520
and all you need to do is figure out which bits of the algorithm to play

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:06.160
to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things. And as a biochemist, I find that argument

01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:15.280
close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable. I don't like the sound of it. That's just my

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:20.080
reaction as a human being. You might like the sound of it because that says that AI is capable of the

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:26.960
same kind of emotional feelings about the world as we are, because the whole thing is an algorithm

01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:32.880
and you can program an algorithm. And there you are. He then has a peculiar final chapter

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:39.280
where he talks about consciousness in rather separate terms. And he's talking about meditating

01:53:39.280 --> 01:53:42.880
and so on and getting in touch with his inner consciousness. I don't meditate. I don't know

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:49.920
anything about that. But he wrote in very different terms about it, as if somehow it's a way out of

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:57.840
the algorithm. Now, it seems to me that consciousness, in that sense, is capable of scuppering the

01:53:57.840 --> 01:54:03.360
algorithm. I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops and so on, it is undoubtedly

01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:09.200
algorithmic. But in terms of what we decide to do, it can be much more

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:20.080
based on an emotion. We can just think, I don't care. I can't resolve this complex situation.

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:25.040
I'm going to do that. And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency, which is the

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:29.840
currency of feelings and something where we don't have very much personal control over.

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:36.240
And then it comes back around to you. And what are you trying to get at with AI? Do we need to

01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:42.880
have some system which is capable of overriding a rational decision which cannot be made because

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:48.400
there's too much conflicting information by effectively an emotional, judgmental decision

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.800
that just says, do this and see what happens? That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.

01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:58.080
Yeah. And the question is whether it's a different process or just a higher level process.

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:06.800
I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.

01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:14.800
There's a lot of things that, the moment you say it, it's irrefutable,

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:21.680
but it simplifies and in the process loses something fundamental. So for example,

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:29.840
calling a universe and an information processing system, sure, yes. You can make that. It's a

01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:41.040
computer that's performing computations, but you're missing the process of the entropy somehow

01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:47.360
leading to pockets of complexity that creates these beautiful artifacts that are incredibly complex

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.920
and they're like machines. And then those machines are through the process of evolution

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:57.280
are constructing even further complexity. Like in calling the universe information

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:03.920
processing machine, you're, you're missing those little local pockets and how difficult

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.960
is to create them. So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm, how difficult

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:16.160
is it to create a software system that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect.

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:23.040
I think we're, that is going to take so long. I can't, I mean, that's going to be centuries from

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:28.880
now to be able to reconstruct the human. Now what I would venture to say, to get some of the magic

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:34.560
of a human being with what we're saying with the emotions and the interactions and like,

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.520
like a dog makes a smile and joyful and all those kinds of things that will come much sooner,

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:44.160
but that doesn't require us to reverse engineer the algorithm of biochemistry.

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:50.480
Yes, but the toaster is making you happy. Yes. It's not about whether you make the toaster happy.

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:57.920
No, it has to be. It has to be. It has to be. The toaster has to be able to leave me.

01:56:57.920 --> 01:57:00.480
Yes, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case is very intelligent.

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.680
Yeah, the toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me. That's essential.

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:11.360
Yeah. That's essential for my being able to miss the toaster. If the toaster is just my servant,

01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:19.760
that's not or a provider of like services like tells me the weather makes toast.

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:25.840
That's not going to deep connection. It has to have internal conflict. You write about life

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:32.960
and death. It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality and the finiteness of its existence.

01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.920
And that life is for its temporary and therefore needs to be more selective.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.840
One of the most moving moments in the movies from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:54.160
2001, where that was the death of a sentient being and Hal knew it. So I think we all kind of know

01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:02.720
that a sufficiently intelligent being is going to have some form of consciousness,

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:07.840
but whether it would be like biological consciousness, I just don't know. And if you're

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.760
thinking about how do we bring together, I mean, obviously we're going to interact

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:23.680
more closely with AI, but are we really is a dog really like a toaster? Or is there really some

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:30.880
kind of difference there? You're talking about biochemistry is algorithmic, but it's not single

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:35.200
algorithm and it's very complex, of course it is. So it may be that there's that there are again

01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:41.040
conflicts in the circuits of biochemistry, but I have a feeling that the level of complexity of

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:46.560
the total biochemical system at the level of a single cell is less complex than the level of

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:55.280
neural networking in the human brain or in an AI. Well, I guess I assumed that we were including

01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:01.120
the brain in the biochemistry algorithm, because you have to- I would see that as a higher level

01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.760
of organization of neural networks, they're all using the same biochemical wiring within themselves.

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:13.120
Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons, it's the immune system, it's the whole package.

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:20.240
I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm that runs an intelligent biological system, you have to

01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:25.120
include the whole damn thing. And it's pretty fascinating that it comes from an embryo.

01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:36.240
I mean, if you can, what is a human being? Because it's just some code and then you build.

01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.640
And then that DNA doesn't just tell you what to build, but how to build it.

01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:45.520
I mean, the thing is impressive. And the question is how

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:51.280
difficult is it to reverse engineer the whole shebang?

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:53.600
Very difficult.

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.440
I would say it's-

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:06.480
Don't want to say impossible, but it's much easier to build a human than to reverse engineer,

02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:14.080
to build a fake human, human-like thing, than to reverse engineer the entirety of the process of

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:20.080
the evolution of her. I'm not sure if we are capable of reverse engineering the whole thing.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:26.480
If the human mind is capable of doing that. I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I wasn't trying.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
But I know I can't understand the whole problem. I'm just trying to understand

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.200
the rudimentary outlines of the problem. There's another aspect though,

02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:41.600
you're talking about developing from a single cell to the human mind and all the

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:46.240
part system subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:55.520
This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine, with Michael Levin. But

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:03.440
so little is known about- you talk about reverse engineers. So little is known about

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.480
the developmental pathways that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.

02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:14.800
And a lot of it seems to depend on the same electrical interactions

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.400
that I was talking about happening at the level of single cells and its interaction

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:22.720
with the environment. There's a whole electrical field side to biology

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:29.520
that is not yet written into any of the textbooks, which is about how does an embryo develop into

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.160
or a single cell develop into these complex systems? What defines the head? What defines

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:38.720
the immune system? What defines the brain and so on? That really is written in a language that

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:43.840
we're only just beginning to understand and frankly biologists, most biologists, are still very reluctant

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:51.600
to even get themselves tangled up in questions like electrical fields influencing development.

02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:56.320
It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists and it should not be because this is the 21st

02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:02.000
century biology. This is where it's going. But we're not going to reverse engineer a human being,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.960
or the mind, or any of these subsystems until we understand how this developmental process is,

02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:13.840
how electricity and biology really works. And if it is linked with feelings and with

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:19.600
consciousness and so on, that's the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try. But I think

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:27.840
that's where the answer lies. So you think it's possible that the key to things like consciousness

02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:34.000
are some of the more tricky aspects of cognition might lie in that early development,

02:02:34.560 --> 02:02:40.240
the interaction of electricity and biology, electrical fields.

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:44.640
But we already know the EEG and so on is telling us a lot about brain function,

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:48.880
but we don't know which cells, which parts of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG. We

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:54.320
don't know the basics. The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks, we know it's multiple

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.600
cells, hundreds or thousands of cells involved in it. And we assume that it's to do with depolarization

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.840
during action potentials and so on. But the mitochondria which are in there have much

02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:09.840
more membranes than the plasma membrane of the neuron. And there's a much greater membrane

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:15.120
potential. And it's formed in parallel, very often parallel Christi, which are capable of

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:22.800
reinforcing a field and generating fields over longer distances. And nobody knows if that plays

02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:27.920
a role in consciousness or not. There's reasons to argue that it could, but frankly, we simply do

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:33.920
not know. And it's not taken into consideration. You look at the structure of the mitochondrial

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:41.600
membranes in the brains of simple things like josophila, the fruit fly, and they have amazing

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:48.000
structures. You can see lots of little rectangular things all lined up in amazing patterns.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.040
What are they doing? Why are they like that? We haven't the first clue.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:58.800
What do you think about organoids and brain organoids? So in a lab, trying to study the

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:06.960
development of these in the Petru dish development of organs, do you think that's promising? Do you

02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:11.360
have to look at the whole systems? I've never done anything like that. I don't know much about it.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:16.720
The people who I've talked to who do work on it say amazing things can happen. And a bit of a

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:22.560
brain drone in a dish is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings or even memories of its

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:29.120
former brain. Again, I have a feeling that until we understand how to control the electrical

02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:34.240
fields that control development, we're not going to understand how to turn an organoid into a real

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:42.400
functional system. But how do we get that understanding? It's so incredibly difficult. I mean, you would

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.280
I mean, one promising direction. I'd love to get your opinion on this. I don't know if you're

02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:52.640
familiar with the work of Deep Mind and Alpha Fold with protein folding and so on. Do you think

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:59.760
it's possible that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology, trying to basically

02:04:59.760 --> 02:05:08.560
simulate and model the behavior of trivial biological systems as they become complex

02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:15.680
biological systems? I'm sure it will. The interesting thing to me about protein folding

02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:21.680
is that for a long time, my understanding is not what I work on. So I may have got this wrong. But

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:29.200
my understanding is that you take the sequence of a protein and you try to fold it. And there are

02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:33.840
multiple ways in which you can fold and to come up with the correct confirmation is not a very

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:38.160
easy thing because you're doing it from first principles from a string of letters, which specify

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:45.040
the string of amino acids. But what actually happens is when a protein is coming out of a ribosome,

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:50.080
it's coming out of a charged tunnel and it's in a very specific environment, which is going to

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:53.600
force this to go there now and then this one to go there and this one to come like that. And so

02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:58.320
you're forcing a specific conformational set of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:03.120
So by the time it's fully emerged, it's already got its shape and that shape depended on

02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:11.120
the immediate environment that it was emerging into one letter, one amino acid at a time.

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:18.720
And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way. And if that's correct,

02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:22.720
then that's very characteristic of science, which is to say it asks very often the wrong

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:26.800
question and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses on something having never

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:30.880
thought to actually think, well, what is biology doing? And biology is giving you a charged

02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:37.200
electrical environment that forces you to be this way. Now, did deep mind come up through

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:42.560
patterns with some answer that was like that? I've got absolutely no idea. It ought to be

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:47.920
possible to deduce that from the shapes of proteins. It would require much greater

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:55.040
skill than the human mind has. But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on,

02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.880
let's look at this exit tunnel and try and work out what shape is this protein going to take.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:03.120
We can figure that out. That's really interesting about the exit tunnel. But sometimes we get lucky

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:11.760
and just like in science, the simplified view or the static view will actually solve the problem

02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:17.280
for us. So in this case, it's very possible that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping to

02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:23.680
our structure without considering how it unraveled, so without considering the tunnel.

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:29.680
And so that seems to be the case in this situation where the cool thing about proteins,

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:32.560
all the different shapes they can possibly take, it actually seems to take

02:07:33.360 --> 02:07:38.560
very specific unique shapes given the sequence. That's forced on you by an exit tunnel. So the

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:44.320
problem is actually much simpler than you thought. And then there's a whole army of proteins that

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:51.760
which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins. And they're only used when

02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:56.960
there's some presumably issue with how it came out of the exit tunnel and you want to do it

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:01.760
differently to that. So very often the chaperone proteins will go there and will influence the

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:09.280
way in which it falls. So there's two ways of doing it. Either you can look at the structures and

02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:13.680
the sequences of all the proteins and you can apply an immense mind to it and figure out what

02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:17.840
the patterns are and figure out what how or you can look at the actual situation where it is and

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:21.520
say, well, hang on, it was actually quite simple. It's got a charged environment and then you fall

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:25.360
it's forced to come out this way. And then the question will be, well, do different ribosomes

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:29.520
have different charged environments for what happens if a chaperone, you're asking a different

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:34.160
set of questions to come to the same answer in a way which is telling you a much simpler story

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:39.920
and explains why it is rather than saying it could be, this is one in a billion different

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:43.360
possible conformational states that this protein could have. You're saying, well, it has this one

02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:50.560
because that was the only one it could take given its setting. Well, yeah, I mean, currently humans

02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:55.440
are very good at that kind of first principles thinking of stepping back. But I think AI is

02:08:55.440 --> 02:09:01.440
really good at, you know, collect a huge amount of data and a huge amount of data of observation of

02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:06.080
planets and figure out that Earth is not at the center of the universe that there's actually a

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:11.760
sun were orbiting the sun. But then you can as a human being ask, well, how did how do solar

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:18.800
systems come to be? How do what are the different forces that are required to make this kind of

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.760
pattern emerge? And then you start to invent things like gravity, what I mean, obviously,

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:32.720
I mixed up the ordering of gravity wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets, but

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:39.680
we are able to think about those big picture things as human beings. AI is just very good to

02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:48.000
infer simple models from a huge amount of data. And the question is with biology, you know, we

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.840
kind of go back and forth to how we solve biology. Listen, protein folding was thought to be

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:59.360
impossible to solve. And there's a lot of brilliant PhD students that worked one protein at a time

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:05.440
trying to figure out the structure. And the fact that I was able to do that. Oh, I'm not knocking

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:11.920
it at all. But I think that people have been asking the wrong question. But then as the people

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:20.240
start to ask better and bigger questions, the AI kind of enters the chat and says,

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:24.480
I'll help you out with that. Can I give you another example of my own work?

02:10:27.840 --> 02:10:35.280
The risk of getting a disease as we get older. There are genetic aspects to it. You know, if

02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.720
you spend your whole life overeating and smoking and whatever, that's a whole separate question.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.640
But there's a genetic side to the risk. And we know a few genes that increase your risk of

02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:51.920
certain things. And for probably 20 years now, people have been doing what's called GWAS, which is

02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:59.280
genome-wide association studies. So you've effectively scanned the entire genome for any

02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.800
single nucleotide polymorphisms, which is to say a single letter change in one place

02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.520
that has a higher association of being linked with a particular disease or not. And you can

02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:16.800
come out with thousands of these things across the genome. And if you add them all up and try and

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:24.400
say, well, so do they add up to explain the known genetic risk of this disease? And the known genetic

02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:31.280
risk often comes from twin studies. And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy, there's a 40

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.800
or 50% risk that the other twin, identical twin, will also get epilepsy. Therefore, the genetic

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:45.280
factor is about 50%. And so the gene similarities that you see should account for 50% of that known

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:52.160
risk. Very often it accounts for less than a tenth of the known risk. And there's two possible

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:56.480
explanations. And there's one which people tend to do, which is to say, ah, well, we don't have

02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:01.360
enough statistical power. If we maybe there's maybe there's a million, we've only found a thousand of

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.040
them. But if we find the other million, they're weakly related, but there's a huge number of them.

02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:09.120
And so we'll, we'll, we'll account for that whole risk. Maybe there's, you know, maybe there's a

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:15.840
billion of them. So, so that's one way. The other way is to say, well, hang on a minute, you're

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:20.640
missing a system here. That system is the mitochondrial DNA, which people tend to dismiss

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:29.200
because it's small and it's not, it doesn't change very much. But a few single letter changes in

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:34.240
that mitochondrial DNA, it, it controls some really basic processes. It controls

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:39.600
not only all the energy that we need to live and to move around and do everything we do,

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:47.280
but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks to, you know, to, to, to make new cells

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:53.280
and cancer cells very often kind of take over the mitochondria and rewire them so that instead of

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:57.200
using them for making energy, they're effectively using them as precursors for the building blocks

02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:01.920
with biosynthesis. You need to make new amino acids, new nucleotides for DNA. You want to make

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:07.840
new lipids to make your membranes and so on. So they kind of rewire metabolism. Now the problem is

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:12.640
that we've got all these interactions between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:18.160
that are overlooked completely because people throw away, literally throw away the mitochondrial

02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:23.360
genes. And we can see in fruit flies that they interact and produce big differences in risk.

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:33.920
So you can set, you can set AI onto this question of exactly what, you know, how many of these

02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:38.960
base changes there are. And this is one possible solution that maybe there are a million of them,

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.480
and it does account for the greatest part of the risk. Or the other one is they aren't,

02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:46.960
that it's just not there. That actually the risk lies in something you weren't even looking at.

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:52.160
And this is where human intuition is very important. And just this feeling that, well,

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:56.560
I'm working on this and I think it's important and I'm bloody minded about it. And in the end,

02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:01.920
some people are right. It turns out that it was important. Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody

02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:09.680
minded? And that hang on a minute, you might be missing a whole other system here that's much

02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:20.160
bigger. That's the moment of discovery of scientific revolution. I'm giving up on saying AI

02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:26.240
can't do something. I've said enough times about enough things. I think there's been a lot of

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:32.960
progress. And instead, I'm excited by the possibility of AI helping humans. But at the same time,

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:41.440
just like I said, we seem to dismiss the power of humans. Like we're so limited in so many ways

02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:52.400
that we kind of, in what we feel like dumb ways, like we're not strong, where we're kind of,

02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:59.440
our attention, our memory is limited, our ability to focus on things is limited

02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:05.360
in our own perception of what limited is. But that actually, there's an incredible computer

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:10.960
behind the whole thing that makes this whole system work, our ability to interact with the

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.640
environment, to reason about the environment. There's magic there. And I am hopeful that AI

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:21.760
can capture some of that same magic. But that magic is not going to look like deep blue playing

02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:26.400
chess. It's going to be more interesting. But I don't think it's going to look like

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:30.240
pattern finding either. I mean, that's essentially what you're telling me. It does very well at

02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:35.520
the moment. And my point is, it works very well where you're looking for the right pattern.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:41.840
But we are storytelling animals. And the hypothesis is a story. It's a testable story.

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:49.040
But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown and it's a new story, basically. And it says,

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:54.160
this leads to this leads to that. It's a causal set of storytelling.

02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:58.560
It's also possible that the leap into the unknown has a pattern of its own.

02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:01.760
Yes, it is. And it's possible that it's learnable.

02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:11.760
I'm sure it is. There's a nice book by Arthur Kersler on the nature of creativity. And he

02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:15.760
likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off in a completely unexpected direction and says

02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:21.680
that this is the basis of human creativity, that some creative switch of direction to an

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:27.600
unexpected place is similar to a joke. I'm not saying that's how it works, but it's a nice idea

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:34.080
and there must be some truth in it. And it's one of these, most of the stories we tell are probably

02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:38.560
the wrong story and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful. And we definitely don't

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:45.360
do as well at seeing patterns in things. But some of the most enjoyable human aspects is finding a

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.800
new story that goes to an unexpected place. And these are all aspects of what being human means

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:56.480
to me. And maybe these are all things that AI figures out for itself, or maybe they're just

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:03.360
aspects of it. But I just have the feeling sometimes that the people who are trying to

02:17:04.160 --> 02:17:12.000
understand what we are like, if we wish to craft an AI system, which is somehow human-like,

02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:20.240
that we don't have a firm enough grasp of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.

02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:27.840
But we get a better, better understanding of that. I agree with you completely. We try to build a thing

02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:34.560
and then we go, hang on in a minute. There's another system here and that's actually the attempt to build

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:40.480
AI that's human-like, is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings. The funny thing

02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:44.800
that I recently talked to Magnus Carlson, widely considered to be the greatest chess player of all

02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:50.800
time, and he talked about AlphaZero, which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.

02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:59.280
And he had a funny comment. He has a kind of dry sense of humor, but he was extremely impressed

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:05.600
when he first saw AlphaZero play. And he said that it did a lot of things that could easily be

02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:13.600
mistaken for creativity. So he, as a typical human, refused to give the system

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:19.440
sort of its due, because he came up with a lot of things that a lot of people

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:27.440
are extremely impressed by, not just the sheer calculation, but the brilliance of play. So one

02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:36.320
of the things that it does in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces. So in chess, that

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:43.200
means you basically take a few steps back and it takes a step forward. You give away pieces

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:51.760
for some future reward. And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess. You take big risks,

02:18:52.480 --> 02:19:01.680
that for us humans, those risks are especially painful because you have a fog of uncertainty

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:06.720
before you. So to take a risk now, based on intuition, if I think this is the right risk to

02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:12.400
take, but there's so many possibilities that that's where it takes guts. That's where art is,

02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:19.760
that's that danger. And then AlphaZero takes those same kind of risks

02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:24.880
and does them even greater degree. But of course, it does it from a,

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:34.720
well, you could easily reduce down to a cold calculation over patterns. But

02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:40.480
boy, when you see the final result, it sure looks like the same kind of magic that we see in

02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:47.120
creativity. We see creative play on the chessboard. But the chessboard is very limited. And the

02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:53.360
question is, as we get better and better, can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics,

02:19:54.080 --> 02:20:02.000
in programming, and then venturing biology, psychology, and expand into more and more

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:09.040
complex systems? I was, I used to go running when I was a boy and fell running, which is to say

02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:14.000
running up and down mountains. And I was never particularly great at it. But there were some

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:21.040
people who were amazingly fast, especially at running down. And I realized in trying to do this,

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:26.480
that there's, there's only really two, two ways, there's three possible ways of doing it. And

02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:31.600
there's only two that work, either you go extremely slowly and carefully. And you figure out, okay,

02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:36.320
there's a stone, I'll put my foot on this stone. And then there's another, there's a muddy puddle

02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:40.960
and we're void. And, you know, it's slow, it's laborious, you figure it out step by step.

02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:46.400
Or you can just go incredibly fast. And you don't think about it at all. The entire conscious mind

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:50.480
is shut out of it. And it's probably the same, playing table tennis or something. There's something

02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:54.640
in the mind, which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations about exactly that.

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:59.280
And it's amazing, you can run that astonishing speed down a hillside with no idea how you did it at

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:03.280
all. And then you panic, when you think, I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this,

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:06.800
I've got to think about where I'm going to put my foot. So you slow down a bit and try to bring

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:12.400
those conscious mind in. And then you do, you crash, you can't, you cannot think consciously

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:19.680
while running downhill. So it's amazing. It's amazing how many calculations the mind is able

02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:24.720
to make. And now the problem with playing chess or something, if you're able to make all of those

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:31.200
subconscious kind of forward calculations about what is the likely outcome of this move now,

02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:36.480
in the way that we can by running down a hillside or something, you know, it's partly about what

02:21:36.480 --> 02:21:41.040
we have adapted to do. It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in running fast

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:46.400
downhill is something that we'd better be bloody good at otherwise we're going to be eaten. Whereas

02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:53.360
trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves into the future is not something we've ever been called

02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:58.320
on to do. Two or three, four moves into the future is quite enough for most of us most of the time.

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:09.280
Yeah. Yeah. So the, yeah, just solving chess may not, we may not be as far towards solving the

02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:18.560
problem of downhill running as we might think just because we solve chess. Still, it's beautiful to

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:27.920
see creativity. Humans create machines that are able to create art and art on the chess board and

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:35.760
art otherwise. Who knows how far that takes us. So I mentioned Andre Carpathia earlier. Him and I

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:41.280
are big fans of yours. If you're taking votes, his suggestion was you should write your next book on

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:50.320
the Fermi Paradox. So let me ask you on the topic of alien life. Since we've been talking about life

02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:55.680
and we're a kind of aliens. How many alien civilizations are out there? Do you think?

02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:04.480
Well, the universe is very big. So some, but not as many as most people would like to think is my

02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:14.560
view because the idea that there is a trajectory going from simple cellular life like bacteria

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:20.480
all the way through to humans. It seems to me there's some big gaps along that way that the

02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:26.320
eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is

02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:33.200
another. Another interesting gap is a long gap from the origin of the eukaryotic cell to the

02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:40.480
first animals. That was about a billion years, maybe more than that. A long delay in where

02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:44.720
no oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. So from the first appearance of oxygen in the

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:50.080
Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals to respire, it was close to two billion years.

02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:57.040
Why so long? It seems to be planetary factors. It seems to be geology as much as anything else.

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:03.280
And we don't really know what was going on. So the idea that there's a kind of an inevitable

02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:13.120
march towards complexity and sentient life, I don't think is right. It doesn't, not to say,

02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:16.880
it's not going to happen, but I think it's not going to happen often.

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.560
So if you think of earth, given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:30.240
do you have a sense that life, complex life, intelligent life happen really quickly on earth

02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:37.440
or really long? So just to get a sense of, are you more sort of saying that it's very

02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:44.240
unlikely to get the kind of conditions required to create humans? Or is it even if you have the

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.440
condition it's just statistically difficult? I think the, I mean, the problem, the single

02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:53.200
great problem at the center of all of that to my mind is the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:57.520
which happened once and without eukaryotes, nothing else would have happened. And that is

02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:02.400
something that- That's because you're saying it's super important, the eukaryotes, but-

02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:07.040
I'm saying tantamount to saying that it is impossible to build something as complex as

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:12.240
a human being from bacterial cells. Totally agree and some deep fundamental way. But it's just

02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:16.880
like a one cell going inside another. Is that so difficult to get to work right?

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:25.680
Well, again, it happened once. And if you think about, if you think about, I mean,

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:30.400
I'm in a minority view in this position, most biologists probably wouldn't agree with me anyway.

02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:35.600
But if you think about the starting point, we've got a simple cell. It's an archaeal cell,

02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:40.000
we can be fairly sure about that. So it looks a lot like a bacterium, but it's in fact from this

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:46.080
other domain of life. So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell. That means it doesn't have anything.

02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:51.440
It doesn't have a nucleus. It doesn't really have complex endomembrane. It has a little bit of stuff,

02:25:51.440 --> 02:26:00.480
but not that much. And it takes up an endosymbiont. So what happens next? And the answer is basically

02:26:00.480 --> 02:26:08.560
everything to do with complexity. To me, there's a beautiful paradox here. Plants and animals and

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:16.720
fungi all have exactly the same type of cell. But they all have really different ways of living.

02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:24.720
So a plant cell is photosynthetic. They started out as algae in the oceans and so on. So think of

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:33.280
algal blooms, single cell things. The basic cell structure that it's built from is exactly the same

02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:37.280
with a couple of small differences. It's got chloroplasts as well. It's got a vacuole. It's

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.280
got a cell wall. But that's about it. Pretty much everything else is exactly the same in a plant

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:47.920
cell and an animal cell. And yet the ways of life are completely different. So this cell structure

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:52.320
did not evolve in response to different ways of life, different environments. I'm in the ocean

02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:57.680
doing photosynthesis. I'm on land running around as part of an animal. I'm a fungus in the soil,

02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:05.760
spending out long kind of shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium. So they all have the same

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:12.480
underlying cell structure. Why? Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation to the internal

02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:18.080
environment, to having these pesky endosymbionts that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.

02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:21.280
Now, in one way, you could see that as a really good thing because it may be that

02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:24.960
there's some inevitability to this process. As soon as you've got endosymbionts, you're more or

02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:29.200
less bound to go in that direction. Or it could be that there's a huge fluke about it and it's

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:34.320
almost certain to go wrong in just about every case possible, that the conflict will lead to

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:39.680
effectively war leading to death and extinction. And it simply doesn't work out. So maybe it

02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:43.040
happened millions of times and it went wrong every time. Or maybe it only happened once

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.560
and it worked out because it was inevitable. And actually, we simply do not know enough now

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:51.600
to say which of those two possibilities is true, but both of them are a bit grim.

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:57.520
But you're leaning towards, we just got really lucky in that one leap.

02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:02.960
Like we got, so do you have a sense that our galaxy, for example, has just

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.680
maybe millions of planets with bacteria living on it?

02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:12.480
I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets with bacteria living on it practically.

02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:19.360
I mean, there's probably what five to 10 planets per star of which I would hope that at least one

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:26.320
would have bacteria on. So I expect bacteria to be very common. I simply can't put a number

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:29.840
otherwise. I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere. It's not that I think we're living

02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:32.560
in a completely empty universe. That's so fascinating.

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:36.400
But I think that it's not going to happen inevitably and there's something,

02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:43.360
that's not the only problem with complex life on Earth. I mentioned oxygen and animals and so on

02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:48.400
as well. And even humans, we came along very late. You go back five million years and would

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:53.120
be that impressed if we came across a planet full of giraffes? I mean, you'd think, hey,

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.880
there's life here. There's a nice planet to colonize or something. We wouldn't think,

02:28:56.880 --> 02:28:59.280
oh, let's try and have a conversation with this giraffe.

02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:07.760
Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think. I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting

02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:12.800
from an alien perspective or how they would notice. I'll talk to you about cities too,

02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.400
because that's an interesting perspective of how to look at human civilization.

02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:21.680
But your sense, I mean, of course you don't know, but it's an interesting

02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:27.440
world. It's an interesting galaxy. It's an interesting universe to live in.

02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:38.160
That's just like every sun, like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:47.920
Imagine that world. And the galaxy maybe has just a handful, if not one,

02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:56.080
intelligence civilization. That's a wild world. I didn't even think about that world. There's a

02:29:56.080 --> 02:30:03.120
kind of thought that one of the reasons it would be so exciting to find life on Mars or Titan or

02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:11.600
whatever is like, if it's life is elsewhere, then surely, statistically, that life, no matter how

02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:20.320
unlikely, eukaryos, multi-cell organisms, sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult?

02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:27.520
I mean, photosynthesis is figuring out some machinery that involves the chemistry and the

02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:32.800
environment to allow the building up of complex organisms. Surely that would arise.

02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:38.560
But man, I don't know how I would feel about just bacteria everywhere.

02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:42.240
Well, it would be depressing if it was true. I suppose depressing.

02:30:42.240 --> 02:30:45.920
Always natural. I don't know what's more depressing, bacteria everywhere, nothing

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:52.320
everywhere. Yes, either of them are chilling. But whether it's chilling or not, I don't think

02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:59.200
should force us to change our view about whether it's real or not. And what I'm saying may or may

02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:05.520
not be true. So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars? It sounds like you would be less

02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:10.560
excited than some others because you're like, wow. What I would be most interested in is how

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:14.080
similar to life on Earth it would be. It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem because

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:24.080
the likelihood of life having gone to and fro between Mars and the Earth is quite, I wouldn't

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:31.280
say high, but it's not low. It's quite feasible. And so if we found life on Mars and it had very

02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:36.400
similar genetic code, but it was slightly different, most people would interpret that immediately as

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:40.880
evidence that there'd been transit one way or the other and that it was a common origin of life on

02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:44.640
Mars or on the Earth. And it went one way or the other way. The other way to see that question,

02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:49.360
though, would be to say, well, actually, the beginnings of life lie in deterministic chemistry

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:55.440
and thermodynamics, starting with the most likely abundant materials, CO2 and water and

02:31:55.440 --> 02:32:01.840
a wet rocky planet. And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning. And we'll, I won't say inevitably,

02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:06.000
but potentially almost inevitably come up with a genetic code, which is not very far away from

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.840
the genetic code that we already have. So we see subtle differences in the genetic code. What does

02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:17.040
it mean? It could be very difficult to interpret. Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:22.080
or something that truly originated? I think if the stereochemistry was different,

02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:30.080
we have sugars, for example, that are the L form or the D form. And we have D sugars and

02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:38.880
alumino acids right across all of life. But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer and

02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:44.080
the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly possible to

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:49.920
use one or the other one. And the same would almost only go for, and I think George Church

02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:57.120
has been trying to make life based on the opposite stereoisomer. So it's perfectly

02:32:57.120 --> 02:33:02.960
possible to do and it will work. And if we were to find life on Mars that was using the opposite

02:33:02.960 --> 02:33:08.720
stereoisomer, that would be unequivocal evidence that life had started independently there.

02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:13.920
So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa or something like that,

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:18.880
where it's less likely that we shared. And it's harsher conditions, so there's going to be weird

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:25.600
or kind of life. I wouldn't count on that because life started in deep sea hydrothermal vents.

02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:30.880
It's a little harsh. That's pretty harsh. Yeah. So Titan is different. Europa is probably quite

02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:35.360
similar to Earth in the sense that we're dealing with an ocean, some acidic ocean there,

02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:41.440
as the early Earth would have been. And it almost only has hydrothermal systems, same with Enceladus.

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:46.400
We can tell that from these plumes coming from the surface through the ice. We know there's a

02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:51.840
liquid ocean and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is. For Titan, we're dealing with

02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:55.200
liquid methane and things like that. So that would really, if there really is life there,

02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:59.440
it would really have to be very, very different to anything that we know on Earth.

02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:04.000
So the hard leap, the hardest leap, the most important leap is from

02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:16.160
prokaryotes to eukaryotes. What's the second, if we're ranking? You gave a lot of emphasis on

02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:22.320
photosynthesis. Yeah. And that would be my second one, I think. But it's not so much. I mean,

02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:28.640
photosynthesis is part of the problem. It's a difficult thing to do. Again, we know it happened

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:39.120
once. We don't know why it happened once. But the fact that it was kind of taken on board

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:46.160
completely by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts and did very well in completely

02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:50.400
different environments and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest that there's no

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:56.560
problem with exploring. You could have a separate origin that explored this whole domain over there

02:34:56.560 --> 02:35:02.800
that the bacteria had never gone into. So that kind of says that the reason that it only happened

02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:08.560
once is probably because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult. But then it happened

02:35:09.120 --> 02:35:15.680
at least 2.2 billion years ago, right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago,

02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:19.440
when there are some people say there are whiffs of oxygen, there's just kind of traces in the

02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:23.520
fossil in the geochemical record that say maybe there was a bit of oxygen then,

02:35:23.520 --> 02:35:27.760
that's really disputed. Some people say it goes all the way back 4 billion years ago

02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:33.040
and that it was the common ancestor of life on earth was photosynthetic. So immediately you've

02:35:33.040 --> 02:35:39.120
got groups of people who disagree over a 2 billion year period of time about when it started.

02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:47.120
But well, let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal, that's 2.2 billion years ago,

02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:51.360
through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion when oxygen levels definitely got

02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:57.520
close to modern levels, which was around about 550 million years ago. So we've gone more than

02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:04.480
one and a half billion years where the earth was in stasis, nothing much changed,

02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:10.800
as known as the boring billion, in fact. Probably stuff was, that was when Eukaryotes arose somewhere

02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:18.480
in there, but it's... So this idea that the world is constantly changing, that we're constantly

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:24.640
evolving, that we're moving up some ramp is a very human idea. But in reality, there are

02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:36.160
tipping points to a new stable equilibrium, where the cells that are producing oxygen are

02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:41.040
precisely counterbalanced by the cells that are consuming that oxygen, which is why it's 21%

02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:46.320
now and has been that way for hundreds of millions of years. We have a very precise balance.

02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:51.200
You go through a tipping point and you don't know where the next stable state's going to be,

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:56.880
but it can be a long way from here. And so if we change the world with global warming,

02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:01.520
there will be a tipping point. The question is where and when, and what's the next stable state?

02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:07.360
It may be uninhabitable to us. It'll be habitable to life, for sure. But there may be something

02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:13.600
like the Permian extinction, where 95% of species go extinct. And there's a 5 to 10 million year gap,

02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:18.640
and then life recovers, but without humans. And the question statistically, well, without humans,

02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:23.840
but statistically, does that ultimately lead to greater complexity, more interesting life?

02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:30.560
Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE, there was a tipping point,

02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:34.640
which led to a long-term stable state that was equivalent to the Black Sea today,

02:37:34.640 --> 02:37:41.200
which is to say oxygenated at the very surface and stagnant sterile, not sterile, but sulfurous,

02:37:41.200 --> 02:37:48.400
lower down. And that was stable, certainly around the continental margins for more than

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:52.800
a billion years. It was not a state that led to progression in an obvious way.

02:37:55.120 --> 02:37:59.520
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution, like what leads to stable states

02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:09.520
and how often are evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment?

02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:16.000
So maybe other planets are able to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures,

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.080
whatever, some kind of pressure that say you're screwed unless you get your shit together in

02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:28.320
the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of pressure. It seems like Earth, like the boring

02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:33.760
building might be explained in two ways. One is super difficult to take any kind of next step,

02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:38.800
and the second way it could be explained is there's no reason to take the next step.

02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:43.600
No, I think there is no reason, but at the end of it, there was a snowball Earth.

02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:52.880
So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale where the sea was frozen at the equator,

02:38:53.840 --> 02:39:00.160
and that forced change in one way or another. It's not long after that,

02:39:00.160 --> 02:39:03.760
a hundred million years, perhaps after that, so not a short time, but this is when we begin

02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:08.720
to see animals. There was a shift again, another tipping point that led to catastrophic change,

02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:14.880
that led to a take off then. We don't really know why, but one of the reasons why that I discuss in

02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:22.640
the book is about sulfate being washed into the oceans, which sounds incredibly parochial.

02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:31.680
But what the data is showing, we can track roughly how oxygen was going into the atmosphere from

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:39.120
carbon isotopes. So there's two main isotopes of carbon that we need to think about here.

02:39:39.120 --> 02:39:44.400
One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12, and then 1% of carbon is carbon 13,

02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:48.560
which is a stable isotope, and then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive,

02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:57.120
it's trivial in amount. So carbon 13 is 1%, and life and enzymes generally, you can think of

02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:02.400
carbon atoms as little balls bouncing around, ping-pong balls bouncing around. Carbon 12 moves

02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.200
a little bit faster than carbon 13 because it's lighter, and it's more likely to encounter an

02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:13.040
enzyme, and so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter. And so organic matter is enriched,

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:18.080
and this is just an observation, it's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent compared to carbon

02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:24.640
13 relative to what you would expect if it was just equal. And if you then bury organic matter,

02:40:25.520 --> 02:40:32.640
as coal or oil or whatever it may be, then it's no longer oxidized. So some oxygen remains left

02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:37.680
over in the atmosphere, and that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere. And you can work

02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.280
out historically how much oxygen there must have been in the atmosphere by how much

02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:45.600
carbon was being buried, and you think, well, how can we possibly know how much carbon was

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:50.000
being buried? And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12, what you're leaving behind

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:54.560
is more carbon 13 in the oceans, and that precipitates out in limestone. So you can look

02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:59.600
at limestones over these ages and work out what's the carbon 13 signal, and that gives you a kind

02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:05.440
of a feedback on what the oxygen content. Right before the Cambrian explosion, there was what's

02:41:05.440 --> 02:41:10.800
called a negative isotope anomaly excursion, which is basically the carbon 13 goes down by a

02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:17.120
massive amount and then back up again 10 million years later. And what that seems to be saying

02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:27.200
is the amount of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing, which is to say, it was being

02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:33.600
oxidized. And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen. And that should,

02:41:33.600 --> 02:41:39.520
so a big carbon 13 signal says the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,

02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.160
which means there's much more carbon 12 being taken out and being oxidized. Sorry,

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:49.280
this is getting too complex. Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.

02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:53.600
If you calculate the amount of oxygen based on the assumption that all this carbon 12 that's

02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:57.600
being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen, the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere

02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:03.120
gets stripped out. There is none left. And yet the rest of the geological indicators say, no,

02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:08.960
there's oxygen in the atmosphere. So it's kind of a paradox. And the only way to explain this

02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:13.520
paradox just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air, how much stuff is in the oceans

02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:20.080
and so on is to assume that what oxygen was not the oxygen, it was sulfate. Sulfate was being

02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:25.760
washed into the oceans. It's used as an electron acceptor by sulfate reducing bacteria just as

02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:30.160
we use oxygen as an electron acceptor. So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.

02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:36.800
Bacteria did. Yeah. So these are bacteria. So they're

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:42.320
oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate, passing the electrons on to sulfate.

02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:48.400
That reacts with iron to form iron pyrides or fools gold, sinks down to the bottom, gets

02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:54.400
buried out of the system. And this can account for the mass balance. So why does it matter?

02:42:55.040 --> 02:43:01.040
It matters because what it says is there was a chance event, tectonically there was a lot of

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:08.880
sulfate sitting on land as some kind of mineral. So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are

02:43:08.880 --> 02:43:17.520
evaporitic. And because there happened to be some continental collisions, mountain building,

02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:21.760
the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain and happened to get washed into the ocean.

02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:26.880
Yeah. So I wonder how many happy accidents like that are possible.

02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:32.160
Statistically, it's really hard. Maybe you can roll that in statistically. This is the course

02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:37.200
of life on earth. Without all that sulfate being raised up, this Cambrian explosion almost

02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:41.760
certainly would not have happened. And then we wouldn't have had animals and so on and so on.

02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:51.040
This kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion. So let me actually say in several

02:43:51.040 --> 02:44:00.320
ways, folks who challenge the validity of the theory of evolution will give us an example.

02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:04.960
No, I'm not. We'll study in this, but we'll give us an example of the Cambrian explosion as like,

02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:14.640
this thing is weird. Oh, it is weird. So by the question I would have is what's the biggest mystery

02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:21.840
or gap in understanding about evolution? Is it the Cambrian explosion? And if so, how do we,

02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:28.640
what's our best understanding of how to explain? First of all, what is it? In my understanding,

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:33.120
in the short amount of time, maybe 10 million years, 100 million years, something like that,

02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:40.240
a huge number of animals, a variety, diversity of animals were created. Anyway, there's like

02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:44.080
five questions in there. Is that the biggest mystery? No, I don't think it's a particularly

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:50.000
big mystery really anymore. I mean, there are still mysteries about why then,

02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:55.120
and I've just said sulfate being washed into the oceans is one, it needs oxygen and oxygen

02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:02.400
levels rose around that time. So probably before that, they weren't high enough for animals.

02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:07.280
What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.

02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:13.040
We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races and we're seeing

02:45:15.440 --> 02:45:21.600
we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed. And so I talked about the boring

02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:26.800
billion, nothing happens for one and a half, one billion years, one and a half billion years.

02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:34.400
The assumption, and this is completely wrong, this assumption is then that evolution works

02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:40.640
really slowly and that you need billions of years to affect some small change and then another

02:45:40.640 --> 02:45:45.920
billion years to do something. And it's completely wrong. Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it

02:45:45.920 --> 02:45:51.280
stays that way for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years. And Stephen Jay Gould used

02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:55.360
to argue this, he called it punctuated equilibrium, but he was doing it to do with animals and to do

02:45:55.360 --> 02:46:00.320
with the last 500 million years or so, where it's much less obvious than if you think about the

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:05.920
entire planetary history. And then you realize that the first two billion years was bacteria only,

02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.400
you have the origin of life, two billion years of just bacteria, oxygenic photosynthesis

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:16.000
arising here, then you have a global catastrophe, snowball earths and great oxidation event and

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.400
then another billion years of nothing happening and then some period of upheavals and then another

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:24.720
snowball earth and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion. This is long periods of stasis

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:30.720
where the world is in a stable state and it's not geared towards increasing complexity, it's

02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:36.880
just everything is in balance. And only when you have a catastrophic level of global problem like

02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:40.960
a snowball earth, it forces everything out of balance and there's a tipping point and you

02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:49.280
end up somewhere else. Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong. It can be incredibly fast.

02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:55.600
And I mentioned earlier on, in theory, it would take half a million years to invent an eye,

02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:03.520
for example, from a light sensitive spot. It doesn't take long to convert one kind of tube

02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:09.120
into a tube with nobles on it, into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms and then one

02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:14.720
end is ahead with it, it starts out as a swelling. It's not difficult intellectually to understand

02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:21.760
how these things can happen. It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly, but we're used to

02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:28.160
human time scales. And what we need to talk about is generations of things that live for a year

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:34.640
in the ocean. And then a million years is a million generations and the amount of change that

02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:39.440
you can do, you can affect in that period of time is enormous. And we're dealing with large

02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:46.160
populations of things where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes. And so again, as soon as

02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:53.280
you throw in the competition of predators and prey and you're ramping up the scale of evolution,

02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:58.080
it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly when the environment allows it to happen.

02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:02.240
So I don't think there's a big mystery. There's lots of details that need to be filled in.

02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:06.320
I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:15.040
The big mystery in biology is consciousness. Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:30.560
I mean, you said biology, not psychology. Because from a biology perspective, it seems like

02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:37.120
intelligence and consciousness all are the same, like weird, like all the brain stuff.

02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:43.280
I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult, I suppose. I mean, I see it as a

02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:49.360
form of computing and I don't know much about computing. So you don't know much about consciousness

02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:58.320
either. So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see that consciousness you do know

02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:04.720
a lot about as a human being. No, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring of a brain

02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:14.880
as a series of, in pretty much the same way as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry

02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:21.680
of it. The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings, as we were talking

02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:28.800
about earlier on. Yeah, I just, I think, I think we oversimplify intelligence. I think the dance,

02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:38.880
the magic of reasoning is as interesting as the magic of feeling. We tend to think of reasoning

02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:48.160
as like very, running a very simplistic algorithm. I think reasoning is the interplay between memory,

02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:52.080
whatever the hell's going on, the unconscious mind, all of that.

02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:59.280
I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all. Obviously, it's extraordinarily

02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:05.440
exquisitely complex, but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.

02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:13.360
Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah, there's a big cloak of mystery around

02:50:13.360 --> 02:50:18.400
consciousness. I mean, let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.

02:50:19.360 --> 02:50:26.640
Classical physics is logical, and you can understand that the kind of language we're

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:30.320
dealing with, it's almost at the human level, we're dealing with stars and things that we

02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:35.600
can see. And when you get to quantum mechanics and things, it's practically impossible for

02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:41.760
the human mind to compute what just happened there. Yeah, I mean, that is the same. It's like,

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:48.000
you understand mathematically the notes of a musical composition, that's intelligence.

02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:58.000
Why makes you feel a certain way? That is much harder to understand. Yeah, that's really,

02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:05.600
but it was interesting framing that that's a mystery at the core of biology. I wonder

02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:12.000
who solves consciousness. I tend to think consciousness will be solved by the engineer,

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:21.280
meaning the person who builds it, who keeps trying to build the thing versus biology,

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:30.240
such a complicated system. I feel like the building blocks of consciousness from a biological

02:51:30.240 --> 02:51:36.640
perspective are like, that's like the final creation of a human being. So you have to

02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:42.880
understand the whole damn thing. You said electrical fields, but like electrical fields plus

02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:50.000
plus everything at the whole shebang. I mean, trying to agree. I mean, my feeling is from

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:54.000
my meagre knowledge of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough is usually comes

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:59.520
through from a field that was not related to it. So if anyone is not going to be a biologist who

02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:06.400
solves consciousness, just because biologists are too embedded in the nature of the problem.

02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:09.520
And then nobody's going to believe you when you've done it because nobody's going to be able to

02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:16.880
prove that this AI is in fact conscious and sad in any case, and any more than you can prove

02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:23.520
that a dog is conscious and sad. So it tells you that it is in good language and you must believe

02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:30.720
it. But I think most people will accept if faced with that, that that's what it is. All of this

02:52:31.600 --> 02:52:34.240
probability of complex life.

02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:41.520
In one way, I think why it matters is that

02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:50.640
my expectation, I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years or so if we survive at all

02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:56.640
that AI will increasingly dominate and pretty much anything that we put out into space going

02:52:56.720 --> 02:53:03.280
looking for other well for the universe for what's out there will be AI won't be won't be us we

02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:08.080
won't be doing that or when we do it'll be on a much more limited scale. I suppose the same would

02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:14.800
apply to any alien civilization. So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there,

02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:19.840
we should be looking for AI out there. But then we face the problem

02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:28.240
that I don't see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.

02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:32.160
You can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.

02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:38.560
And if the principles that govern the evolution of life on earth apply to other planets as well,

02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:46.320
and I think a lot of them would, then the likelihood of ending up with a human like

02:53:46.320 --> 02:53:52.000
civilization capable of giving rise to AI in the first place is massively limited.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.720
Once you've done it once, perhaps it takes over the universe and maybe there's no issue.

02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:02.480
But it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked that you're not going to just turn a

02:54:02.480 --> 02:54:07.520
sterile planet into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics first.

02:54:08.480 --> 02:54:14.880
You have to run the evolutionary computation with the organics to create AI.

02:54:14.880 --> 02:54:19.360
How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid of an intelligent designer?

02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:25.040
The origin of AI is going to have to be in the chemistry of a planet.

02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:33.520
But that's not a limiting factor, right? So let me ask the Fermi Paradox question.

02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:40.720
Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful world of

02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:48.640
just billions of planets with bacteria on it and very few intelligent civilizations.

02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:56.320
And yet there's a few out there. Why haven't we at scale seen them visit us?

02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:00.640
What's your sense? Is it because they don't exist?

02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:05.680
Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe at the right time. That's the simplest

02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:11.440
answer for it. Is that the one you find the most compelling? Or is there some other explanation?

02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:17.920
I find that, you know, it's not that I find it more compelling. It's that I find more probable.

02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:22.720
And I find all of them, I mean, there's a lot of hand waving in this, we just don't know.

02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:29.200
So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth to what might happen somewhere else.

02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:35.360
And it gives to my mind a bit of a pessimistic view of bacteria everywhere and only occasional

02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:41.040
intelligent life. And, you know, running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else that

02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:45.520
you would necessarily be any more excited about making contact with than you would be making

02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:53.200
contact with them on Earth. So, so I think the chances are pretty limited. And the chances of

02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:58.160
us surviving is pretty limited too. And the way we're going on at the moment, the likelihood

02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:04.240
of us not making ourselves extinct within the next few hundred years, possibly within the next

02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:11.520
50 or 100 years, seems quite small. I hope we can do better than that. So maybe the only thing

02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:15.840
that will survive from humanity will be AI. And maybe AI, once it exists, and once it's capable

02:56:15.840 --> 02:56:22.720
of effectively copying itself and cutting humans out of the loop, then maybe that will take over

02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:27.920
the universe. I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness to the way you described that. But isn't

02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:37.680
that also potentially beautiful that that's the next step of life? I suppose, from your

02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:40.800
perspective, as long as it carries the flame of consciousness somehow.

02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:44.480
I think yes, there can be some beauty to it being the next step of life. And I don't know if

02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:51.120
consciousness matters or not from that point of view, to be honest with you. But there's

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:57.840
some sadness, yes, probably, because I think it comes down to the selfishness that we were

02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:05.440
talking about earlier on. I am an individual with a desire not to be kind of displaced from life.

02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:12.720
I want to stay alive. I want to be here. So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would

02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:19.520
feel is that we will just be wiped out. So there will be potential conflicts between AI and humans

02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:22.960
and that AI will win because it's a lot smarter.

02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:30.800
Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs if consciousness is just an intermediate stage

02:57:31.920 --> 02:57:39.600
between bacteria and AI. I would see bacteria as being potentially a primitive form of

02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:46.000
consciousness. The whole of life on earth, to my mind, is capable of some form of feelings

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.840
in response to the environment. That's not to say it's intelligent, though it's got its own

02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.080
algorithms for intelligence, but nothing comparable with us. I think it's beautiful what a planet,

02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:00.880
what a sterile planet can come up with. It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this

02:58:00.880 --> 02:58:07.680
stuff that we see around us and that either we or whatever we produce is capable of destroying

02:58:07.680 --> 02:58:18.080
all of that. It is a sad thought, but it's also hugely pessimistic. I'd like to think that we're

02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:22.560
capable of giving rise to something which is at least as good if not better than us as AI.

02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:30.800
Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing that is able to propagate throughout the

02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:37.360
universe more efficiently than humans can or extensions of humans, some merger with AI and

02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:45.520
humans. Where does that come from? Bioengineering of the human body to extend its life somehow

02:58:46.640 --> 02:58:52.480
to carry that flame of consciousness and that personality and the beautiful tension that's

02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:58.400
within all of us carry that through to multiple planets, to multiple solar systems all out there

02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:05.440
in the universe. I mean, that's a beautiful vision. Whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans

02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:13.280
can. That's an exciting possibility and especially meeting other alien civilizations in that same

02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:17.200
kind of way. Do you think aliens have consciousness? If they're organic.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:23.280
Organic connected to consciousness. I mean, I think any system which is going to bootstrap

02:59:23.280 --> 02:59:31.040
itself up from planetary origins, let me finish this and then I come onto something else,

02:59:31.040 --> 02:59:36.480
but from planetary origins is going to face similar constraints and those constraints are

02:59:36.480 --> 02:59:41.600
going to be addressed in similar basic engineering ways and I think it will be cellular and I think

02:59:41.600 --> 02:59:47.040
it will have electrical charges and I think it will have to be selected in populations over time

02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:51.520
and all of these things will tend to give rise to the same processes as the simplest fix to a

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:56.800
difficult problem. So I would expect it to be conscious. Yes, and I would expect it to resemble

02:59:56.800 --> 03:00:04.000
life on earth in many ways. When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16, I remember reading a book by

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:11.200
Fred Hoyle called The Black Cloud, which I was budding biologists at the time and this was the

03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:15.120
first time I'd come across someone that really challenging the heart of biology and saying,

03:00:16.080 --> 03:00:22.160
you are far too parochial. You're thinking about life as carbon-based. Here's a life form which is

03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:33.120
interstellar dust on a solar system scale and it's a novel, but I felt enormously challenged

03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:42.240
by that novel because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was, how narrow-minded I

03:00:42.240 --> 03:00:46.480
was being and here was a great physicist with a completely different conception of what life could

03:00:46.480 --> 03:00:54.480
be. And since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways and I'm reluctant to say the attacks

03:00:54.480 --> 03:01:01.760
make more sense to me than the original story, which is to say, even in terms of information

03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:06.000
processing, if you're on that scale and there's a limit of the speed of how quickly can something

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:16.480
think if you're needing to broadcast across the solar system, it's going to be slow. It's not

03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:21.760
going to hold a conversation with you on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining,

03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:26.720
or at least not by any easy way of doing it, assuming that the speed of light is a limit.

03:01:28.240 --> 03:01:34.480
And then again, you really can't. This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago and I

03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:40.240
do think he's right. There is no other way to generate this level of complexity than natural

03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:45.680
selection. Nothing else can do it. You need populations and you need selection in populations

03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:55.360
and a kind of an isolated interstellar cloud. Again, there's unlimited time and maybe there's

03:01:55.360 --> 03:02:02.560
no problems with distance, but you need to have a certain frequency of generational time

03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:10.240
to generate a serious level of complexity. And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.

03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:16.240
Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution is a really powerful tool here on

03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:21.120
Earth, but there could be other mechanisms. So whenever I don't know if you're familiar with

03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:29.120
cellular automata, but complex systems that have really simple components and seemingly

03:02:29.120 --> 03:02:34.480
move based on simple rules when they're taken as a whole, really interesting complexity emerges.

03:02:35.520 --> 03:02:39.840
I don't know what the pressures on that are. It's not really selection, but

03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:44.240
interesting complexity seems to emerge. And that's not well understood exactly.

03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:51.840
I think there's a difference between complexity and evolution. So some of the work we're doing on

03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:59.360
the origin of life is thinking about how does, well, how do genes arise? How does information

03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:05.040
arise in biology? And thinking about it from the point of view of reacting CO2 with hydrogen,

03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:09.120
what do you get? Well, what you're going to get is carboxylic acids and amino acids. It's

03:03:09.120 --> 03:03:15.520
quite hard to make nucleotides. And it's possible to make them and it's been done and it's been

03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:21.040
done following this pathway as well. But you make trace amounts. And so the next question, assuming

03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:25.200
that this is the right way of seeing the question, which maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is,

03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:30.880
is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides then? How do you become more complex and better

03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:36.880
becoming a nucleotide generating machine? And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,

03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:42.960
some form of autocatalysis. So that can work. And we know it happens in biology. If this

03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:49.520
nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation, then you're going to increase the rate of flux

03:03:49.520 --> 03:03:53.120
through the whole system and you're going to effectively steepen the driving force to make

03:03:53.120 --> 03:04:01.520
more nucleotides. And this can be inherited because there are forms of membrane heredity that you

03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:07.040
can have. And there are, effectively, you can, if a cell divides in two and it's got a lot of stuff

03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:12.640
inside it and that stuff is basically bound as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,

03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:19.040
then it will inevitably regenerate itself. And so you can develop greater complexity.

03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:25.120
But everything that I've said depends on the underlying rules of thermodynamics. There is

03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:31.600
no evolvability about that. It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,

03:04:32.160 --> 03:04:36.720
assuming that you're able to increase the driving force through the system. You will

03:04:36.720 --> 03:04:41.040
generate more of the same, you'll expand on what you can do, but you'll never get anything different

03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:47.520
than that. And it's only when you introduce information into that as a gene, as a kind of

03:04:48.160 --> 03:04:54.480
small stretch of RNA, which can be random stretch, then you get real evolvability,

03:04:54.480 --> 03:04:58.400
then you get biology as we know it, but you also have selection as we know it.

03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:02.640
Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.

03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:09.680
That's the kind of memory of the system. So it's not, yeah, at the local level,

03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:14.560
it's propagation of copying yourself and changing and improving your adaptability

03:05:14.560 --> 03:05:22.720
to the environment. But if you look at earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory. That's the key

03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:31.040
feature of it. In what way? It remembers the stuff it tries. Like if you were to describe

03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:36.240
earth, I think evolution is something that we experience

03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:44.320
as individual organisms. That's how the individual organisms interact with each other.

03:05:44.320 --> 03:05:50.320
There's a natural selection. But when you look at earth as an organism in its entirety,

03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:55.120
how would you describe it? I mean,

03:05:55.120 --> 03:06:02.240
well, not as an organism. I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely. And James Lovelock originally

03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:08.160
put Gaia out as an organism that had somehow evolved. And he was immediately attacked by

03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:15.200
lots of people. And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat because that was more of a poetic

03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:23.280
vision than the science. The science is now called earth systems science. And it's really about how

03:06:23.280 --> 03:06:27.840
does the world kind of regulate itself so it remains within the limits which are hospitable

03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:35.360
to life. And it does it amazingly well. And it is working at a planetary level of kind of

03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:41.280
integration of regulation. But it's not evolving by natural selection. And it can't because there's

03:06:41.280 --> 03:06:46.800
only one of it. And so it can change over time, but it's not evolving. All the evolution is

03:06:46.800 --> 03:06:51.520
happening in the parts of the system. Yeah, but it's a self-sustaining organism.

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:53.680
No, it's sustained by the sun.

03:06:55.200 --> 03:07:01.280
Right. So I mean, you don't think it's possible to see earth as its own organism?

03:07:02.320 --> 03:07:06.800
I think it's poetic and beautiful. And I often refer to the earth as a living planet.

03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:12.320
But it's not in biological terms, an organism. No.

03:07:13.680 --> 03:07:20.480
If aliens were to visit earth, what would they notice? What would be the basic

03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:22.080
unit of light they would notice?

03:07:22.960 --> 03:07:27.200
Trees, probably. I mean, it's green. It's green and blue. I think that's the first thing you'd

03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:31.920
notice is it stands out from space as being different to any of the other planets.

03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:35.120
So it would notice the trees at first, because the green...

03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:37.040
Well, I would notice the green, yes.

03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:41.680
Yeah. And then probably notice to figure out the photosynthesis.

03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:43.920
Probably notice cities a second, I suspect.

03:07:44.880 --> 03:07:45.920
Yeah. First.

03:07:45.920 --> 03:07:49.040
They arrived at night, they noticed cities first, that's for sure.

03:07:49.040 --> 03:07:55.200
It depends the time. You write quite beautifully in Transformers once again.

03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:57.280
I think you open the book in this way. I don't remember.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:04.160
From space describing earth, it's such an interesting idea of what earth is.

03:08:05.520 --> 03:08:12.160
You also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless,

03:08:12.160 --> 03:08:13.920
which is a beautifully poetic thing.

03:08:14.560 --> 03:08:21.280
You open Transformers with from space, it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating the

03:08:21.280 --> 03:08:26.960
blue-green colors of the living earth. It is crisscrossed by regular patterns and convergent

03:08:26.960 --> 03:08:33.760
striations. There's a central amorphous density where these scratches seem lighter.

03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:40.160
This, quote, growth does not look alive, although it has extended out along some lines,

03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:43.360
and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.

03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:48.480
Across the globe, there are thousands of them, varying in shape and detail,

03:08:48.480 --> 03:08:52.560
but all of them gray, angular, and organic, spreading.

03:08:53.680 --> 03:08:55.600
Yet at night, they light up.

03:08:56.560 --> 03:08:59.680
Glowing up the dark sky, suddenly beautiful.

03:08:59.680 --> 03:09:03.920
Perhaps these cankers on the landscape are in some sense living.

03:09:03.920 --> 03:09:09.440
There's a controlled flow of energy, there must be information and some form of metabolism,

03:09:09.440 --> 03:09:15.840
some turnover of materials. Are they alive? No, of course not. They are cities.

03:09:17.120 --> 03:09:20.000
So is there some sense that cities are living beings?

03:09:20.880 --> 03:09:23.840
You think aliens would think of them as living beings?

03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:26.080
Well, it would be easy to see it that way, wouldn't it?

03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:32.160
It wakes up at night. They wake up at night.

03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:34.560
Strictly nocturnal, yes.

03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:38.960
I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough to get here would understand

03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:41.520
that they're not living beings.

03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:51.600
My reason for saying that is that we tend to think of biology in terms of information and

03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:57.520
forget about cells. I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell as a city and the

03:09:57.520 --> 03:10:02.960
energy flow through the city and the energy flow through cells and the turnover of materials.

03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:09.200
An interesting thing about cities is that they're not really exactly governed by anybody.

03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:15.680
There are regulations and systems and whatever else, but it's pretty loose.

03:10:18.320 --> 03:10:21.600
They have their own life, their own way of developing over time.

03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:25.040
And in that sense, they're quite biological.

03:10:26.640 --> 03:10:32.480
There was a plan after the Great Fire of London, Christopher Wren was making plans

03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:38.720
not only for St Paul's Cathedral, but also to rebuild in large Parisian-type boulevards,

03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:42.880
a large part of the area of central London that was burned.

03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:47.280
It never happened because they didn't have enough money, I think.

03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:49.840
But it's interesting what was in the plan. There were all these boulevards,

03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:55.280
but there were no pubs and no coffee houses or anything like that.

03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:02.080
The reality was London just kind of grew up in a set of jumbled streets.

03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:05.360
It was the coffee houses and the pubs where all the business of the city of London was

03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:08.880
being done and that was where the real life of the city was. And no one had planned it.

03:11:08.880 --> 03:11:12.560
The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.

03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.240
And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned, it's not controlled by the genes

03:11:16.240 --> 03:11:19.600
in the nucleus and the way that we might like to think that it is, but it's kind of

03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:24.640
evolved entity that has the same kind of flux, the same animation, the same life.

03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:31.200
So I think it's a beautiful analogy, but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.

03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:37.280
See, I disagree with you. I disagree with you. I think you are so steeped.

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:46.080
And actually the entirety of science, the history of science is steeped in a biological

03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:52.160
framework of thinking about what is life. And not just biological, it's very human-centric too.

03:11:52.960 --> 03:12:01.760
That the human organism is the epitome of life on earth. I don't know. I think there is some

03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:08.080
deep fundamental way in which a city is a living being in the same way that a human-

03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:14.720
It doesn't give rise to an offspring city. It doesn't work by natural selection,

03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:21.840
it works by, if anything, memes it works by. It's kind of copying itself conceptually as a

03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:29.920
mode of being. So I mean, maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms that are really essential to

03:12:29.920 --> 03:12:35.840
life on earth. Maybe it's much more important about the collective aspect of human nature,

03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:41.600
the collective intelligence than the individual intelligence. Maybe the collective humanity

03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:48.720
is the organism. And the thing that defines the collective intelligence of humanity is the ideas

03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:55.840
and maybe the way that manifests itself is cities, maybe or societies or geographically

03:12:55.840 --> 03:13:00.960
constrained societies or nations and all that kind of stuff. I mean, from an alien perspective,

03:13:00.960 --> 03:13:07.520
it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing, not from a place of ignorance.

03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:13.360
What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works. I mean, I don't have any problem with what you're

03:13:13.360 --> 03:13:22.320
saying, really, except that it's not possible without the humans, we went from a hunter-gatherer

03:13:22.320 --> 03:13:29.120
type economy, if you like, without cities. And as soon as we get into human evolution

03:13:29.120 --> 03:13:34.640
and culture and society and so on, then yes, there are other forms of evolution,

03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:41.600
other forms of change, but cities don't directly propagate themselves. They propagate themselves

03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:46.080
through human societies and human societies only exist because humans as individuals propagate

03:13:46.080 --> 03:13:51.680
themselves. So there's a hierarchy there and without the humans in the first place,

03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:58.720
none of the rest of it exists. So do you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit on which

03:13:58.800 --> 03:14:02.160
evolution can operate? I think it's a really important thing, yes.

03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:09.520
Yeah. And we don't have any other better ideas than evolution for how to create one.

03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:14.560
I never came across a better idea than evolution. I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.

03:14:16.080 --> 03:14:21.360
You mentioned, oh, that's no automator and so on. And I don't think specifically about that,

03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:25.280
but I have thought about it in terms of selective units at the origin of life and

03:14:25.280 --> 03:14:30.320
the difference between evolvability and complexity or just increasing complexity,

03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:38.400
but within very narrowly defined limits. The great thing about genes and about selection

03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:42.480
is it just knocks down all those limits. It gives you a world of information in the end,

03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:48.800
which is limited only by the biophysical reality of what kind of an organism you are,

03:14:48.800 --> 03:14:54.640
what kind of a planet you live on and so on. And cities and all these other forms that look alive

03:14:54.640 --> 03:15:00.800
and could be described as alive because they can't propagate themselves, can only exist as the

03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:08.320
product of something that did propagate itself. Yeah. I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth

03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:14.800
to that kind of way of looking at things, but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud

03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:22.800
among us. I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this because I can't say that my world

03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:28.800
view is particularly uplifting, but in some sense, it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not,

03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:36.480
science is about what's reality, what's out there, why is it this way? And I think there's beauty

03:15:36.480 --> 03:15:44.000
in that too. There's beauty in darkness. You write about life and death sort of at the biological

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:51.680
level. Does the question of suicide, why live, does the question of why the human mind is capable

03:15:51.760 --> 03:16:02.320
of depression, are you able to introspect that from a place of biology? Why are minds, why we humans

03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:14.480
can go to such dark places? Why can we commit suicide? Why can we go suffer, suffer period,

03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:21.360
but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness of going to a dark place that depression can take

03:16:21.360 --> 03:16:31.280
you? Is this a feature of life or is it a bug? I don't know. I mean, if it's a feature of life,

03:16:31.280 --> 03:16:35.200
then I suppose it would have to be true of other organisms as well. And I don't know

03:16:36.480 --> 03:16:43.200
when we were talking about dogs earlier on, and they can certainly be very sad and upset and may

03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:47.840
mooch for days after their owner died or something like that. So I suspect in some sense it's a

03:16:47.840 --> 03:16:59.120
feature of biology. It's probably a feature of mortality. But beyond all of that, I mean,

03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:05.760
I guess there's two ways you could come at it. One of them would be to say, well, you can effectively

03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:10.560
do the math and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless and that there's really no point

03:17:10.560 --> 03:17:16.880
in me being here any longer. And maybe that's true. In the greater scheme of things, you can

03:17:16.880 --> 03:17:21.360
justify yourself in terms of society, but society will be gone soon enough as well. And you end

03:17:21.360 --> 03:17:27.680
up with a very bleak place just by logic. In some sense, it's surprising that we can find any meaning

03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:33.280
at all. Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in, that we have transient joy. But with

03:17:33.280 --> 03:17:38.880
transient joy, we have transient misery as well. And sometimes with everything in biology,

03:17:40.640 --> 03:17:45.760
getting the regulation right is practically impossible. You will always have a bell-shaped

03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:50.960
curve where some people, unfortunately, are at the joy end and some people are at the misery end.

03:17:50.960 --> 03:17:58.000
And that's the way brains are wired. And I doubt there's ever an escape from that. It's the same

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:03.280
with sex and everything else as well. We're dealing with it. You can't regulate it. So

03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:07.280
anything goes. It's all part of biology.

03:18:07.520 --> 03:18:20.320
Amen to that. Let me on writing in your book, Power Sex and Suicide. First of all,

03:18:20.320 --> 03:18:26.240
can I just read off the books you've written? If there's any better titles and topics to be

03:18:26.240 --> 03:18:30.080
covered, I don't know what they are. It makes me look forward to whatever you're going to write

03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:35.280
next. I hope there's things you write next. So you first, you wrote Oxygen, the molecule that

03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:40.560
made the world, as we've talked about, this idea of the role of oxygen in life on earth.

03:18:40.560 --> 03:18:48.400
Then wait for it. Power Sex Suicide, mitochondria and the meaning of life. Then life ascending,

03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:53.680
the 10 great inventions of evolution. The vital question, the first book I've read of yours,

03:18:53.680 --> 03:18:59.040
the vital question, why is life the way it is? And the new book, Transformer,

03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:07.440
The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death. In Power Sex and Suicide, you write about writing,

03:19:07.440 --> 03:19:12.720
or about a lot of things, but I have a question about writing. You write,

03:19:13.520 --> 03:19:19.520
in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision

03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:26.720
to the guide's entry on the earth, which originally read harmless. By the way, I would also, as a

03:19:26.800 --> 03:19:32.160
side quest, as a side question, would like to ask you what would be your summary of what earth is.

03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:40.560
You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down by the guide to read mostly harmless. I

03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:47.280
suspect that too many new additions suffer a similar fate, if not through absurd editing decisions,

03:19:47.280 --> 03:19:53.200
at least through a lack of meaningful change in content. As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed

03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:59.200
since the first edition of Power Sex, Suicide was published. And I am resisting the temptation

03:19:59.200 --> 03:20:05.760
to make any lame revisions. Some say that even Darwin lessened the power of his arguments in

03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:11.280
the origin of species through his multiple revisions, in which he dealt with criticisms

03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:17.120
and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction. I prefer my original to speak for

03:20:17.200 --> 03:20:23.760
itself, even if it turns out to be wrong. Let me ask the question about writing,

03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:29.280
both your students in the academic setting, but also writing some of the most brilliant

03:20:29.280 --> 03:20:36.880
writings on science and humanity I've ever read. What's the process of writing? How do you advise

03:20:36.960 --> 03:20:48.720
other humans? If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you and just young anybody and give

03:20:48.720 --> 03:20:53.840
advice about how to write and how to write well about these big topics, what would you say?

03:20:55.600 --> 03:21:03.520
I suppose there's a couple of points. One of them is what's the story? What do I want to know?

03:21:03.520 --> 03:21:10.720
What do I want to convey? Why does it matter to anybody? And very often the biggest,

03:21:10.720 --> 03:21:18.960
most interesting questions, the childlike questions are the one that actually everybody

03:21:18.960 --> 03:21:24.960
wants to ask, but then quite do it in case they look stupid. And one of the nice things about

03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:29.200
being in science is the longer you're in, the more you realize that everybody doesn't know the

03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:36.000
answer to these questions and it's not so stupid to ask them after all. So trying to

03:21:37.200 --> 03:21:44.560
ask the questions that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16, when I was really

03:21:44.560 --> 03:21:52.480
hungry to know about the world and didn't know very much about it and wanted to go to the edge

03:21:52.480 --> 03:22:00.960
of what we know, but be helped to get there. I don't want to be too much terminology and so I

03:22:00.960 --> 03:22:09.520
want someone to keep a clean eye on what the question is. Beyond that, I've wondered a lot

03:22:09.520 --> 03:22:16.640
about who am I writing for? And that was in the end, the only answer I had was myself at the age

03:22:16.640 --> 03:22:25.040
of 15 or 16. Because even if you're, you just don't know who's reading but also where are they

03:22:25.040 --> 03:22:32.320
reading it? Are they reading it in the bath or in bed or on the metro or listening to an audio

03:22:32.320 --> 03:22:39.920
book? Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages because you read three pages at a time

03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:45.920
or are you really irritated by that? You're going to get criticism from people who are

03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:49.440
irritated by what you're doing and you don't know who they are or what you're going to do

03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:54.960
that's going to irritate people. And in the end, all you can do is just try and please yourself.

03:22:56.560 --> 03:23:02.720
And that means, well, what are these big fun, fascinating, big questions? And what do we know

03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:10.000
about it? And can I convey that? And I kind of learned in trying to write, first of all,

03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:16.320
say what we know. And I was shocked in the first couple of books how often I came up

03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:23.920
quickly against all the stuff we don't know. And if you're trying to, I've realised later on in

03:23:24.640 --> 03:23:30.960
supervising various physicists and mathematicians who are PhD students and their maths is way

03:23:30.960 --> 03:23:36.080
beyond what I can do. But the process of trying to work out what are we actually going to model

03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:39.200
here? What's going into this equation? It's a very similar one to writing. What am I going to

03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:45.040
put on a page? What's the simplest possible way I can encapsulate this idea so that I now

03:23:45.040 --> 03:23:50.160
have it as a unit that I can kind of see how it interacts with the other units? And you realise

03:23:50.160 --> 03:23:54.160
that, well, if this is like that and this is like this, then that can't be true.

03:23:56.960 --> 03:24:01.840
So you end up navigating your own path through this landscape. And that can be thrilling because

03:24:01.840 --> 03:24:07.200
you don't know where it's going. And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons my books have

03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:11.440
worked for people because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride that I don't know where

03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:17.280
it's going either. So finding the simplest possible way to explain the things we know

03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:21.520
and the simplest possible way to explain the things we don't know and the tension between those two

03:24:21.520 --> 03:24:29.520
and that's where the story emerges. What about the edit? Do you find yourself to the point of this

03:24:30.480 --> 03:24:37.200
editing doll to most harmless? To arrive at simplicity, do you find

03:24:38.160 --> 03:24:42.560
the edit is productive or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?

03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:49.040
No, I usually find, I think I'm perhaps a better editor than I am a writer. I write and rewrite

03:24:49.040 --> 03:24:53.760
and rewrite and rewrite. Put a bunch of crap on the page first and then see where the edit where it

03:24:53.920 --> 03:24:59.040
takes. Yeah. But then there's the professional editors who come along as well. And I mean,

03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:06.000
in Transformer, the editor came back to me after I'd sent him two months after I sent the

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:11.120
first edition, he'd read the whole thing and he said, the first two chapters prevent a formidable

03:25:11.120 --> 03:25:17.200
hurdle to the general reader. Go and do something about it. And it was the last thing I really

03:25:17.200 --> 03:25:22.000
wanted to do. Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech. Yeah, well, this was an email. But

03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:30.160
I thought about it in, you know, the bottom line is he was right. And so I put the whole thing aside

03:25:30.160 --> 03:25:34.720
for about two months. It's been the summer. This would have been, I guess, last summer.

03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:40.560
And then turned to it with full attention in about September or something and rewrote those

03:25:40.560 --> 03:25:45.920
chapters almost from scratch. I kept some of the material, but it took me a long time to process

03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:50.240
it to work out what needs to change. Where does it need to change? I wasn't writing in this time.

03:25:50.240 --> 03:25:54.320
How am I going to tell this story better so it's more accessible and interesting? And in the end,

03:25:55.040 --> 03:26:00.400
I think it's still difficult. It's still biochemistry. But as he ended up saying,

03:26:00.400 --> 03:26:05.920
now he's got a barreling energy to it. And because he'd told me the truth the first time,

03:26:05.920 --> 03:26:10.400
I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth the second time as well and was delighted.

03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:19.280
Could you give advice to young people in general? Folks in high school, folks in college,

03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:22.960
how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on. Now you've done that in the space of

03:26:22.960 --> 03:26:32.320
biology and expanded out. How can they have a career they can be proud of or have a life

03:26:32.320 --> 03:26:41.920
they can be proud of? Gosh, that's a big question. I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom that you can

03:26:42.480 --> 03:26:48.800
impart to young people. So the only advice that I actually ever give to my students

03:26:50.480 --> 03:26:57.920
is follow what you're interested in. Because they're often worried that if they make this

03:26:57.920 --> 03:27:01.600
decision now and do this course instead of that course, then they're going to restrict

03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:08.800
their career opportunities. And there isn't a career path in science. It's not, I mean,

03:27:08.880 --> 03:27:15.040
there is, but there isn't. There's a lot of competition. There's a lot of death symbolically.

03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:24.640
So who survives? The people who survive are the people who care enough to still do it. And they're

03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:32.320
very often the people who don't worry too much about the future and are able to live in the present.

03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:37.280
Because if you do a PhD, you've competed hard to get onto the PhD, then you have to compete hard

03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:43.840
to get a post-doc job. And you have the next one maybe on another continent. And it's only two

03:27:43.840 --> 03:27:50.560
years anyway. And there's no guarantee you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.

03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:56.960
And there's always the next step to compete. If you get a faculty position, you get a tenure.

03:27:56.960 --> 03:28:01.200
And with tenure, you go full professor and full professor, then you go to some kind of whatever

03:28:01.200 --> 03:28:05.120
the discipline is. There's an award. If you're in physics, you're always competing for the

03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:09.120
there's different awards. And then eventually you're all competing to,

03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:13.760
I mean, there's always a competition. So there is no happiness. Happiness does not lie.

03:28:13.760 --> 03:28:17.840
If you're looking into the future, yes. And if what you're caring about is a career, then

03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:26.720
it's probably not the one for you. If you can put that aside, and I've also worked in industry

03:28:26.720 --> 03:28:30.800
for a brief period and I was made redundant twice. So I know that

03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:36.400
it's, you know, there's no guarantee that you've got a career that way either.

03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:45.200
So live in the moment and try and enjoy what you're doing. And that means really go to the

03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:51.680
go to the themes that you're most interested in and try and follow them as well as you can.

03:28:51.680 --> 03:28:57.440
And that tends to pay back in surprising ways. I don't know if you've found this as well,

03:28:57.440 --> 03:29:06.240
but I found that people will help you often. If they see some light shining in the eye,

03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:13.840
you're excited about their subject. And, you know, just want to talk about it.

03:29:14.640 --> 03:29:19.040
And they know that their friend in California has got a job coming up. They'll say,

03:29:19.040 --> 03:29:24.880
go for this, this guy's all right. You know, they'll use the network to help you out

03:29:24.880 --> 03:29:29.360
if you really care. And you're not going to have a job two years down the line. But if what you

03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:33.440
really care about is what you're doing now, then it doesn't matter if you have a job in two years

03:29:33.440 --> 03:29:40.320
time or not. It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye. And so that's the only

03:29:40.320 --> 03:29:46.960
advice I can give. And most people probably drop out through that system because the fight is just

03:29:46.960 --> 03:29:51.760
not worth it for them. Yeah, when you have the light in your eye, when you have the excitement

03:29:51.760 --> 03:29:56.000
for the thing, what happens is you start to surround yourself with others that are interested

03:29:56.000 --> 03:30:00.160
in that same thing that also have the light. If you really are rigorous about this, because

03:30:00.960 --> 03:30:07.600
I think it does take, it doesn't, it takes effort to make... Oh, you've got to be obsessive.

03:30:07.600 --> 03:30:12.080
But if you're doing what you really love doing, then it's not work anymore is what you do.

03:30:12.080 --> 03:30:16.240
Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself with other people that are obsessed about the

03:30:16.240 --> 03:30:20.400
same thing because depending on... Oh, that takes some work as well, yes. And look.

03:30:20.400 --> 03:30:26.640
Finding the right mentors, the collaborators, because I think one of the problem with

03:30:27.520 --> 03:30:34.560
the PhD process is people are not careful enough in picking their mentors. Those are people,

03:30:35.520 --> 03:30:41.040
mentors and colleagues and so on, those are people are going to define the direction of your life,

03:30:41.040 --> 03:30:47.200
the how much you love a thing, the power of just like the few little conversations you have

03:30:48.160 --> 03:30:54.960
in the hallway, it's incredible. So you have to be a little bit careful in that. Sometimes you

03:30:54.960 --> 03:31:05.120
just get randomly almost assigned, really pursue, I suppose, the subject as much as you pursue the

03:31:05.120 --> 03:31:09.360
people that do that subject. So like both, the whole dance of it. They kind of go together really.

03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:15.280
Yeah, they do. They really do. But take that part seriously. And probably in the way you're

03:31:15.280 --> 03:31:23.200
describing it, careful how you define success because... You'll never find happiness in success.

03:31:23.200 --> 03:31:27.120
I know there's a lovely quote from Robert Lewis Stevenson, I think, who said,

03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:33.840
nothing in life is so disenchanting as attainment. Yeah, so I mean, in some sense,

03:31:34.720 --> 03:31:42.480
the true definition of success is getting to do today what you really enjoy doing,

03:31:42.480 --> 03:31:48.880
just what fills you with joy. And that's ultimately success. Success isn't the thing

03:31:48.880 --> 03:31:56.560
beyond the horizon, the big trophy, the financials. I think it's as close as we can get to happiness.

03:31:56.560 --> 03:32:01.520
That's not to say you're full of joy all the time, but it's as close as we can get to a sustained

03:32:01.520 --> 03:32:05.840
human happiness is by getting some fulfillment from what you're doing on a daily basis. And if

03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:13.440
what you're looking for is the world giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize or a

03:32:13.440 --> 03:32:21.200
fellowship or whatever it is, then I've known people like this who they eat away by the

03:32:22.640 --> 03:32:28.560
anger of the kind of caustic resentment that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.

03:32:29.760 --> 03:32:33.520
And the other way, if you put too much value into those kinds of prizes and you win them,

03:32:34.160 --> 03:32:38.320
I've gotten a chance to see that it also,

03:32:41.200 --> 03:32:45.840
the more, quote unquote, successful you are in that sense, the more you run the danger of

03:32:48.560 --> 03:32:54.720
growing ego so big that you don't get to actually enjoy the beauty of this life,

03:32:54.720 --> 03:33:00.400
you start to believe that you figured it all out, as opposed to I think what ultimately the most

03:33:00.400 --> 03:33:05.600
fun thing is is being curious about everything around you, being constantly surprised, and

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:10.800
these little moments of discovery of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.

03:33:10.800 --> 03:33:14.640
And I think the bigger your ego grows, the more you start to take yourself seriously,

03:33:14.640 --> 03:33:22.640
the less you're able to enjoy that. Oh man, I couldn't agree more. So the summary from harmless

03:33:22.640 --> 03:33:28.160
to mostly harmless in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, how would you try to summarize

03:33:29.120 --> 03:33:37.120
earth? And if you were given, if you had to summarize the whole thing in a couple of sentences,

03:33:37.120 --> 03:33:45.280
and maybe throw in meaning of life in there, like why, why, why, maybe is that a defining

03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:52.800
thing about humans that we care about the meaning of the whole thing? I wonder if that should be

03:33:52.880 --> 03:33:59.280
part of the, these creatures seem to be very lost. Yes, I'm always asking why. I mean,

03:33:59.280 --> 03:34:07.280
that's my defining question is why people used to make a joke. I have a small scar on my forehead

03:34:07.280 --> 03:34:12.720
from a climbing accident years ago. And the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock and he

03:34:12.720 --> 03:34:18.160
shouted something, he shouted below, I think, meaning that the rock was coming down. And I

03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:24.400
hadn't caught what he said. So I looked up and it smashed straight on my forehead. And everybody

03:34:24.400 --> 03:34:33.280
around me took the piss saying he looked up to ask why. Yeah, but that's a human imperative.

03:34:33.280 --> 03:34:39.120
That's part of what it means to be human. Look up to the sky and ask why. And ask why.

03:34:39.760 --> 03:34:43.040
So your question, define the earth.

03:34:47.840 --> 03:34:50.880
I'm not sure I can do that. I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.

03:34:53.440 --> 03:34:55.360
I wouldn't like to say mostly living, but perhaps.

03:34:56.560 --> 03:35:00.880
Mostly living. Well, it's interesting because like if you were to write

03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:10.400
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I suppose, say our idea we talked about the bacteria is the

03:35:10.400 --> 03:35:18.560
most prominent form of life throughout the galaxy and the universe. I suppose the earth would be

03:35:18.560 --> 03:35:25.520
kind of unique and would require abundance in that case. Yeah, it's profligate, it's rich,

03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:32.240
it's enormously living. So how would you describe that it's not bacteria? It's

03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:41.200
eukaryotic. Yeah, well, I mean, that's the technical term, but it is basically.

03:35:45.040 --> 03:35:50.000
Yeah, and then. How would I describe that? I've actually really struggled with that term,

03:35:50.720 --> 03:35:56.240
because the word, I mean, there's few words quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off

03:35:56.240 --> 03:36:01.200
immediately. You start using words like that and they'll leave the room. Krebs cycle is another

03:36:01.200 --> 03:36:08.800
one that gets people to leave the room. So I've tried to think, is there another word for eukaryotic

03:36:08.800 --> 03:36:14.480
that I can use? And really the only word that I've been able to use is complex cells,

03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:22.480
complex life and so on. And that word, it serves one immediate purpose, which is to convey

03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:30.800
an impression. But then it means so many different things just everybody that actually

03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:37.600
is lost immediately. And so it's kind of. Well, that's unnoticeable from the perspective of other

03:36:37.600 --> 03:36:42.800
planets. That is the noticeable face transition of complexity is the eukaryotic.

03:36:45.280 --> 03:36:48.400
What about the harmless and the mostly harmless? Is that kind of?

03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:58.160
Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale. I don't think that humanity is in any danger of

03:36:58.160 --> 03:37:03.200
disturbing the universe at the moment. At the moment, which is why the mostly,

03:37:03.920 --> 03:37:09.440
we don't know, depends what you want us up to. Depends how many rockets. I think it's

03:37:09.440 --> 03:37:16.240
it'll be still even then a while. I think before, before we disturb the fabric of time and space.

03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:21.280
Was the aforementioned Andre Carpathia, I think he summarized earth as

03:37:23.440 --> 03:37:31.120
as a system where you hammer it with a bunch of photons. The input is like photons and the output

03:37:31.120 --> 03:37:37.840
is rockets. Well, that's the hell of a lot of photons before there was a rocket.

03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:43.920
You know, maybe maybe in the span of the universe, it's not, it's not that much time.

03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:49.680
And so, and I do wonder, you know, what the future is, whether we're just in the early

03:37:49.680 --> 03:37:55.200
beginnings of this earth, which is important when you try to summarize it, or we're at the end,

03:37:56.160 --> 03:38:02.800
where humans have finally gained the ability to destroy the entirety of this beautiful project

03:38:02.800 --> 03:38:08.560
we've got going on, that with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses, with all those kinds of

03:38:08.560 --> 03:38:14.000
things. Or just inadvertently through global warming and pollution and so on. We're quite

03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:18.160
capable of that. I mean, we just need to pass a tipping point. I mean, I think we're more likely

03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:23.200
to do it inadvertently than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time. But

03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:33.280
my fear is, is we just don't know where the tipping points are. And we will, we kind of think

03:38:33.280 --> 03:38:38.320
we're smart enough to fix the problem quickly if we really need to. I think that's the overriding

03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:44.000
assumption that we're all right for now. Maybe in 20 years time, it's going to be a calamitous

03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:47.200
problem. And then we'll really need to put some serious mental power into fixing it

03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:54.480
without seriously worrying that perhaps that is too late. And that however brilliant we are,

03:38:55.360 --> 03:39:02.240
it's, we miss the boat. And just walk off the cliff. I don't know. I have optimism in humans

03:39:02.240 --> 03:39:08.720
being clever descendants. Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem. But it's an urgent

03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:15.280
problem. And we need to fix it pretty sharpish. And I do have doubts about whether politically

03:39:15.280 --> 03:39:21.600
we are capable of coming together enough to not just in any one country, but around the planet

03:39:22.320 --> 03:39:27.680
to, I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will? Do we have the vision to

03:39:28.640 --> 03:39:34.800
accomplish it? That's what makes this whole ride fun. I don't know. Not only do we not

03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:39.920
know if we can handle the crises before us, we don't even know all the crises that are going to

03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:46.880
be before us in the next 20 years. The ones I think that will most likely challenge us

03:39:46.880 --> 03:39:51.280
in the 21st century are the ones we don't even expect. People didn't expect World War II.

03:39:51.760 --> 03:39:52.880
At the end of World War I.

03:39:54.400 --> 03:39:59.600
Well, some people did, but not at the end of World War I, but by the late 1920s,

03:39:59.600 --> 03:40:03.920
I think people were beginning to worry about it. Yeah, no, there's always people worrying about

03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:08.800
everything. So if you focus on the thing that people worry about, because there's a million

03:40:08.800 --> 03:40:14.160
things people worry about and 99.9999% of them don't come to be. Of course, the people that

03:40:14.160 --> 03:40:19.520
turn out to be right, they'll say, I knew all along, but that's not an accurate way of knowing

03:40:19.520 --> 03:40:24.800
what you could have predicted. I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it, but nobody

03:40:24.800 --> 03:40:29.360
thought you could have another World War, the war to end all wars. Why would you have another war?

03:40:29.920 --> 03:40:36.080
And the idea of nuclear weapons, just technologically, is a very difficult thing to

03:40:36.080 --> 03:40:41.840
anticipate to create a weapon that just jumps, orders the magnitude, and destructive capability.

03:40:42.400 --> 03:40:46.720
And of course, we can intuit all the things like engineered viruses,

03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:54.800
nanobots, artificial intelligence, yes, all the different complicated global effects of

03:40:54.800 --> 03:40:59.120
global warming. So how that changes the allocation of resources, the flow of energy,

03:40:59.120 --> 03:41:04.320
the tension between countries, the military conflict between countries, the reallocation

03:41:04.320 --> 03:41:11.040
of power, then looking at the role of China in this whole thing with Russia and growing influence

03:41:11.120 --> 03:41:18.000
of Africa and the weird dynamics of Europe, and then America falling apart through the political

03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:23.840
division fueled by recommender systems through Twitter and Facebook. The whole beautiful mess

03:41:24.400 --> 03:41:29.840
is just fun. And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers, incredible scientists,

03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:35.440
incredible human beings that while everyone is bickering and so on online for the fun of it on

03:41:35.440 --> 03:41:39.600
the weekends, they're actually trying to build solutions. And those are the people that will

03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:44.480
create something beautiful, at least I have, you know, that's the process of evolution. It's,

03:41:45.520 --> 03:41:53.440
there was, it all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism that went out from the events

03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:02.320
and was the parent to all of us. And for that guy or lady or both, I guess, is a big thank you.

03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:07.520
And I can't wait to what happens next. And I'm glad there's incredible humans writing and studying

03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:12.160
it like you are. Nick, it's a huge honor that you were talking to me. This is fantastic. This is

03:42:12.160 --> 03:42:21.840
really amazing. I can't wait to read what you write next. Thank you for existing. And thank you

03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:40.080
words from Steve Jobs. I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the
