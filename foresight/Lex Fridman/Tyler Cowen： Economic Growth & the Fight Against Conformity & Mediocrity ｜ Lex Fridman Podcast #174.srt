00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
The following is a conversation with Tyler Cohen, an economist at George Mason University

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,520
and co-creator of an amazing economics blog called Marginal Revolution. Author of many books,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,200
including The Great Stagnation, Average is Over, and his most recent Big Business,

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,360
a love letter to an American anti-hero. He's truly a polymath in his work, including his love

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,520
for food, which makes his amazing podcast called Conversations with Tyler really fun to listen

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,520

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,920
them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, given Tyler's culinary

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,000
explorations, let me say that one of the things that makes me sad about my love-hate relationship

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,560
with food is that while I've found a simple diet, plain meat and veggies that makes me happy

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,000
in day-to-day life, I sometimes wish I had the mental ability to moderate consumption of food

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,520
so that I could truly enjoy meals that go way outside of that diet. I've seen my mom, for example,

12
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,680
enjoy a single piece of chocolate, and yet if I were to eat one piece of chocolate, the odds are high

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,160
that I would end up eating the whole box. This is definitely something I would like to fix,

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,760
because some of the amazing artistry in this world happens in the kitchen, and some of the

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,160
richest human experiences happen over a unique meal. I recently was eating cheeseburgers with Joe

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,400
Rogan and John Donahar late at night in Austin talking about jiu-jitsu and life, and I was

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,120
distinctly aware of the magic of that experience, magic made possible by the incredibly delicious

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,840
cheeseburgers. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Tyler Cohen.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,440
Would you say economics is more art or science or philosophy or even magic? What is it?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,440
Economics is interesting because it's all of the above. To start with magic, the notion that you

21
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,240
can make some change and simply everyone's better off, that is a kind of modern magic

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,920
that has replaced old-style magic. It's an art in the sense that the models are not very exact.

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,400
It's a science in the sense that occasionally propositions are falsified,

24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,360
are a few basic things we know, and however trivial they may sound, if you don't know them,

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,200
you're out of luck. So all of the above. But from my outsider's perspective, economics

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,920
is sometimes able to formulate very simple, almost like E equals MC squared, general models of how

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:46,320
our human society will function when you do a certain thing. But it seems impossible or almost

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,320
way too optimistic to think that a single formula or just a set of simple principles can describe

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,400
behavior of billions of human beings with all the complexity that we have involved.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,840
So do you have a sense there's a hope for economics to have those kinds of physics level

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
descriptions and models of the world, or is it just our desperate attempts as humans to make sense

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,840
of it even though it's more desperate than rigorous and serious and actually predictable,

33
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,360
like a physics type science? I don't think economics will ever be very predictive.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
It's most useful for helping you ask better questions. You look at something like game theory.

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,240
Well, game theory never predicted USA and USSR would have a war, would not have a war,

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,360
but trying to think through the logic of strategic conflict. If you know game theory,

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,280
it's just a much more interesting discussion. Are you surprised that we, speaking of the Soviet

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
Union and the United States, and speaking of game theory, are you surprised that we haven't

39
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,040
destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons yet, like that simple formulation of mutually assured

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,240
destruction? That's a good example of an explanation that perhaps allows us to ask better questions,

41
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,240
but it seems to have actually described the reality of why we haven't destroyed ourselves

42
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,400
with these ultra-powerful weapons. Are you surprised? Do you think the game theory explanation

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,480
is at all accurate there? I think we will destroy each other with those weapons. Eventually?

44
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,560
Eventually. Look, it's a very low probability event, so I'm not surprised it hasn't happened yet.

45
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,840
I'm a little surprised it came as close as it did. Your general thinking, realizing it might have

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,640
just been a flock of birds or it wasn't a first strike attack from the USA, we got very lucky

47
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,280
on that one. But if you just keep on running the clock on a low probability event,

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,400
it will happen. It may not be USA and China, USA and Russia, whatever. It could be the Saudis and

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,640
Turkey. It might not be nuclear weapons, it might be some other destruction. Bio weapons,

50
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,640
but it simply will happen, is my view. I've argued at best we have seven or eight hundred years,

51
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,000
and that's being generous. Worst? How long we got?

52
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Well, maybe it's like a person arrival process, right? So, tiny probability could come anytime,

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,960
probably not in your lifetime, but the chance presumably increases the cheaper weapons of

54
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,040
mass destruction are. So, the person process description doesn't take in consideration

55
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,880
the game theoretic aspect. So, another way to consider is repeated games, iterative games.

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,040
So, is there something about our human nature that allows us to fight against

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,560
probability? Reduce, like the closer we get to trouble, the more we're able to figure out how

58
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,560
to avoid trouble. The same thing is for when you take exams or you go and take classes,

59
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
the closer or paper deadlines, the closer you get to a deadline, the better you start to perform

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,840
and get your shit together. It actually gets stuff done. I'm really not so negative on human

61
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,760
nature. And as an economist, I very much see the gains from cooperation. But if you just ask,

62
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,480
are there outliers in history? Like, was there a Hitler? For instance. Obviously. And again,

63
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,400
you let the clock tick. Another Hitler with nuclear weapons doesn't, per se, care about his own

64
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,560
destruction. It will happen. So, your sense is fundamentally people are good, but-

65
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it. Trumbling hand equilibrium?

66
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,080
That the basic logic is for cooperation, which is mostly what we've seen,

67
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,280
even between enemies. But every now and then, someone does something crazy and you don't

68
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,880
know how to react to it. And you can't always beat Hitler. Sometimes, Hitler drags you down.

69
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,480
To push back is it possible that the crazier the person, the less likely they are,

70
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:57,360
and in a way where we're safe. Meaning, this is the kind of proposition- I had the discussion

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:06,080
with my dad as a physicist about this, where he thinks that if you have a graph, evil people

72
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,400
can't also be geniuses. So, this is his defense why evil people will not get control of nuclear

73
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,800
weapons, because to be truly evil. But evil meaning, you can argue that not even the evil of

74
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,120
Hitler we're talking about, because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany and all those kinds of-

75
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,800
He probably deluded himself and the people around him to think that he's actually doing good for

76
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,600
the world, similar with Stalin and so on. By evil, I mean more like almost like terrorists,

77
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,080
to where they want to destroy themselves and the world. Those people will never be able to be

78
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,720
actually skilled enough to do, to deliver that kind of mass scale destruction. So, the hope is

79
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,560
that it's very unlikely that the kind of evil that would lead to extinctions of humans or mass

80
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,120
destruction is so unlikely that we're able to last way longer than some 100, 800 years.

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,680
It's very unlikely in that sense. I accept the argument, but that's why you need to let the clock

82
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,680
It's also the best argument for bureaucracy. To negotiate a bureaucracy, it actually selects

83
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,320
against pure evil, because you need to build alliances. So, bureaucracy in that regard is

84
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,840
great, right? It keeps out the worst apples. But look, put it this way, could you imagine 35 years

85
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:33,120
from now, the Osama bin Laden of the future has nukes or very bad bio-weapons? It seems to me,

86
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,520
you can. And Osama was pretty evil. And actually, even he failed, right? But nonetheless,

87
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,360
that's what the 700 or 800 years is there for. And it might be destructive technology that don't

88
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,560
have such a high cost of production or such a high learning curve, like cyber attacks or

89
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,680
artificial intelligence, all those kinds of things. So, yeah. I mean, let me ask you a question. Let's

90
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,440
say you could as an active will, by spending a million dollars obliterate any city on earth,

91
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,320
and everyone in it dies, and you'll get caught, and you'll be sentenced to death,

92
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,680
but you can make it happen just by willing it. How many months does it take before that happens?

93
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,280
So, the obvious answer is like very soon. There's probably a good answer for that,

94
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,640
because you can consider how many millionaires there are, how many you can look at that, right?

95
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,160
I have a sense that there's just people that have a million dollars.

96
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,960
I mean, there's a certain amount, but have a million dollars,

97
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,200
have other interests that will outweigh the interest of destroying the entire city.

98
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,480
Like, there's a particular, you know, like, I mean, maybe that's a hope.

99
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
It's why we should be nice to the wealthy, too, right?

100
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah, all that trash talking is Bill Gates. We should stop that, because that doesn't inspire

101
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,520
the other future Bill Gates is to be nice to the world. It's true. But your sense is that

102
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,560
cheaper guests to destroy the world, the more likely it becomes.

103
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,520
Now, when I say destroy the world, there's a trick in there. I don't think literally every human

104
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,040
will die. But it would set back civilization by an extraordinary degree. It's then just

105
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,120
hard to predict what comes next. Yeah.

106
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
But a catastrophe where everyone dies, that probably has to be something more like an

107
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,040
asteroid or supernova. And those are purely exogenous for the time being, at least.

108
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,640
So, I immigrated to this country. I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia.

109
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,520
And which one?

110
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,440
Again, it's an important question. You were born in the Soviet Union, right?

111
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,480
Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union. The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.

112
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,920
But I came to this country and this country even back there, but it's always symbolized to me

113
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,120
a place of opportunity where everybody could build the most incredible things,

114
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,440
especially in the engineering side of things, just invent and build and scale and have a huge

115
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,440
impact on the world. And that's been, to me, that's my version of the American ideal, the American

116
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:23,760
dream. Do you think the American dream is still there? What do you think of that notion in itself?

117
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,720
From an economics perspective, from a human perspective, is it still alive? And how do you

118
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,560
think about it? The American dream? The American dream is mostly still there. If you look at which

119
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,680
groups are the highest earners, it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran, which is a

120
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,760
fairly new development, great for them, not necessarily easy. Both you could call persons of

121
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,000
color, may have faced discrimination, also on the grounds of religion, yet they've done it. That's

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,120
amazing. It says great things about America. Now, if you look at Native-born Americans, the story's

123
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,560
trickier. People think intergenerational mobility has declined a lot recently, but it has not for

124
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,800
Native-born Americans. For about, I think, 40 years it's been fairly constant, which is sort of good.

125
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,640
But compared to much earlier times, it was much higher in the past. I'm not sure we can replicate

126
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,360
that, because look, go to the beginning of the 20th century. Very few Americans finish high school

127
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,800
or even have much wealth. There's not much credentialism. There aren't that many credentials.

128
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
So there's more upward mobility across the generations than today. And it's a good thing

129
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,200
that we had it. I'm not sure we should blame the modern world for not being able to reproduce that.

130
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,520
But look, the general issue of who gets into Harvard or Cornell, is there an injustice? Should

131
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,360
we fix that? Is there too little opportunity for the bottoms, say, half of Americans? Absolutely.

132
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,320
It's a disgrace how this country has evolved in that way. And in that sense, the American dream

133
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,920
is clearly ailing. But it has had problems from the beginning for blacks, for women, for many other

134
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,240
groups. I mean, isn't that the whole challenge of opportunity and freedom is that it's hard and

135
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,680
the difficulty of how hard it is to move up in society is unequal often. And that's the injustice

136
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,600
of society. But the whole point of that freedom is that over time, it becomes better and better.

137
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:35,920
You start to fix the leaks, the issues, and it keeps progressing in that kind of way. But ultimately,

138
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,960
there's always the opportunity, even if it's harder, there's the opportunity to create something

139
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,760
truly special, to move up, to be president, to be a leader in whatever the industry that you're

140
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,400
passionate about. We each have podcasts in English. The value of joining that American English

141
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,520
language network is much higher today than it was 30 years ago, mostly because of the internet.

142
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,480
So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed. So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,

143
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,200
I think has become much more valuable in relative terms than, say, going to France,

144
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,680
would just still a pretty well off, very nice country.

145
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,680
If you had gone to France, your chance of having a globally known podcast would be much smaller.

146
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,480
Yeah, this is the interesting thing about how much intellectual influence the United States has.

147
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,440
I don't know if it's connected to what we're discussing here, the freedom and the opportunity

148
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,480
of the American dream. Or does it make any sense to you that we have so much impact on the rest

149
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,880
of the world in terms of ideas? Is it just simply because the English is the primary language of

150
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,320
the world, or is there something fundamental to the United States that drives the development of

151
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:04,400
ideas? It's almost like what's cool, what's entertaining, what's meme culture, the internet

152
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:12,160
culture, the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts, the movies, music, all that stuff,

153
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,560
driving culture. There's something above and beyond language in the United States.

154
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,880
It's a sense of entertainment, really mattering, how to connect with your audience,

155
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,400
being direct and getting to the point, how humor is integrated even with science.

156
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,560
That is pretty strongly represented here, much more so than on the European continent.

157
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,120
Britain has its own version of this, which it does very well. Not surprisingly,

158
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,400
they're hugely influential in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mention. Canada,

159
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,680
yes, but their best talent tends to come here. You could say it's like a broader North American

160
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,120
thing and give them their fair share of credit. What about science? There's a sense,

161
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,120
higher education is really strong, research is really strong in the United States, but it just

162
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,760
feels like culturally speaking, when we zoom out, scientists aren't very cool here.

163
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,200
Most people wouldn't be able to name basically a single scientist. Maybe they would say what,

164
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,880
Einstein and Neil deGrasse Tyson, maybe. Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't exactly a scientist. He's

165
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:28,800
a science communicator. There's not the same admiration of science and innovators as there is

166
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:38,080
of athletes or actors, actresses, musicians. You can become a celebrity scientist if you want to.

167
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,680
May or may not be best for science. We have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal,

168
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,760
but look at it this way. Which country is most comfortable with inegalitarian rewards

169
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,160
for scientists, whether it's fame or money? I still think it's here. Some of that's just

170
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,600
the tax rate. Some of it is a lot of America is set up for rich people to live really well.

171
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,440
Again, that's going to attract a lot of top talent. You ask the two best vaccines. I know

172
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,320
the Pfizer vaccine is sorted from Germany, sorted from Turkey, but it's nonetheless

173
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,360
being distributed through the United States, Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through

174
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,160
Lebanon, first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area. Those are incredible

175
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,840
vaccines. US nailed it. Yeah. Well, that's more almost like the, I don't know what you would call

176
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,160
engineering the sort of scaling. That's what US is really good at, not just inventing of ideas,

177
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,960
but taking an idea and actually building the thing and scaling it and being able to distribute it

178
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:50,000
at scale. I think some people would attribute that to the general word of capitalism. I don't

179
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,760
know if you would. Sure. What in your views are the pros and cons of capitalism as it's

180
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,960
implemented in America? I don't know if you would say capitalism has really existed in America,

181
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,240
but to the extent that it does. People use the word capitalism in so many different ways.

182
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,360
What is capitalism? The literal meaning is private ownership of capital goods,

183
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,880
which I favor in most areas, but no, I don't think the private sector should own our F-16s

184
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,800
or military assets. Government-owned water utilities seem to work as well as privately

185
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,520
owned water utilities, but with all those qualifications put to the side, business,

186
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,920
for the most part, innovates better than government. It is oriented toward consumer services.

187
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,520
The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages. Business is great at getting things done.

188
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,040
USA is fundamentally a nation of business, and that makes us a nation of opportunity.

189
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
I am indeed mostly a fan, subject to numerous caveats.

190
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,960
What's the con? What are some negative downsides of capitalism

191
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,520
in your view or some things that we should be concerned about maybe for long-term impacts of

192
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,880
capitalism? Capitalism takes a different form in each country. I would say in the United States,

193
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,280
our weird blend of whatever you want to call it has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning,

194
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,240
has been a force of taking away land from Native Americans and oppressing them pretty much from

195
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:36,880
the beginning. It has done very well by immigrants for the most part. We revel in chimpaterian

196
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,800
creative destruction more, so we don't just prop up national champions forever, and there's a

197
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,160
precariousness to life for some people here that is less so, say, in Germany or the Netherlands.

198
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,760
We have weaker communities in some regards than, say, Northwestern Europe often would.

199
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,040
That has pluses and minuses. I think it makes us more creative. It's a better country in which

200
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,360
to be a weirdo than, say, Germany or Denmark. But there is truly, whether from the government

201
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,920
or from your private community, there is less social security in some fundamental sense.

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:20,400
On the point of weirdo, that's kind of a beautiful little statement. What is that? That seems to

203
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,160
be, you could think of a guy like Elon Musk and say that he's a weirdo. Is that the sense of what

204
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,560
you're using the weirdo? Outside of the norm, breaking conventions. Absolutely. Here, that is

205
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,640
either acceptable or even admired or to be a loner. Since so many people are outsiders,

206
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,040
and that where all immigrants is selecting for people who left something behind,

207
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,360
were willing to leave behind their families, were willing to undergo a certain brutality

208
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,600
of switch in their lives, makes us a nation of weirdos, and weirdos are creative. Denmark

209
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,000
is not a nation of weirdos. It's a wonderful place, great for them. Ideally, you want part

210
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,160
of the world to be fully weirdos and innovating, and the other part of the world to be a little

211
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,800
kind of chicken shit, risk averse, and enjoy the benefit to the innovation, and to give people

212
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,560
these smooth lives in six weeks off and free ride. Everyone's like, oh, American way versus

213
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,520
European way, but basically they're compliments. Yeah, that's fascinating. I used to have this

214
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,360
conversation with my parents when I was growing up, and just others from the immigrant kind of

215
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:36,400
flow, and they used this term, especially in Russian, is to criticize something I was doing,

216
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,200
that would suggest normal people don't do this. I used to be really offended by that,

217
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:54,080
but as I got older, I realized that that's a kind of compliment, because in the same kind of,

218
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:01,520
I would say, way that you're saying that is the American ideal, because if you want to do anything

219
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,000
special or interesting, you don't want to be doing, in one particular avenue, what normal people do,

220
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,640
because that won't be interesting. Russians, I think, fit in very well here,

221
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,960
because the ones who come are weirdos, and there's a very different Russian weirdo tradition,

222
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,240
like Alyosha, right, and Brother Skaramisov, or Perlman, the mathematician. They're weirdos,

223
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
and they have their own different kind of status in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever.

224
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,120
And when Russians come to America, they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me a week later,

225
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,520
they've somehow adjusted, and the ways in which they might want to be grumpier than Americans,

226
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,720
not smile, think that people who smile are idiots. They can do that. No one takes that away from them.

227
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,920
Yeah. Yeah. What are you on the tiny tangent? I'd love to hear a few thoughts about Grisha Perlman

228
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,800
turning down the Fields Medal. Is that something you admire? Does that make sense to you that somebody,

229
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,240
you know, we have the structure of Nobel Prizes, of these huge awards, of the reputations,

230
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,960
the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding how special you are, and here's a person who was

231
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,720
doing one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mathematics. It doesn't want

232
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,120
the stupid prize and doesn't want recognition, doesn't want to do interviews, it doesn't want to be

233
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,920
famous. What do you make of that? It's great. Look, prizes are corrupting. After scientists win

234
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,960
Nobel Prizes, they tend to become less productive. Now, statistically, it's hard to sort out the

235
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,800
different effects. There's a Russian toward the mean. Does the prize make you too busy? It's a

236
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,280
little tricky, but there's not enough Nobel Prizes either to gather enough data. Right. But it's,

237
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,680
I've known a lot of Nobel Prize winners, and it is my sense they become less productive.

238
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,640
They repeat more of their older messages, which may be highly socially valuable. But if someone

239
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,160
wants to turn their back on that and keep on working, which I assume is what he's doing,

240
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,680
that's awesome. I mean, we should respect that. It's like he wins a bigger prize, right? Our extreme

241
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:14,160
respect. Yeah. Well, Grisha, if you're listening, I need to talk to you soon. Okay. I've been trying

242
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,640
to get ahold of them. Okay. Back to capitalism. I got to ask you, just competition in general,

243
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:29,280
in this world of weirdos, is competition good for the world? This seems to be one of the fundamental

244
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,680
engines of capitalism, right? Do you see it as ultimately constructive or destructive for the

245
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,200
world? What really matters is how good your legal framework is. So competition within nature,

246
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,960
for food, leads to bloody conflict all the time. The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the

247
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,720
least. If you have something like the rule of law and clearly defined property rights, which are

248
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,240
within reason justly allocated, competition probably is going to work very well.

249
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,000
But it's not an unalloyed good thing at all. It can be highly destructive. Military competition,

250
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,800
right? Which actually is itself sometimes good, but it's not good per se.

251
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,480
What aspects of life do you think we should protect from competition? So is there some,

252
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,600
you said like the rule of law, is there some things we should keep away from competition?

253
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,240
Well, the fight for territory most of all, right? So violence, anything that involves

254
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,000
like actual physical violence. Right. And it's not that I think the current borders are just.

255
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,400
I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians, Serbians, Bosnians, they'll talk your ear off.

256
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,600
And some of them are probably right. But at the end of the day, we have some kind of international

257
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,080
order. And I would rather we more or less stick with it. If Catalonians want to leave, they keep

258
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,200
up with it, you know, let them go. But what about a space of like healthcare? This is where you

259
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,840
get into a tension of like between capitalism and kind of more, I don't want to use socialism,

260
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,360
but those kinds of policies, they're less free market. I think in this country,

261
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,000
healthcare should be much more competitive. So you go to hospitals, doctors, they don't treat

262
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,680
you like a customer. They treat you like an idiot or like a child or someone with third party

263
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:21,920
payment. And it's a pretty humiliating experience often. Yeah. Do you think free market in general

264
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,160
is possible, like a pure free market? And is that a good goal to strive for?

265
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,040
I don't think the term pure free markets well defined, because you need a legal order. The

266
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,400
legal order has to make decisions on like what is intellectual property more important than ever.

267
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,200
There's no benchmark that like represents the pure free market way of doing things.

268
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,880
What will penalties be? How much do we put into law enforcement? No simple answers,

269
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,840
but just saying free market doesn't pin down what you're going to do on those all important questions.

270
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,160
So free market is an economics, I guess, idea. So there's no, it's not possible for free market

271
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,960
to generate the rules. They're like emergent, like self governing. It generates a lot of them,

272
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,680
right, through private norms, through trade associations. International trade is mostly

273
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,320
done privately and by norms. So it's certainly possible. But at the end of the day, I think

274
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,360
you need governments to draw very clear lines to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.

275
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,640
You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos lately, Michael Malis,

276
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:39,600
who espouses to be an anarchist anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually, just

277
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,680
fascinating set of ideas, where, you know, taking free market to the full extreme of

278
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:55,520
basically saying there should be no, no government. What is it? Oversight, I guess,

279
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,240
and then everything should be fully, like all the agreements, all the collectives you form

280
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,840
should be voluntary, not based on the geographic land you were born on and so on. Do you think

281
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,320
that's just a giant mess? Like, do you think it's possible for an anarchist society to work where

282
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,840
it's, you know, in a fully distributed way, people agree with each other, not just on financial

283
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:29,680
transactions, but, you know, on their personal security, on sort of military type of stuff,

284
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,600
on healthcare, on education, all those kinds of things. And where does it break down?

285
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,000
Well, I wouldn't press a button to say, get rid of our current constitution, which I view is pretty

286
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
good and quite wise. But I think the deeper point is that all societies are, in some regards,

287
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,880
anarchistic. And we should take the anarchists seriously. So globally, there's a kind of anarchy

288
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,400
across borders, even within federalistic systems. They're typically complex. There's not a clear

289
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:05,120
transitivity necessarily of who has the final say over what. Just the state vis-a-vis its people.

290
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,000
There's not, per se, a final arbitrator in that regard. So you want a good anarchy rather than

291
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,800
a bad anarchy. You want to squish your anarchy into the right corners. And I don't think there's a

292
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,640
theoretical answer how to do it. But you start with a country like, is it working well enough now?

293
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,400
This country, you'd say mostly, you'd certainly want to make a lot of improvements. And that's

294
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,480
why I don't want to press that get rid of the constitution button. But to just dump on the

295
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,000
anarchists is to miss the point. Always try to learn from any opinion, you know, and what in it is

296
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,680
true? I'm just like marveling at the poetry of saying that we should squish our anarchy into

297
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:54,560
the right corners. I love it. Okay, I gotta ask, I've been talking with, since we're doing a

298
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,520
whirlwind introduction to all of economics, I've been talking to a few objectivists recently.

299
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,600
Ayn Rand comes up as a person, as a philosopher throughout many conversations. A lot of people

300
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,080
really despise her. A lot of people really love her. It's always weird to me when somebody arouses

301
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,640
a philosophy or a human being arouses that much emotion in either direction. Do you understand,

302
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,840
first of all, that level of emotion? And what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand and her philosophy,

303
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:34,720
objectivism? Is it useful at all to think about this kind of formulation of rational self-interest,

304
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:43,760
if I could put it in those words, or I guess, more negatively, the selfishness, or she would put,

305
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,600
I guess, the virtue of selfishness? Ayn Rand was the big influence on me growing up. The book that

306
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,880
really mattered for me was capitalism, the unknown ideal, the notion that wealth creates

307
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,120
opportunity and good lives, and wealth is something we ought to valorize and give very high status.

308
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,160
It's one of her key ideas. I think it's completely correct. I think she has the most profound and

309
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:12,800
articulate statement of that idea. That said, as a philosopher, I disagree with her on most things,

310
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,080
and I did, even as a boy when I was reading her. I read Plato before Ayn Rand, and in a

311
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,720
Socratic dialogue, there's all these different points of view being thrown around. And whomever

312
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,760
it is you agree with, you understand the wisdom isn't coming together at the different points of

313
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,240
view, and she doesn't have that. So altruism can be wonderful in my view. Humans are not actually

314
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:40,960
that rational. Self-interest is often poorly defined. To pound the table and say existence exists,

315
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,600
I wouldn't say I disagree, but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement.

316
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,800
I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian. I'd love to have her on my podcast if

317
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,000
she was still alive. I'd only ask her about Russia, which she mostly never talked about

318
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,320
after writing We the Living. And she is much more Russian than she seems at first, even like purging

319
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,760
people from the Objectivist circles. It's like how Russians, especially female Russians, so often

320
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:16,240
purge their friends. It's weird, all the parallels. So you're saying, so yes, assuming she's still not

321
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,840
around. But if she is, and she comes into your podcast, can you dig into that a little bit?

322
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:31,280
Do you mean like her personal demons around the social and economic Russia of the time,

323
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,960
when she escaped? The traumas she suffered there. What she really likes in the music and literature

324
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,720
and getting deeply into that, her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,

325
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,120
how it differs from America, why she still carries through the old Russian vision in her fiction,

326
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,680
this extreme sexual dimorphism, but with also very strong women. To me is a uniquely, at least

327
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:02,400
Eastern European vision, mostly Russian, I would say. And that's in her. That's her actual real

328
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,600
philosophy, not this table-bounding existence exists. And that's not talked about enough.

329
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,320
She's a Russian philosopher or Soviet, whatever you want to call it.

330
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,720
And if she wasn't so certain, she could have been a Dostoevsky, where it's not,

331
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,840
that certainty is almost the thing that brings over the adoration of millions, but also the

332
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,280
hatred of millions. She became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian-like manner. Yeah.

333
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,120
It is what it is. But I love the idea that, again, you're just dropping bombs that are poetic,

334
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,480
that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas. It's kind of interesting to think that

335
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:52,080
no one human possesses wisdom. No one idea is the wisdom, that the coming together is the wisdom.

336
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,800
Like in my view, Boswell's life of Johnson, 18th century British biography,

337
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,960
it's, in essence, a co-authored work, Boswell and Johnson. It's one of the greatest

338
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,320
philosophy books ever, though it is commonly regarded as a biography. John Stuart Mill,

339
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,000
who, in a sense, was co-authoring with Harriet Taylor, a better philosopher than is realized,

340
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,280
though he's rated very, very highly. Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works

341
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,880
are in a kind of dialogue form, Kurtis Faust, would be another example. It's very much a dialogue.

342
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,160
Yes, it's drama, but it's also philosophy, Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.

343
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,680
In your book, Big Business, speaking of Anne Rand, Big Business, a love letter to an American

344
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:44,000
antihero, you make the case for the benefit that large businesses bring to society. Can you explain?

345
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,080
If you look at, say, the pandemic, which has been a catastrophic event, right, for many reasons,

346
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,160
but who is it that saved us? So Amazon has done remarkably well. They upped their delivery game

347
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,960
more or less overnight with very few hitches. I've ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,

348
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:09,360
direct delivery food, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats or using Whole Foods through Amazon

349
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:15,680
shipping. Again, it's gone remarkably well. Switching over our entire higher educational system,

350
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,120
basically within two weeks to Zoom. Zoom did it. I mean, I've had a Zoom outage,

351
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,400
but their performance rate has been remarkably high. So if you just look at resources,

352
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,720
competence, incentives, who's been the star performers, the NBA even, just canceling the

353
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,160
season as early as they did, sending a message like, hey people, this is real. And then pulling

354
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,000
off the bubble with not a single found case of COVID and having all the testing set up in advance.

355
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,160
Big business has done very well lately. And throughout the broader course of American

356
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,840
history, in my view, has mostly been a hero. Can we engage in a kind of therapy session?

357
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:06,560
I'm often troubled by the negativity towards big business. And I wonder if you could help

358
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,560
figure out how we've removed that or maybe first psychoanalyze it and then how we remove it.

359
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,520
It feels like once we've gotten Wi-Fi on flights, on airplane flights,

360
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,320
people start complaining about how shady the connection is, right? They take it for granted

361
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,360
immediately and then start complaining about little details. Another example that's closer to,

362
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,040
especially as a aspiring entrepreneur is closer to the things I'm thinking about is Jack Dorsey

363
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,760
with Twitter. To me, Twitter has enabled an incredible platform of communication.

364
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,880
And yet the biggest thing that people talk about is not how incredible this platform is.

365
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,440
They essentially use the platform to complain about the censorship of a few individuals,

366
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,240
as opposed to how amazing it is. Now, you should also talk about how shady the Wi-Fi is and how

367
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,720
censorship or the removal of Donald Trump from the platform is a bad thing. But it feels like

368
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:22,080
we don't talk about the positive impacts at scale of these technologies. Can you explain why and is

369
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,000
there a way to fix it? I don't know if we can fix it. I think we are beings of high neuroticism,

370
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,240
for the most part, as a personality trait. Not everyone, but most people. And as a compliment

371
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,040
to that, if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult, you're more bothered by the

372
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,880
insult than you're pleased by the nice things, especially if the insult is somewhat true.

373
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,680
So you have these media, these vehicles, Twitter is one you mentioned,

374
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,600
where there's all kinds of messages going back and forth. And you're really bugged

375
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,360
by the messages you don't like. Most people are neurotic to begin with. It's not only taken out

376
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,600
on big business to be clear. So Congress catches a lot of grief and some of it they deserve, yes.

377
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,800
Religion is not attacked the same way, but religiosity is declining. If you poll people,

378
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,200
the military still polls quite well. But people are very disillusioned with many things. And the

379
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,320
Martin-Gurrey thesis that because of the internet, you just see more of things. And the more you see

380
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,640
of something, whether it's good, bad, or in between, the more you will find to complain about,

381
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,680
I suspect, is the fundamental mechanism here. I mean, look at Clubhouse, right?

382
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,280
To me, it's a great service. May or may not be like my thing, but gives people this opportunity.

383
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,760
No one makes you go on it. And all these media articles like, oh, is Clubhouse going to wreck

384
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,000
things? Are they going to break things? New York Times is complaining. Of course,

385
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,240
it's their competitor as well. I'm like, give these people a chance. Talk it up.

386
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,920
You may or may not like it. Let's praise the people who are getting something done. Very

387
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,720
unrandom point. As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster, what do you think about

388
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:10,640
Clubhouse? What do you think about? Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it. I used to use

389
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,920
Discord, which is another service where people use voice. So the only thing you do is just hear

390
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,600
each other. There's no face. You just see a little icon. That's the essential element of Clubhouse.

391
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,960
There's an intimacy to voice-only communication that's hard. That didn't make sense to me,

392
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,000
but it was just what it is, which feels like something that won't last for some reason. Maybe

393
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:42,080
it's the cynical view. But what's your sense about the intimacy of what's happening right now with

394
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,600
Clubhouse? I've greatly enjoyed what I've done, but I'm not sure it's for me in the long run for two

395
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:55,120
reasons. First, if you compare it to doing a podcast, podcasting has greater reach than Clubhouse.

396
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:02,720
So I would rather put time into my podcast, but then also my core asset, so to speak,

397
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,400
is I'm a very fast reader. So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage. I don't

398
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,520
speak or listen faster than other people. In fact, I'm a slower listener because I like 1.0,

399
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,720
not 1.5x. So I should spend less time on audio and more time reading and writing.

400
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:27,920
Yeah. It's interesting because you mentioned podcasts and audiobooks. The podcasts are recorded,

401
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,720
and so I can skip things. I can skip commercials or I can skip parts where it's like, this part

402
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,680
is boring. With live conversations, especially when there's a magic to the fact that when you

403
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,200
have a lot of people participating in that conversation, but some people are like, this

404
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,800
topic, they're going into this thing and you can't skip it or you can't fast forward. You can go 1.5x

405
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,680
or 2x. You can't speed it up. Nevertheless, there's a tension between that. So that's the productivity

406
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:07,520
aspect with the actual magic of live communication where anything can happen where Elon Musk can

407
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,200
ask the CEO of Robin Hood, Vlad, about like, hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,

408
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,160
there's something shady going on, the magic of that. That's also my criticism of like,

409
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,600
there's been a recent conversation with Bill Gates that he won a platform and had a basically

410
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,120
a regular interview on the platform without allowing the possibility of the magic of the chaos.

411
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:38,240
So I'm not exactly sure. It's probably not the right platform for you and for many other people

412
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,880
who are exceptionally productive in other places, but there's still nevertheless the magic to the

413
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,040
chaos that could be created with live conversation that gives me pause. Maybe what it's perfect for

414
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,920
is the tribute. So they had an episode recently that I didn't hear, but I heard it was wonderful.

415
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,360
It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs. That you can't do one to one, right? And you don't want control.

416
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,880
You want different people appearing and stepping up and saying their bit.

417
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,840
And Clubhouse is 110% perfect for that, the tribute. I love that, the tribute.

418
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,320
But there's also the possibility, I think there was a time when somebody arranged a conversation

419
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,560
with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on stage. I remember that happen a long time ago.

420
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,040
And it was very formal. It could have probably gone better, but it was still magical

421
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,040
to have these people that obviously had a bunch of tension throughout their history.

422
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,480
It's so frictionless to have two major figures in world history just jump on on a Clubhouse stage.

423
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,680
Putin and Elon Musk.

424
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,640
Putin and Elon Musk.

425
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,800
And that's exactly it. So there's a language barrier there. There's also the problem that

426
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,960
in particular, it's like Biden would have a similar problem. It's like they're just not

427
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,480
into a new technology. So it's very hard to catch the Kremlin up to, first of all, Twitter.

428
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,720
But to catch them up to Clubhouse, you have to have the Elon Musk has a sense of the internet,

429
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,240
the humor, the memes and all that kind of stuff that you have to have in order to

430
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,920
use a new app and figure out the timing, the beat. What is this thing about?

431
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:26,160
That's the challenge there. But that's exactly it. That magic of have two big personalities

432
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,520
just show up. And I wonder if it's just the temporary thing that we're going through with

433
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,520
the pandemic where people are just lonely and they're seeking for that human connection that

434
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,480
we usually get elsewhere through our work. But they'll stay lonely, in my opinion.

435
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,120
You think so?

436
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,360
I do. So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist. And the idea of wanting to be

437
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,960
connected to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that. And all the mental health issues

438
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,480
out there, a lot of people have broken ties and they will still be lonely post vaccines.

439
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
Yeah, from an artificial intelligence perspective,

440
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,960
have a sense that there is like a deep loneliness in the world that all of us are really lonely.

441
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,440
Like we don't even acknowledge it. Even people in happy relationships. It feels like there's

442
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,120
like an iceberg of loneliness in all of us, like seeking to be understood, like deeply

443
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:29,200
understood. Like having somebody with whom you can have a deep interaction enough

444
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,760
to where they can help you to understand yourself. And they also understand you.

445
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,560
Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence systems can provide that as well.

446
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,320
But humans, I think, crave that from other humans in ways that we perhaps don't acknowledge.

447
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,720
And I have a hope that technology will enable that more and more. Like Clubhouse is an example

448
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,560
that allows that. Are touring bots going to outcompete Clubhouse? Like why not sort of program

449
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,080
your own session? You'll just talk into your device and say, here's the kind of conversation I want.

450
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,880
And it will create the characters for you. And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin,

451
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,520
but it will be better than ordinary Clubhouse. Yeah. And one of the things that's missing,

452
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,600
it's not just conversation. It's memory. So long term memory is what current AI systems don't have

453
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,560
is sharing an experience together. Forget the words. It's like sharing the highs and the lows

454
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,400
of life together and the systems around us remembering that. Remembering we've been through

455
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,360
that. Like that's the thing that creates really close relationships is going through some shit.

456
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,880
Like go and struggle. If you've survived together, there's something really difficult

457
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,200
that bonds you with other humans. And this is related to immigration in the American dream.

458
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,960
In what way? The people who have come to this country, however weird and different they may be,

459
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,960
they or their ancestors at some point probably have shared this thing.

460
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,160
Right. US is not going to split up. It may get more screwed up as a country,

461
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,240
but Texas and California are not going to break off. Yeah. I mean, they're big enough

462
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,240
where they could do it, but it's just never going to happen. We've been through too much together.

463
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,960
Yeah. That's a hopeful message. Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein,

464
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:26,160
you've talked to Eric Weinstein. He has a sense that growth, the entirety of the American system

465
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,880
is based on the assumption that we're going to grow forever. The economy is going to grow forever.

466
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,960
Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely or will we stagnate?

467
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:44,800
I've long been in agreement with Eric Peter Thiel, Robert Gordon, and others that growth has slowed

468
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:51,600
down. I argued that in my book, The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled, but the last two years,

469
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,320
I've become much more optimistic. I've seen a lot of breakthroughs in green energy and battery

470
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:04,240
technology. mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already. It will repair our GDP and save

471
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,160
millions of lives around the world. There's an anti-malaria vaccine that's now in stage three

472
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:17,920
trial. It probably works. CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia. This space area after area after

473
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,880
area, there's suddenly this surge of breakthroughs. I would say many of them rooted in superior

474
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,120
computation and ultimately Moore's law and access to those computational abilities. I'm much more

475
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:34,800
optimistic than say the last time I spoke to Eric. He moves all the time in his views. I don't

476
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:42,240
know where he's at now. He hasn't gained. That's really interesting. Your little drop of optimism

477
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,720
comes from, there might be a fundamental shift in the kind of things that computation has unlocked

478
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,960
for us in terms of, it could be a wellspring of innovation that enables growth for a long time

479
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:02,640
to come. Eric has not quite connected to the computation aspect yet to where it could be

480
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,600
a wellspring of innovation. You're very close to it in your own work. I don't have to tell you that.

481
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,000
The work you're doing would not have been possible not very long ago. The question is,

482
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,600
how much does that work enable continued growth for decades to come? For all their problems,

483
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,240
some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing. I'm not sure when. You know much better

484
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,800
than I do, maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal. One of the open questions that the

485
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:38,400
Peter Thiel School area of ideas is how much can be converted to technology? How many parts of our

486
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,000
lives can technology integrate and then innovate? Can it replace healthcare? Can it replace legal

487
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:55,360
system? Can it replace government? Never replace, but make it digital and thereby enable computation

488
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:02,480
to improve it. That's the open question because many aspects of our lives are still not really that

489
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,480
digitized. There was a New York Times symposium in April, which is not long ago, and they asked

490
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,840
the so-called experts, when are we going to get vaccines? The most optimistic answer was

491
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:23,200
in four years. Obviously, we beat that by a long mile. I think people still haven't woken up. You

492
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,800
mentioned my tiny drop of optimism, but it's a big drop of optimism. Is it a waterfall yet?

493
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,680
Here's my pessimism. Whenever there are major new technologies, they also tend to be used for

494
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,040
violence directly or indirectly. Radio, Hitler, not that he hit people over the head with radios,

495
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,760
but it enabled the rise of various dictators. The new technologies now, whatever exactly they may

496
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,960
be, they're going to cause a lot of trouble. That's my pessimism, not that I think they're all going

497
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:01,520
to slow to a trickle. When was the stagnation book? 2011. It was the first of these stagnation books,

498
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:08,800
in fact. It's very interesting. Even then, I said, this is temporary. I was predicting it

499
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,720
would be gone in about 20 years' time. I'm not sure that's exactly the right prediction, like

500
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,880
2030, but I think we're actually going to beat that. You think the United States might still be

501
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,880
on top of the world for the rest of the century in terms of its economic growth, impact on the

502
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,600
world, scientific innovation, all those kinds of things. That's too long to predict, but I'm

503
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:38,800
bullish on America in general. Got it. Speaking of being bullish on America,

504
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:46,640
the opposite of that is, we talked about capitalism, we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.

505
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:58,160
What do you think about communism? Why doesn't it work? Is it the implementation?

506
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:04,240
Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling, or is it just a fundamentally flawed

507
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,080
system? Communism is like capitalism. The words mean many things to different people.

508
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:15,600
You could argue, my life as a tenured professor comes closer to communism than anything the human

509
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,880
race has seen, and I would argue it works pretty well. If you mean the Soviet Union,

510
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:28,880
it devolved pretty quickly to a decentralized set of incentives that were destructive

511
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,640
rather than value-maximizing. It wasn't even central planning, much less communism. Paul

512
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,960
Craig Roberts and Poignet were correct in their descriptions of the Soviet system.

513
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,040
Think of it as weird mixes of barter and malfunctioning incentives,

514
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,720
and being very good at a whole bunch of things, but in terms of progress, innovation,

515
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:56,240
and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure. Now, I wouldn't call that communism,

516
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,520
but that's what I think of the system the Soviets had, and it required an ever-increasing pile of

517
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,520
lies that both alienated people but created an elite that by the end of the thing no longer

518
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,680
believed in the system itself or even thought they were doing better by being crooks than by

519
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,840
just moving to Switzerland and being an upper-middle-class individual. You would have a higher

520
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:25,200
standard of living by Gorbachev's time, not Gorbachev, but if you're a number 30 in the hierarchy,

521
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,920
you're better off as a middle-class person in Switzerland, and that, of course, did not prove

522
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,960
sustainable. What is it? A momentum of bureaucracy or something like that? It just builds up where

523
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,080
you lose control of the original vision, and that naturally happens. It's just people.

524
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,320
And you can't use normal profit and loss in price incentives, so you get all prices,

525
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,800
or most prices, set to low. Shortage is everywhere. People trade favors. You have this culture of

526
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,960
bartered bribes, sexual favors, or family friends, and you get more and more of that,

527
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,600
and you over time lose more and more of the information and the prices and quantities

528
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,600
and practices and norms you had, and that slowly decays, and then by the end, no one is believing

529
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:14,080
in it. That would be my take, but again, you're the expert here, the Russian scholar.

530
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:23,920
Well, perhaps no more an expert than Ayn Rand. It's more personal than it is scholarly or historic.

531
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:34,160
So Stalin held power for 30 years. Vladimir Putin has held power for 21 years,

532
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,840
we could argue. He took a little break. But not much. He was still holding power, I think.

533
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,920
And it's still possible now with the new constitution that he could hold power for

534
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:53,040
longer than Stalin, 30 years. What do you think about the man, the state of affairs in Russia,

535
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,080
in general, the system they have there? Is there something interesting to use in economists as

536
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,640
a human being about Russia today? Everything is interesting. I mean, here would be

537
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:11,760
part of my take. As you know, the Russian economy starting what, 1999, 2000, has really quite a

538
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:18,960
few years of super excellent growth. And Putin is still riding on that. It more or less coincides

539
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:25,280
with his rise as the truly focal figure on the scene. Since then, pretty recently,

540
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,640
they've had a bunch of years of negative 4% to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible.

541
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,720
The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels. But the structural problem is this.

542
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:43,520
You need a concordance across economic power, social power, political power. They don't have to

543
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:50,400
be allocated identically, but they have to be allocated consistently. And the Russian system

544
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,120
under Putin from almost the beginning has never been able to have that, that ultimately his incentives

545
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,960
are to steer the system where the economic power is in a small number of hands in a non-diversified

546
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,840
way. The system won't deliver sustainable gains and living standards anymore, ever the way it's

547
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,560
set up now, that with fossil fuel prices go up, they'll have some good years for sure.

548
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,360
And that is really quite structural what has gone wrong. And then on top of that,

549
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,840
you can have an opinion of Putin. But you've got to start with those structural problems. And that's

550
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:31,200
why it's just not going to work. But he had all those good years in the beginning. So the number

551
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:37,280
of Russians, say, who live here or in Russia, who love Putin and it's sincere, they're not just afraid

552
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:45,200
of being dragged away. That's a real phenomenon. Yeah, I'm really torn on Putin's approval rating,

553
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:52,080
real approval rating. It seems to be very high. And I'm torn in whether that has to do with

554
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:01,120
the fact that there is control of the press or if it's, which is the people I talk to who are

555
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:07,760
in Russia, family and so on, a genuine love of Putin, appreciation of what Putin has done

556
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,040
and is going to do with Russia. But a lot of that would go away if the press were freer, I think.

557
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,480
Well, Singapore realizes this. Anyone discussed by the press, no matter who they are,

558
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,000
people in Singapore have done a great job. But if you're discussed by the press, you don't look

559
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:30,320
good. Tech company executives are learning this, right? It's just like a rule. So in that sense,

560
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,360
I think their rating is artificially high. But I don't, by any means, think it's all insincere.

561
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,800
But that high popularity, I view as bearish for Russia. I would feel better about the country

562
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,600
if people were more pissed off at him. Yeah, that's right. It's nice to see free speech,

563
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:54,240
even if it's full of hate. I am also troubled on the scientific side and entrepreneurial side.

564
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:02,560
It seems difficult to be an entrepreneur in Russia. It's not even in terms of rules.

565
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:11,520
It's just culturally that people I speak to, it's not easy to build a business. No,

566
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,120
it's not easy to even dream of building a business in Russia. That's just not part of the culture,

567
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:23,840
part of the conversation. It's almost like the conversation is, if you want to be the next

568
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:29,120
Bill Gates or Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or whatever, you come to America. That's the

569
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:36,320
sense they have. History matters. Is history just structural problems of today?

570
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,360
It's all the same thing. So a history of hostility to commerce, which of course,

571
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:49,280
the old USSR is gone, but a lot of the attitudes remain, a lot of the corruption remains. You have

572
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,320
this legacy distribution of wealth from the auctioning off of the assets, which is not conducive

573
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,560
to some kind of broadly egalitarian democracy. You have these small number of power points

574
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:06,320
that try to control information and wealth and not really so keen to encourage the others who

575
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,720
ultimately would pull the balance of political power away from the very wealthy and from Putin,

576
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:16,160
and they support that culture. The return of interest in Orthodox church and all that,

577
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:22,080
it's all part of the same piece, I think, because the old Orthodox church is not that pro-commerce,

578
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,480
you'd have to say, but it's traditionalist, it's pro-family, those are safer ideas,

579
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,280
and then there's such a great safety valve, the most ambitious, smartest people,

580
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,560
like they probably will learn English. They can look like they belong in all sorts of other

581
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,960
countries that can show up and blend in. Super talented, they've probably had an excellent

582
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,760
education, especially if they're from one of the two major cities, but even if not so,

583
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,480
even from Siberia, and they go off, they leave, they're not a source of opposition,

584
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,680
and that keeps the whole thing up and running for another generation.

585
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:03,680
Yeah. What do you make of the other big player, China? They seem to have a very different

586
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:13,120
messed up, but also functioning system. They seem to be much better at encouraging entrepreneurs.

587
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,080
They're choosing winners, but what do you make of the entire Chinese system?

588
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,280
Why does it work as well as it does currently? What are your concerns about it, and what are

589
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:35,120
its threats to the United States, or possible wisdom when two ideas come together? Is there

590
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,520
some possible benefits of these kinds of ideas coming together?

591
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:45,840
It's amazing what China has done, but I would say to put it in perspective, if you compare them

592
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:50,560
to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, they've still done much worse,

593
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:59,760
not even close. That's both living standards, or I hesitate to cite democracy as an unalloyed good

594
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,880
in and of itself, but there's more freedom in all those other places by a lot. China has all

595
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,160
these problems of history, but they've managed, as actually the Soviets did in the middle of the

596
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,240
20th century, one of the two great mass migrations from the countryside to cities, which boosts

597
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:22,720
productivity enormously, and will sustain totalitarian systems, but they move from a totalitarian

598
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:30,480
system to an oligarchy, where the CCP is actually, at least for a while, has been really good at

599
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,560
governing, have made a lot of very good decisions. You have to admit that. I don't know how long

600
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:45,760
that streak will continue, with one person so much now holding authority in a more extreme manner.

601
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,600
The selection pressures for the next generation of high-level CCP members probably become much

602
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:57,040
worse. You have this general problem of the state-owned enterprise is losing relative productivity

603
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,480
compared to the private sector. Well, we're going to kind of hold Jack Ma on this island,

604
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:09,520
and he can only issue weird hello statements. It kind of smells bad to me. I don't feel that

605
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:17,200
it's about to crash, but I don't see them supplanting America as the world's number one country.

606
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,720
I think they will muddle through and have very serious problems, but there's enough talent there

607
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,920
they will muddle through. Is there ideas from China, from anywhere in general, of large-scale

608
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,320
role of government that you find might be useful? Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform, UBI,

609
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:41,760
my universal basic income. Is there some interesting ideas of large-scale

610
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,080
government welfare programs at scale that you find interesting?

611
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:57,920
Well, keep in mind, the current version of the Chinese Communist Party post Mao dismantled what

612
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,760
was called the iron rice ball. It took apart the healthcare protections, a lot of the welfare system,

613
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,120
a lot of the guaranteed jobs. The economic rise of China coincided with the weakening

614
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:16,720
of welfare. I'm not saying that's causal per se, but people think of China as having a government

615
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,840
that takes care of everyone. It's very far from the truth. By a lot of metrics, I don't mean control

616
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:26,960
over people's lives. I don't mean speech, but by a lot of metrics, economically, we have a lot more

617
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,280
government than they do. What one means here by government, private control, I don't think you

618
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:38,880
can just add up the numbers and get a simple answer. They've been fantastic at building

619
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,800
infrastructure in cities in ways that will attract people from the countryside. Furthermore,

620
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:51,200
they more or less enforce a meritocracy in this sense. If you're a kid of a rich guy,

621
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,800
you'll get unfair privilege. That's unfair, but systems can afford that. If you are smart and

622
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:02,160
from the countryside and your parents have nothing, you will be elevated and sent to a very good

623
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,040
school, graduate school, because of the exam system. They do that and they mean that very

624
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:12,320
consistently. It's like the Soviets had a version of that, like the chess and romantic piano,

625
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,880
not for everything, but where they had it. Again, they were tremendous.

626
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:23,440
Chinese have it in so many areas, a genuine meritocracy in this one way.

627
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:29,040
That moves people from the rural to the big city and that's a big boost of productivity for

628
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,920
so amount of time. When they get there, they're taken seriously. Jack Ma was riding a bicycle

629
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,880
teaching English in his late 20s. He was a poor guy. Not a society of credentialism.

630
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,280
In America, it's way too much a credentialist society.

631
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,960
As we were talking about, even with the Nobel Prize. What do you think about

632
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:55,760
these large government programs like UBI? The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me

633
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,840
is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids. Kids are vulnerable. If their parents screw up, you

634
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,760
shouldn't blame the kid or make the kids suffer. I believe in something like UBI for kids, maybe

635
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:15,600
just cash. But if you don't have kids, even with AI, my sense is at least in the world we know,

636
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:22,480
you should be able to find a way to adjust. You might have to move to North Dakota to work

637
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:32,960
next to fracking, say. But look, before the pandemic, the two most robot-intensive societies,

638
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,520
Japan and the US, at least for manufacturing, were at full employment. Maybe there's some far

639
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:45,040
off day where there's literally no work. John Lennon and Imagine, it's piped everywhere.

640
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:53,760
Then we might revisit the question. But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years and full

641
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,240
employment. You don't see automation as a threat that fundamentally shakes our society.

642
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,560
It's a threat in the following sense. The new technologies are harder to work with for many

643
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:11,120
people and that's a social problem. But I'm not sure a universal basic income is the right answer

644
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:20,160
to that very real problem. I like the UBI for kids. It's also your definition or the line,

645
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,840
the threshold for what is vulnerable and what is basic human nature. Going back to Russia,

646
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:34,880
life is suffering. That struggle is a part of life and perhaps changing. Maybe what defines

647
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,480
the 21st century is having multiple careers and adjusting and learning and evolving.

648
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:54,480
Some of the technology we see like the internet allows us to make those pivots easier.

649
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:01,120
Allows later life education possible. It makes it possible. I don't know.

650
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,560
And your earlier point about loneliness being this fundamental human problem,

651
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:10,080
which I would agree with strongly, UBI, if it's at a high level, will make that worse.

652
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,560
I mean, say UBI were higher enough, you could just sit at home.

653
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:19,360
People are not going to be happy. They don't actually want that. We've relearned that in the

654
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:27,040
pandemic. Yeah. The flip side, the hope with UBI is you have a little bit more freedom to find the

655
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:32,560
thing that alleviates your loneliness. That's the idea. So it's kind of an open question.

656
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:40,560
If I give you a million dollars or a billion dollars, will you pursue the thing you love?

657
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,440
Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love, to do the thing you love? Or will you be

658
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,160
lazy and lose yourself in the sort of daily activities that don't actually bring you joy,

659
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:02,720
but pacify you in some kind of way where you just let the day slip by? That's an open question.

660
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,520
A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions, whether it was Mozart or James Brown

661
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:13,840
or the great painters in history. They had to work pretty hard. And if you look at heirs to great

662
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:19,840
fortunes, maybe I'm forgetting someone, but it's hard to think of any who have creatively been

663
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:27,520
important as novelists or they might have continued to run the family business. But Van Gogh was not

664
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:37,360
heir to a great family fortune. It's sad that cushions get in the way of progress. It's the same

665
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,760
point about prizes, right? Yeah. Heriting too much money is like winning a prize.

666
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,560
We mentioned Eric, Eric Weinstein. I know you agree on a bunch of things. Is there some beautiful,

667
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,040
fascinating insights for disagreement that you have? Does he have to be resolved with him?

668
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,600
Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on? Is it the stagnation question that you've

669
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:06,960
mentioned? That's one of them, but here's at least two others. But I would stress Eric is

670
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,760
always evolving. So I'm just talking about a time slice, Eric, right? I don't know where he's at

671
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,400
right now. Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago, but that was three nights ago.

672
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:22,640
But I think he's far too pessimistic about the impact of immigration on US science.

673
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:29,200
He thinks it has displaced US scientists, which I think that is partly true. I just think we've

674
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:35,360
gotten better talent. I'm like, bring it on, double down. And look at Kurt Eco, who basically

675
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:41,520
came up with mRNA vaccines. She was from Hungary and was ridiculed and mocked. She couldn't cut

676
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:48,320
her papers published. She stuck at it. An American might not have been so stubborn because we have

677
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:53,520
these cushions. So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in, they're discouraging

678
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:00,240
native US citizens from doing math. I'm like, bring in the best people. If we all end up

679
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,920
in other avocations, absolutely fine by me. Does it trouble you that we kick them out

680
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:12,400
after they get a degree often? I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree a green card

681
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:18,880
universally. Yeah. I agree with that. It makes no sense. It makes so strange that the best people

682
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,760
that come here suffer here, create awesome stuff here. Then when we kick them out, it doesn't make

683
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,840
any sense. Here's another view I have. I call it open borders for Belarus. Now, Russia is a big

684
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:38,320
country. I would gladly increase the Russian quota by 3x, 4x, 5x. Not 20%, but a big boost.

685
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:45,760
But Belarus is a small country. They're poor and they have decent education

686
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:52,480
and a lot of talent there. Why can't we just open the door and convert a Belarus passport to a green

687
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,520
card? Open borders for Belarus. It's my new campaign slogan. Are you running for president?

688
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:04,080
23 or 24? Well, writings are welcome. What's the second thing you disagree with, Eric?

689
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:14,080
Trade. Again, I'm not sure where he's at now, but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.

690
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:19,760
I do understand what's called the China shock has been a big problem for the US middle class.

691
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:25,920
I fully accept that. I think most of that is behind us. National security issues aside,

692
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:32,960
I think free trade is very much a good thing. Eric, I'm not sure he'll say it's not a good thing,

693
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,680
but he won't say it is a good thing. I know he's like, Eric, free trade. But look,

694
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,400
on things like vaccines, I don't believe in free trade. You want vaccine production

695
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,040
in your own country. Look at the EU. They have enough money. No one will send them vaccines.

696
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:54,560
What's different about vaccines? There's some things you want to prioritize the

697
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:01,120
citizenry on. You could argue it would be cheaper to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.

698
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,920
They have the technologies, obviously lower wages. But look, there's talk in India right now of cutting

699
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,280
off the export of vaccines. If you outsource your vaccine production, you're not sure the other country

700
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:19,280
will respect the norm of free trade. You need to keep some vaccine production in your country.

701
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,160
It's an exception to free trade, not to the logic.

702
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:29,120
A bunch of things the Navy uses. You can't buy those components from China. That's insane.

703
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:37,680
But look, it would be cheaper to do so, right? Yeah. Let me completely shift topics on something

704
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,640
that's fascinating. It's all the same topic, but great. Everything is interesting.

705
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:51,200
What do you think about what the hell is money and the recent

706
01:11:53,840 --> 01:12:03,120
excitement around cryptocurrency that brings to the forefront the philosophical discussion

707
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,840
of the nature of money? Are you bullish on cryptocurrency? Are you excited about it?

708
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,760
What does it make you think about how the nature of money is changing?

709
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:17,200
No one knows what money is. Probably no one ever knew. Go back to medieval times. Bills of

710
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:22,880
exchange. Were they money? Maybe it's just a semantic debate. Gold, silver. What about copper

711
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,440
coins? What about metals that were considered legal tender, but not always circulating?

712
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:35,200
What about credit? Being confused about money is the natural state of affairs for human beings.

713
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,680
If there's more of that, I'd say that's probably a good thing.

714
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,480
Now, crypto, per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over a lot of the space held by gold.

715
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:53,360
That to me seems sustainable. I'm not short Bitcoin. I don't have some view that the price

716
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,560
has to be different than the current price, but I know it changes every moment.

717
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:04,560
I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto, which seems connected to ultimate visions of

718
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:12,000
using it for transactions in ways where I'm not sure whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.

719
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:18,240
I'm not sure the retail demand really is there once it is regulated like everything else is.

720
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:25,520
I would say I'm 40, 60 optimistic on those forms of crypto. That is, I think it's somewhat more

721
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,040
likely they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously.

722
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,800
So we're talking about it becoming one of the main currencies in the world.

723
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,120
That's what we're discussing. That I don't think will happen.

724
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:42,160
But the reality is that Bitcoin used to be in the single digits of a dollar,

725
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:48,800
and now has crossed $50,000 for a single Bitcoin. Do you think it's possible it reaches something

726
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,560
like a million dollars? I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin. If people

727
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,800
decide it's worth a million dollars, it's worth a million dollars. But isn't that money, like you

728
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,120
said, isn't the ultimate state of money confusion, however beautifully you put it?

729
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,680
It's like valuing an Andy Warhol painting. So when Warhol started off, probably those things

730
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:13,520
had no value in the sketches, early sketches of shoes. Now a good Warhol could be worth over

731
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,920
$50 million. That's an incredible rate of price appreciation. Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.

732
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:25,680
I don't pretend to know where it will stop, but it's about trying to figure out what did people

733
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:30,880
think of Andy Warhol. He could be out of fashion in a century, maybe yes, maybe no.

734
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,640
But you don't think about Warhol's as money. They perform some money-like functions. You

735
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:45,920
can even use them as collateral for deals between gangs. But they're not basically money, nor is

736
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,640
Bitcoin. And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin, I would think, is likely to fall, if anything.

737
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,480
So you don't think there will be some kind of phase shift? Will it become adopted,

738
01:14:54,480 --> 01:15:00,080
become mainstream for one of the main mechanisms of transactions?

739
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,640
Bitcoin, no. Now, Ether has some chance at that. I would bet against it,

740
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:12,240
but I wouldn't give you a definitive no. Bitcoin is too costly. It may be fine to hold it like gold,

741
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:19,440
but gold is also costly. You have smart people trying to make, say, Ether, much more effective

742
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:25,440
as a currency than Bitcoin. And there's certainly a decent chance they will succeed.

743
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,960
Yeah, there's a lot of innovation. It was smart contracts with NFTs as well. There's a lot of

744
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:37,040
interesting innovations that are plugging into the human psyche somehow, just like money does.

745
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:45,280
Money seems to be this viral thing, our ideas of money. And if the idea is strong enough,

746
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:49,760
it seems to be able to take hold. Like there's network effects that just take over.

747
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,720
And I particularly see that with, I'd love to get your comment on the Dogecoin,

748
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:03,120
which is basically by a single human being Elon Musk has been created. It's like these celebrities

749
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:10,800
can have a huge ripple effect on the impact of money. Is it possible that in the 21st century,

750
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,280
people like Elon Musk and celebrities, I don't know, Donald Trump, the Rock,

751
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,080
whoever else, can actually define the currencies that we use. Can Dogecoin be

752
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:29,120
kind of the primary currency of the world? I think of it as like baseball cards.

753
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,920
So right now, every baseball player has a baseball card. And the players who are stars,

754
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,720
their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money. And that's stable. We've had it for many

755
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:45,040
decades. Sort of the player defines the card. They sign a contract with Tops or whatever company.

756
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,080
Now, could you imagine celebrities, baseball players, LeBron James,

757
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,280
having their own currencies instead of cards? Absolutely. And you're somewhat seeing that

758
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,960
right now, as you mentioned, artists with these unique works on the blockchain.

759
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:05,040
But I'm not sure those are macroeconomically important. If it's just a new class of collectibles

760
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:12,000
that people have fun with, again, I say bring it on. But whether there are use cases beyond that,

761
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,680
the challenge fiat monies, which actually work very well. Yesterday, I sent money

762
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:24,160
to a family in Ethiopia that I helped support. In less than 24 hours, they got that money.

763
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:31,760
Digitally. Yes. No, not digitally, through my bank. My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&T,

764
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,640
Mid-Atlantic Bank, had quartered in North Carolina,

765
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,720
charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and the OCC. Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate

766
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:48,880
was not so great. I don't see crypto as close to beating that once you take into account all of

767
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,800
the last mile problems. The fiat currency works really well. People are not sitting around bitching

768
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,880
about it. And when you talk to crypto people, the number who have to postulate some out of the

769
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,640
blue hyperinflation, there's no evidence for that whatsoever. That's Denise's sign, they're not

770
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,960
thinking clearly about how hard they have to work to outcompete fiat currency.

771
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:15,120
There's a bunch of different technologies that are really exciting that don't want to address

772
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,480
how difficult it is to outcompete the current accepted alternative. So, for example, autonomous

773
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:27,120
vehicles, a lot of people are really excited. Yeah. But it's not trivial to outcompete Uber

774
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,720
on the cost and the effectiveness and the user experience and all those kinds of...

775
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,720
Correct. Sorry, Uber driven by humans.

776
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,120
Yes.

777
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:42,400
And it's not, that's taken for granted, I think, that look, wouldn't it be amazing? How amazing

778
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,800
would the world look when the cars are driving themselves fully? It's going to drive the cost

779
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,440
down. You can remove the cost of drivers, all those kinds of things. But when you actually get down

780
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,760
to it and have to build a business around it, it's actually very difficult to do. And I guess

781
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:02,400
you're saying your sense is a similar competition is facing cryptocurrency. You have to actually

782
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:12,720
present a killer app reason to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or whatever.

783
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:17,040
And the Biden people are going to regulate crypto and they're going to do it soon. So,

784
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:22,800
something like DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper or for some can be cheaper than other

785
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:27,760
ways of conducting financial intermediation. But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.

786
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:33,600
It will not be allowed to go on forever for better or worse. I would rather see it given

787
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:38,480
greater tolerance. But the point is banking lobby is strong. The government will only let

788
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,920
it run so far. There'll be capital requirements, reporting requirements imposed. And it will lose

789
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:49,760
a lot of those advantages. What do you make of Wall Street bets? Another thing that recently

790
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:57,600
happened that shook the world and at least me from the outside of perspective make me question

791
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:05,280
what I do and don't understand about economics, which is a large number of individuals getting

792
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:11,280
together on the internet and having a large-scale impact on the markets. If you tell a group of

793
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,200
people and coordinate them through the internet, we're going to play a fun game. It might cost you

794
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,880
money, but you're going to make the headlines. And there's a chance you'll screw over some

795
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:24,400
billionaires and hedge funds. Enough people will play that game. So that game might continue. But I

796
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:30,560
don't think it's of macroeconomic importance. And the price of those stocks in the medium term

797
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:36,640
will end up wherever it ought to be. So these are little outliers from a macroeconomics perspective.

798
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:46,400
These are not signals of shifting power, like from centralized power to distributed power. These

799
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:51,840
aren't some fundamental changes in the way our economy works. I think of it as a new brand of

800
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:58,000
eSports, maybe more fun than the old brand, which is fine. It's like push the anarchy into the

801
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,480
corners where you want it. It doesn't bother me, but I think people are seeing it as a more fun

802
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:09,600
amount than it is. It's a new eSport, more fun for many, but more expensive than the old eSports.

803
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:16,800
Like chess is a new eSport. It's super cheap. Not as fun as sending hedge funds to their doom,

804
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:23,360
but what would you expect? The poetry of that. I love it. But macroeconomically,

805
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,800
it's not fundamental. I was going to say, I hope you're right because I'm uncomfortable with the

806
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:35,920
chaos of the masses that's creates. I think that chaos is somewhat real, to be clear,

807
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:45,200
but it will matter through other channels, not through manipulating GameStop or AMC.

808
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,560
You're seeing the real macro phenomenon. When people see a real macro phenomenon,

809
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:56,080
they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative. This micro story fits the narrative,

810
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:59,520
but it doesn't mean its importance fits the narrative. That's how I would

811
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,720
kind of dissect the mistake I think people are making.

812
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,760
The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean?

813
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,880
Everyone's weird now. The internet either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder.

814
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,280
I'm not sure what's the right way to put it. Maybe a mix of both.

815
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,960
You're probably right that it allows us to be weirder because, well, this is the other.

816
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:26,480
Okay, so this connects to our previous conversation. Does America allow us to be weirder,

817
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,600
or does it make us weirder? Say we're weirder and somewhat neurotic to begin with,

818
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:36,880
but the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower and I Love Lucy and Network TV.

819
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:43,760
That's going to keep us within certain bounds in good and bad ways. That's obviously totally gone,

820
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,920
and the internet you can connect to, not just QAnon, but all sorts of things,

821
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:54,160
many of them just fantastic. But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder.

822
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,920
So that maybe is troubling, right? Like if someone's worried about that,

823
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,800
I would at least say they should give it deep serious thought. And then it has a whole lot of

824
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,720
ebbs and flows, micro-realizations of the weirdness that don't actually matter.

825
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,760
So like chess players today, they play a lot more weird openings than they did 20 years ago.

826
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,960
Like it reflects the same thing because you can research any weird opening on the internet,

827
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:24,320
but like does that matter? Probably not. So a lot of the things we see are just like the

828
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,720
weird chess openings. And to figure out which are like the weird chess openings and which are

829
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:33,440
fundamental to the new and growing weirdness. Like that's what a hedge fund investor type

830
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:39,120
should be trying to do. I just think no one knows yet. It's like this itself, this fun weird guessing

831
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:44,880
game, which we're partly engaging in right now. Exactly. And I mean, as Eric talks about

832
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:51,280
on the science side of things, I mean, I said, like at MIT, especially in the machine learning

833
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:57,520
field, there's a natural institutional resistance to the weird. As they talk about,

834
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:04,000
it's difficult to hire weird faculty, for example. Correct. You want to hire and give

835
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,600
tenure to people that are safe, not weird. And that's one of the concerns is like,

836
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,960
it seems like the weird people are the ones that push the science forward usually.

837
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:19,360
And so how do you balance it too? It's not obvious. It's another area where Eric and I

838
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:25,360
disagree. As I interpret him, he thinks academia is totally bankrupt. And I think it's only

839
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:31,920
partially bankrupt. How do we fix it? Because I'm with you. I'm bullish on academia.

840
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:37,200
You need up and coming schools that end up better than where they started off. And MIT

841
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,240
was once one of them. Now they're not in every area. In some areas, they have become the problem.

842
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:47,200
You Chicago, you wouldn't call it up and coming, but it's still different. And that's great. Let's

843
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:55,360
hope they manage to keep it that way. The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism at

844
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:00,560
kind of second tier schools, maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen, that are just trying to

845
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:06,720
be like a junior MIT, but it's mediocre and copycat. And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of

846
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:11,920
weirdness that like Harvard is more open than those second tier schools. And those second

847
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,800
tier schools are pretty good, typically, right? Yeah. But the mediocrity is enforced there.

848
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:22,960
Correct. Very strictly. And the homogenization pressure is trying to climb their rankings by

849
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,680
another three places and be a little closer to MIT, though you'll never touch them. That to me is

850
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,360
very harmful. And you'd rather they be more like Chicago, more like Caltech, or the older Caltech

851
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:39,840
all the more like pick some model, be weird in it. You might fail. That's socially better.

852
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:48,240
Yeah. So the problem with MIT, for example, is the mediocrity is really enforced on the

853
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:53,840
junior faculty. So the people that are allowed to be weird, or actually they just don't even ask

854
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,880
for permissions anymore, are more senior faculty. And that's good, of course, but you want the

855
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:07,120
weird young people. I find this podcast, I like talking to tech people, and I find the young

856
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:11,040
faculty to be really boring. They are. They're the most boring of faculty.

857
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:18,800
Their work is interesting technically, technically, but just the passion. They are dredges.

858
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:26,560
And some of them sneak by. Like you have like the young version of Max Tagmark who

859
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:34,160
knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in. And then on the side, he does the weird shit.

860
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,800
But they're not, they're far and few in between, which I'd love to figure out a way to shake up

861
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:46,080
that system because. If you look at MIT's Broad Institute, right, in biomedical, it's been a

862
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:51,600
huge hit. I'm not privy to their internal doings, but I suspect they support weird

863
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,560
more than the formal departments do at the junior level. Yes, that's probably true. Yeah,

864
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:03,760
I don't know what whatever they're doing is working, but it needs to figure it out because I

865
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:11,280
think the best ideas still do come from the, so forget my apologies, but for the humanity side

866
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:16,400
of things, I don't know anything, Bob, but the engineering and the science side, I think there's

867
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,800
so many amazing ideas that are still coming from universities. It's not true that you don't know

868
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:25,600
anything about the humanities. You're doing the humanities right now. We're talking about people.

869
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,160
There are no numbers put on a blackboard, right? There's no hypothesis testing per se.

870
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:36,080
You have however many subscribers to your podcast, all listening to you on the humanities.

871
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,800
Whatever your frequency is. But I'm not in the department of the humanities.

872
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,240
That's why it's innovative. They have very different conversations.

873
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:53,840
The number of emails I get about, listen, I really deeply respect diversity and the full

874
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:58,880
scope of what diversity means and also the more narrow scope of different races and genders and

875
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,920
so on. It's a really important topic, but there's a disproportionate number of emails I'm getting

876
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,840
about meetings and discussions and that just kind of is overwhelming. I don't get enough emails

877
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:18,720
from people like a meeting about why are all your ideas bad? For example, let me call out MIT.

878
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:25,440
Why don't we do more? Why don't we kick Stanford's ass or Google's ass more importantly in deep

879
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:31,520
learning and machine learning and AI research. What CCEL, for example, used to be a laboratory,

880
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:39,680
is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research. Why is that not the beacon of

881
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,040
greatness in artificial intelligence? Let's have those meetings as well.

882
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,400
Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism for enforcing conformity.

883
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,880
Yes, exactly. It's almost like this conformity mechanism finds

884
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,080
the hot new topic to use to enforce further conformity.

885
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:03,280
Exactly. Oh boy, I still hope I'm an optimistic.

886
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,880
The humanities have innovated through podcasts, including yours and mine,

887
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,760
and they're alive and well. All the bad talk you hear about the humanities in universities,

888
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:17,520
there's been this huge end run of innovation on the internet, and it's amazing.

889
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,080
You're right. I never thought, I mean, this is humanities.

890
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:25,920
It's like I've been speaking prose all one's life and didn't know it, right?

891
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,840
Yeah, I am actually part of the humanities department at MIT now.

892
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,000
I did not realize this, and I will fully embrace it from this moment on.

893
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,960
Look, you have this thing, the Media Lab, I'm sure you know about it.

894
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,680
Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,

895
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,960
but you're out competing them. You're blowing them out of the water.

896
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,800
Yeah. Like you are them.

897
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:51,360
Yeah, and I'm talking to those folks, and they're trying to figure it out.

898
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,320
I mean, they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on, but outside of that,

899
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,680
there's actually gone through a shift with this particular podcast, for example,

900
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:08,880
where at first, it was seen as one, at the very first, it was seen as a distraction.

901
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:13,600
Second, it was a source of almost like a kind of jealousy,

902
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,080
like the same kind of jealousy you feel when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.

903
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:18,960
Of course.

904
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,680
And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing. We should do more of that.

905
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,240
We should embrace this guy. We should embrace this thing.

906
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,920
So there's a sense that podcasting and whatever this is, and it doesn't have to be podcasting,

907
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,440
will drive some innovation within MIT, within different universities.

908
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,120
There's a sense that things are changing. It's just that university is lagged behind.

909
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:49,440
And my hope is that they catch up quickly. They innovate in some way that goes along

910
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:54,160
with the innovations of the internet. I think the internet will outrace them for a long time,

911
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,480
maybe forever. Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're, as long as they keep them.

912
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:02,640
Yeah, and we're both in universities, so we have multiple hats on here, as we're speaking.

913
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,520
We can complain about the university, but that's like complaining about the podcast.

914
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,280
Yeah, we be them.

915
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:17,520
But speaking on the weird, you've, in the best sense of the word weird, you've written about

916
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:21,280
and made the case that we should take you a full sightings more seriously.

917
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:32,960
So that's one of the things that I've been inundated with, sort of the excitement and the

918
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:40,000
passion that people have for the possibility of extraterrestrial life, of life out there in

919
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
the universe. I've always felt this excitement. I'm just looking up at the stars and wondering

920
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:51,520
what the hell's out there. But there's people that have more like, more grounded excitement

921
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:57,040
and passion of actually interacting with the, with aliens on this here, our planet.

922
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:04,800
What's the case from your perspective for taking these sightings more seriously?

923
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:13,840
The data from the Navy to me seem quite serious. I don't pretend that I have the technical

924
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,480
abilities to judge it as data, but there are numerous senators at the very highest of levels,

925
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,840
former heads of CIA, Brennan, I talked to him, did an interview with him. I asked him,

926
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,640
what's up with these? What do you think it is? He basically said that was the single most likely

927
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:36,240
explanation was of alien origin. Now you don't have to agree with him. But look, if you know how

928
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:41,520
government works, these senators or Hillary Clinton for that matter or Brennan, they sat down,

929
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,920
they were briefed by their smartest people and they said, hey, what's going on here?

930
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:53,040
And everyone around the table, I believe is telling them, we don't know. And that is sociological data.

931
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,960
I take very seriously. I have not seen a debunking of the technical data.

932
01:32:58,960 --> 01:32:59,440
Yes.

933
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:03,760
Which is eyewitness reports and images and radar. Again, at a technical level,

934
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:09,200
I feel quite uncertain on that turf. But evaluating the testimony of witnesses,

935
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:14,320
it seems to me it's now at a threshold where one ought to take it seriously.

936
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:20,320
Yeah, there's a, one of the problems with UFO sightings is that because of people with good

937
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:27,280
equipment, don't take it seriously. It's such a taboo topic that you have just like really

938
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:32,640
shitty equipment collecting data. And so you have the blurry bigfoot kind of situation where you

939
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:39,760
have just bad video and all those kinds of things. As opposed to, I mean, there's a bunch of people,

940
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:49,920
Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Amua Amua. It's just like people with the equipment to do

941
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:59,120
the data collection don't want to help out. And that creates a kind of divide where the scientists

942
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:03,440
ignore that this is happening. And there's the masses of people who are curious about it.

943
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,000
And then there's the government that's full of secrets. That's leaking some confusion.

944
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,400
And it creates distrust in the government. It creates distrust in science.

945
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:19,760
And it prevents the scientists from being able to explore some cool topics,

946
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,280
some exciting possibilities that they should be, be curious kids like Avi talks about.

947
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:30,320
Even if it has nothing to do with aliens, whatever the answer is, it has to be something

948
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,600
fascinating. We already know everything's interesting, but this is fascinating.

949
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,000
But look, that all said, I suspect they're not of alien origin. And let's let me tell you my

950
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:45,920
reason. The people who are all gung-ho, they do a kind of reasoning in reverse or argument from

951
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,520
elimination. They figure out a bunch of things that can't be like, is it a Russian advanced vehicle?

952
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:56,560
No, probably pretty good arguments there. Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle? No.

953
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:03,520
Is it people like from the Earth's future coming back in time? No. And they go through a few others.

954
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,960
They have some really good, no arguments. And they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens.

955
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:13,600
This argument from elimination, I don't actually find that persuasive. You can talk yourself into

956
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:20,400
a lot of mistaken ideas that way. The positive evidence that it's aliens is still quite weak.

957
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,360
The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.

958
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,400
And whatever the solutions to the puzzle is, it might be fascinating.

959
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,800
And it's going to be so weird or fascinating or maybe even trivial, but that's weird in its own way

960
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:38,640
that we can't set up by elimination all the things that might be able to be.

961
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:43,200
Yeah. And just like you said, the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things

962
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:52,160
are less explorations and solutions to the puzzle and more a kind of have-hearted dismissal.

963
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:58,640
And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him, he's been attacked an awful lot.

964
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:02,880
And when I hear the idea carrier attacked, I get very suspicious of the critics.

965
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:11,200
If he's wrong, just tell me why. My ears are open. I don't have a set view on Oumuamua.

966
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,920
I know I can't judge Avi's arguments. He can't convince me in that sense.

967
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,760
I'm too stupid to understand how good his argument may or may not be.

968
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:27,920
And like you said, ultimately, in the argument, in the meeting of that debate

969
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:32,560
is where we find the wisdom, like dismissing it. There's one thing that troubles me.

970
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,360
There's a bunch of people like Nietzsche, sometimes dismiss this way,

971
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:41,200
Ein Miranda, sometimes dismiss this way. Oh, here we go. There's a supposed to

972
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:47,520
arguing against her ideas, dismissing it outright. And that's not productive at all.

973
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:52,800
She may be wrong in a lot of things, but like laying out some arguments,

974
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:58,480
even if they're basic human arguments, that's where we arrive at the wisdom. I love that.

975
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:06,640
Is there something deeper to be said about our trust in institutions and governments and so on

976
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:13,120
that has to do with UFOs? That there's a kind of suspicion that the US government and governments

977
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,960
in general are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs.

978
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:22,800
This is my view on that. If we declassified everything, I think we would find a lot more

979
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:28,160
evidence all pointing toward the same puzzle. There aren't some alien men being held underground.

980
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,520
Yes. There's not some secret file that lays out whatever is happening.

981
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:38,080
I think the real lesson about government is government cannot bring itself to any

982
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:44,640
new belief on this matter of any kind. And it's a funny inertia. Government is deeply puzzled.

983
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:50,080
They're more puzzled than they want to admit to us, which I'm okay with that, actually.

984
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,560
They shouldn't just be out panicking people in the streets. But at the end of the day,

985
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:58,960
it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which does work, and they haven't

986
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:05,520
approved it. When are they going to do it? When is our government actually, if only internally,

987
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,240
going to take this more than just seriously, but take it truly seriously?

988
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,320
And I just don't know if we have that capability, kind of mentally,

989
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,600
to sound like Eric Weinstein for another moment.

990
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,520
To stay on the same topic, although on the surface shifting completely,

991
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:31,120
because it is all the same topic, you have written and studied art. What do you think we humans

992
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:37,120
mean? Long to create art. Human society in general, and just the human mind.

993
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,640
Well, most of us don't really long to create art, right? I would start with that point.

994
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:49,840
You think so? You think that's the unique weirdness of some particular humans?

995
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:55,520
I think, I don't know, 10% of humans, roughly, which is a lot. But it is somewhat weird.

996
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,280
Yeah. I don't aspire to create art. You could say

997
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,440
a writing nonfiction, there's something art-like about it, but it's a different urge, I would say.

998
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:15,200
So why do some people have it? I think human brains are very different. It's a different

999
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:20,800
notion of working through a problem, like you and I enjoy working through analytic problems.

1000
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:26,400
For me, economics for you AI in other areas or your humanity's podcast, but that's fun.

1001
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:33,520
For that problem to be visual and linked to physical materials and putting those on a canvas,

1002
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:41,440
to me, it's not a huge leap. But I really don't want to do it. It would be pain. If you paid me

1003
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:49,280
like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting, I don't know. Is that worth it? Maybe, but

1004
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:55,920
I'm happy when that hour's over. And would not be proud or happy with the results?

1005
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,040
It would suck. I don't think I would do it, actually.

1006
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:06,640
Do you think you're suppressing some deep... Absolutely not. Now, when I was young, I played

1007
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:10,720
the guitar as you played the guitar, and that I greatly enjoyed, although I was never good.

1008
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:16,240
But it helped me appreciate music much, much more. Well, this is the question. Okay. So from the

1009
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:22,160
perspective of the observer and the appreciator of art, you said good. Is there such a concept as

1010
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:28,160
good in art? There's clearly a concept of bad. My guitar playing fit that concept.

1011
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:33,520
Okay. But I wasn't trying to be good. I wanted to learn how do chords work?

1012
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,040
Okay. Analytical. How does a jazz improvisation work? How is blues different?

1013
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,560
Classical guitar, sort of physically, how do you make those sounds?

1014
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,640
Yes. And I did learn those things. And you can't learn everything about them,

1015
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:48,560
but you can learn a lot about them without ever being good or even trying to be that good.

1016
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:53,680
But I could play all the notes. So from the observer perspective, what do you...

1017
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,240
Apologize to the absurd question, but what do you use the most beautiful or maybe a moving

1018
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:04,800
piece of art you've encountered in your life? It's not an absurd question at all.

1019
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:13,440
And I think about this quite a bit. I would say the two winners by a clear margin are both by

1020
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:20,720
Michelangelo. It's the Pieta in the Vatican and the David statue in Florence.

1021
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:25,200
Why? Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?

1022
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:28,960
I don't think you can view it apart from historical context and being in Florence

1023
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:34,400
or in the Vatican. You're already primed for a lot, right? You can't pull that out.

1024
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:42,000
But just technically how they express the emotion of human form, I do honestly intellectually think

1025
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,280
they're the two greatest artworks for doing that. That's not all that art does. Not all art is about

1026
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:54,160
the human form, but they are phenomenal. And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,

1027
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:58,880
but my view is not considered a crazy one within the broader part of critical opinion.

1028
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:05,440
Now in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away was to see Vermeer's artwork. It's

1029
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:11,760
called the Art of Painting and it's in Vienna in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. And I saw that,

1030
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:18,880
I think I was 23. It just stunned me because I'd seen reproductions, but live in front of you

1031
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,480
in huge, a completely different artwork. And again, Vienna primed.

1032
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:28,560
Yes. And I was living abroad for the first time in Vienna itself, the city and so on.

1033
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,080
Now, unlike the Michelangeloes, that is not my current favorite painting,

1034
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,360
but that would be like historically the one I would pick.

1035
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,600
What do you make in the context of those choices? What do you make of modern art?

1036
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:45,520
And I apologize if I'm not using the correct terminology, but art that maybe

1037
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:53,200
is goes another level of weird outside of the art that you've kind of mentioned and breaks

1038
01:42:53,200 --> 01:43:00,720
all the conventions and rules and so on and becomes something else entirely that doesn't make sense

1039
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:06,880
in the same way that David might. I think a lot of it is phenomenal. And I would say the single

1040
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:13,040
biggest mistake that really smart people make is to think contemporary art or music for that

1041
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:17,840
matter is just a load of junk or rubbish. It's just like a kind of mathematics they haven't

1042
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:23,920
learned yet. It's really hard to learn. Maybe some people can never learn it. But there's

1043
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:29,600
a very large community of super smart, well-educated people who spend their lives with it, who love it.

1044
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,360
Those are genuine pleasures. They understand it. They talk about it with the common language.

1045
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,640
And to think that somehow they're all frauds, it just isn't true. Like one doesn't have to

1046
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:44,000
like it oneself, just like love house may or may not be your thing. But it is amazing and for me

1047
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,840
personally highly rewarding. And if someone doesn't get it, I do kind of have the conceited response

1048
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,840
of thinking like in that area, I'm just smarter than you are. Yeah. So the interesting thing is,

1049
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,040
as with most... We get back to Eric Weinstein again. Yes.

1050
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:03,920
Who is in general smarter than I am. This I get. But when it comes to contemporary

1051
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,720
artistic creations, I'm smarter than he is. So he's not a fan of contemporary art?

1052
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:12,000
I don't want to speak for him. I've heard him say... He's evolving always.

1053
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,400
He's evolving always. I've heard him say derogatory things about some of it. Doesn't

1054
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,840
mean he doesn't love some other parts of it. So I wonder if there's just a higher learning curve,

1055
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:28,080
a steeper learning curve for contemporary art, meaning like it takes more work to appreciate

1056
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:33,360
the stories, the context from which they're like thinking about this work. It feels like

1057
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:37,600
in order to appreciate the art, contemporary, certain pieces of contemporary art,

1058
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:42,800
you have to know the story better behind the art. I think that's true for many people,

1059
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:47,120
but I think it's a funny shape distribution because there's a whole other set of people,

1060
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:52,880
sometimes just small children, and they get abstract art more easily. You show them Vermeer

1061
01:44:52,880 --> 01:45:00,640
or Rembrandt, they don't get it. But just like a wall of color, they're in love with it. So

1062
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:05,120
I don't think I know the full story. Again, some strange kind of distribution. The entry

1063
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:09,040
barriers are super high or super low, but not that often in between.

1064
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:16,160
But you would challenge saying that there's a lot to be explored in contemporary art is just

1065
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:24,000
you need to learn. Yeah, it's one of the most profound bodies of human thought out there,

1066
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,720
and it's part of the humanities. And yes, there are people who also don't like podcasts, right?

1067
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:37,040
And that's fine. Yeah. He's also been a scholar of food. We're just going through the entirety of

1068
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:44,560
the human experience today on this humanities podcast. Another absurd question, say this

1069
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:48,720
conversation is the last thing you ever do in your life. We're in the suit,

1070
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:52,560
would murder you at the end of the conversation. So this is your last day on earth,

1071
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,560
but I would offer you a last meal. What would that meal contain? We can also travel to other

1072
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:04,160
parts of the world. Well, we have to travel because my preferred last meal here, I probably had like

1073
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:10,160
two nights ago. Which is what? Can you describe or no? The best restaurant around here is called

1074
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:17,440
Mama Chang's and it's in Fairfax and it's food from Wuhan, actually. And they take pandemic

1075
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:23,760
safety seriously in addition to the food being very good. But this is what I would do. I would fly

1076
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:30,400
to Hermosillo in northern Mexico, which has some of the best food in Mexico, but I sadly only had

1077
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:38,000
two days there. So somewhere like Oaxaca Puebla, I think they have food just as good or some people

1078
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,920
would say better, but I've spent a lot of time in those places. Wait, is it possible the scarcity

1079
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:48,480
of time contributed to the richness of the experience? Of course, but the point is that scarcity

1080
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:55,520
still holds. So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo. Can we describe what the food is?

1081
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:59,680
It's the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally is just like the Mexican food you get

1082
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:05,760
in the US. So there are burritos, there's fajitas. It doesn't taste at all like our stuff. But again,

1083
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:11,040
nominally, it's the part of Mexican food that made it into the US was then transformed.

1084
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:16,480
Yes. But it's in a way the most familiar. But for that reason, it's the most radical because you

1085
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:22,080
have to rethink all these things you know, and they're way better in Hermosillo. Hardly any tourists

1086
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:28,000
go there. Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo. Nothing to do other than eat. It's not ruined by any

1087
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:34,640
outsiders. It's this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap. And the thing to do there is just sweet

1088
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:41,200
talk a taxi driver into first taking you seriously and then trusting you enough to know that you

1089
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:47,920
trust him to bring you to the very best like food stands. So where's the magic of that

1090
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:56,960
nominally similar entity of the burrito? Where's the magic come from? Is it the taxi ride? Is it

1091
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,440
the whole experience? Or is there something actually in the food? Well, you can break the food down

1092
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:07,360
part by part. So if you think of the beef, the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air

1093
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,400
in a way the FDA here would never permit. Like they dry age it till it turns green,

1094
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:17,440
but it is phenomenal. The quality of the chilies. So here, there's only a small

1095
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:22,640
number of kinds of chilies you can get in most parts of Mexico. There's quite a large number

1096
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:27,840
of chilies you can get. They're different. They're fresher, but it's just like a different thing,

1097
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:35,280
the chilies. The wheat used, so this is wheat territory, not corn territory, which is itself

1098
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:41,040
interesting. The wheat is more diverse and more complex. Here, it's more homogenized,

1099
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:48,320
obviously cheaper, more efficient, but there it is better. Non-pasteurized cheeses are legal

1100
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:53,760
in all parts of Mexico, and they can be white and gooey and amazing in a way that here again,

1101
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:57,600
it's just against the law. You could legalize them. The demand wouldn't be that great.

1102
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,440
There's a black market in these cheeses that Latino groceries around here,

1103
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:07,120
but you just can't get that much of it. So the cheese, the meat, the wheat, all different

1104
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:13,440
in significant ways. The chilies, I don't think the onions really matter much. Garlic,

1105
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:18,560
I don't know. I wouldn't put much stock in that, but that's a lot of the core food,

1106
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:24,160
and then it's cooked much better, and everything's super fresh. The food chain is not relying on

1107
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:29,920
refrigeration, and this is one thing Russia and US have in common. We were early pioneers

1108
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:34,800
in food refrigeration, and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early, and it took us a

1109
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:42,000
long time to dig out of that because big countries, right? You've had an extensive rail system in

1110
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,720
Russia at USSR a long time, which makes it easier to freeze and then ship. What about the actual

1111
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:56,400
cooking? The chef, is there an artistry to the simple? I hesitate to call the burrito simple,

1112
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:02,400
but- And there's no brain drain out of cooking. So if you're in the United States and you're

1113
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:06,000
very talented, I'm not saying there aren't talented chefs. Of course there are,

1114
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:11,680
but there's so many other things to pull people away. But in Mexico, there's so much talent going

1115
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:16,640
into food, as there is in China, which would be another candidate for last meal questions,

1116
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:24,160
or India. Oh, India. That's not even get started. Unbelievable. There's a

1117
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:27,360
million things we could talk about here, but you've written about Jiro, dreams of sushi.

1118
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:36,480
This is just a really clean, good example that people are aware of, of mastery in the art of

1119
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:44,000
the simple in food. What do you make of that obsessive pursuit of perfection in creating

1120
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,320
simple food? Sushi is about perfection, but it's a bit like the Beatles' white album,

1121
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:54,160
which people think is simple and not overproduced. It's in a funny way, their most overproduced album,

1122
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:59,680
but it's produced just perfectly. It sounds simple. It's really hard to produce music to the point

1123
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:04,240
where it's going to sound so simple and not sound like sludge, like let it be album.

1124
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:10,000
There's some great songs, but a lot of it sounds like sludge. One after 909, that's sludge. I dig

1125
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,640
up on each sludge. Like it's a bit interesting. It's not that good. It doesn't sound that good.

1126
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,840
White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence. Sounds perfect. Sounds simple.

1127
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:27,440
Cry, baby, cry. It's not simple. Back in the USSR. Super complex. Sushi is like that. It's because

1128
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:33,680
it's so incredibly not simple, starting with the rice. You try to refine it to make it appear super

1129
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:41,120
simple, and that's the most complex thing of all. Do you admire, I mean, we're not talking about

1130
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:47,840
days, weeks, months. We're talking about years, generations of doing the same thing over and

1131
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:53,280
over and over again. Do you admire that kind of sticking to the, does that, you know, we talked

1132
01:51:53,280 --> 01:52:00,400
about our admiration of the weird. That doesn't feel weird. That seems like discipline and dedication

1133
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:07,280
to like a stoic minimalism or something like that. I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad

1134
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:13,440
about it. I feel they're sacrificial victims to me, which I benefit from. But don't you ever think

1135
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:19,840
like, gee, you're a great master sushi chef. Wouldn't you be happier if you did something else?

1136
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:26,560
Doesn't seem to happen. That might be something that a weird mind would think. Maybe it is weird

1137
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:32,720
people, and maybe they're really enjoying it, but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years

1138
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:37,680
before they let you do anything else. It's like these Indian, you know, Sarod players,

1139
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:42,240
they just spent five years tapping out rhythms before they're allowed to touch their instruments.

1140
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,520
Well, actually, to defend that. It's kind of like graduate school, right?

1141
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:56,960
Well, I think graduate school, perhaps I graduate school is full of like every single day is full

1142
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:03,920
surprises, I would say. I did martial arts for a long time, I do martial arts. And I've always

1143
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:10,000
loved kind of the Russian way of drilling is doing the same technique. I don't know if this

1144
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,840
applies into intellectual or academic disciplines where you can do the same thing over and over

1145
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:22,560
and over again, thousands and thousands and thousands of times. What I've discovered through

1146
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:28,480
that process is you get to start to appreciate the tiniest of details and find the beauty in them.

1147
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:35,520
People who go to like monasteries to meditate, talk about this, is when you just sit in silence

1148
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:41,920
and don't do anything, you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty there is in just

1149
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:48,000
the movement of a finger. Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about how fun it is

1150
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:56,240
to move a finger. And then you can almost become your full weird self about the tiniest details of

1151
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:00,480
life. The thing you've got to wonder, like is there a free lunch in there? Are the rest of us

1152
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:06,960
moving around too much? Yeah, exactly. They sure feel like they found a free lunch that people

1153
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:12,800
meditate. They're onto something. I tend to think it's like artists that some percent of people

1154
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,680
are like that, but most are not. And for most of us, there's no free lunch. Like my free lunch is

1155
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:23,920
to move around a lot in search of lunch, in fact. Well, with all the food talk, it made me hungry.

1156
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:32,720
What books, three or so books, if any come to mind, technical fiction philosophical,

1157
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:39,520
would you recommend? Had a big impact on you? Or you just drew some insights from throughout your

1158
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:45,600
life? Well, two of them we've already discussed. One is Plato's Dialogues, which I started reading

1159
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:52,880
when I was like 13. Another is Inran Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal. But I would say the Friedrich

1160
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Hayek essay, The Use of Knowledge in Society, which is about how decentralized mechanisms can work,

1161
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:05,040
also why they might go wrong. And that's where you start to understand the price system capitalism.

1162
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:09,520
And that was in a book called Individualism and Economic Order. But it was just a few essays in

1163
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:14,480
that book. Those are maybe the three I would cite. Can you elaborate a little bit on the...

1164
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:19,200
Say the price of copper goes up, right? Because there's a problem with the copper mine in Chile

1165
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:24,080
or Bolivia. So the price of copper goes up all around the world. People are led to economize

1166
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:29,280
copper, to look for substitutes for copper, to change their production processes, to change

1167
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:35,760
the goods and services they buy, to build homes a different way. And this one event creates this

1168
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:42,480
one tiny change in information. It gets into your AI work very directly. And how much complexity

1169
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:48,640
that one change engenders in a meaningful, coherent way, how the different pieces of

1170
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:56,240
the price system fit together. Hayek really laid out very clearly. And it's like an AI problem.

1171
01:55:56,240 --> 01:56:00,240
And how well, not for everything, but for many things, we solved that AI problem.

1172
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,000
I learned, I was, I think, 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.

1173
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,640
The distributed nature of things there.

1174
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:10,400
And it's like your work on human attention, like how much can we take in?

1175
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:10,800
Yes.

1176
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:16,880
Very often, not that much. And how many of the advances of modern civilization you need to

1177
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:21,200
understand as a response to that constraint? I got that also from Hayek.

1178
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,480
What's the title of the book again?

1179
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,600
It's reprinted in a lot of books at this point. But back then, the book was called

1180
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:34,400
Individualism and Economic Order. But the essay is online, Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society.

1181
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:38,400
There are open access versions of it through Google. And you don't need the whole book.

1182
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,000
So it's a very good book.

1183
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:47,200
Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean, maybe sitting on a porch,

1184
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:55,520
maybe with a drink of some kind. And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice. What advice

1185
01:56:55,520 --> 01:57:02,800
would you give? A drink. That's my advice. I'm serious. So, okay, after that,

1186
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:10,800
what advice would you give to a young person today as they take on life?

1187
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:18,240
Whether a career in academia in general or just a life, which is probably more important than career?

1188
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:23,920
Most good advice is context specific. But here are my two generic pieces of advice.

1189
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:30,000
First, get a mentor. Both career, but anything you want to learn. Say you want to learn about

1190
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:36,000
contemporary art. People write me this. What book should I read? It's probably not going to work

1191
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,080
that way. You need a mentor. Yes, you should read some books on it. But you want a mentor to help

1192
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:45,120
you frame them, take you around to some art, talk about it with you. So get as many mentors as you

1193
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:53,120
can in the things you want to learn. And then- Caske, a quick tangent on that. Presumably a

1194
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:59,120
good mentor. Of course. Is there- I'm begging the question in there. It's complicated, right?

1195
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:02,480
Well, it is complicated. Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?

1196
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:06,320
I don't think that much because it's very easy to drop mentors. And in fact,

1197
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:10,960
it's quite hard to maintain them. Good mentors tend to be busy. Bad mentors tend to be busy.

1198
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,160
And you can try on mentors and maybe they're not good for you, but you still-

1199
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:21,280
There's a good chance you'll learn something. Like I had a mentor. I was an undergrad. He was a

1200
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:26,560
Stalinist. He edited the book called The Essential Stalin. Brilliant guy. I learned a tremendous

1201
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:32,800
amount from him. Was he like as a Stalinist, a good mentor for me? Fanofiak? Well, no. But for a

1202
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:40,800
year, it was tremendous. Yeah. He introduced me like to, you know, Soviet and Eastern European

1203
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,280
science fiction because he was a Marxist. Like that's what I took from him, among other things.

1204
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:52,560
Any advice on finding a good mentor? Daniel Kahneman has- somebody just popped us to mind

1205
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,120
as somebody who was able to find exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life. There's

1206
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:05,840
not many bright minds that find collaborators. They often, which I ultimately see what a mentor is.

1207
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:12,160
Yeah. Be interesting, be direct and try. It's not like a perfect formula, but it's amazing

1208
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:16,800
how many people don't even do those things. Be interesting, be direct and try.

1209
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:22,160
Like what you want from a better known person, I would just say be very direct with them.

1210
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:30,000
Yeah. Beautiful. What's the second piece of advice? Build small groups of peers. They don't have to be

1211
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:34,400
your age, but very often they'll be your age, especially if you're younger, with broadly

1212
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:39,040
similar interests, but there can be different points of view. People you hang out with, which

1213
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:44,480
can include in a WhatsApp group online. And like every day or almost every day, they're talking

1214
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:49,520
about the thing you care about, trying to solve problems in that thing. And that's your small

1215
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,760
group and you really like them and they like you and you care what you think about each other,

1216
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:58,240
and you have this common interest. That's for human connection or that's for development of

1217
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:03,520
ideas? It's both. They're not that different. Like Beatles, classic small group, right?

1218
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:09,440
But there's so much drama. The Florentine artists, of course there's drama and small groups tend to

1219
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:15,120
split up, which is fine, just like entering relationships often end. But it's remarkable

1220
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,800
how little has been done that was not done in small groups in some way.

1221
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:27,600
So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships, what do you make this whole love thing?

1222
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:35,600
Why do humans fall in love? What's the role of love, friendship, family, and life

1223
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:42,000
in a successful life or just life in general? Why the hell are we so into this thing?

1224
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:46,720
There are multiple layers of understanding that question. So the lowest layer is the

1225
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:52,560
Darwinian answer. If we weren't this way, we wouldn't have been successful in reproducing and

1226
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:59,120
building alliances. It's important to realize that's far from complete. The highest understanding

1227
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:05,520
would be poetic, like read John Keats or many other love poets. So who do I go to to find out,

1228
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:09,440
to learn about love in terms of poets? I would say start with John Keats,

1229
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,680
but given that you're fluent in Russian. Yeah, let's go Russian literature for a

1230
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:25,040
second. You keep mentioning Russia. What's your connection? What's your love in Russia?

1231
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:29,280
Well, first, it's all interesting, but more concretely, my wife was born in Moscow.

1232
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:35,200
Sokolniki was her favorite. Oh, wow. Yeah. Wow. And she grew up there. I married her here.

1233
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:41,840
My daughter, I adopted her. I'm not her biological father, but I genuinely raised her. She was born

1234
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:47,440
in Russia, though she came here when she was one. Wow. So you're basically Russian? No,

1235
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:52,960
no, no. I'm a New Jersey boy. That's the same thing. I'm very sorry to report. My father-in-law

1236
02:01:52,960 --> 02:02:00,400
passed away a week ago. He lived with us for six years. He lived in Russia till he was 70,

1237
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:08,080
saw Stalin, his father was brought to a camp, lived through World War II, much,

1238
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:15,680
much more, had an incredible life, never really learned how to speak English. So I absorbed

1239
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:21,840
something Russian from him as well. He was part Armenian. So that's my connection to Russia.

1240
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:26,640
A bit of the Russian soul, too. I don't think I have it. I think I appreciate it,

1241
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:33,280
but there's division of labor, right? Others in the family. Take care of that. I'm more superficial.

1242
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:38,960
You mentioned Keats and that higher version, that non-Darwinian love. What's that about?

1243
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:45,920
That it's the highest form of human connection, and it's intoxicating, and it's part of building a

1244
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:52,480
life, and most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it. And it's part of the highest realization

1245
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:58,880
of you being what you can be. Yeah. He mentioned you lost. But ask a Russian. I mean, this is

1246
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:05,200
superficial New Jersey boy who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen, and that was his romanticism.

1247
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:13,280
What's your favorite Bruce Springsteen song? I think the album Born to Run has actually held up

1248
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,240
the best. That was very fashionable to think the earlier or later works are actually better,

1249
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:23,360
and that's the overproduced Super Pop album. But the quality of the songs to me Born to Run is

1250
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:28,720
far and away the best than Darkness on the Edge of Town, and those are still my favorites.

1251
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:36,720
Born to Run is an incredible song, and perfectly produced in a Phil Specter kind of way. Every

1252
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:42,960
detail is right. Every lyric. What else is on an album? Thunder Row, Jungle Land, 10th Avenue,

1253
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:49,600
Freeze Out, She's the Wine, Unbelievable, Meeting Across the River. I really like,

1254
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:59,120
I like when he goes into love personally, like I'm on fire. That's a very good song, Dancing in

1255
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:05,120
the Dark. A lot of the later work, I find the percussion becomes too simple and kind of too white

1256
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:12,000
somehow, and a little clunky. And it's still good work. He's super talented, but it doesn't speak

1257
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:18,160
to me. But when it all bursts open into the open road like it does on Born to Run, that's magic.

1258
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:22,160
Yeah. Have you ever seen him live?

1259
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:29,280
Yes, twice. I wonder what he's like live when he was young, right? Those years.

1260
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:36,080
I saw him live when he was young. I was young. New Jersey. I was a little disappointed actually.

1261
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:42,800
I think what I like best from him is quite studio. He certainly played well. I don't fault

1262
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:48,800
his performance. But it's like when I saw Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin, tremendous creators,

1263
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:53,360
and they showed up. They were not drunk. They were paying attention. But I was underwhelmed

1264
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:58,480
because Led Zeppelin, like the Beatles White album, is much more of a studio band than you

1265
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:02,560
think at first. And in the case of Bruce Springsteen, I don't know about you, but for me,

1266
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:09,920
he's somebody that I connect with the most when I'm alone and there's like a melancholy feeling.

1267
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,320
And actually driving up my folks live in Philly. I went to school in Philly.

1268
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,000
You're almost worthy of New Jersey then?

1269
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:27,920
Yeah. Well, you're almost worthy of Russia. So we can connect and then ask. I mean,

1270
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:36,560
I loved your something. I feel like, I don't know. There's this beautiful,

1271
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:43,440
like there's an Olga's diner that closed down. I used to go there. There's a melancholy feeling

1272
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:49,440
to me. Of course. A thickness to culture in that part of the world, which is oddly similar to some

1273
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:54,240
elements of the thickness of Russian culture. And when you see Russian characters on the Sopranos,

1274
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:58,320
it totally makes sense, even though they're these complete outliers.

1275
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:05,760
Exactly. It totally makes sense. You mentioned you lost your father-in-law last week.

1276
02:06:07,600 --> 02:06:14,000
Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?

1277
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:18,800
I don't think about my own mortality that much, which is probably a good thing.

1278
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:25,360
I think death will be bad. I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it. For me, the worst thing about death

1279
02:06:25,360 --> 02:06:29,680
is not knowing how the human story turns out. The full human story.

1280
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:34,480
The full human story. So if I could, right before I die, read like a Wikipedia page

1281
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:39,040
called The Rest of Human History and have enough time, just like a few days to absorb it, think

1282
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:44,960
about it. And no, like, oh, well, 643 years from now, that's when all the atomic weapons went off.

1283
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,360
And here's what happened between now and then. I would feel much better dying.

1284
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:54,960
Because that's not how it's going to be, right? That's unlikely.

1285
02:06:54,960 --> 02:07:01,840
It's almost like the Hitchhiker's Guide. They have a one or two sentence description of the human

1286
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,960
of what goes on on Earth. It's interesting to think if there's a lot of intelligent civilizations

1287
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:12,560
out there that in the big Encyclopedia that describes the universe, humans will only have one

1288
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:17,440
sentence. Probably true. But it's the only one I can read and understand, right?

1289
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:22,720
And it may be hard to understand the human one past a number of centuries.

1290
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:30,320
Like how many years from now will reading Wikipedia be like trying to read Chaucer?

1291
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:35,680
Which I almost can do, but I actually can't. I need a translation. Probably you can't do

1292
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:40,960
it at all. Yeah. I mean, maybe reading will be outdated. It might be a very silly notion.

1293
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:46,000
Maybe we're fundamentally, like we think language is fundamental to cognition,

1294
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,680
but it could be something visual or something totally different that we'll plug in.

1295
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:55,760
Neural anchor, yeah. But in that story, that Wikipedia article,

1296
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,920
do you think there'll be a section on the meaning of it?

1297
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:06,480
I hope not. Because that section we could write now and it's just not going to be very good,

1298
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,520
what would you put in the section on the meaning of human existence?

1299
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:17,520
I don't know, links to a lot of other sections. I don't think there are general statements about

1300
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:22,640
the meaning of life that have that much meaning. I think if you study different cultures, the arts,

1301
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:27,120
travel, mathematics, like whatever your thing is, you'll get a lot about the meaning of life.

1302
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:31,760
So like it's there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense. But I don't want to read the page on

1303
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,920
the meaning. I bet they have such a page. In fact, the fact that I've never visited it,

1304
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:39,360
none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler, here's the page on the meaning of life. I know you've

1305
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:43,280
been wondering about this. You got to read this one. No one's ever done that to you, have they?

1306
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:47,920
It probably has. Well, I actually gone to that page. It does in fact have a lot of links to other

1307
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:56,400
pages. Okay. So that's it. The meaning of life is just a bunch of self-referential

1308
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:04,400
or citation needed type of statements. I think there's no better way to end it, Tyler. It's a

1309
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:10,400
huge honor. I'm a huge fan. Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me. It was one of

1310
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,560
the greatest conversations I've ever had. Thank you so much. My pleasure and delighted to finally

1311
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:20,160
have met you and that we can do this. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tyler Cohen

1312
02:09:20,160 --> 02:09:27,440
and thank you to Linode, ExpressVPN, SimplySafe, and Public Goods. Check them out in the description

1313
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:32,720
to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Adam Smith.

1314
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:39,200
Little Else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest

1315
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:44,880
barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice.

1316
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:57,840
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
