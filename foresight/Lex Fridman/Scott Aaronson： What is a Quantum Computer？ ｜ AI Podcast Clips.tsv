0	7160	As you've said, quantum computing, at least in the 1990s, was a profound story at the
7160	11080	intersection of computer science, physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.
11080	16240	So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing that represents more than just the
16240	17240	quantum computer.
17240	18240	Yes.
18240	20180	But can we start at the very basics?
20180	22320	What is quantum computing?
22320	23320	Yeah.
23320	29960	So it's a proposal for a new type of computation, let's say a new way to harness nature to
29960	34560	do computation that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.
34560	40840	Now, the principles of quantum mechanics have been in place since 1926.
40840	43160	They haven't changed.
43160	46160	What's new is how we want to use them.
46160	50720	So what does quantum mechanics say about the world?
50720	55720	The physicists, I think, over the generations convinced people that that is an unbelievably
55720	63080	complicated question and just give up on trying to understand it, not being a physicist,
63080	67700	I can let you in on a secret, which is that it becomes a lot simpler if you do what we
67700	72640	do in quantum information theory and take the physics out of it.
72640	79320	So the way that we think about quantum mechanics is as a generalization of the rules of probability
79320	80480	themselves.
80480	87760	So you might say there was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today or something.
87760	90840	You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance.
90840	92640	That would be nonsense.
92640	98920	Much less would you say that there was an I% chance, a square root of minus 1% chance.
98920	109200	Now the central discovery that quantum mechanics made is that fundamentally the world is described
109200	118960	by the possibilities for what a system could be doing are described using numbers called
118960	127040	amplitudes, which are like probabilities in some ways, but they are not probabilities.
127040	129640	For one thing, they can be positive or negative.
129640	131680	In fact, they can even be complex numbers.
131680	138080	And if you've heard of a quantum superposition, this just means that some state of affairs
138080	146000	where you assign an amplitude, one of these complex numbers, to every possible configuration
146000	148420	that you could see a system in on measuring it.
148420	154640	So for example, you might say that an electron has some amplitude for being here and some
154640	157360	other amplitude for being there.
157360	161560	Now if you look to see where it is, you will localize it.
161560	167320	You will sort of force the amplitudes to be converted into probabilities.
167320	172320	That happens by taking their squared absolute value.
172320	178400	And then you can say either the electron will be here or it will be there.
178400	183000	Knowing the amplitudes, you can predict at least the probabilities that you'll see each
183000	185100	possible outcome.
185100	191440	But while a system is isolated from the whole rest of the universe, the rest of its environment,
191440	198160	the amplitudes can change in time by rules that are different from the normal rules of
198160	202560	probability and that are alien to our everyday experience.
202560	208400	So anytime anyone ever tells you anything about the weirdness of the quantum world or
208400	214360	assuming that they're not lying to you, they are telling you yet another consequence of
214360	218100	nature being described by these amplitudes.
218100	223140	So most famously, what amplitudes can do is that they can interfere with each other.
223140	228660	So in the famous double slit experiment, what happens is that you shoot a particle like
228660	232740	an electron, let's say, at a screen with two slits in it.
232740	238500	And you find that on a second screen, now there are certain places where that electron
238500	244460	will never end up after it passes through the first screen.
244460	250780	And yet if I close off one of the slits, then the electron can appear in that place.
250780	255580	So by decreasing the number of paths that the electron could take to get somewhere, you
255580	258260	can increase the chance that it gets there.
258260	260220	Now how is that possible?
260220	266620	Well it's because, as we would say now, the electron has a superposition state.
266620	272620	It has some amplitude for reaching this point by going through the first slit.
272620	276540	It has some other amplitude for reaching it by going through the second slit.
276540	281780	But now if one amplitude is positive and the other one is negative, then I have to add
281780	282780	them all up.
282780	287500	I have to add the amplitudes for every path that the electron could have taken to reach
287500	288900	this point.
288900	293420	And those amplitudes, if they're pointing in different directions, they can cancel each
293420	294660	other out.
294660	298980	That would mean the total amplitude is zero and the thing never happens at all.
298980	303500	If I close off one of the possibilities, then the amplitude is positive or it's negative
303500	305460	and now the thing can happen.
305460	308980	So that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.
308980	311820	And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is.
311820	322420	A quantum computer is a computer that tries to exploit exactly these phenomena, superposition,
322420	327380	amplitudes, and interference in order to solve certain problems much faster than we know
327380	328820	how to solve them otherwise.
328820	333780	So it's the basic building block of a quantum computer is what we call a quantum bit or
333780	334980	a qubit.
334980	339620	That just means a bit that has some amplitude for being zero and some other amplitude for
339620	340620	being one.
340620	344220	So it's a superposition of zero and one states.
344220	350220	But now the key point is that if I've got, let's say, a thousand qubits, the rules of
350220	355380	quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal that I do not just need one amplitude.
355380	358660	I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.
358660	364260	In general, I need an amplitude for every possible setting of all thousand of those
364260	370620	bits so that what that means is two to the 1,000 power amplitudes.
370620	375380	If I had to write those down, or let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,
375380	380500	if I had to write down two to the 1,000 complex numbers, that would not fit within the entire
380500	382860	observable universe.
382860	387900	And yet, quantum mechanics is unequivocal that if these qubits can all interact with
387900	394580	each other, and in some sense, I need two to the 1,000 parameters, amplitudes to describe
394580	396300	what is going on.
396300	402740	Now, I can tell you where all the popular articles about quantum computing go off the
402740	409100	rails is that they say what I just said, and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer
409100	414220	works is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.
414220	419820	That sounds too good to be true, and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.
419820	426420	The problem is I could make a superposition over every possible answer to my problem,
426420	430780	even if there are two to the 1,000 of them, I can easily do that.
430780	434540	The trouble is for a computer to be useful, you've got at some point, you've got to look
434540	437420	at it and see an output.
437420	442580	And if I just measure a superposition over every possible answer, then the rules of quantum
442580	446540	mechanics tell me that all I'll see will be a random answer.
446540	449940	If I just wanted a random answer, well, I could have picked one myself with a lot less
449940	450940	trouble.
450940	457740	So the entire trick with quantum computing, with every algorithm for a quantum computer,
457740	463780	is that you try to choreograph a pattern of interference of amplitudes, and you try to
463780	468740	do it so that for each wrong answer, some of the paths leading to that wrong answer
468740	472860	have positive amplitudes, and others have negative amplitudes.
472860	477380	So on the whole, they cancel each other out, whereas all the paths leading to the right
477380	482980	answer should reinforce each other, should have amplitudes pointing the same direction.
482980	488100	So the design of algorithms in this space is the choreography of the interferences.
488100	489100	Precisely.
489100	490100	That's precisely what it is.
490100	495220	Take a brief step back, and you mentioned information.
495220	501220	So in which part of this beautiful picture that you've painted is information contained?
501220	505580	Oh, well, information is at the core of everything that we've been talking about.
505580	514300	I mean, the bit is the basic unit of information, since Claude Shannon's paper in 1948, and
514300	520060	of course, people had the concept even before that, he popularized the name.
520060	523820	But a bit is zero or one, so that's the basic element of information.
523820	524820	That's right.
524820	529780	And what we would say is that the basic unit of quantum information is the qubit, is the
529780	537100	object, any object that can be maintained and manipulated in a superposition of zero
537100	538860	and one states.
538860	543980	Now sometimes people ask, well, but what is a qubit physically?
543980	549700	And there are all these different proposals that are being pursued in parallel for how
549700	551780	you implement qubits.
551780	557580	There is superconducting quantum computing that was in the news recently because of Google's
557580	565700	quantum supremacy experiment, where you would have some little coils where a current can
565700	569260	flow through them in two different energy states.
569260	572460	One representing a zero, another representing a one.
572460	577700	And if you cool these coils to just slightly above absolute zero, like a hundredth of a
577700	582980	degree, then they superconduct and then the current can actually be in a superposition
582980	585460	of the two different states.
585460	587340	So that's one kind of qubit.
587340	593780	Another kind would be just an individual atomic nucleus, it has a spin.
593780	598460	It could be spinning clockwise, it could be spinning counterclockwise, or it could be in
598460	600940	a superposition of the two spin states.
600940	602380	That is another qubit.
602380	607900	Because just like in the classical world, you could be a virtuoso programmer without
607900	614100	having any idea of what a transistor is, or how the bits are physically represented inside
614100	618060	the machine, even that the machine uses electricity.
618060	619860	You just care about the logic.
619860	622420	It's sort of the same with quantum computing.
622420	627260	Cubits could be realized by many, many different quantum systems, yet all of those systems
627260	634900	will lead to the same logic, the logic of qubits and how you measure them, how you change
634900	636340	them over time.
636340	643060	And so the subject of how qubits behave and what you can do with qubits, that is quantum
643060	644060	information.
644060	652060	So just to linger on that, so the physical design implementation of a qubit does not
652060	657220	interfere with that next level of abstraction that you can program over it.
657220	661860	So it truly is, the idea of it is, is it okay?
661860	665700	Well, to be honest with you, today they do interfere with each other.
665700	670460	That's because all the quantum computers we can build today are very noisy.
670460	677820	And so the qubits are very far from perfect, and so the lower level sort of does affect
677820	681660	the higher levels, and we sort of have to think about all of them at once.
681660	687380	But eventually, where we hope to get is to what are called error-corrected quantum computers,
687380	692980	where the qubits really do behave like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them
692980	693980	to.
693980	700500	And in that future, a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about or think about
700500	706860	today, but in that future, the logic of it really does become decoupled from the hardware.
706860	713540	So if noise is currently like the biggest problem for quantum computing, and then the
713540	721380	dream is error-correcting quantum computers, can you just maybe describe what does it mean
721380	723620	for there to be noise in the system?
723620	724620	Absolutely.
724620	727980	So yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific than noise.
727980	734380	So the fundamental problem, if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer of any
734380	738740	appreciable size, is something called decoherence.
738740	743100	And this was recognized from the very beginning when people first started thinking about this
743100	744820	in the 1990s.
744820	752420	Now what decoherence means is sort of the unwanted interaction between your qubits, the state
752420	756180	of your quantum computer, and the external environment.
756180	758060	And why is that such a problem?
758060	763460	I talked before about how when you measure a quantum system, so let's say if I measure
763460	768540	a qubit that's in a superposition of zero and one states to ask it, are you zero or
768540	769540	are you one?
769540	771980	Well, now I force it to make up its mind.
771980	775820	And now probabilistically, it chooses one or the other.
775820	781300	And now it's no longer a superposition, there's no longer amplitudes, there's just some probability
781300	785140	that I get a zero and there's some that I get a one.
785140	790620	And now the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me who's looking.
791020	795300	In fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.
795300	801620	Any kind of interaction with the external world that leaks out the information about
801620	807860	whether this qubit was a zero or a one, sort of that causes the zero-ness or the oneness
807860	815420	of the qubit to be recorded in the radiation in the room, in the molecules of the air,
815420	822180	in the wires that are connected to my device, any of that, as soon as the information leaks
822180	825940	out, it is as if that qubit has been measured.
825940	830340	It is the state has now collapsed.
830340	834340	Another way to say it is that it's become entangled with its environment.
834340	839140	But from the perspective of someone who's just looking at this qubit, it is as though
839140	841740	it has lost its quantum state.
842380	848220	What this means is that if I want to do a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits
848220	853380	sort of fanatically well-isolated from their environment, but then at the same time, they
853380	857220	can't be perfectly isolated because I need to tell them what to do.
857220	862020	I need to make them interact with each other for one thing and not only that, but in a
862020	865580	precisely choreographed way.
865580	868260	That is such a staggering problem.
868300	872580	How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe, but then also tell them exactly
872580	873580	what to do?
873580	879300	I mean, there were distinguished physicists and computer scientists in the 90s who said
879300	881860	this is fundamentally impossible.
881860	887100	The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits to the degree of accuracy that
887100	889220	you're talking about.
889220	897180	What changed the views of most of us was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s,
897220	902540	which was called the theory of quantum error correction and quantum fault tolerance.
902540	908860	The upshot of that theory is that if I want to build a reliable quantum computer and scale
908860	915940	it up to an arbitrary number of as many qubits as I want and doing as much on them as I want,
915940	920860	I do not actually have to get the qubits perfectly isolated from their environment.
920860	926740	It is enough to get them really, really, really well-isolated.
926780	933340	Even if every qubit is leaking its state into the environment at some rate, as long as that
933340	941740	rate is low enough, I can encode the information that I care about in very clever ways across
941740	948180	the collective states of multiple qubits in such a way that even if a small percentage
948180	953140	of my qubits leak, well, I'm constantly monitoring them to see if that leak happened.
953140	955660	I can detect it and I can correct it.
955700	959460	I can recover the information I care about from the remaining qubits.
961540	966900	You can build a reliable quantum computer even out of unreliable parts.
969300	975660	In some sense, that discovery is what set the engineering agenda for quantum computing research
975660	977940	from the 1990s until the present.
977940	985260	The goal has been engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable but reliable enough
985340	991140	that you can then use these error-correcting codes to have them simulate qubits that are
991140	992980	even more reliable than they are.
993740	997020	The error-correction becomes a net win rather than a net loss.
997620	1004420	And then once you reach that crossover point, then your simulated qubits could in turn simulate
1004420	1010460	qubits that are even more reliable and so on until you've just effectively, you have arbitrarily
1010460	1011500	reliable qubits.
1011780	1015220	So long story short, we are not at that break-even point yet.
1015380	1019900	We're a hell of a lot closer than we were when people started doing this in the 90s, like orders
1019900	1020980	of magnitude closer.
1020980	1024260	But the key ingredient there is the more qubits, the better.
1025660	1029460	Well, the more qubits, the larger the computation you can do, right?
1029820	1035020	I mean, qubits are what constitute the memory of your quantum computer, right?
1035020	1037820	But also for the error-correcting mechanism.
1038020	1038500	Yes.
1038700	1044700	So the way I would say it is that error-correction imposes an overhead in the number of qubits.
1044980	1049460	And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems with building a scalable quantum
1049460	1049980	computer.
1050260	1055500	If you look at the error-correcting codes, at least the ones that we know about today, and you
1055500	1063820	look at what would it take to actually use a quantum computer to hack your credit card number,
1063900	1067780	which is the most famous application people talk about, right?
1067940	1072340	Let's say to factor huge numbers and thereby break the RSA crypto system.
1072620	1078460	Well, what that would take would be thousands of several thousand logical qubits.
1078780	1083460	But now with the known error-correcting codes, each of those logical qubits would need to
1083460	1086700	be encoded itself using thousands of physical qubits.
1087020	1090340	So at that point, you're talking about millions of physical qubits.
1090540	1095020	And in some sense, that is the reason why quantum computers are not breaking cryptography
1095020	1095540	already.
1095540	1098260	It's because of these immense overheads involved.
1098500	1101140	So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?
1101140	1102180	Well, it's multiplicative.
1102180	1108100	I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits that you need in your abstract
1108100	1111140	quantum circuit, you multiply it by a thousand or so.
1111460	1116820	So there's a lot of work on inventing better, trying to invent better error-correcting codes.
1117100	1118900	OK, that is the situation right now.
1118900	1125900	In the meantime, we are now in what the physicist John Preskell called the noisy intermediate
1125900	1127980	scale quantum or NISC era.
1128260	1129140	And this is the era.
1129300	1133660	You can think of it as sort of like the vacuum, you know, we're now entering the very early
1133660	1136100	vacuum tube era of quantum computers.
1136460	1140740	The quantum computer analog of the transistor has not been invented yet.
1140940	1141180	Right.
1141180	1143780	That would be like true error correction, right?
1143780	1147780	Where, you know, we are not or something else that would achieve the same effect.
1147780	1149300	Right. We are not there yet.
1150060	1156180	And but where we are now, let's say, as of a few months ago, you know, as of Google's
1156180	1161020	announcement of quantum supremacy, you know, we are now finally at the point where even
1161020	1166500	with a non-error corrected quantum computer with, you know, these noisy devices, we can
1166500	1170460	do something that is hard for classical computers to simulate.
1170620	1173060	OK, so we can eke out some advantage.
1173300	1178500	Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something beyond what a classical computer
1178500	1182260	can do that is also useful to someone that we still don't know?
1182380	1186700	People are going to be racing over the next decade to try to do that by people.
1186700	1191500	I mean, Google, IBM, you know, a bunch of startup companies and, you know,
1191500	1195780	a and research labs and research labs and governments.
1195780	1198700	And yeah, you just mentioned a million things.
1198700	1200300	Well, I'll backtrack for a second.
1200300	1201820	Yes, sure. Sure.
1201820	1204260	So we're in these vacuum tube days.
1204260	1205700	Yeah, just entering.
1205700	1207860	And just entering. Wow. OK.
1207860	1211060	So yeah, how do we escape the vacuum?
1211060	1216660	So how do we get to how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?
1216900	1219340	Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?
1219340	1225460	Is there is there breakthroughs in on the physics side that they're needed on the
1225740	1227780	computer science side?
1227780	1228940	What is there?
1228940	1235420	And is it a financial issue where much larger, just sheer investment and excitement is needed?
1235780	1238260	So, you know, those are excellent questions.
1238380	1243620	My guess. My guess would be all of the above.
1243980	1248100	I mean, my guess, you know, I mean, you know, you can say fundamentally,
1248100	1249820	it is an engineering issue, right?
1249820	1252420	The theory has been in place since the 90s.
1252700	1257060	You know, at least, you know, you know, this is what, you know, error correction
1257060	1261180	would look like, you know, we do not have the hardware that is at that level.
1261420	1266780	But at the same time, you know, so you could just, you know, try to power through,
1266940	1271220	you know, maybe even like, you know, if someone spent a trillion dollars
1271220	1274140	on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right?
1274140	1280140	Then conceivably, they could just, you know, build a an error corrected
1280140	1284100	quantum computer as it was envisioned back in the 90s, right?
1284260	1288780	I think the more plausible thing to happen is that there will be further
1288780	1291820	theoretical breakthroughs and there will be further insights
1292020	1294420	that will cut down the cost of doing this.
