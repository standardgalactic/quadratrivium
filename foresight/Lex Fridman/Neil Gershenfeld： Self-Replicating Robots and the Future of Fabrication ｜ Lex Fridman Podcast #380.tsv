0	2440	The ribosome, who I mentioned a little while back,
2440	5360	can make an elephant one molecule at a time.
5360	7200	Ribosomes are slow.
7200	9240	They run at about one molecule a second.
9240	11480	But ribosomes make ribosomes.
11480	14520	So you have trillions of them, and that makes an elephant.
14520	16640	In the same way, these little assembly robots,
16640	20280	I'm describing, can make giant structures at heart
20280	23240	because the robot can make the robot.
23240	26760	So more recently, two of my students, Amira and Miana,
26760	29200	had a nature communication paper showing
29240	33760	how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making
33760	35520	so the robots can make the robot,
35520	38160	so you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.
40360	43520	The following is a conversation with Neil Gershenfeld,
43520	46720	the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms,
46720	49880	an amazing laboratory that is breaking down boundaries
49880	52560	between the digital and physical worlds,
52560	56880	fabricating objects and machines at all scales of reality,
56920	59920	including robots and automata
59920	62240	that can build copies of themselves
62240	66600	and self-assemble into complex structures.
66600	69400	His work inspires millions across the world
69400	73240	as part of the maker movement to build cool stuff,
73240	78240	to create the very act that makes life so beautiful and fun.
79920	81880	This is a Lex Friedman podcast.
81880	83840	To support it, please check out our sponsors
83840	85000	in the description.
85000	88520	And now, dear friends, here's Neil Gershenfeld.
89520	91880	You have spent your life working at the boundary
91880	96200	between bits and atoms, so the digital and the physical.
96200	98960	What have you learned about engineering
98960	103240	and about nature of reality from working at this divide,
103240	105040	trying to bridge this divide?
105040	108760	I learned why Van Neumann and Turing
108760	111260	made fundamental mistakes.
112260	115780	I learned the secret of life.
115780	117180	Yeah.
117180	121100	I learned how to solve many of the world's most important
121100	123300	problems, which all sound presumptuous,
123300	125460	but all of those are things I learned at that boundary.
125460	127700	Okay, so Turing and Van Neumann, let's start there.
127700	129820	Some of the most impactful, important humans
129820	132620	who have ever lived in computing, why were they wrong?
132620	136220	So, I worked with Andy Gleason,
136220	137740	who is Turing's counterpart.
137740	140140	So, just for background, if anybody doesn't know,
140140	142140	Turing is credited with the modern architecture
142140	145900	of computing, among many other things.
145900	148380	Andy Gleason was his US counterpart.
148380	151660	And you might not have heard of Andy Gleason,
151660	153940	but you might have heard of the Hilbert problems.
153940	156380	And Andy Gleason solved the fifth one.
156380	159460	So, he was a really notable mathematician.
159460	161340	During the war, he was Turing's counterpart.
161340	163980	Then Van Neumann is credited with the modern architecture
163980	167780	of computing, and one of his students was Marvin Minsky.
167860	170140	So, I could ask Marvin what Johnny was thinking,
170140	172940	and I could ask Andy what Alan was thinking.
172940	175300	And what came out from that,
175300	178060	what I came to appreciate as background,
178060	180540	I never understood the difference between computer science
180540	181900	and physical science.
181900	185900	But Turing's machine, that's the foundation
185900	190180	of modern computing, has a simple physics mistake,
190180	193020	which is the head is distinct from the tape.
193020	194860	So, in the Turing machine, there's a head
194860	197540	that programmatically moves and reads and writes a tape.
197540	199180	The head is distinct from the tape,
199180	202060	which means persistence of information
202060	205140	is separate from interaction with information.
206220	210140	Then Van Neumann wrote deeply and beautifully
210140	212700	about many things, but not computing.
212700	216780	He wrote a horrible memo called the first draft
216780	218660	of a report on the EDVAC,
218660	221980	which is how you program a very early computer.
221980	226060	In it, he essentially roughly took Turing's architecture
226060	227620	and built it into a machine.
228700	233580	So, the legacy of that is the computer somebody's using
233580	235900	to watch this is spending much of its effort
235900	239620	moving information from storage transistors
239620	241380	to processing transistors,
241380	244060	even though they have the same computational complexity.
244060	248460	So, in computer science, when you learn about computing,
248460	250900	there's a ridiculous taxonomy
250900	255100	of about a hundred different models of computation.
255140	256860	But they're all fictions.
256860	260340	In physics, a patch of space occupies space.
260340	263420	It stores state, it takes time to transit,
263420	264780	and you can interact.
264780	268140	That is the only model of computation that's physical.
268140	270300	Everything else is a fiction.
270300	274820	So, I really came to appreciate that a few years back
274820	276460	when I did a keynote for the annual meeting
276460	278500	of the supercomputer industry,
278500	280500	and then went into the halls and spent time
280500	282300	with the supercomputer builders,
282300	285580	and came to appreciate,
285580	288020	oh, let's see, if you're familiar with the movie,
288020	292140	The Metropolis, people would frolic upstairs in the gardens,
292140	294540	and down in the basement, people would move levers.
294540	298140	And that's how computing exists today,
298140	300740	that we pretend software is not physical.
300740	302620	It's separate from hardware.
302620	305020	And the whole canon of computer science
305020	306700	is based on this fiction
306700	309580	that bits aren't constrained by atoms,
309580	312700	but all sorts of scaling issues in computing
312700	313740	come from that boundary,
313740	316780	but all sorts of opportunities come from that boundary.
316780	318740	And so, you can trace it all the way back
318740	322060	to Turing's machine making this mistake
322060	323220	between the head and the tape.
323220	328220	Van Neumann, he never called it Van Neumann's architecture.
328220	330180	He wrote about it in this dreadful memo,
330180	331260	and then he wrote beautifully about
331260	332900	other things we'll talk about.
332900	336500	Now, to end a long answer, Turing and Van Neumann
336500	338140	both knew this.
338180	341900	So all of the canon of computer scientists credits them
341900	345300	for what was never meant to be a computer architecture.
345300	348300	Both Turing and Van Neumann ended their life
348300	352300	studying exactly how software becomes hardware.
352300	355300	So Van Neumann studied self-reproducing automata,
355300	358420	how a machine communicates its own construction.
358420	360580	A Turing studied morphogenesis,
360580	362340	how genes give rise to form.
362340	366140	They ended their life studying the embodiment of computation,
366140	369140	something that's been forgotten by the canon of computing,
369140	370900	but developed sort of off to the sides
370900	372940	by a really interesting lineage.
372940	376260	So there's no distinction between the head and the tape,
376260	377940	between the computer and the computation.
377940	379500	It is all computation.
379500	382860	Right, so I never understood the difference
382860	385540	between computer science and physical science.
385540	389060	And working at that boundary helped lead to things
389060	391100	like my lab was part of doing
391100	392780	with a number of interesting collaborators,
392780	396580	the First Fest or the classical quantum computations.
396580	399340	We were part of a collaboration creating
399340	400900	the minimal synthetic organism
400900	402740	where you design life in a computer.
402740	405500	Those both involve domains
405500	408420	where you just can't separate hardware from software.
408420	411180	The embodiment of computation is embodied
411180	412900	in these really profound ways.
414220	416860	So the first quantum computations,
416860	420540	synthetic life, so in the space of biology,
420540	422740	the space of physics at the lowest level
422740	425740	and space of biology at the lowest level.
425740	429260	So let's talk about CBA, Center of Bits and Atoms.
429260	432940	What's the origin story of this MIT, legendary MIT center
432940	436300	that you're a part of creating?
436300	439780	In high school, I really wanted to go to vocational school
439780	444100	where you learn to weld and fix cars and build houses.
444100	447180	And I was told, no, you're smart, you have to sit in a room.
447180	448380	And nobody could explain to me
448380	451380	why I couldn't go to vocational school.
452380	455140	I then worked at Bell Labs,
455140	459460	this wonderful place before deregulation, legendary place.
459460	461820	And I would get union grievances
461820	463980	because I would go into the workshop
463980	465380	and try to make something and they would say,
465380	468700	no, you're smart, you have to tell somebody what to do.
468700	472220	And it wasn't until MIT, and I'll explain how CBA started,
472220	475580	but I could create CBA that I came to understand
475580	478100	this is a mistake that dates back to the Renaissance.
478100	481900	So in the Renaissance, the liberal arts emerged
481900	484420	and liberal doesn't mean politically liberal.
484420	487580	This was the path to liberation, birth of humanism.
487580	490380	And so the liberal arts were the trivium, quadrivium,
490380	492900	roughly language, natural science.
492900	497900	And at that moment, what emerged was this dreadful concept
499020	500580	of the illiberal arts.
500580	502580	So anything that wasn't the liberal arts
502580	505540	was for commercial gain and was just making stuff
505580	508500	and wasn't valid for serious study.
508500	511780	And so that's why we're left with learning to well
511780	514140	wasn't a subject for serious study,
515100	517420	but the means of expression have changed
517420	518340	since the Renaissance.
518340	521900	So micromachining or embedded coding
521900	524420	is every bit as expressive as painting a painting
524420	525460	or writing a sonnet.
525460	529420	So never understanding this difference
529420	532020	between computer science and physical science,
533020	538020	the path that led me to create CBA with colleagues
538140	541900	was, I was what's called the junior fellow at Harvard.
541900	544220	I was visiting MIT through Marvin
544220	545740	because I was interested in the physics
545740	547020	of musical instruments.
548540	550900	This will be another slight digression.
550900	553820	And Cornell, I would study physics
553820	555660	and then I would cross the street
555660	557540	and go to the music department where I played the bassoon
557540	559460	and I would trim reads and play the reads
559460	561860	and they'd be beautiful, but then they'd get soggy.
561860	563340	And then I discovered in the basement
563340	566140	of the music department at Cornell was David Borden,
567140	568260	who you might not have heard of,
568260	570180	but is legendary in electronic music
570180	572380	because he was really the first electronic musician.
572380	576180	So Bob Mogue, who invented Mogue synthesizers
576180	579420	was a physics student at Cornell like me crossing the street
579420	581140	and eventually he was kicked out
581140	582860	and invented electronic music.
582860	585540	David Borden was the first musician
585540	587060	who created electronic music.
587060	589020	So he's legendary for people like Phil Glass
589020	590460	and Steve Reich.
590580	592940	And so that got me thinking about,
592940	595620	I would behave as a scientist in the music department,
595620	597900	but not in the physics department,
597900	599260	but not in the music department,
599260	600100	got me thinking about
600100	603820	what's the computational capacity of a musical instrument.
603820	607140	And through Marvin, he introduced me to Todd Backover
607140	608860	at the Media Lab,
608860	611660	who was just about to start a project with Yo-Yo Ma
611660	615180	that led to a collaboration to instrument a cello,
615180	617300	to extract Yo-Yo's data
617300	620300	and bring it out into computational environments
620300	623420	what is the computational capacity of a musical instrument?
623420	624740	As we continue on this tangent
624740	626180	and we'll share a return to CBA.
626180	631180	Yeah, so one part of that is to understand the computing
633020	636100	and if you look at like the finest timescale
636100	638540	and length scale you need to model the physics,
638540	639980	it's not heroic.
639980	642900	A good GPU can do teraflops today.
642900	645020	That used to be a national class supercomputer,
645020	646300	now it's just a GPU.
646300	648940	And that's about if you take the timescales
648940	650700	and length scales relevant for the physics,
650700	653380	that's about the scale of the physics computing.
653380	655780	For Yo-Yo, what was really driving it
655780	659500	was he's completely unsentimental about the Strad.
659500	662180	It's not that it makes some magical wiggles
662180	663380	in the sound wave,
663380	665940	it's performance as a controller,
665940	669860	how he can manipulate it as an interface device.
669860	671500	Interface between one and what exactly?
671500	672820	Him and sound.
672820	673660	Okay, him and sound.
673660	675700	And so what it led to was,
675700	678020	I had started by thinking about ops per second,
678020	683020	but Yo-Yo's question was really resolution and bandwidth.
683140	687220	It's how fast can you measure what he does
687220	692220	and the bandwidth and the resolution
692900	696220	of detecting his controls
696220	698420	and then mapping them into sounds.
698420	701740	And what we found, what he found was
701740	704140	if you instrument everything he does
704140	706940	and connect it to almost anything,
706980	708620	it sounds like Yo-Yo,
708620	711220	that the magic is in the control,
711220	715780	not in ineffable details in how the wood wiggles.
715780	719060	And so with Yo-Yo and Todd, that led to a piece in,
719060	720140	towards the end I asked Yo-Yo,
720140	722860	what it would take for him to get rid of his Strad
722860	723820	and use our stuff?
723820	725460	And his answer was just logistics.
725460	729140	It was at that time, our stuff was like a rack of electronics
729140	732620	and lots of cables and some grad students to make it work.
732620	736140	Once the technology becomes as invisible as the Strad,
736380	739100	then sure, absolutely he would take it.
739100	742060	And by the way, as a footnote on the footnote,
742060	745140	an accident in the sensing of Yo-Yo's cello
745140	747820	led to $100 million a year auto safety business
747820	749860	to control airbags and cars.
749860	751260	How did that work?
751260	754020	I had to instrument the bow without interfering with it.
754020	758100	So I set up local electromagnetic fields
758100	762780	where I would detect how those fields interact
762780	765380	with the bow he's playing.
765380	767540	But we had a problem that his hand,
767540	769660	whenever his hand got near the sensing fields,
769660	771060	I would start sensing his hand
771060	773580	rather than the materials on the bow.
773580	777500	And I didn't quite understand what was going on
777500	780180	with that interference.
780180	784940	So my very first grad student ever, Josh Smith,
784940	787420	did a thesis on tomography with electric fields,
787420	790380	how to see in 3D with electric fields.
790380	793380	Then through Todd and at that point,
793380	795740	research scientist in my lab, Joe Paradiso,
795740	798460	it led to a collaboration with Penn and Teller,
798460	801820	who, where we did a magic trick in Las Vegas
801820	803100	to contact Houdini.
803100	805780	And sort of these fields are sort of like,
805780	807140	contacting spirits.
808260	810500	So we did a magic trick in Las Vegas.
810500	813620	And then the crazy thing that happened after that
813620	817820	was Phil Rittmueller came running into my lab.
817820	822180	He worked with, this became with Honda and NEC,
822220	825700	airbags were killing infants in rear-facing child seats.
825700	829540	Cars need to distinguish a front-facing adult
829540	832540	where you'd save the life versus a bag of groceries
832540	833940	where you don't need to fire the airbag
833940	836300	versus a rear-facing infant where you would kill it.
836300	838820	And so the seat need to, in effect,
838820	841140	see in 3D to understand the occupants.
841140	845100	And so we took the Penn and Teller magic trick
845100	848620	derived from Josh's thesis from Yo-Yo's cello
848620	850060	to an auto show.
850060	851100	And all the car companies said,
851140	852820	great, when can we buy it?
852820	855900	And so that became Elisys and it was $100 million a year
855900	857700	business making sensors.
857700	859060	There wasn't a lot of publicity
859060	862180	because it was in the car so the car didn't kill you.
862180	864500	So they didn't sort of advertise,
864500	866780	we have nice sensors so the car doesn't kill you.
866780	868900	But it became a leading auto safety sensor.
868900	870580	And that started from the cello
870580	873260	and the question of the computational capacity,
873260	874180	the musical instrument.
874180	875020	Right.
875020	879340	So now to get back to MIT,
879340	882260	I was spending a lot of outside time at IBM research
882260	885100	that had gods of the foundations of computing.
886260	888220	There's just amazing people there.
888220	892300	And I'd always expected to go to IBM to take over a lab.
892300	897100	But at the last minute, pivoted and came to MIT
897100	902100	to take a position in the media lab
902500	905460	and start what became the predecessor to CBA.
905500	909940	Media lab is well known for Nicholas Negarpanti.
909940	913460	What's less well known is the role of Jerry Wiesner.
913460	915740	So Jerry was MIT's president
915740	917540	before that Kennedy science advisor,
917540	920140	grand old man of science.
920140	921740	At the end of his life,
921740	925940	he was frustrated by how knowledge was segregated.
925940	928220	And so he wanted to create a department
928220	930140	of none of the above,
930140	933540	a department for work that didn't fit in departments.
933580	937100	And the media lab in a sense was a cover story
937100	938660	for him to hide a department.
939740	942300	As MIT's president towards the end of his tenure,
942300	944100	if he said, I'm gonna make a department
944100	945660	for things that don't fit in departments,
945660	947660	the departments would have screamed.
947660	949460	But everybody was sort of paying attention
949460	950980	to Nicholas creating the media lab
950980	953700	and Jerry kind of hid in it a department
953700	955260	called media arts and sciences.
955260	957940	It's really the department of none of the above.
957940	961020	And Jerry explaining that and Nicholas then confirming it
961020	963860	is really why I pivoted and went to MIT.
964860	967580	Because my students who helped create quantum computing
967580	971460	or synthetic life get degrees from media arts and sciences,
971460	973580	this department of none of the above.
974660	979660	So that led to coming to MIT with Todd and Joe Paradiso
981260	983060	and my colleague, we started a consortium
983060	984340	called Things That Think.
984340	987340	And this was around the birth of internet of things
987340	989900	and RFID.
989900	992940	But then we started doing things like work we can discuss
992940	995340	that became the beginnings of quantum computing
995340	997380	and cryptography and materials
997380	999940	and logic and microfluidics.
999940	1004940	And those needed much more significant infrastructure
1005340	1007300	and were much longer research arcs.
1007300	1010660	So with a bigger team of about 20 people,
1010660	1012700	we wrote a proposal to the NSF
1012700	1014180	to assemble one of every tool
1014180	1017660	to make anything of any size was roughly the proposal.
1017700	1021580	One of any tool to make anything of any size.
1021580	1025580	Yeah, so they're usually nanometers, micrometers,
1025580	1027860	millimeters, meters are segregated,
1027860	1029860	input and output is segregated.
1030700	1033020	We wanted to look just very literally
1033020	1036980	how digital becomes physical and physical becomes digital.
1036980	1041660	And fortunately, we got NSF on a good day
1041660	1045580	and they funded this facility of one of almost every tool
1045580	1047100	to make anything.
1047100	1052020	And so with a group of core colleagues
1052860	1056980	that included Joe Jacobson, Ike Trang, Scott Minales,
1056980	1058300	we launched CBA.
1059540	1062860	And so you're talking about nanoscale, microscale,
1062860	1065580	nanostructures, microstructures, macrostructures,
1065580	1068180	electron microscopes and focus time beam probes
1068180	1071620	for nanostructures, laser, micro machining
1071620	1075300	and X-ray microtomography for microstructures,
1075340	1077060	multi-axis machining and 3D printing
1077060	1079100	for macrostructures, just some examples.
1079100	1080740	What are we talking about in terms of scale?
1080740	1084100	How can we build tiny things and big things
1084100	1085180	all in one place, is that possible?
1085180	1087740	Yeah, so a well-equipped research lab
1087740	1089940	has the sort of tools we're talking about,
1089940	1092340	but they're segregated in different places.
1092340	1096580	They're typically also run by technicians
1096580	1099620	where you then have an account and a project and you charge.
1099620	1102140	All of these tools are essentially
1102140	1103460	when you don't know what you're doing,
1103460	1105100	not when you do know what you're doing
1105100	1108300	in that they're when you need to work across length scales
1108300	1113020	where we don't, once projects are running in this facility,
1113020	1116340	we don't charge for time,
1116340	1118980	you don't make a formal proposal to schedule
1118980	1121860	and the users really run the tools and it's for work
1121860	1123780	that's kind of in Co8 that needs to span
1123780	1126540	these disciplines and length scales.
1126540	1131540	And so work in the project today,
1131740	1135860	work in CBA today ranges from developing
1135860	1139220	Zeptojoule electronics for the lowest power computing
1139220	1143580	to micromachining diamond to take 10 million RPM bearings
1143580	1146340	for molecular spectroscopy studies
1146340	1149740	up to exploring robots to build
1149740	1152820	100 meter structures in space.
1152820	1155940	Okay, can we, the three things you just mentioned,
1155940	1157780	let's start with the biggest.
1157780	1160380	What are some of the biggest stuff you attempted
1160380	1162300	to explore how to build in a lab?
1162300	1166100	Sure, so viewed from one direction,
1166100	1169940	what we're talking about is a crazy random seeming
1169940	1172700	of almost unrelated projects.
1172700	1174380	But if you rotate 90 degrees,
1174380	1177980	it's really just a core thought over and over again,
1177980	1181340	just very literally how bits and atoms relate,
1181340	1184660	how digital and just going from digital to physical
1184660	1185820	in many different domains,
1185820	1188740	but it's really just the same idea over and over again.
1188740	1190820	So to understand the biggest things,
1192060	1196940	let me go back to bring in now Shannon
1196940	1199300	as well as Van Neumann.
1199300	1200140	Claude Shannon.
1200140	1202620	Yeah, so what is digital?
1204220	1208300	The casual obvious answer is digital in one and zero,
1208300	1209700	but that's wrong.
1209700	1211100	There's a much deeper answer,
1211100	1216100	which is Claude Shannon at MIT wrote the best master thesis
1216700	1218540	ever in his master's thesis,
1218540	1222340	he invented our modern notion of digital logic.
1222340	1227340	Where it came from was Vannevar Bush was a grand old man
1227820	1231820	at MIT, he created the post war research establishment
1231820	1234140	that led to the National Science Foundation
1234140	1237340	and he made an important mistake, which we can talk about.
1237340	1240620	But he also made the differential analyzer,
1240620	1242900	which was the last grade analog computer.
1242900	1245300	So it was a room full of gears and pulleys
1246220	1249020	and the longer it ran, the worse the answer was.
1249020	1252540	And Shannon worked on it as a student
1252540	1255060	and he got so annoyed in his master's thesis,
1255060	1257700	he invented digital logic,
1257700	1259740	but he then went on to Bell Labs.
1259740	1263100	And what he did there was communication
1263100	1265220	was beginning to expand,
1265220	1267540	there was more demand for phone lines.
1267540	1271780	And so there's a question about how many phone lines
1271780	1274620	you could, phone messages you could send down a wire.
1275420	1277940	And you could try to just make it better and better.
1277940	1279820	He asked a question nobody had asked,
1279820	1281740	which is rather than make it better and better,
1281740	1283740	what's the limit to how good it can be?
1283740	1286860	And he proved a couple of things,
1286860	1288620	but one of the main things he proved
1288620	1292660	was a threshold theorem for channel capacity.
1292660	1296500	And so what he showed was my voice to you right now
1296500	1298460	is coming as a wave through sound
1298460	1300900	and the further you get, the worse it sounds.
1300900	1302820	But people watching this are getting it
1303460	1306180	as packets of data in a network.
1307740	1310340	When the computer, they're watching this,
1310340	1312780	gets the packet of information,
1313780	1316940	it can detect and correct an error.
1316940	1319820	And what Shannon showed is if the noise
1319820	1322380	in the cable to the people watching this
1322380	1324980	is above a threshold, they're doomed.
1324980	1327460	But if the noise is below a threshold
1327460	1330300	for a linear increase in the energy
1330300	1332420	representing our conversation,
1332460	1335540	the error rate goes down exponentially.
1335540	1337180	Exponentials are fast.
1337180	1339620	There's very few of them in engineering.
1339620	1342100	And the exponential reduction of error
1342100	1345060	below a threshold if you restore state
1345060	1347260	is called a threshold theorem.
1347260	1349300	That's what led to digital.
1349300	1352340	That means unreliable things can work reliably.
1352340	1354900	So Shannon did that for communication.
1354900	1358660	Then Van Neumann was inspired by that
1358660	1360860	and applied it to computation.
1360860	1363100	And he showed how an unreliable computer
1363100	1364900	can operate reliably
1364900	1368180	by using the same threshold property of restoring state.
1368180	1369620	It was then forgotten many years.
1369620	1371300	We had to rediscover it in effect
1371300	1372940	in the quantum computing era
1372940	1374820	when things are very unreliable again.
1375940	1378620	But now to go back to how does this relate
1378620	1380620	to the biggest things I've made?
1380620	1385620	So in fabrication, MIT invented
1386460	1390180	computer-controlled manufacturing in 1952.
1390180	1392460	Jet aircraft were just emerging.
1392460	1394860	There was a limit to turning cranks
1394860	1399780	on a milling machine to make parts for jet aircraft.
1399780	1401060	Now, this is a messy story.
1401060	1403740	MIT actually stole computer-controlled machining
1403740	1406020	from an inventor who brought it to MIT.
1406020	1408340	Wanted to do a joint project with the Air Force
1408340	1410140	and MIT effectively stole it from him.
1410140	1412460	So it's kind of a messy history.
1412460	1415100	But that sounds like the birth
1415100	1418020	of computer-controlled machining, 1952.
1419020	1422140	There are a number of inventors of 3D printing.
1422140	1424220	One of the companies spun off my lab
1424220	1425900	by Max Lobowski's form labs,
1425900	1428780	which is now a billion dollar 3D printing company.
1428780	1430620	That's the modern version.
1430620	1434860	But all of that's analog, meaning the information
1434860	1436060	is in the control computer.
1436060	1438020	There's no information in the materials.
1438020	1441580	And so it goes back to Vannevar Bush's analog computer.
1441580	1444380	If you make a mistake in printing or machining,
1444380	1446820	just the mistake accumulates.
1446940	1451940	The real birth of computerized digital manufacturing
1452100	1454100	is four billion years ago.
1454100	1456980	That's the evolutionary age of the ribosome.
1456980	1461140	So the way you're manufactured
1461140	1466140	is there's a code that describes you, the genetic code.
1466420	1470620	It goes to a micro machine, the ribosome,
1470620	1472340	which is this molecular factory
1472340	1476360	that builds the molecules that are you.
1477340	1478980	The key thing to know about that
1478980	1483580	is there are about 20 amino acids that get assembled.
1483580	1485380	And in that machinery,
1485380	1487900	it does everything Shannon and Van Neumann taught us.
1487900	1489580	You detect and correct errors.
1489580	1491540	So if you mix chemicals,
1491540	1494020	the error rate is about a part in a hundred.
1494020	1497020	When you elongate a protein in the ribosome,
1497020	1499100	it's about a part in 10 to the four.
1499100	1500940	When you replicate DNA,
1500940	1503180	there's an extra level of error correction.
1503180	1505260	It's a part in 10 to the eight.
1505260	1508500	And so in the molecules that make you,
1508500	1510660	you can detect and correct errors
1510660	1512700	and you don't need a ruler to make you.
1512700	1515300	The geometry comes from your parts.
1515300	1519420	So now compare a child playing with Lego
1519420	1521660	and a state-of-the-art 3D printer
1521660	1523540	or a computerized milling machine.
1524860	1527180	The tower made by a child
1527180	1529540	is more accurate than their motor control
1529540	1531860	because the act of snapping the bricks together
1531860	1533860	gives you a constraint on the joints.
1535020	1538500	You can join bricks made out of dissimilar materials.
1538500	1540100	You don't need a ruler for Lego
1540100	1542980	because the geometry locally gives you the global parts
1542980	1544540	and there's no Lego trash.
1544540	1547580	The parts have enough information to disassemble them.
1547580	1552180	Those are exactly the properties of a digital code.
1552180	1554060	The unreliable is made reliable.
1554060	1555460	Yes, absolutely.
1555460	1559620	So what the ribosome figured out four billion years ago
1559620	1563540	is how to embody these digital properties
1563540	1567540	but not for communication or computation
1567540	1569900	in effect but for construction.
1569900	1573180	So a number of projects in my lab
1573180	1576380	have been studying the idea of digital materials
1576380	1580340	and think of a digital material just as Lego bricks.
1580340	1584340	The precise meaning is a discrete set of parts
1584340	1588380	reversibly joined with global geometry
1588380	1590580	determined from local constraints.
1590580	1593380	And so it's digitizing the materials.
1593380	1594620	And so I'm coming back to
1594620	1596380	what are the biggest things I've made?
1596380	1598780	My lab was working with the aerospace industry.
1598780	1602020	So Spirit Arrow was Boeing's factories.
1602020	1604700	They asked us for how to join composites.
1604700	1606460	When you make a composite airplane,
1606460	1608900	you make these giant wing and fuselage parts
1608900	1612260	and they asked us for a better way to stick them together
1612260	1614540	because the joints were a place of failure.
1614540	1617500	And what we discovered was
1617500	1619740	instead of making a few big parts,
1619740	1622940	if you make little loops of carbon fiber
1622940	1626220	and you reversibly link them in joints
1626220	1629020	and you do it in a special geometry
1629020	1632460	that balances being under constrained and over constrained
1632460	1634780	with just the right degrees of freedom.
1634780	1638260	We set the world record for the highest modulus
1638260	1640140	ultralight material
1640180	1644620	just by in effect making carbon fiber Lego.
1644620	1649300	So lightweight materials are crucial for energy efficiency.
1649300	1652300	This let us make the lightest weight,
1652300	1654020	high modulus material.
1654020	1657740	We then showed that with just a few part types
1657740	1659980	we can tune the material properties
1659980	1663260	and then you can create really wild robots
1663260	1665940	that instead of having a tool the size of a jumbo jet
1665940	1667020	to make a jumbo jet,
1667020	1668620	you can make little robots
1668620	1670740	that walk on these cellular structures
1670740	1672260	to build the structures
1672260	1674620	where they error correct their position on the structure
1674620	1676740	and they navigate on the structure.
1676740	1680740	And so using all of that with NASA,
1682100	1684580	we made morphing airplanes.
1684580	1688420	A former student Kenny Chang and Ben Jeanette
1688420	1689380	made a morphing airplane
1689380	1692020	the size of NASA Langley's biggest wind tunnel.
1692020	1695700	With Toyota, we've made super efficiency race cars.
1695700	1698060	We're right now looking at projects with NASA
1698060	1700220	to build these for things like space telescopes
1700220	1703620	and space habitats where the ribosome
1703620	1705220	I who I mentioned a little while back
1705220	1708180	can make an elephant one molecule at a time.
1708180	1709980	Ribosomes are slow.
1709980	1712060	They run at about one molecule a second
1712060	1714300	but ribosomes make ribosomes.
1714300	1716260	So you have thousands of them,
1716260	1718620	billions of them and that makes an elephant.
1718620	1721300	In the same way these little assembly robots I'm describing
1721300	1724580	can make giant structures at heart
1724580	1727540	because the robot can make the robot.
1727540	1731100	So more recently to my students, Samira and Miana
1731100	1733500	had a nature communication paper showing
1733500	1738060	how this robot can be made out of the parts it's making
1738060	1739820	so the robots can make the robot.
1739820	1742340	So you build up the capacity of robotic assembly.
1742340	1743180	It can self-replicate.
1743180	1745140	Can you linger on what that robot looks like?
1745140	1747180	What is a robot that can walk along
1747180	1748620	and do error correction?
1748620	1751900	And what is a robot that can self-replicate
1753220	1754860	from the materials that is given?
1754860	1755700	What does that look like?
1755700	1756540	What are we talking?
1757020	1757860	This is fascinating.
1757860	1761700	Yeah, the answer is different at different length scales.
1761700	1765740	So to explain that in biology, primary structure
1765740	1768540	is the code in the messenger RNA
1768540	1771220	that says what the ribosome should build.
1771220	1773860	Secondary structure are geometrical motifs
1773860	1775860	or things like helices or sheets.
1775860	1778540	Tertiary structures are functional elements
1778540	1780940	like electron donors or acceptors.
1780940	1785940	Quaternary structure is things like molecular motors
1786020	1787220	that are moving my mouth
1787220	1789580	or making the synapses work in my brain.
1789580	1791540	So there's that hierarchy of primary,
1791540	1793900	secondary, tertiary, quaternary.
1793900	1798900	Now, what's interesting is if you wanna buy electronics today
1799260	1802740	from a vendor, there are hundreds of thousands of types
1802740	1807740	of resistors or capacitors or transistors, huge inventory.
1807780	1809980	All of biology is just made from this inventory
1809980	1811700	of 20 parts of the amino acids.
1811700	1814540	And by composing them, you can create all of life.
1814580	1819580	And so as part of this digitization of materials,
1820740	1822900	we're in effect trying to create something
1822900	1824540	like amino acids for engineering,
1824540	1827700	creating all of technology from 20 parts.
1827700	1831340	I see, as another discretion,
1831340	1834860	I helped start an office for science in Hollywood.
1834860	1838100	And there was a fun thing for the movie, The Martian,
1838100	1841180	where I did a program with Bill Nye and a few others
1841180	1843580	on how to actually build a civilization on Mars
1843580	1845940	that they described in a way that I like
1845940	1849060	as I was talking about how to go to Mars without luggage.
1849060	1852860	And at heart, it's sort of how to create life
1852860	1854340	in non-living materials.
1854340	1856820	So if you think about this primary,
1856820	1859060	secondary, tertiary, quaternary structure,
1860180	1862380	in my lab, we're doing that,
1862380	1864460	but on different length scales for different purposes.
1864460	1868660	So we're making micro robots out of like nanobricks
1868660	1872940	and to make the robots to build large scale structures
1872940	1876980	in space, the elements of the robots now are centimeters
1876980	1879460	rather than micrometers.
1879460	1883300	And so the assembly robots for the bigger structures are,
1885740	1887900	there are the cells that make up the structure,
1887900	1889580	but then we have functional cells.
1889580	1892460	And so cells that can process and actuate,
1892460	1895380	each cell can like move one degree of freedom
1895380	1900460	or attach or detach or process.
1900460	1903140	Now, those elements I just described,
1903140	1905340	we can make out of the still smaller parts.
1905340	1907820	So eventually there's a hierarchy of the little parts
1907820	1909660	make little robots that make bigger parts
1909660	1912620	of bigger robots up through that hierarchy.
1912620	1914460	And that way you can move up the length scale.
1914460	1917380	Right, early on I tried to go in a straight line
1917380	1918540	from the bottom to the top
1918540	1920460	and that ended up being a bad idea.
1920460	1922940	Instead, we're kind of doing all of these in parallel
1922940	1924820	and then they're growing together.
1924820	1928340	And so to make the larger scale structures,
1928340	1930300	like there's a lot of hype right now
1930300	1931540	about 3D printing houses
1931540	1933900	where you have a printer the size of the house.
1933900	1937340	We're now working on using swarms of these,
1937340	1939580	table scale robots that walk on the structures
1939580	1942380	to place the parts much more efficiently.
1942380	1943740	That's amazing.
1943740	1945940	But you're saying you can't for now go
1945940	1947900	from the very small to the very large.
1947900	1950860	That'll come in stages.
1950860	1953020	Can we just link around this idea
1953020	1956660	starting from Vinoyman's self replicating automata
1956660	1959740	that you mentioned, it's just a beautiful idea.
1959820	1961620	That's at the heart of all of this.
1961620	1962940	In the stack I described,
1962940	1964860	so one student, Will Langford,
1964860	1967540	made these micro-robots out of little parts
1967540	1970780	that then we're using for Miana's bigger robots
1970780	1972220	up through this hierarchy.
1972220	1973980	And it's really realizing
1973980	1976060	this idea of the self-reproducing automata.
1976060	1979020	So Vinoyman, when I complained about
1979020	1981420	the Vinoyman architecture,
1981420	1982820	it's not fair to Vinoyman
1982820	1984820	because he never claimed it as his architecture.
1984820	1987300	He really wrote about it in this one fairly dreadful memo
1987300	1988940	that led to all sorts of lawsuits
1988940	1991900	and fights about the early days of computing.
1991900	1995620	He did beautiful work on reliable computation
1995620	1997100	and reliable devices.
1997100	1998500	And towards the end of his life,
1998500	2001500	what he studied was how,
2001500	2004060	and I have to say this precisely,
2004060	2007500	how a computation communicates its own construction.
2007500	2008980	Yeah, so beautiful.
2008980	2013980	So a computation can store a description
2014020	2015980	of how to build itself.
2015980	2018620	But now there's a really hard problem,
2018660	2023500	which is if you have that in your mind,
2023500	2028060	how do you transfer it and wake up a thing
2028060	2030300	that then can contain it?
2030300	2031740	So how do you give birth to a thing
2031740	2033660	that knows how to make itself?
2033660	2036340	And so with Stan Ulam,
2036340	2040300	he invented cellular automata as a way to simulate these.
2041740	2043980	But that was theoretical.
2043980	2045900	Now the work I'm describing in my lab
2045900	2048500	is fundamentally how to realize it,
2048500	2053140	how to realize self-reproducing automata.
2053140	2056860	And so this is something Van Neumann thought very deeply
2056860	2059620	and very beautifully about theoretically.
2059620	2062020	And it's right at this intersection.
2062020	2067020	It's not communication or computation or fabrication.
2067300	2068660	It's right at this intersection
2068660	2071420	where communication and computation meets fabrication.
2072300	2076020	Now the reason self-reproducing automata intellectually
2076020	2076860	is so important,
2076860	2078460	is this is the foundation of life.
2078460	2079820	This is really just understanding
2079820	2082100	the essence of how to life.
2082100	2083700	And in effect, we're trying to create life
2083700	2085380	in non-living material.
2085380	2088380	The reason it's so important technologically
2088380	2090820	is because that's how you scale capacity.
2090820	2093540	That's how you can make an elephant from a ribosome
2093540	2096340	because the assemblers make assemblers.
2096340	2098340	So simple building blocks
2098340	2101180	that inside themselves contain the information
2101180	2103420	how to build more building blocks.
2103420	2108220	And between each other construct arbitrarily complex objects.
2108220	2109820	Now let me give you the numbers.
2109820	2111860	So let me relate this to right now
2111860	2115860	we're living in AI mania explosion time.
2115860	2118940	Let me relate that to what we're talking about.
2119860	2122380	A hundred petaflop computer,
2122380	2127380	which is a current generation supercomputer,
2127420	2129140	not quite the biggest ones,
2129980	2132900	does 10 to the 17 ops per second.
2132900	2135820	Your brain does 10 to the 17 ops per second.
2135820	2138060	It has about 10 to the 15 synapses
2138060	2140140	and they run at about a hundred hertz.
2140140	2143140	So as of a year or two ago,
2143140	2147700	the performance of a big computer matched a brain.
2147700	2150540	So you could view AI as a breakthrough,
2150540	2155540	but the real story is within about a year or two ago,
2155780	2157980	and let's see that the supercomputer
2157980	2161500	has about 10 to the 15 transistors in the processors,
2161500	2163380	10 to the 15 transistors in the memory,
2163380	2165220	which is the synapses in your brain.
2165220	2166940	So the real breakthrough was
2166940	2171700	the computers match the computational capacity of a brain.
2171700	2173140	And so we'd be sort of derelict
2173140	2175540	if they couldn't do about the same thing.
2175540	2178700	But now the reason I'm mentioning that is
2178700	2183340	the chip fab making the supercomputer
2183340	2187380	is placing about 10 to the 10 transistors a second.
2187380	2189780	While you're digesting your lunch right now,
2190460	2193840	you're placing about 10 to the 18 parts per second.
2195500	2198540	There's an eight order of magnitude difference.
2198540	2202460	So in computational capacity, it's done, we've caught up.
2202460	2205060	But there's eight orders of magnitude difference
2205060	2207620	in the rate at which biology can build
2207620	2210860	versus state-of-the-art manufacturing can build.
2210860	2212960	And that distinction is what we're talking about.
2212960	2216260	That distinction is not analog,
2216260	2218780	but this deep sense of digital fabrication,
2218820	2221140	of embodying codes in construction.
2221140	2222900	So a description doesn't describe a thing,
2222900	2224980	but the description becomes the thing.
2224980	2227420	So you're saying, I mean, this is one of the cases
2227420	2230460	you're making and that this is this third revolution.
2230460	2232540	We've seen the Moore's Law in communication,
2232540	2235380	we've seen the Moore's Law-like type of growth
2235380	2239460	in computation, and you're anticipating,
2239460	2242220	we're going to see that in digital fabrication.
2242220	2243820	Can you actually first of all describe
2243820	2246460	what you mean by this term, digital fabrication?
2246460	2249460	So the casual meaning is the computer controls
2249460	2251540	the tool to make something.
2251540	2255140	And that was invented when MIT stole it in 1952.
2256620	2259620	There's the deep meaning of what the ribosome does,
2259620	2264620	of a digital description doesn't describe a thing,
2265660	2268100	a digital description becomes the thing.
2268100	2273020	That's the path to the Star Trek replicator,
2273020	2276300	and that's the thing that doesn't exist yet.
2276300	2278540	Now, I think the best way to understand
2278540	2283380	what this roadmap looks like is to now bring in FAB Labs
2283380	2284780	and how they relate to all of this.
2284780	2285940	What are FAB Labs?
2285940	2288820	So here's a sequence.
2288820	2292340	With colleagues, I accidentally started a network
2292340	2296500	of what's now 2,500 digital fabrication community labs
2296500	2299540	called FAB Labs right now in 125 countries,
2299540	2301340	and they double every year and a half.
2301340	2304300	That's called Lassa's Law after Sherry Lasseter,
2304300	2305260	who I'll explain.
2305300	2306580	So here's the sequence.
2308740	2311140	We started Center for Bits and Atoms
2311140	2313420	to do the kind of research we're talking about.
2313420	2316940	We had all of these machines, and then had a problem,
2316940	2318940	it would take a lifetime of classes
2318940	2321540	to learn to use all the machines.
2321540	2325620	So with colleagues who helped start CBA,
2325620	2327420	we began a class modestly called
2327420	2328940	how to make almost anything.
2328940	2331380	And there's no big agenda, it was just,
2331380	2334060	it was aimed at a few research students to use the machines,
2334060	2336060	and it was completely unprepared
2336060	2337860	for the first time we taught it.
2337860	2340780	We were swamped by, every year since,
2340780	2342740	hundreds of students try to take the class.
2342740	2345620	It's one of the most oversubscribed classes at MIT.
2346660	2347940	Students would say things like,
2347940	2349380	can you teach this at MIT?
2349380	2350580	It seems too useful.
2350580	2353180	It's just how to work these machines.
2353180	2355780	And the students in the class,
2355780	2358980	I would teach them all the skills to use all these tools,
2358980	2361060	and then they would do projects integrating them,
2361060	2361900	and they're amazing.
2361900	2365580	So Kelly was a sculptor, no engineering background.
2365580	2367380	Her project was she made a device
2367380	2368940	that saves up screams when you're mad
2368940	2370740	and plays them back later.
2370740	2373420	And saves up screams when you're mad
2373420	2374460	and plays them back later.
2374460	2377620	You scream into this device and it deadens the sound,
2377620	2379380	records it, and then when it's convenient,
2379380	2381060	releases your scream.
2381060	2385260	Can we just pause on the brilliance of that invention?
2385260	2389380	Creation, the art, I don't know, the brilliance.
2389380	2390380	Who is this that created this?
2390380	2391220	Kelly Dobson.
2392060	2394220	Gone on to do a number of interesting things.
2394220	2397180	Mijin, who's gone on to do a number of interesting things,
2397180	2399900	made a dress instrumented with sensors and spines.
2399900	2401300	And when somebody creepy comes close,
2401300	2402860	it would defend your personal space.
2402860	2404340	It's also very easy.
2404340	2407980	Another project early on was a web browser for parrots,
2407980	2410020	which have the cognitive ability of a young child,
2410020	2412260	and lets parrots surf the internet.
2412260	2414380	You know, another was an alarm clock,
2414380	2417340	an alarm clock you wrestle with and prove you're awake.
2417340	2420340	And what connects all of these is,
2420380	2423460	so MIT made the first real-time computer, the whirlwind.
2423460	2426420	That was transistorized as the TX.
2426420	2430580	The TX was spun off from MIT as the PDP.
2430580	2435580	PDPs were the mini computers that created the internet.
2436540	2440740	So outside MIT was DEC, Prime, Wang, Data, General,
2440740	2442900	the whole mini computer industry.
2442900	2444820	The whole computing industry was there,
2444820	2448820	and it all failed when computing became personal.
2448820	2450420	Ken Olson, the head of digital,
2450420	2452980	famously said, you don't need a computer at home.
2452980	2454220	There's a little background to that,
2454220	2458780	but DEC completely missed computing became personal.
2458780	2461780	So I mentioned all of that because I was asking
2461780	2464780	how to do digital fabrication, but not really why.
2464780	2468460	The students in this how to make class were showing me
2468460	2471060	that the killer app of digital fabrication
2471060	2472420	is personal fabrication.
2472420	2474700	Yeah, how do you jump to the personal fabrication?
2474700	2476940	So Kelly didn't make the screen body
2476940	2478220	because it was for a thesis.
2478260	2480300	She wasn't writing a research paper.
2480300	2483180	It wasn't a business model.
2483180	2485500	She wanted, it was because she wanted one.
2485500	2487740	It was personal expression going back
2487740	2489620	to me in vocational school.
2489620	2493060	It was personal expression in these new means of expression.
2493060	2494940	So that's happened every year since.
2494940	2496260	It literally is called,
2496260	2497660	the course is literally called
2497660	2500740	how to make almost anything.
2500740	2504540	A legendary course at MIT every year.
2504540	2508620	And it's grown to multiple labs at MIT
2508620	2511220	with as many people involved in teaching as taking it.
2511220	2513660	There's even a Harvard lab for the MIT class.
2513660	2518660	What have you learned about humans colliding
2518740	2520980	with the fab lab, about what the capacity
2520980	2522580	of humans to be creative and to build?
2522580	2524020	I mentioned Marvin.
2524020	2526580	Another mentor at MIT, sadly no longer living
2526580	2528180	is Seymour Papper.
2528180	2531140	So Papper studied with Piaget.
2531140	2534660	He came to MIT to get access to the early computer.
2534660	2538020	Piaget was a pioneer in how kids learn.
2538020	2542780	Papper came to MIT to get access to the early computers
2542780	2545300	with the goal of letting kids play with them.
2545300	2547380	Piaget helps show kids are like scientists.
2547380	2549300	They learn as scientists
2549300	2551340	and it gets kind of throttled out of them.
2551340	2554340	Seymour wanted to let kids have a broader landscape to play.
2554340	2556220	Seymour's work led with Mitch Resnick
2556220	2559420	to Lego, Logo, Mindstorms, all of that stuff.
2559420	2562420	As fab lab spread and we started creating
2562420	2564460	educational programs for kids in them,
2564460	2566100	Seymour said something really interesting.
2566100	2566980	He made a gesture.
2566980	2570500	He said it was a thorn in his side
2570500	2573060	that they invented what's called the turtle,
2573060	2575660	a early robot kids could program
2575660	2577940	to connect it to a mainframe computer.
2577940	2581300	Seymour said the goal was not for the kids
2581300	2582500	to program the robot,
2582500	2585460	it was for the kids to create the robot.
2585460	2587540	And so in that sense, the fab labs,
2587580	2589420	which for me were just this accident,
2589420	2591140	he described as sort of this fulfillment
2591140	2594460	of the arc of kids learned by experimenting.
2594460	2596900	It was to give them the tools to create,
2596900	2599620	not just assemble things and program things,
2599620	2600980	but actually create.
2600980	2603180	So coming to your question,
2603180	2608180	what I've learned is MIT,
2608780	2611260	a few years back, somebody added up businesses
2611260	2612820	from spun off from MIT
2612820	2614500	and it's the world's 10th economy.
2614500	2616580	It falls between India and Russia.
2616620	2619820	And I view that in a way as a bad number
2619820	2621740	because it's only a few thousand people
2621740	2624820	and these aren't uniquely the 4,000 brightest people,
2624820	2627380	it's just a productive environment for them.
2627380	2630820	And what we found is in rural Indian villages
2630820	2635220	in African shantytowns and Arctic hamlets,
2635220	2639900	I find exactly precisely that profile.
2639900	2644300	So Ling sighed at a few hours above Tromsø,
2644300	2645940	way above the Arctic circles.
2645980	2647420	So far in North, the satellite dishes,
2647420	2649500	look at the ground, not the sky.
2649500	2653340	Hans Christian in the lab was considered a problem
2653340	2654500	in the local school
2654500	2656220	because they couldn't teach him anything.
2656220	2657500	I showed him a few projects.
2657500	2659180	Next time I came back, he was designing
2659180	2661060	and building little robot vehicles.
2661060	2666060	And in South Africa, I mentioned Soshengovie,
2667140	2668420	in this apartheid township,
2668420	2670500	the local technical institute taught kids
2670500	2671980	how to make bricks and fold sheets.
2671980	2673820	So it was punitive.
2673820	2675580	But Chepiso in the fab lab
2675580	2677900	was actually doing all the work of my MIT classes.
2677900	2681700	And so over and over, we found precisely
2681700	2686700	the same kind of bright invent of creativity.
2687780	2691860	And historically, the answer was,
2691860	2693220	go, you're smart, go away.
2693220	2695580	It's sort of like me in vocational school.
2695580	2697300	But in this lab network,
2697300	2699140	what we could then do is in effect,
2699140	2700500	bring the world to them.
2700500	2702460	Now let's look at the scaling of all of this.
2702460	2707460	So there's one earth, 1,000 cities,
2707500	2711140	a million towns, a billion people, a trillion things.
2711980	2714220	There was one whirlwind computer,
2714220	2717300	MIT made the first real-time computer.
2717300	2719860	There were thousands of PDPs.
2719860	2721820	There were millions of hobbyist computers
2721820	2723660	that came from that,
2723660	2725140	billions of personal computers,
2725140	2727420	trillions of internet of things.
2727420	2730180	So now if we look at this fab lab story,
2730220	2732380	1952 was the NC mill.
2733620	2735700	There are now thousands of fab labs.
2735700	2739620	And the fab lab costs exactly the same
2739620	2742500	constant complexity of the mini computer.
2742500	2746020	So on the mini computer, it didn't fit in your pocket.
2746020	2747700	It filled the room.
2747700	2751620	But video games, email, word processing,
2751620	2753460	really anything you do, the internet,
2753460	2756740	anything you do with a computer today happened at that era
2756740	2759300	because it got on the scale of a work group,
2759340	2761460	not a corporation.
2761460	2765140	In the same way, fab labs are like the mini computers
2765140	2766540	inventing how does the world work
2766540	2768380	if anybody can make anything.
2768380	2771380	Then if you look at that scaling,
2771380	2776080	fab labs today are transitioning from buying a machine
2776080	2778060	to make machines, making machines.
2778060	2780660	So we're transitioning to you can go to a fab lab,
2780660	2784380	not to make a project, but to make a new machine.
2784380	2787300	So we talked about the deep sense of self-replication.
2787300	2790260	There's a very practical sense of fab lab machines
2790260	2792500	making fab lab machines.
2792500	2797500	And so that's the equivalent of the habeas computer era,
2798140	2801460	what it's called the Altair historically.
2801460	2803660	Then the work we spent a while talking about
2803660	2805620	about assemblers and self-assemblers,
2805620	2808620	that's the equivalent of smartphones
2808620	2809700	and internet of things.
2809700	2813940	That's when, so the assemblers are like the smartphone
2813940	2815940	where a smartphone today has the capacity
2815940	2818700	of what used to be a supercomputer in your pocket.
2818700	2822380	And then the smart thermostat on your wall
2822380	2827380	has the power of the original PDP computer,
2827500	2828980	not metaphorically, but literally,
2828980	2832020	and now there's trillions of those in the same sense
2832020	2834820	that when we finally merge materials
2834820	2836620	with the machines in the self-assembly,
2836620	2839140	that's like the internet of things stage.
2839140	2841260	But here's the important lesson.
2842160	2844880	If you look at the computing analogy,
2844880	2848000	computing expanded exponentially,
2848000	2852160	but it really didn't fundamentally change.
2852160	2856040	The core things happened in that transition
2856040	2857300	in the mini computer era.
2857300	2860200	So in the same sense, the research now,
2860200	2861360	we spent a while talking about
2861360	2863680	is how we get to the replicator.
2863680	2866640	Today you can do all of that if you close your eyes
2866640	2869140	and view the whole fab lab as a machine.
2869140	2871080	In that room, you can make almost anything,
2871080	2872800	but you need a lot of inputs.
2872800	2875680	Bit by bit, the inputs will go down
2875680	2877440	and the size of the room will go down
2877440	2879880	as we go through each of these stages.
2879880	2884720	So how difficult is it to create a self-replicating assembler,
2884720	2889720	self-replicating machine that builds copies of itself
2889720	2891680	or builds more complicated version of itself,
2891680	2894360	which is kind of the dream towards which you're pushing
2894360	2896880	in a generic arbitrary sense?
2896880	2900360	I had a student Nadia Peek with Jonathan Ward,
2900400	2903600	who for me started this idea of how do we use
2903600	2906800	the tools in my lab to make the tools in the lab?
2906800	2909520	In a very clear sense,
2909520	2911840	they are making self-reproducing machines.
2911840	2914560	So one of the really cool things that's happened
2914560	2918040	is there's a whole network of machine builders
2918040	2918920	around the world.
2918920	2921800	So there's Danielle and now in Germany
2921800	2923120	and Jens in Norway.
2923120	2928120	And each of these people has learned the skills
2928800	2930920	to go into a fab lab and make a machine.
2930920	2934040	And so we've started creating a network of super fab,
2934040	2935520	so the fab lab can make a machine,
2935520	2936520	but it can't make a number
2936520	2938680	of the precision parts of the machine.
2938680	2941960	So in places like Bhutan or Kerala in the south of India,
2941960	2944000	we've started creating super fab labs
2944000	2946800	that have more advanced tools to make the parts
2946800	2949280	of the machines so that the machines themselves
2949280	2951240	become even cheaper.
2951240	2955680	So that is self-reproducing machines,
2955720	2959440	but you need to feed it things like bearings
2959440	2961920	or microcontrollers, they can't make those parts.
2961920	2964440	But other than that, they're making their own things.
2964440	2966360	And I should note as a footnote,
2966360	2969600	the stack I described of computers controlling machines
2969600	2972600	to machine making machines to assemblers to self-assemblers,
2972600	2975400	view that as fab1234.
2975400	2978280	So we're transitioning from fab1 to fab2
2978280	2980640	and the research in the lab is three and four.
2980640	2983960	At this fab2 stage, a big component of this
2983960	2987920	is sustainability in the material feedstocks.
2987920	2991600	So Alicia, colleague in Chile is leading a great effort
2991600	2994040	looking at how you take forest products
2994040	2995720	and coffee grounds and seashells
2995720	2998680	and a range of locally available materials
2998680	3002520	and produce the high tech materials that go into the lab.
3002520	3005840	So all of that is machine building today.
3005840	3010840	Then back in the lab, what we can do today is
3011840	3014040	we have robots that can build structures
3014040	3017440	and can assemble more robots that build structures.
3017440	3020280	We have finer resolution robots
3020280	3022880	that can build micromechanical systems.
3022880	3026840	So robots that can build robots that can walk and manipulate.
3026840	3031920	And we're just now, we have a project at the layer below that
3031920	3033720	where there's endless attention today
3033720	3037200	to billion dollar chip fab investments.
3037200	3040120	But a really interesting thing we pass through
3040320	3044200	is today the smallest transistors you can buy
3044200	3047400	as a single transistor, just commercially for electronics,
3047400	3049760	is actually the size of an early transistor
3049760	3051840	in an integrated circuit.
3051840	3054600	So we're using these machines, making machines,
3054600	3057360	making assemblers to place those parts
3057360	3059360	to not use a billion dollar chip fab
3059360	3060520	to make integrated circuits,
3060520	3063160	but actually assemble little electronic components.
3063160	3066880	So have a fine enough, precise enough actuators
3066920	3070200	and manipulators that allow you to place these transistors.
3070200	3072600	Right, that's a research project in my lab
3073600	3076360	called DICE on Discrete Assembly of Integrated Electronics.
3076360	3078920	And we're just at the point to really start
3078920	3080480	to take seriously this notion
3080480	3084400	of not having a chip fab make integrated electronics,
3084400	3086840	but having not a 3D printer,
3086840	3090120	but a thing that's a cross between a pick in place
3090120	3092200	makes circuit boards in 2D.
3092200	3094840	The 3D printer extrudes in 3D.
3094880	3097040	We're making sort of a micromanipulator
3097040	3098160	that acts like a printer,
3098160	3101400	but it's placing to build electronics in 3D.
3101400	3103440	But this micromanipulator is distributed,
3103440	3105880	so there's a bunch of them, or is this one centralized thing?
3105880	3107680	So that's why that's a great question.
3107680	3111280	So I have a prize that's almost but not been claimed
3111280	3114680	for the students whose thesis can walk out of the printer.
3114680	3115640	Oh, nice.
3115640	3119400	So you have to print the thesis with the means
3119400	3121560	to exit the printer,
3121560	3125840	and it has to contain its description of the thesis
3125840	3127200	that says how to do that.
3128240	3129760	It's a really good...
3129760	3132680	I mean, it's a fun example of exactly
3132680	3133520	the thing we're talking about.
3133520	3137480	And I've had a few students almost get to that.
3137480	3140920	And so in what I'm describing,
3140920	3143400	there's this stack where we're getting closer,
3143400	3146720	but it's still quite a few years to really go from us.
3146720	3148840	So there's a layer below the transistors
3148840	3150520	where we assemble the base materials
3150520	3152200	that become the transistor.
3152200	3155600	We're now just at the edge of assembling the transistors
3155600	3157760	to make the circuits.
3157760	3161640	We can assemble the micro parts to make the micro robots.
3161640	3163640	We can assemble the bigger robots.
3163640	3164600	And in the coming years,
3164600	3167560	we'll be patching together all of those scales.
3167560	3172560	So do you see a vision of just endless billions of robots
3172680	3174920	at the different scales, self-assembling,
3175920	3178880	self-replicating and building complicated structures?
3178880	3180520	Yes.
3180520	3183360	And the but to the yes, but is...
3183360	3184960	Let me clarify two things.
3184960	3189960	One is that immediately raises King Charles' fear
3190120	3195040	of gray goo, of runaway mutant self-reproducing things.
3195040	3197320	The reason why there are many things
3197320	3199080	I can tell you to worry about,
3199080	3201280	but that's not one of them,
3201280	3205680	is if you want things to autonomously self-reproduce
3205680	3206800	and take over the world,
3206800	3209080	that means they need to compete with nature
3209080	3212960	on using the resources of nature, of water and sunlight.
3212960	3215640	And in light of everything I'm describing,
3215640	3217960	biology knows everything I told you.
3217960	3219560	Every single thing I explained,
3219560	3221280	biology already knows how to do.
3223200	3225480	What I'm describing isn't new for biology,
3225480	3227920	it's new for non-biological systems.
3227920	3230520	So in the digital era,
3230520	3233800	the economic when ended up being centralized,
3233800	3235680	the big platforms.
3235680	3238320	In this world of machines that can make machines,
3238320	3239960	I'm asked for example,
3241000	3243560	what's the killer opportunity?
3243560	3245640	Who's gonna make all the money?
3245640	3247120	Who to invest in?
3247120	3249000	But if the machine can make the machine,
3249000	3252200	it's not a great business to invest in the machine.
3253540	3257880	In the same way that if you can think globally,
3257880	3259760	but produce locally,
3259760	3263360	then the way the technology goes out into society
3263360	3266160	isn't a function of central control,
3266160	3267940	but is fundamentally distributed.
3267940	3271680	Now, that raises an obvious kind of concern,
3271680	3272800	which is well, doesn't this mean
3272800	3275760	you could make bombs and guns and all of that?
3275760	3279600	The reason that's much less of a problem than you would think
3279600	3282920	is making bombs and guns and all of that
3282920	3285280	is a very well-met market need.
3285280	3289720	Anywhere we go, there's a fine supply chain for weapons.
3289720	3291840	Now, hobbyists have been making guns for ages
3291840	3294360	and guns are available just about anywhere.
3294360	3296360	So you could go into the lab and make a gun.
3296360	3298440	Today, it's not a very good gun
3298440	3300160	and guns are easily available.
3300160	3303240	And so generally, we've run these lab and war zones.
3303240	3308080	What we find is people don't go to them to make weapons,
3308080	3309480	which you can already do anyway.
3309480	3311600	It's an alternative to making weapons.
3311600	3312800	Coming back to your question,
3312800	3315880	I'd say the single most important thing I've learned is
3317000	3319040	the greatest natural resource of the planet
3319040	3323120	is this amazing density of bright invent of people
3323120	3324640	whose brains are underused.
3324640	3329640	And you could view the social engineering of this lab work
3330360	3332440	is creating the capacity for them.
3332440	3337120	And so in the end, the way this is gonna impact society
3337120	3338920	isn't gonna be command and control.
3338920	3341000	It's how the world uses it.
3341000	3343560	And it's been really gratifying for me
3343560	3345800	to see just how it does.
3345800	3348160	Yeah, but what are the different ways
3348160	3350920	the evolution of the exponential scaling
3350920	3352760	of digital fabrication can evolve?
3352760	3356760	So you said, yeah, self replicating nanobots, right?
3356760	3359720	This is the gray goo fear.
3359720	3361800	It's a caricature of a fear,
3361800	3363720	but nevertheless, there's interesting,
3363720	3366600	just like you said, spam and all these kinds of things
3366600	3370080	that came with the scaling of communication and computation.
3370080	3371920	What are the different ways
3371920	3375120	that malevolent actors will use this technology?
3375120	3377680	Yeah, well, first, let me start with a benevolent story,
3377720	3382720	which is trash is an analog concept.
3384000	3385800	There's no trash in a forest.
3385800	3388520	All the parts get disassembled and reused.
3388520	3391560	Trash means something doesn't have enough information
3391560	3393960	to tell you how to reuse it.
3393960	3398400	It's as simple as there's no trash in a Lego room.
3398400	3399760	When you assemble Lego,
3399760	3402880	the Lego bricks have enough information to disassemble them.
3402880	3407320	So as you go through this fab one, two, three, four story,
3407320	3411200	one of the implications of this transition
3411200	3413720	to from printing to assembling.
3413720	3416280	So the real breakthrough technologically
3416280	3418280	isn't additive versus subtractive,
3418280	3422400	which is a subject of a lot of attention and hype.
3422400	3424040	3D printers are useful.
3425280	3427960	We spun off companies like form labs
3427960	3429840	led by Max for 3D printing.
3429840	3432400	But in a fab lab, it's one of maybe 10 machines.
3432400	3435140	It's used, but it's only part of the machines.
3435140	3438060	The real technological change is when we go from printing
3438060	3442220	and cutting to assembling and disassembling.
3442220	3446580	But that reduces inventories of hundreds of thousands
3446580	3448260	of parts to just having a few parts
3448260	3449860	to make almost anything.
3449860	3451880	It reduces global supply chains
3451880	3454180	to locally sourcing these building blocks.
3454180	3456980	But one of the key implications is it gets rid
3456980	3460820	of technological trash because you can disassemble
3460820	3463260	and reuse the parts, not throw them away.
3463260	3465900	And so initially that's of interest for things
3465900	3468720	at the end of long supply chains, like satellites on orbit.
3468720	3471700	But one of the things coming is eliminating technical trash
3471700	3474420	through reuse of the building blocks.
3474420	3476840	So like when you think about 3D printers,
3476840	3479960	you're thinking about addition and subtraction
3479960	3483660	when you think about the other options available to you
3483660	3485820	in that parameter space as you call it,
3485820	3489540	that's going to be assembly, this assembly cutting you said.
3489540	3494540	So the 1952 NC mill was subtractive, you remove material.
3495700	3500140	And 3D printing additive, and there's a couple of claims
3500140	3501820	to the invention of 3D printing,
3501820	3503660	that's closer to what's called net shape,
3503660	3505500	which is you don't have to cut away the material
3505500	3507700	you don't need, you just put material where you do need it.
3507700	3510140	And so that's the 3D printing revolution.
3510140	3514620	But there are all sorts of limitations on 3D printing
3514620	3518220	to the kinds of materials you can print,
3518220	3520420	of kind of functionality you can print.
3520420	3523620	We're just not going to get to making a,
3524940	3527860	everything in a cell phone on a single printer,
3527860	3530160	but I do expect to make everything in a cell phone
3530160	3531180	with an assembler.
3531180	3534380	And so instead of printing and cutting technologically,
3534380	3537780	it's this transition to assembling and disassembling,
3537780	3540300	going back to Shannon and Van Neumann,
3540300	3543500	going back to the ribosome four billion years ago.
3543500	3546420	Now you come to malevolent.
3546420	3549020	Let me tell you a story about,
3549020	3554020	I was doing a briefing for the National Academy
3554220	3559060	of Sciences group that advises the intelligence communities.
3559060	3561740	And I talked about the kind of research we do.
3561740	3564940	And at the very end, I showed a little video clip
3564940	3569660	of Valentina and Ghana making a local girl
3569660	3573460	making surface mount electronics in the fab lab.
3573460	3576380	And I showed that to this room full of people.
3576380	3579140	One of the members of the intelligence community
3579140	3581180	got up livid and said,
3581180	3584660	how dare you waste our time showing us a young girl
3584660	3587540	in an African village making surface mount electronics.
3587540	3591060	We're looking at, we need to know about disruptive threats
3591060	3592820	to the future of the United States.
3593820	3596700	And somebody else got up in the room and yelled at him,
3596700	3599500	and you idiot, I can't think of anything more important
3599500	3601860	than this, but for two reasons.
3601860	3606420	One reason was because if we rely
3606420	3609620	on like informational superiority in the battlefield,
3609620	3612020	it means other people could get access to it.
3612020	3615060	But this intelligence person's point, bless him,
3615060	3620060	wasn't that it was getting at the root causes of conflict
3620100	3622300	is if this young girl in an African village
3622300	3625140	could actually master surface mount electronics,
3625140	3628140	it changes some of the most fundamental things
3628260	3630980	about recruitment for terrorism,
3633060	3635020	impact of economic migration,
3635020	3636940	basic assumptions about an economy.
3636940	3640700	It's just existential for the future of the planet.
3640700	3644780	But we've just lived through a pandemic.
3644780	3646460	I would love to linger on this
3646460	3650460	because the possibilities that are positive are endless,
3650460	3652100	but the possibilities are negative
3652100	3654420	are still nevertheless extremely important.
3654420	3656540	Well, it's both positive and negative.
3656540	3661540	What do you do with a large number of general assemblers?
3661540	3663140	Yeah, with the fab lab,
3663140	3664940	you could roughly make a bio lab,
3664940	3666540	then learn biotechnology.
3666540	3670660	Now, that's terrifying because making self-reproducing
3670660	3674300	gray goo that outcompetes biology,
3674300	3677540	I consider doom because biology knows everything
3677540	3679940	I'm describing and is really good at what it does.
3681380	3685860	In how to grow almost anything,
3685900	3688980	you learn skills in biotechnology
3688980	3692860	that let you make serious biological threats.
3692860	3696580	And when you combine some of the innovations
3696580	3698180	you see with large language models,
3698180	3700740	some of the innovations you see with AlphaFold,
3700740	3704940	so applications of AI for designing biological systems
3704940	3708020	for writing programs,
3708020	3710300	which you can have a large language models increasingly.
3710300	3713100	So there seems to be an interesting dance here
3713100	3718100	of automating the design stage of complex systems using AI.
3718980	3722500	And then that's the bits.
3722500	3725260	And you can leap now, the innovations you're talking about,
3725260	3728580	you can leap from the complex systems in the digital space
3728580	3732620	to the printing, to the creation, to the assembly
3733540	3738220	at scale of complex systems in the physical space.
3738220	3740540	Yeah, so something to be scared about
3740540	3743380	is a fab lab can make a biolab,
3743380	3745540	a biolab can make biotechnology,
3745540	3748980	somebody could learn to make a virus.
3748980	3750060	That's scary.
3750060	3752860	That's unlike some of the things I said,
3752860	3754780	I don't worry about that's something
3754780	3757100	I really worry about that is scary.
3757100	3758980	Now, how do you deal with that?
3760580	3765580	Prior threats we dealt with command and control.
3765980	3770980	So like early color copiers had unique codes
3771940	3773620	and you could tell which copier made them.
3773620	3776420	Eventually you couldn't keep up with that.
3776420	3779500	There was a famous meeting at Asilomar
3779500	3782580	in the early days of recombinant DNA,
3782580	3786500	where that community recognized the dangers
3786500	3789780	of what it was doing and put in place a regime
3789780	3791260	to help manage it.
3791260	3794580	And so that led to the kind of research management.
3794940	3798100	MIT has an office that supervises research
3798100	3799860	and it works with the national office.
3799860	3803500	That works if you can identify who's doing it and where.
3803500	3806420	It doesn't work in this world we're describing.
3806420	3808900	So anybody could do this anywhere.
3808900	3813900	And so what we found is you can't contain this,
3814660	3817060	it's already out, you can't forbid
3817060	3819260	because there isn't command and control.
3819260	3821540	The most useful thing you can do
3821540	3824340	is provide incentives for transparency.
3824580	3828380	So, but really the heart of what we do is
3828380	3831500	you could do this by yourself in a basement
3831500	3833900	for nefarious reasons,
3833900	3836140	or you could come into a place in the light
3836140	3837900	where you get help and you get community
3837900	3839580	and you get resources.
3839580	3842540	And there's an incentive to do it in the open,
3842540	3843500	not in the dark.
3843500	3846300	And that might sound naive,
3846300	3850220	but in the sort of places we're working,
3850260	3855260	so again, bad people do bad things in these places already,
3856460	3860780	but providing openness and providing transparency
3860780	3862460	is a key part of managing these.
3862460	3865860	And so it transitions from regulating risks
3865860	3870060	as regulation to soft power to manage them.
3870060	3872020	So there's so much potential for good,
3872020	3875340	so much capacity for good that Fab Labs
3875420	3880420	and the ability and the tools of creation
3881220	3882820	really unlock that potential.
3884260	3888140	Yeah, and I don't say that as sort of dewy-eyed naive,
3888140	3891100	I say that empirically from just years
3891100	3892740	of seeing how this plays out in communities.
3892740	3895340	I wonder if it's the early days of personal computers though,
3895340	3897420	before we get spam, right?
3897420	3900700	In the end, most fundamentally,
3901660	3905340	literally the mother of all problems
3905340	3909820	is who designed us.
3909820	3913900	So assume success
3913900	3915860	in that we're gonna transition to the machines,
3915860	3917060	making the machines,
3917060	3920300	and all of these new sort of social systems we're describing
3920300	3923660	will help manage them and curate them and democratize them.
3925620	3928580	If we close the gap I just let off with
3928740	3933580	of 10 to the 10 to 10 to the 18 between Chip Fab and you,
3934660	3937820	we're ultimately in marrying communication,
3937820	3939340	computation, and fabrication
3939340	3942260	gonna be able to create unimaginable complexity.
3944700	3948260	And how do you design that?
3948260	3953260	And so I'd say the deepest of all questions
3953860	3957820	that I've been working on is,
3957820	3960540	goes back to the oldest part of our genome.
3960540	3965540	So in our genome, what are called Hox genes,
3966140	3969700	and these are morphogenes,
3970620	3975620	and nowhere in your genome is the number five.
3976340	3979580	It doesn't store the fact that you have five fingers.
3979580	3982460	What it stores is what's called a developmental program.
3982460	3984300	It's a series of steps,
3984300	3986820	and the steps have the character of like,
3986820	3990460	grow up a gradient or break symmetry.
3990460	3992580	And at the end of that developmental program,
3992580	3994540	you have five fingers.
3994540	3999540	So you are stored not as a body plan,
4001380	4004540	but as a growth plan.
4004540	4006540	And there's two reasons for that.
4006540	4009660	One reason is just compression.
4009700	4013980	Billions of genes can place trillions of cells,
4013980	4017460	but the much deeper one is evolution
4017460	4020420	doesn't randomly perturb.
4020420	4022700	Almost anything you did randomly in the genome
4022700	4026980	would be fatal or inconsequential, but not interesting.
4026980	4031080	But when you modify things in these developmental programs,
4031080	4034260	you go from like webs for swimming to fingers,
4034260	4037220	or you go from walking to wings for flying.
4037220	4039740	It's a space in which search is interesting.
4039740	4044740	So this is the heart of the success of AI.
4046940	4050700	In part, it was the scaling we talked about a while ago.
4050700	4053940	And in part, it was the representations
4053940	4057060	for which search is effective.
4058380	4061620	AI has found good representations.
4061620	4063060	It hasn't found new ways to search,
4063060	4065540	but it's found good representations of search.
4065900	4067300	You're saying that's what biology,
4067300	4069860	that's what evolution has done,
4069860	4072580	is creative representations, structures,
4072580	4076260	biological structures through which search is effective.
4076260	4080340	And so the developmental programs in the genome
4081140	4085420	beautifully encapsulate the lessons of AI.
4085420	4088700	And it's molecular intelligence.
4088700	4091740	It's AI embodied in our genome.
4091980	4096500	It's every bit as profound as the cognition in our brain,
4096500	4100660	but now this is sort of thinking in molecular thinking
4100660	4102460	in how you design.
4102460	4107140	And so I'd say the most fundamental problem we're working on
4107140	4109740	is it's kind of tautological
4109740	4113420	that when you design a phone, you design the phone.
4113420	4115340	You represent the design of the phone.
4115340	4117380	But that actually fails when you get
4117380	4120420	to the sort of complexity that we're talking about.
4120420	4123500	And so there's this profound transition to come.
4123500	4126300	Once I can have self-reproducing assemblers
4126300	4128580	placing 10 to the 18 parts,
4129420	4134420	you need to not sort of metaphorically, but create life
4135220	4138660	in that you need to learn how to evolve.
4138660	4141820	But evolutionary design has a really misleading,
4141820	4144460	trivial meaning.
4144460	4148500	It's not as simple as you randomly mutate things.
4148500	4152100	It's this much more deep embodiment of AI
4152100	4153820	and morphogenesis.
4153820	4157340	Is there a way for us to continue the kind of evolutionary
4157340	4159020	design that led us to this place
4159020	4161820	from the early days of bacteria, single cell organism,
4161820	4164500	to ribosomes and the 20 amino acids?
4164500	4166900	You mean for human augmentation or?
4166900	4168060	For life augment.
4168060	4170620	I mean, what would you call assemblers
4170620	4172620	that are self-replicating and placing parts?
4172620	4173460	What is that?
4174460	4179460	The dynamic complex things built with digital fabrication.
4179860	4180700	What is that?
4180700	4181540	That's life.
4181540	4184180	Yeah, so ultimately, absolutely,
4185420	4187580	if you add up everything I'm talking about,
4187580	4191500	it's building up to creating life in non-living materials.
4191500	4196100	And I don't view this as copying life.
4196100	4198260	I view it as driving life.
4198260	4200780	I didn't start from how does biology work
4200780	4202660	and then I'm gonna copy it.
4202700	4205980	I start from how to solve problems
4205980	4209700	and then it leads me to, in a sense, rediscover biology.
4209700	4213060	So if we go back to Valentina in Ghana
4213060	4215100	making her circuit board,
4215100	4217140	she still needs a chip fab very far away
4217140	4219900	to make the processor on her circuit board.
4219900	4222700	For her to make the processor locally
4222700	4224820	for all the reasons we described,
4224820	4226980	you actually need the deep things
4226980	4229380	we were just talking about.
4229380	4232140	And so it really does lead you.
4232140	4237140	So there's a wonderful series of books by Gingery.
4238540	4241180	Book one is how to make a charcoal furnace
4241180	4244700	and at the end of book seven, you have a machine shop.
4244700	4247820	So it's sort of how you do your own
4247820	4250340	personal industrial revolution.
4250340	4255020	ISRU is what NASA calls in situ resource utilization.
4255020	4256740	And that's how do you go to a planet
4256740	4259860	and create a civilization?
4259860	4262820	ISRU has essentially assumed Gingery.
4262820	4264860	You go through the industrial revolution
4264860	4268540	and you create the inventory of 100,000 resistors.
4268540	4270500	What we're finding is the way,
4270500	4273660	the minimum building blocks for a civilization
4273660	4276900	is roughly 20 parts.
4276900	4278780	So what's interesting about the amino acids
4278780	4280380	is they're not interesting.
4280380	4283780	They're hydrophobic or hydrophilic, basic or acidic.
4283780	4286420	They have typical but not extremal properties
4286420	4289700	but they're good enough you can combine them to make you.
4289740	4293020	So what this is leading towards is technology
4293020	4296980	doesn't need enormous global supply chains.
4296980	4300180	It just needs about 20 properties you can compose
4300180	4303780	to create all technology as the minimum building blocks
4303780	4305940	for a technological civilization.
4305940	4309460	So there's going to be 20 basic building blocks
4309460	4312940	based on which the self-replicating assemblers can work.
4312940	4315220	Right, and I say that not philosophically,
4315220	4318420	just empirically, sort of that's where it's heading.
4318420	4321780	And I like thinking about
4321780	4324860	how you bootstrap a civilization on Mars, that problem.
4324860	4327260	There's a fun video on bonus material for the movie
4327260	4330580	where we're with a neat group of people we talk about it
4330580	4332740	because it has really profound implications
4332740	4335300	back here on earth about how we live sustainably.
4336340	4338740	What does that civilization on Mars looks like
4338740	4340940	that's using ISRU,
4340940	4344140	that's using these 20 building blocks and does self-assembly?
4344140	4347220	Yeah, go through primary secondary tertiary, quaternary.
4348860	4353860	You extract properties like conducting, insulating,
4354060	4359060	semi-conducting, magnetic, dielectric, flexural.
4360700	4363060	These are the kind of roughly 20 properties.
4364380	4369380	With those, those are enough for us to assemble logic
4371140	4373540	and they're enough for us to assemble actuation.
4374500	4378700	With logic and actuation, we can make micro-robots.
4379780	4383300	The micro-robots can build bigger robots.
4383300	4387620	The bigger robots can then take the building block materials
4387620	4389460	and make the structural elements
4389460	4392500	that you then do to make construction
4392500	4394060	and then you boot up through the stages
4394060	4396380	of a technological civilization.
4396380	4400540	By the way, where in the span of logic and actuation
4400540	4402380	did the sensing come in?
4402380	4403500	Oh, I skipped over that.
4403500	4408500	But my favorite sensor is a step response.
4408540	4411260	So if you just make a step
4411260	4413740	and measure the response to the electric field,
4414900	4417220	that ranges from user interfaces
4417220	4420020	to positioning to material properties.
4420020	4423300	And if you do it at higher frequencies, you get chemistry.
4423300	4425380	And you can get all of that just from a step
4425380	4426860	in an electric field.
4426860	4431860	So for example, once you have time resolution in logic,
4431940	4434620	something as simple as two electrodes
4434620	4438220	let you do amazingly capable sensing.
4438220	4440660	So we've been talking about all the work I do.
4440660	4444380	There's a story about how it happens.
4444380	4446500	Where do ideas come from?
4446500	4447540	That's an interesting story.
4447540	4448580	Where do ideas come from?
4448580	4452180	So I had mentioned Vannevar Bush
4452180	4456980	and he wrote a really influential thing
4456980	4458540	called the Endless Frontier.
4458580	4462260	So science won World War II.
4462260	4466380	The more known story is Nuclear Bombs.
4466380	4468940	The less well-known story is the Rad Lab.
4468940	4472700	So at MIT, an amazing group of people invented radar
4472700	4475300	which is really credited as winning the war.
4475300	4479500	So after the war, a grand old man from MIT
4479500	4484500	and it was charged with science won the war,
4484780	4488300	how do we maintain that edge?
4488300	4491620	And the report he wrote led to
4491620	4493540	the National Science Foundation
4493540	4495420	and the modern notion we take for granted
4495420	4497140	but didn't really exist before then
4497140	4501640	of public funding of research or research agencies.
4502620	4506100	In it, he made again what I consider
4506100	4511100	an important mistake, which is he described basic research
4511100	4515100	leads to applied research, leads to applications,
4515100	4518580	leads to commercialization, leads to impact.
4518580	4522820	And so we need to invest in that pipeline.
4522820	4525980	The reason I considered a mistake
4525980	4530920	is almost all of the examples we've been talking about
4530920	4533320	in my lab went backwards,
4533320	4537580	that the basic research came from applications.
4537580	4541660	And further, almost all of the examples
4541660	4544980	we've been talking about came fundamentally
4545020	4546300	from mistakes.
4546300	4551300	So essentially everything I've ever worked on has failed
4553620	4556140	but in failing, something better happened.
4556140	4560180	So the way I like to describe it is ready, aim, fire
4560180	4564620	is you do your homework, you aim carefully
4564620	4566980	at a target you want to accomplish.
4566980	4568140	And if everything goes right,
4568140	4570300	you then hit the target and succeed.
4571140	4575140	What I do, you can think of as ready, fire, aim.
4575140	4578220	So you do a lot of work to get ready,
4578220	4579960	then you close your eyes
4579960	4582700	and you don't really think about where you're aiming
4582700	4584900	but you look very carefully at where you did aim,
4584900	4589060	where you aim after you fire.
4589060	4591940	And the reason that's so important is
4593460	4594980	if you do ready, aim, fire,
4594980	4598540	there's the best you can hope is hit what you aim at.
4598580	4600580	So let me give you some examples.
4601620	4603580	Because this is a source of great...
4603580	4605500	You're full of good lines today.
4605500	4607220	...source of great frustration.
4607220	4611300	So I mentioned the early quantum computing.
4611300	4614740	So quantum computing is this power of using quantum mechanics
4614740	4616860	to make computers that for some problems
4616860	4621020	are dramatically more powerful than classical computers.
4621020	4622780	Before it started,
4622780	4625260	there was a really interesting group of people
4625260	4629540	who knew a lot about physics and computing
4629540	4632620	that were inventing what became quantum computing
4632620	4634180	before it was clear anything,
4634180	4635620	there was an opportunity there.
4635620	4638380	It was just studying how those relate.
4638380	4641020	Here's how it fits to the ready, fire, aim,
4641020	4644280	in that I was doing really short-term work in my lab
4644280	4645980	on shoplifting tags.
4647580	4650980	This was really before there was modern RFID.
4650980	4655460	And so how you put tags in objects to sense them,
4655460	4657540	something we just take for granted commercially.
4657540	4659660	And there was a problem of how you can sense
4659660	4661540	multiple objects at the same time.
4662980	4667980	And so I was studying how you can remotely sense materials
4668740	4670300	to make low-cost tags
4670300	4673740	that could let you distinguish multiple objects simultaneously.
4673740	4675980	To do that, you need non-linearity
4675980	4678260	so that the signal is modulated.
4679260	4682980	And so I was looking for material sources of non-linearity
4682980	4687980	and that led me to look at how nuclear spins interact,
4689660	4693060	just for spin resonance,
4693060	4697380	the sort of things you use when you go in an MRI machine.
4697380	4699460	And so I was studying how to use that.
4699460	4701980	And it turns out that it was a bad idea.
4701980	4706980	You couldn't remotely use it for shoplifting tags.
4708380	4711260	But I realized you could compute.
4711260	4716260	And so with a group of colleagues thinking
4716780	4718060	about early quantum computing,
4718060	4719980	like David D. Vincenzo and Charlie Bennett
4719980	4723220	was articulating what are the properties you need to compute?
4723220	4725500	And then looking at how to make the tags,
4725500	4728300	it turns out the tags were a terrible idea
4728300	4733300	for sensing objects in a supermarket checkout.
4734260	4736500	But I realized they were computing.
4736500	4738580	So with Ike Chuang and a few other people,
4738580	4742220	we realized we could program nuclear spins to compute.
4742220	4745700	And so that's what we used to do Grover's search algorithm
4745700	4748980	and then it was used for a Shores factoring algorithm.
4748980	4750260	And it worked out,
4750260	4752940	the systems we did it in nuclear magnetic resonance
4752940	4755860	don't scale beyond a few qubits,
4755860	4758180	but the techniques have lived on.
4758180	4762020	And so all the current quantum computing techniques
4762020	4766460	grew out of the ways we would talk to these spins,
4766460	4768340	but I'm telling this whole story
4768340	4772260	because it came from a bad way to make a shoplifting tag.
4772260	4774020	Starting with an application,
4774020	4777900	mistakes led to break through fundamental science.
4777900	4779420	I mean, can you just link on that?
4779420	4783620	I mean, just using nuclear spins to do computation
4783620	4788620	that like what gave you the guts to try
4789100	4793100	to think through this from a digital fabrication perspective
4793100	4795020	actually, how to leap from one to the other.
4795020	4795900	I wouldn't call it guts.
4795900	4797140	I would call it collaboration.
4797140	4802140	So at IBM, there was this amazing group of like,
4802620	4805060	I mentioned Charlie Bennett and David DiVincenzo
4805060	4807260	and Ralph Landau and Nabil Amir.
4807260	4810740	And these were all gods of thinking
4810740	4813060	about physics and computing.
4813060	4818060	So I yelled at the whole computer industry
4818220	4822900	being based on a fiction, metropolis.
4822900	4824340	Programmers frolicking in the garden
4824380	4826420	while somebody moves levers in the basement.
4826420	4828820	There's a complete parallel history
4828820	4833820	of Maxwell de Boltzmann does a lard
4833940	4837140	to Landau or to Bennett.
4837140	4839300	Most people won't know most of these names,
4839300	4842060	but this whole parallel history thinking deeply
4842060	4844420	about how computation and physics relate.
4844420	4848780	So I was collaborating with that whole group of people.
4848780	4853460	And then at MIT, I was in this high traffic environment.
4853460	4856380	I wasn't deeply inspired to think about better ways
4856380	4860180	to detect shoplifting tags, but stumbled across companies
4860180	4862740	that needed help with that and was thinking about it.
4862740	4865260	And then I realized those two worlds intersected
4865260	4867740	and we could use the failed approach
4867740	4872740	for the shoplifting tags to make early quantum computing
4873860	4874700	algorithms.
4874700	4876300	And this kind of stumbling is fundamental
4876300	4878140	to the fab lab idea, right?
4878140	4878980	Right.
4878980	4880040	Here's one more example.
4880040	4883060	With a student, Manu, we talked about ribosomes
4883060	4884940	and I was trying to build a ribosome
4886060	4889820	that worked on fluids so that I could place
4889820	4891900	the little parts we're talking about.
4891900	4895540	And it kept failing because bubbles would come
4895540	4897380	into our system and the bubbles would make
4897380	4899020	the whole thing stop working.
4899020	4900740	And we spent about half a year trying to get rid
4900740	4902340	of the bubbles.
4902340	4904220	Then Manu said, wait a minute,
4904220	4907340	the bubbles are actually better than what we're doing.
4907340	4908780	We should just use the bubbles.
4908780	4912460	And so we invented how to do universal object
4913460	4915740	logic with little bubbles and fluid.
4915740	4919700	Okay, you have to explain this microfluidic bubble logic.
4919700	4921060	Please, how does this work?
4921060	4923900	So, yeah, it's super interesting.
4923900	4926580	Yeah, and so I'll come back and explain it.
4926580	4930660	But what it led to was we showed fluids could do,
4932100	4933940	it'd been known fluid could do logic.
4933940	4937540	Like your old automobile transmissions do logic,
4937540	4938660	but that's macroscopic.
4938660	4939980	It didn't work at little scales.
4939980	4940980	We showed with these bubbles,
4941020	4942860	we could do it at little scales.
4942860	4944580	Then I'm gonna come back and explain it.
4944580	4947380	But what came out of that is Manu then showed
4947380	4951060	you could make a 50 cent microscope using little bubbles.
4951060	4953820	And then the techniques we developed
4953820	4956500	are what we used to transplant genomes
4956500	4959940	to make synthetic life all came out of the failure
4959940	4963740	of trying to make the genome, the ribosome.
4963740	4966620	Now, so the way the bubble logic works is
4967620	4972620	in a little channel, fluid at small scales
4974700	4976780	is fairly viscous.
4976780	4980180	It's sort of like pushing Jell-O, think of it as.
4981820	4986820	If a bubble gets stuck, the fluid has to detour around it.
4987980	4992980	So now imagine a channel that has two wells and one bubble.
4993780	4995660	If the bubble is in one well,
4995660	4998340	the fluid has to go in the other channel.
4998340	4999620	If the fluid is in the other well,
4999620	5001780	it has to go in the first channel.
5001780	5006780	So the position of the bubble can switch,
5007700	5010820	it's a switch, it can switch the fluid between two channels.
5010820	5013020	So now we have one element, a switch.
5013020	5015260	And it's also a memory because you can detect
5015260	5017740	whether or not a bubble is stored there.
5017740	5021100	Then if two bubbles meet,
5021980	5024860	if you have two channels crossing,
5024860	5026780	a bubble can go through one way
5026780	5028700	or a bubble can go through the other way.
5028700	5031380	But if two bubbles come together,
5031380	5033700	then they push on each other and one goes one way
5033700	5035100	and one goes the other way.
5035100	5038180	That's a logic operation, that's a logic gate.
5038180	5039940	So we now have a switch, we have a memory
5039940	5040980	and we have a logic gate,
5040980	5042180	and that's everything you need to make
5042180	5043940	a universal computer.
5043940	5046300	I mean, the fact that you did that with bubbles
5046300	5050220	and microfluid just kind of,
5050260	5052180	kind of brilliant.
5052180	5054860	Well, so to stay with that example,
5056620	5060100	what we proposed to do was to make a fluid ribosome
5060100	5063300	and the project crashed and burned, it was a disaster.
5064500	5066220	This is what came out of it.
5066220	5070700	And so it was precisely ready fire aim
5070700	5072820	in that we had to do a lot of homework
5072820	5076020	to be able to make these microfluidic systems.
5076020	5078980	The fire part was we didn't think too hard
5078980	5080060	about making the ribosome,
5080060	5081500	we just tried to do it.
5081500	5083860	The aim part was we realized the ribosome failed
5083860	5085540	but something better had happened.
5085540	5088740	And if you look all across research funding,
5088740	5093460	research management, it doesn't anticipate this.
5093460	5096340	So fail fast is familiar,
5096340	5101100	but fail fast tends to miss ready and aim.
5101100	5102220	You can't just fail.
5102220	5105260	You have to do your homework before the fail part
5105260	5108060	and you have to do the aim part after the fail part.
5108100	5109980	And so the whole language of research
5109980	5112180	is about like milestones and deliverables.
5112180	5114980	That works when you're going down a straight line
5114980	5117580	but it doesn't work for this kind of discovery.
5117580	5120220	And to leap to something you said that's really important
5120220	5123940	is I view part of what the fab lab network is doing
5123940	5128940	is giving more people the opportunity to fail.
5129020	5134020	You've said that geometry is really important in biology.
5135020	5139900	What does fabrication biology look like?
5139900	5141820	Why is geometry important?
5141820	5146420	So molecular biology is dominated by geometry.
5146420	5148420	That's why the protein folding is so important
5148420	5153220	that the geometry gives the function.
5153220	5156980	And there's this hierarchical construction
5156980	5159220	of as you go through primary, secondary, tertiary,
5160220	5163300	the shapes of the molecules
5163300	5165900	make the shape of the molecular machines.
5165900	5167980	And they really are exquisite machines.
5167980	5172980	If you look at how your muscles move,
5173620	5175540	if you were to see a simulation of it,
5175540	5179940	it would look like a improbable science fiction cyborg world
5179940	5182300	of these little walking robots
5182300	5184060	that walk on a discrete lattice
5184060	5186220	that they're really exquisite machines.
5186220	5189460	And then from there, this whole hierarchical stack
5189460	5192220	of once you get to the top of that,
5192220	5196020	you then start making organelles that make cells
5196020	5199420	that make organs through the stack of that hierarchy.
5201260	5203540	Just stepping back, does it amaze you
5203540	5205380	that from small building blocks
5205380	5209300	where amino acids you mentioned, molecules,
5209300	5211420	let's go to the very beginning of hydrogen and helium
5211420	5213060	at the start of this universe,
5213100	5217580	that we're able to build up such complex
5217580	5220740	and beautiful things like our human brain.
5220740	5224780	So studying thermodynamics,
5225660	5230660	which is exactly the question of batteries run out
5232420	5237420	and need recharging, equipment, cars get old and fail,
5237980	5242980	cars get old and fail, yet life doesn't.
5243380	5246420	And that's why there's a sense
5246420	5248860	in which life seems to violate thermodynamics,
5248860	5250140	although of course it doesn't.
5250140	5253340	It seems to resist the March towards entropy somehow.
5253340	5256500	Right, and so Maxwell,
5256500	5260900	who helped give rise to the science of thermodynamics,
5260900	5265620	posited a problem that was so infuriating,
5265660	5268100	it led to a series of suicides.
5268100	5272460	There was a series of advisors and advisees,
5273780	5276700	three in a row that all ended up committing suicide
5276700	5279140	that happened to work on this problem.
5279140	5284140	And Maxwell's demon is this simple but infamous problem
5287580	5291620	where right now in this room we're surrounded by molecules
5291620	5293620	and they run at different velocities.
5294540	5298540	Imagine a container that has a wall
5298540	5301660	and it's got gas on both sides and a little door.
5301660	5306060	And if the door is a molecular sized creature
5306060	5308340	and it could watch the molecules coming
5308340	5311380	and when a fast molecule is coming, it opens the door.
5311380	5313940	When a slow molecule is coming, it closes the door.
5314860	5318180	After it does that for a while, one side is hot,
5318180	5319220	one is cold.
5319220	5322700	When something is hot and it's cold, you can make an engine.
5322700	5325980	And so you close that, you make an engine and you make energy.
5327220	5331660	So the demon is violating thermodynamics
5331660	5335140	because it's never touching the molecule.
5336100	5338660	Yet by just opening and closing the door,
5338660	5343660	it can make arbitrary amounts of energy and power a machine.
5343660	5345380	And in thermodynamics, you can't do that.
5345380	5346740	So that's Maxwell's demon.
5347020	5353020	That problem is connected to everything we just spoke about
5353020	5354300	for the last few hours.
5354300	5365300	So Leo Zalard around early 1900s was a deep physicist
5365300	5373300	who then had a lot to do with also post-war anti-nuclear things.
5373860	5378780	But he reduced Maxwell's demon to a single molecule.
5378780	5381740	So the molecule, there's only one molecule
5381740	5384940	and the question is which side of the partition is it on.
5384940	5388980	That led to the idea of one bit of information.
5388980	5393580	So Shannon credited Zalard's analysis of Maxwell's demon
5393580	5395380	for the invention of the bit.
5397140	5400940	For many years, people tried to explain Maxwell's demon
5400940	5405780	by like the energy in the demon looking at the molecule
5405780	5408500	or the energy to open and close the door
5408500	5411060	and nothing ever made sense.
5411060	5414540	Finally, Rolf Landauer, one of the colleagues
5414540	5418380	I mentioned at IBM, finally solved the problem.
5419260	5423940	He showed that you can explain Maxwell's demon
5423940	5427140	by you need the mind of the demon.
5427660	5432940	When the demon open and closes the door,
5432940	5435340	as long as it remembers what it did,
5435340	5438740	you can run the whole thing backwards.
5438740	5445140	But when the demon forgets, then you can't run it backwards
5445140	5449140	and that's where you get dissipation
5449140	5451940	and that's where you get the violation of thermodynamics.
5451940	5454540	And so the explanation of Maxwell's demon
5454540	5456740	is that it's in the demon's brain.
5457540	5462300	So then Rolf's colleague, Charlie at IBM,
5463580	5467380	then shock Rolf by showing you can compute
5467380	5470100	with arbitrarily low energy.
5470100	5473260	So one of the things that's not well covered
5473260	5478260	is the big computers used for big machine learning,
5479180	5482100	the data centers use tens of megawatts of power,
5482100	5483820	they use as much power as a city.
5484820	5487780	Charlie showed you can actually compute
5487780	5490860	with arbitrarily low amounts of energy
5490860	5493140	by making computers that can go backwards
5493140	5494540	as well as forwards.
5495740	5499180	And what limits the speed of the computer
5499180	5502380	is how fast you want an answer
5502380	5505100	and how certain you want the answer to be.
5505100	5507500	But we're orders of magnitude away from that.
5507500	5510380	So I have a student Cameron working with Lincoln Labs
5510380	5513180	on making superconducting computers
5513180	5516860	that operate near this land hour limit
5516860	5518900	that are orders of magnitude more efficient.
5520220	5521900	So stepping back to all of that,
5521900	5525700	that whole tour was driven by your question about life.
5525700	5530060	And right at the heart of it is Maxwell's demon.
5530060	5534380	Life exists because it can locally violate thermodynamics.
5534380	5536500	It can locally violate thermodynamics
5536500	5541500	because of intelligence and it's molecular intelligence
5541660	5545740	that I would even go out on a limb to say,
5545740	5548180	we can already see we're beginning to come
5548180	5552260	to the end of this current AI phase.
5552260	5554020	So depending on how you count,
5554020	5556940	this is I'd say the fifth AI boom bus cycle.
5557900	5560180	And you can already, it's exploding,
5560180	5562860	but you can already see where it's heading,
5562860	5566900	how it's going to saturate what happens on the far side.
5567900	5570940	The big thing that's not yet on horizons
5570940	5575940	is embodied AI, molecular intelligence.
5576220	5578980	So to step back to this AI story,
5580860	5585100	there was automation and that was gonna change everything.
5585100	5587100	Then there were expert systems.
5589780	5593980	There was then the first phase of the neural network systems.
5593980	5596580	There've been about five of these
5596580	5599340	in each case on the slope up,
5599340	5601020	it's gonna change everything.
5601820	5604800	Each case what happens is on the slope down,
5605940	5608340	we sort of move the goal posts
5608340	5609940	and it becomes sort of irrelevant.
5609940	5613260	So a good example is going up,
5613260	5615340	computer chess was gonna change everything.
5615340	5616620	Once computers could play chess,
5616620	5618540	that fundamentally changes the world.
5618540	5621540	Now on the downside, computers play chess.
5621540	5624460	Winning at chess is no longer seen as a unique human thing,
5624460	5628180	but people still play chess.
5628180	5631260	This new phase is gonna take a new chunk of things
5631260	5633020	that we thought computers couldn't do.
5633020	5634500	Now computers will be able to do,
5634500	5636420	they have roughly our brain capacity,
5637860	5641180	but we'll keep thinking as well as computers.
5642300	5643740	And as I described,
5643740	5646060	while we've been going through these five boom busts,
5646060	5648500	if you just look at the numbers of ops per second,
5648500	5650660	bits storage, bits of IO,
5650660	5651940	that's the more interesting one.
5651940	5652940	That's been steady,
5652940	5654980	and that's what finally caught up to people.
5654980	5657940	But as we've talked about a couple of times,
5657940	5660740	there's eight orders of magnitude to go,
5660740	5664180	not in the intelligence in the transistors or in the brain,
5664180	5665860	but in the embodied intelligence,
5665860	5667500	in the intelligence in our body.
5667500	5670540	So the intelligent constructions of physical systems
5670540	5672700	that would embody the intelligence
5672700	5674860	versus contain it within the computation.
5674860	5678220	Right, and there's a brain centrism
5678260	5682900	that assumes our intelligence is centered in our brain.
5682900	5685260	And in endless ways in this conversation,
5685260	5687500	we've been talking about molecular intelligence.
5687500	5691700	Our molecular systems do a deep kind
5691700	5693100	of artificial intelligence.
5693100	5696700	All the things you think of as artificial intelligence does
5696700	5701780	in representing knowledge, storing knowledge,
5701780	5704620	searching over knowledge, adapting to knowledge,
5704620	5706860	our molecular systems do,
5706860	5711100	but the output isn't just a thought, it's us.
5711100	5713060	It's the evolution of us.
5713060	5717820	And the real horizon to come is now embodying AI,
5717820	5720820	of not just a processor and a robot,
5720820	5725820	but building systems that really can grow and evolve.
5727460	5729660	So we've been speaking about this boundary
5729660	5731860	between bits and atoms.
5731860	5734820	So let me ask you about one of the big mysteries
5734820	5735980	of consciousness.
5736900	5741900	Do you think it comes from somewhere between that boundary?
5741900	5743820	I won't name names,
5743820	5747340	but if you know who I'm talking about, it's probably clear.
5747340	5752340	I once did a drive, in fact, up to the Mussolini era villa
5752460	5755860	outside Torino in the early days
5755860	5760860	of what became quantum computing with a famous person
5761740	5764500	who thinks about quantum mechanics and consciousness.
5764500	5767780	And we had the most infuriating conversation
5767780	5772780	that went roughly along the lines of consciousness is weird,
5774940	5777340	quantum mechanics is weird,
5777340	5780580	therefore quantum mechanics explains consciousness.
5780580	5784380	That was roughly the logical process.
5784380	5786180	And you're not satisfied with that process?
5786180	5789620	No, and I say that very precisely in the following sense.
5789620	5792900	I was a program manager somewhat by accident
5792940	5797940	in a DARPA program on quantum biology.
5798620	5803620	And so biology trivially uses quantum mechanics
5804140	5805860	and that were made out of atoms,
5805860	5809420	but the distinction is in quantum computing,
5809420	5813220	quantum information, you need quantum coherence.
5813220	5817900	And there's a lot of muddled thinking about like collapse
5817900	5820620	of the wave function and claims of quantum computing
5820660	5824700	that garbles just quantum coherence.
5824700	5829180	That you can think of it as a wave
5829180	5830620	that has very special properties,
5830620	5832820	but these wave-like properties.
5832820	5836700	And so there's a small set of places
5836700	5841140	where biology uses quantum mechanics in that deeper sense.
5841140	5846140	One is how light is converted to energy in photo systems.
5847420	5849300	It looks like one is all faction,
5849300	5851860	how your nose is able to tell different smells.
5853300	5857260	Probably one has to do with how birds navigate,
5858300	5860140	how they sense magnetic fields.
5861340	5864660	That involves a coupling between a very weak energy
5864660	5868100	with a magnetic field, coupling into chemical reactions.
5868100	5870780	And there's a beautiful system.
5871900	5876180	Standard in chemistry is magnetic fields
5876180	5878220	like this can influence chemistry,
5878220	5880060	but there are biological circuits
5880060	5882260	that are carefully balanced with two pathways
5882260	5884620	that become unbalanced with magnetic fields.
5884620	5888020	So each of these areas are expensive for biology.
5888020	5889740	It has to consume resources
5889740	5891540	to use quantum mechanics in this way.
5892620	5894620	So those are places where we know
5894620	5896700	there's quantum mechanics in biology.
5896700	5900300	In cognition, there's just no evidence.
5902460	5907460	There's no evidence of anything quantum mechanical going on
5907740	5909540	in how cognition works.
5909540	5910740	Consciousness.
5910740	5913700	Well, I'm saying cognition, I'm not saying consciousness,
5913700	5917220	but to get from cognition to consciousness.
5918100	5921780	So McCullough and Pitts made a model of neurons.
5922980	5927780	That led to perceptrons that then through a couple
5927780	5931180	of boom busts led to deep learning.
5931180	5933980	One of the interesting things about that sequence is
5933980	5937500	it diverged off so deep neural networks
5937500	5940180	used in machine learning,
5940180	5943260	diverged from trying to understand how the brain works.
5944660	5949100	What makes them work, what's emerged is,
5949100	5950780	it's a really interesting story.
5950780	5953140	This may be too much of a technical detail,
5953140	5955300	but it has to do with function approximation.
5955300	5958660	That we talked about exponentials.
5958660	5963660	A deep network needs an exponentially larger
5964140	5967220	shallow network to do the same function.
5967220	5969860	And that exponential is what gives the power
5969860	5971500	to deep networks.
5971500	5974820	But what's interesting is the sort of lessons
5974820	5977460	about building these deep architectures
5977460	5981340	and how to train them have really interesting echoes
5981340	5983340	to how brains work.
5983340	5985340	And there's an interesting conversation
5985340	5988220	that's sort of coming back of neuroscientists
5988220	5990380	looking over the shoulder of people training
5990380	5992780	these deep networks, seeing interesting echoes
5992780	5996700	for how the brain works, interesting parallels with it.
5996700	6001580	And so I didn't say consciousness, I just said cognition,
6001580	6005220	but I don't know any experimental evidence
6005220	6007580	that points to anything in neurobiology
6007580	6010100	that says we need quantum mechanics.
6010100	6015100	And I view the question about whether a large language model
6015380	6020380	is conscious as silly in that biology is full of hacks
6028420	6029500	and it works.
6030460	6034140	There's no evidence we have that there's anything deeper
6034140	6037100	going on than just this sort of stacking up
6037100	6038420	of hacks in the brain.
6038420	6040860	And somehow consciousness is one of the hacks
6040860	6042740	or an emergent property of the hacks.
6042740	6043580	Absolutely.
6043580	6047980	And just numerically, I said big computations now
6047980	6050540	have the degrees of freedom of the brain.
6050540	6053300	And they're showing a lot of the phenomenology
6053300	6057140	of what we think is properties of what a brain can do.
6059820	6062420	And I don't see any reason to invoke anything else.
6062420	6064940	That makes you wonder what kind of beautiful stuff
6064940	6066900	digital fabrication will create.
6066900	6069500	If biology created a few hacks on top of which
6069500	6072500	consciousness and cognition, some of the things
6072500	6075460	we love about human beings was created.
6075460	6079980	It makes you wonder what kind of beauty in the complexity
6079980	6081940	can create digital fabrication.
6081940	6083700	There's an early peek at that,
6083700	6086740	which is there's a misleading term,
6086740	6089220	which is generative design.
6089220	6092820	Generative design is where you don't tell a computer
6092820	6093820	how to design something.
6093820	6096420	You tell the computer what you want it to do.
6096420	6098020	That doesn't work.
6098020	6100940	That only works in limited subdomains.
6101020	6104060	You can't do really complex functionality that way.
6104060	6106100	The one place it's matured, though,
6106100	6108580	is topology optimization for structure.
6108580	6112260	So let's say you wanted to make a bicycle or a table.
6113620	6115860	You describe the loads on it
6115860	6117860	and it figures out how to design it.
6117860	6121620	And what it makes are beautiful, organic-looking things.
6121620	6124500	These are things that look like they grew in a forest.
6124500	6127100	And they look like they grew in a forest
6127100	6128940	because that's sort of exactly what they are,
6128940	6132900	that they're solving the ways of how you handle loads
6132900	6134260	in the same way biology does.
6134260	6136500	And so you get things that look like trees
6136500	6137820	and shells and all of that.
6137820	6139980	And so that's a peek at this transition
6139980	6144980	from we design to we teach the machines how to design.
6147060	6148060	What can you say about,
6148060	6150540	because you mentioned cellular automata earlier,
6150540	6152540	about from this example you just gave,
6152540	6154380	and in general the observation you can make
6154380	6155820	by looking at cellular automata,
6155820	6160380	that from simple rules and simple building blocks
6160380	6163540	can emerge arbitrary complexity.
6163540	6168540	Do you understand what that is, how that can be leveraged?
6168740	6173740	So understand what it is is much easier than it sounds.
6174340	6175980	I complained about Turing's machine
6175980	6177340	making a physics mistake,
6177340	6181660	but Turing never intended it to be a computer architecture.
6181660	6186340	He used it just to prove results about uncomputability.
6187420	6190900	What Turing did on what his computation is exquisite
6190900	6192700	is gorgeous.
6192700	6196420	He gave us our notion of computational universality
6196420	6199740	and something that sounds deep
6199740	6204740	and turns out to be trivial is it's really easy
6205060	6209300	to show almost everything is computationally universal.
6209300	6213340	So Norm Margolis wrote a beautiful paper
6214820	6219180	with Tom Toffoli showing in a cellular automata world
6219180	6221660	is like the game of life
6221660	6223940	where you just move tokens around.
6225580	6228660	They showed that modeling billiard balls
6228660	6232420	on a billiard table with cellular automata
6232420	6233900	is a universal computer.
6234900	6239620	To be universal, you need a persistent state.
6239620	6243020	You need a non-linear operation to interact them
6244700	6248380	and you need connectivity.
6248380	6251420	So that's what you need to show computational universality.
6251420	6255660	So they showed that a CA modeling billiard balls
6255660	6257620	is a universal computer.
6257620	6261780	Chris Moore went on to show that instead of chaos,
6262780	6267140	Turing showed their problems in computation
6267140	6270340	that you can't solve, that they're harder
6270340	6271340	than you can't predict.
6271340	6274700	They're actually in a deep reason that they are unsolvable.
6276140	6279300	Chris Moore showed it's very easy to make physical systems
6279300	6283380	that are uncomputable, that what the physics system does,
6283380	6285500	just bouncing balls and surfaces,
6285500	6288900	you can make systems that solve uncomputable problems.
6288900	6292580	And so almost any non-trivial physical system
6292580	6294740	is computationally universal.
6294740	6297700	So the first part of the answer to your question is,
6297700	6300660	this comes back to my comment about
6300660	6302980	how do you bootstrap a civilization?
6302980	6306780	You just don't need much to be computationally universal.
6306780	6310780	So then there isn't today a notion
6310780	6314100	of like fabricational universality
6314100	6316340	or fabricational complexity.
6316340	6318500	The sort of numbers I've been giving you
6318500	6321900	about you eating lunch versus the chip fab,
6321900	6326580	sort of that, that's in the same spirit of what Shannon did.
6326580	6331580	But once you connect computational universality
6332220	6335340	to kind of fabricational universality,
6335340	6339340	you then get the ability to grow and adapt and evolve.
6340580	6342620	Because that evolution happens in the physical space.
6342620	6345780	Yeah, and so that's why, for me,
6345780	6349820	the heart of this whole conversation is morphogenesis.
6349820	6351980	So just to come back to that,
6353860	6358860	what Turing ended his sadly cut short life studying
6362300	6365700	was how genes give rise to form.
6365700	6369380	So how the small amount of it,
6369380	6371660	relatively it affects small amount of information
6371660	6374020	in the genome can give rise to the complexity
6374020	6375660	of who you are.
6376660	6381660	That's where what resides is this molecular intelligence,
6382660	6384980	which is first how to describe you,
6384980	6389380	but then how to describe you such that you can exist
6389380	6393580	and you can reproduce and you can grow and you can evolve.
6393580	6398580	And so that's the seat of our molecular intelligence.
6398780	6401100	The maker of revolution in biology.
6401100	6405140	Yeah, it really is, it really is.
6405140	6408700	And that's where you can't separate
6408700	6410940	communication, computation and fabrication.
6410940	6413740	You can't separate computer science and physical science.
6413740	6415980	You can't separate hardware and software.
6415980	6418340	They all intersect right at that place.
6419580	6422660	Do you think of our universe as just one giant computation?
6424620	6428860	I would even kind of say quantum computing is overhyped
6428860	6431340	in that there's a few things quantum computing
6431340	6432380	is gonna be good at.
6432380	6434140	One is breaking crypto systems,
6434180	6436100	how to make new crypto systems.
6436100	6439020	What it's really good at is modeling other quantum systems.
6439020	6443300	So for studying nanotechnology, it's gonna be powerful,
6444420	6447220	but quantum computing is not going to disrupt
6447220	6449060	and change everything.
6449060	6453140	But the reason I say that is this interesting group
6453140	6456620	of strange people who helped invent quantum computing
6456620	6459400	before it was clear anything was there.
6460420	6463220	One of the main reasons they did it wasn't
6463260	6466460	to make a computer that can break a crypto system.
6466460	6468900	It was you could turn this backwards.
6468900	6472340	You could be surprised quantum mechanics can compute
6472340	6475300	or you can go in the opposite direction
6475300	6478580	and say if quantum mechanics can compute,
6480060	6481900	that's a description of nature.
6481900	6485660	So physics is written in terms
6485660	6488340	of partial differential equations.
6488340	6491860	That is an information technology
6491860	6495260	from two centuries ago.
6497540	6501260	The equations of physics are not,
6501260	6502740	this would sound very strange to say,
6502740	6504140	but the equations of physics,
6504140	6506180	Schrodinger's equations and Maxwell's equations
6506180	6508820	and all of them are not fundamental.
6508820	6511020	They're a representation of physics
6511020	6513220	that was accessible to us
6513220	6515740	in the era of having a pencil and a piece of paper.
6518380	6521540	They have a fundamental problem
6521540	6525580	which is if you make a dot on a piece of paper
6525580	6528540	in traditional physics theory,
6528540	6531860	there's infinite information in that dot.
6531860	6535360	A point has infinite information.
6536700	6540740	That can't be true because information
6540740	6545740	is a fundamental resource that's connected to energy.
6545980	6549980	And in fact, one of my favorite questions
6549980	6554140	you can ask a cosmologist to trip them up is ask,
6554140	6557780	is information a conserved quantity in the universe?
6557780	6560300	Was all the information created in the Big Bang
6560300	6561980	or can the universe create information?
6561980	6566620	And I've yet to meet a cosmologist who doesn't stutter
6566620	6571620	and not clearly know how to handle that existential question,
6571900	6575220	but sort of putting that to a side,
6575220	6578060	in physics theory, the way it's taught,
6578900	6583260	information comes late.
6583260	6586420	You're taught about X, a variable,
6586420	6588220	which can contain infinite information,
6588220	6590380	but physically that's unrealistic.
6590380	6593940	And so physics theories have to find ways to cut that off.
6593940	6597860	So instead, there are a number of people
6598780	6603220	who start with a theory of the universe
6603220	6606660	should start with information and computation
6606700	6609580	as the fundamental resources that explain nature.
6609580	6611740	And then you build up from that
6611740	6615820	to something that looks like throwing baseballs down a slope.
6615820	6620820	And so in that sense, the work on physics and computation
6622140	6624660	has many applications that we've been talking about,
6624660	6629060	but more deeply, it's really getting at new ways
6629060	6631220	to think about how the universe works.
6631220	6632780	And there are a number of things
6632780	6634860	that are hard to do in traditional physics
6634860	6637580	that make more sense when you start with information
6637580	6641260	and computation as the root of physical theory.
6641260	6642620	So information and computation
6642620	6646060	being the real fundamental thing in the universe.
6646060	6649020	Right, that information is a resource.
6649020	6652900	You can have infinite information in finite space.
6653780	6656340	Information propagates and interacts,
6656340	6658780	and from there you erect the scaffolding of physics.
6658780	6661540	Now it happens, the words I just said
6661540	6664340	look a lot like quantum field theories.
6665620	6667380	But there's an interesting way
6667380	6671060	where instead of starting with differential equations
6671060	6673020	to get to quantum field theories
6673020	6676260	and quantum field theories, you get to quantization.
6678380	6681300	If you start from computation and information,
6681300	6684740	you begin sort of quantized and you build up from there.
6684740	6689300	And so that's the sense in which absolutely,
6689300	6691260	I think about the universe as a computer.
6691300	6694180	The easy way to understand that is
6696100	6698940	just almost anything is computationally universal,
6698940	6701980	but the deep way is it's a real fundamental way
6701980	6703980	to understand how the universe works.
6705940	6707620	Let me go a little bit to the personal
6707620	6710500	and the center of bits and atoms.
6711620	6716620	You have worked with the students you've worked with
6717980	6720460	have gone on to do some incredible things in this world,
6720460	6724500	including build supercomputers that power Facebook
6724500	6725620	and Twitter and so on.
6726500	6728860	What advice would you give to young people?
6728860	6731220	What advice have you given them?
6731220	6734180	How to have one heck of a great career,
6734180	6735740	one heck of a great life?
6735740	6740740	What one important one is if you look at junior faculty
6742340	6745460	trying to get tenure at a place like MIT,
6745460	6748420	the ones who try to figure out how to get tenure
6748420	6750740	are miserable and don't get tenure.
6750740	6753420	And the ones who don't try to figure it out
6753420	6754700	are happy and do get it.
6756700	6759180	You have to love what you're doing and believe in it
6759180	6762980	and nothing else could possibly be
6762980	6764500	what you wanna be doing with your life
6764500	6766580	and it gets you out of bed in the morning.
6766580	6768740	And again, it sounds naive,
6768740	6773740	but within the limited domain I'm describing now
6774300	6777340	of getting tenure at MIT, that's a key attribute to it.
6777340	6782140	And in the same sense, if you take the sort of outliers
6782140	6785900	students were talking about, 99 out of 100 come to me
6785900	6787540	and say your work is very fascinating,
6787540	6791180	I'd be interesting to work for you.
6791180	6795620	And one out of 100 come and say, you're wrong.
6797300	6800020	Here's your mistake, here's what you should have been doing.
6803740	6806540	They just sort of say I'm here and get to work.
6806540	6809860	And again, I don't know how far this resource goes.
6809860	6813780	So I've said, I consider the world's greatest resource,
6813780	6816060	this engine, a bright invent of people
6816060	6819220	of which we only see a tiny little iceberg of it.
6819220	6821100	And everywhere we open these labs,
6821100	6823340	they come out of the woodwork, they come.
6823340	6825940	We didn't create all these educational programs,
6825940	6827740	all these other things I'm describing.
6827740	6831180	We tried to partner everywhere with local schools
6831180	6833660	and local companies and kept tripping over dysfunction
6833660	6835260	and find we had to create the environment
6835260	6836820	where people like this can flourish.
6836820	6840060	And so I don't know if this is everyone,
6840060	6842580	if it's 1% of society, what the fraction is,
6842580	6845620	but it's so many orders of magnitude bigger
6845620	6847020	than we see it today.
6847020	6848380	We've been racing to keep up with it
6848380	6850340	to take advantage of that resource.
6850340	6852220	Something tells me it's a very large fraction
6852220	6853260	of the population.
6853260	6857620	I mean, the thing that gives me most hope for the future
6857620	6858820	is that population.
6858820	6861180	Once a year, this whole lab network meets.
6861180	6864100	And it's my favorite gathering, it's in Bhutan this year,
6864100	6867820	because it's every body shape, it's every language,
6867820	6870020	every geography, but it's the same person
6870020	6871700	in all those packages.
6871700	6876700	It's the same sense of bright invent of joy and discovery.
6876940	6878340	If there's people listening to this
6878340	6881700	and they're just overwhelmed with how exciting this is,
6881700	6884300	which I think they would be, how can they participate,
6884300	6887540	how can they help, how can they encourage young people
6887540	6890940	or themselves to build stuff, to create stuff?
6890940	6891980	Yeah, that's a great question.
6891980	6896980	So this is part of a much bigger maker movement
6898740	6900580	that has a lot of embodiments.
6900580	6903380	The part I've been involved in, this fab lab network,
6903380	6906180	you can think of as a curated part that works as a network.
6906180	6909260	So you don't benefit in a gym
6909260	6911780	if somebody exercises in another gym,
6911780	6914420	but in the fab network, you do, in a sense,
6914420	6916780	benefit when somebody works in another network,
6916780	6919540	another lab in the way it functions as a network.
6919540	6923540	So you can come to cba.mit.edu
6923540	6926340	to see the research we're talking about.
6926340	6929420	There's a fab foundation run by Sherry Lasseter
6929420	6931460	at fabfoundation.org.
6931460	6935320	Fab Labs I.O. is a portal into this lab network.
6936820	6940020	Fabacademy.org is this distributed hands-on
6940020	6941980	educational program.
6941980	6944940	Fab.city is the platform of cities producing
6944940	6945780	what they consume.
6945780	6948620	Those are all nodes in this network.
6948660	6950380	So you can learn with Fabacademy
6950380	6953060	and you can perhaps launch or help launch
6953060	6954700	or participate in launching a fab lab.
6954700	6959220	Well, in particular, from one to a thousand,
6959220	6960740	we carefully counted labs.
6960740	6963100	Now we're going from a thousand to a million
6963100	6965340	where it ceases to become interesting to count them.
6965340	6967300	And in the thousand to the million,
6968300	6972900	what's interesting about that stage is technologically,
6972900	6975300	you go to a lab not to get access to the machine,
6975300	6977940	but you go to the lab to make the machine.
6977940	6980220	But the other thing interesting in it
6980220	6982620	is we have an interesting collaboration
6982620	6986460	on a fab lab in a box.
6986460	6990740	And this came out of a collaboration with SolidWorks
6990740	6994980	on how you can put a fab lab in a box,
6994980	6997820	which is not just the tools, but the knowledge.
6997820	7002100	So you open the box and the box contains the knowledge
7002100	7005660	of how to use it as well as the tools within it
7005660	7007340	so that the knowledge can propagate.
7007340	7008860	And so we have an interesting group of people
7008860	7012020	working on the original fab labs.
7012020	7014020	We have a whole team to get involved
7014020	7016300	in the setting up and training.
7016300	7018740	And the Fabacademy is a real in-depth,
7018740	7021100	deep technical program in the training.
7021100	7025020	But in this next phase, how sort of the lab itself
7025020	7026220	knows how to do the lab.
7029100	7033060	We've talked deeply about the intelligence in fabrication,
7033060	7034620	but in a much more accessible one
7034620	7039540	about how the AI in the lab in effect
7039540	7043380	becomes a collaborator with you in this nearer term
7043380	7044500	to help get started.
7044500	7048380	And for people wanting to connect,
7048380	7051140	it can seem like a big step, a big threshold,
7051140	7052940	but we've gotten to thousands of these
7052940	7055300	and they're doubling exactly that way
7055300	7057660	just from people opting in.
7057660	7060540	And in so doing, driving towards this kind of idea
7060540	7063900	of personal digital fabrication.
7064220	7066580	And it's not utopia, it's not free,
7066580	7071580	but come back to today, we separately have education,
7072580	7075540	we have big business, we have startups,
7075540	7079700	we have entertainment, each of these things are segregated.
7079700	7081940	When you have global connection
7081940	7084140	to one of these local facilities,
7084140	7087820	in that you can do play and art and education
7087820	7089460	and create infrastructure.
7090660	7093700	You can make many of the things you consume.
7093700	7094980	You could make it for yourself,
7094980	7096740	it could be done on a community scale,
7096740	7099140	it could be done on a regional scale.
7100300	7104260	It really, I'd say the research we spent
7104260	7107740	the last few hours talking about, I thought was hard.
7107740	7112740	And in a sense, I mean, it's non-trivial
7112740	7115300	but in a sense, it's just sort of playing out
7115300	7116500	we're turning the crank.
7116500	7119100	What I didn't think was hard is
7120300	7122900	if anybody can make almost anything anywhere,
7123700	7125500	how do you live, how do you learn,
7125500	7127460	how do you work, how you play,
7127460	7130980	these very basic assumptions about how society functions.
7130980	7134820	There's a way in which it's kind of back to the future
7134820	7139820	in that this mode where work is money is consumption
7140020	7143660	and consumption is shopping by selecting
7143660	7147380	is only a kind of a few decade old stretch.
7148900	7153020	In some ways, we're getting back to a Sami village
7153020	7157300	in North Norway is deeply sustainable,
7158460	7162060	but rather than just reverting to living
7162060	7164320	the way we did a few thousand years ago,
7165580	7168760	being connected globally, having the benefits
7168760	7172020	of modern society, but connecting it back
7172020	7174500	to older notions of sustainability.
7175740	7180020	I hadn't remotely anticipated just how fundamentally
7180020	7182980	that challenges how a society functions.
7182980	7186300	And how interesting and how hard it is to figure out
7186300	7187900	how we can make that work.
7187900	7190540	And it's possible that this kind of process
7191500	7194940	will give a deeper sense of meaning to each person.
7194940	7198180	Let me violently agree in two ways.
7198180	7203180	One way is this community making
7205380	7209460	crosses many sensitive sectarian boundaries
7209460	7211900	in many parts of the world where there's just,
7213380	7215660	implicit or explicit conflict,
7215660	7220660	but sort of this act of making seems to transcend
7221020	7222740	a lot of historical divisions.
7222740	7224460	I don't say that philosophically,
7224460	7226420	I just say that as an observation.
7226420	7230020	And I think there's something really fundamental
7230020	7234020	in what you said, which is deep in our brain
7234020	7235980	is shaping our environment.
7239420	7241900	A lot of what's strange about our society
7241900	7244100	is the way that we can't do that.
7245460	7249020	The act of shaping our environment
7249020	7251260	touches something really, really deep
7251260	7253980	that gets to the essence of who we are.
7255100	7257820	That's again why I say that in a way,
7257820	7260260	the most important thing made in these labs
7260260	7261500	is making itself.
7262740	7266300	What do you think if the shaping of our environment
7266300	7267260	gets to something deep?
7267260	7269660	What do you think is the meaning of it all?
7269660	7271260	What's the meaning of life, Neil?
7272220	7277220	I can tell you my insights into how life works.
7277660	7279620	I can tell you my insights
7279620	7283820	in how to make life meaningful and fulfilling
7285460	7286740	and sustainable.
7289060	7291340	I have no idea what the meaning of life is,
7291340	7293740	but maybe that's the meaning of life.
7293740	7295860	Naha, the uncertainty, the confusion.
7297020	7298860	Because there's a magic to it all.
7298860	7300140	Everything you've talked about
7300180	7302940	from starting from the basic elements
7302940	7305420	with the big bang that somehow created the sun
7305420	7309220	that somehow set a few to thermodynamics
7309220	7312740	and created life in all the ways that you've talked about
7312740	7314860	from ribosomes that created the machinery
7314860	7315980	that created the machine
7315980	7319140	and then now the biological machine creating
7319140	7320420	through digital fabrication,
7320420	7322420	more complex artificial machines,
7322420	7325860	all of that, there's a magic to that creative process.
7325860	7329540	And we humans are smart enough to notice the magic.
7329540	7333220	So you haven't said the S word yet.
7333220	7334060	Which one is that?
7334060	7334900	Singularity.
7334900	7339700	Yeah, I'm not sure if Ray Kurzweil is listening
7339700	7340700	if he is high Ray,
7340700	7343220	but I have a complex relationship with Ray
7343220	7348220	because a lot of the things he projects, I find annoying,
7348660	7351740	but then he does his homework
7351740	7353820	and then somewhat annoyingly,
7353820	7355980	he points out how almost everything I'm doing
7355980	7357860	fits on his roadmaps.
7359820	7364820	And so the question is,
7365420	7367540	are we heading towards a singularity?
7369020	7372980	So I'd have to say I lean towards sigmoids
7372980	7374700	rather than exponentials.
7376340	7379020	But we've done pretty well with sigmoids.
7379020	7382460	Yeah, so sigmoids are things grow and they taper
7382460	7384820	and then there can be one after it and one after it.
7384820	7389820	So I'll pass on whether there's enough of them
7390380	7393020	that they diverge,
7393020	7398020	but the selfish gene answer to the meaning of life
7399900	7403900	is the meaning of life is the propagation of life.
7403900	7408900	And so it was a step for atoms to assemble into a molecule,
7408900	7413100	for atoms to assemble into a molecule,
7414020	7418580	for molecules to assemble into a proto cell,
7418580	7421860	for the proto cell to form, to then form organelles,
7421860	7424540	for the organ cells to form organs,
7424540	7426660	the organs to form an organism.
7426660	7431180	Then it was a step for organisms to form family units,
7431180	7433460	then family units to form villages.
7433460	7436180	You can view each of those as a stack
7436180	7437540	and the level of organization.
7437540	7442100	So you could view everything we've spoken about
7442100	7446500	as the imperative of life,
7447660	7450100	just the next step in the hierarchy of that
7450100	7452580	in the fulfillment of the inexorable drive
7452580	7454380	of the violation of thermodynamics.
7454380	7457980	So you could view, I'm an embodiment of the will
7457980	7460340	of the violation of thermodynamics speaking.
7461980	7464780	The two of us having an old chat, yes.
7464780	7465900	Yeah.
7465900	7469020	And so it continues and even then the singularity
7469020	7471500	is just a transition up the ladder.
7471500	7474540	There's nothing deeper to consciousness
7474540	7479540	than it's a derived property of distributed problem solving.
7481380	7484020	There's nothing deeper to life
7484020	7489020	than embodied AI in morphogenesis.
7490460	7493860	So why so much of this conversation in my life
7493900	7497260	is involved in these fab labs.
7497260	7500020	And initially it just started as outreach,
7500020	7502620	then it started as keeping up with it.
7502620	7505020	Then it turned to,
7507820	7509380	it was rewarding.
7509380	7512820	Then it turned to we're learning as much from these labs
7512820	7514260	in as goes out to them.
7514260	7516700	It began as outreach, but now more knowledge
7516700	7519420	is coming back from the labs that is going into them.
7519420	7524420	And then finally it ends with what I described
7525340	7527140	as competing with myself at MIT,
7527140	7530220	but a better way to say that is tapping
7530220	7531840	the brain power of the planet.
7533200	7535340	And so I guess for me personally,
7535340	7537620	that's the meaning of my life.
7537620	7539700	And maybe that's the meaning for the universe too.
7539700	7544700	It's using us humans and our creations to understand itself
7545660	7550060	in the way it's whatever the creative process
7550060	7553220	that created Earth is competing with itself.
7553220	7556460	Yeah, so you could take morphogenesis
7556460	7558180	as a summary of this whole conversation
7558180	7562420	or you could take recursion that in a sense,
7562420	7565580	what we've been talking about is recursion all the way down.
7565580	7568920	And in the end, I think this whole thing is pretty fun.
7568920	7572420	It's short life is, but it's pretty fun.
7572420	7573980	And so is this conversation.
7573980	7575820	I mentioned to you offline that I'm going
7575820	7577340	through some difficult stuff personally
7577340	7580620	and your passion for what you do is just really inspiring.
7580620	7583820	And it just lights up my mood and lights up my heart.
7583820	7587500	And you're an inspiration for I know thousands of people
7587500	7590220	that work with you at MIT and millions people across the world.
7590220	7591940	It's a big honor to use it with me today.
7591940	7592780	This is really fun.
7592780	7593780	This was a pleasure.
7594800	7596300	Thanks for listening to this conversation
7596300	7597700	with Neil Gershenfeld.

7603700	7605820	from Pablo Picasso.
7605820	7608260	Every child is an artist.
7608260	7611420	The challenge is staying an artist when you grow up.
7612540	7615680	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
