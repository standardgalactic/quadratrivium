The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, his second time in the podcast.

00:04.960 --> 00:10.680
Yosha is one of the most fascinating minds in the world exploring the nature of intelligence,

00:10.680 --> 00:14.600
cognition, computation, and consciousness.

This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Yosha Bach.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.920
Thank you for once again coming on to this particular Russian program and sticking to

00:38.920 --> 00:40.920
the theme of a Russian program.

00:40.920 --> 00:45.360
Let's start with the darkest of topics.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.560
So this is inspired by one of your tweets.

00:48.560 --> 00:56.640
You wrote that, quote, when life feels unbearable, I remind myself that I'm not a person.

00:56.640 --> 01:01.660
I am a piece of software running on the brain for random ape for a few decades.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.760
It's not the worst brain to run on.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.840
Have you experienced low points in your life?

01:07.840 --> 01:09.880
Have you experienced depression?

01:09.880 --> 01:15.440
Of course, we all experience low points in our life, and we get appalled by the things,

01:15.440 --> 01:17.120
by the ugliness of stuff around us.

01:17.120 --> 01:24.840
We might get desperate about our lack of self-regulation, and sometimes life is hard.

01:24.840 --> 01:30.640
And I suspect you don't get to your life nobody does to get to their life without low points

01:30.640 --> 01:33.960
and without moments where they are despairing.

01:33.960 --> 01:40.560
And I thought that let's capture this state and how to deal with that state.

01:40.560 --> 01:45.000
And I found that very often you realize that when you stop taking things personally, when

01:45.000 --> 01:50.800
you realize that this notion of a person is a fiction, similar as it is in Westworld where

01:50.800 --> 01:55.040
the robots realize that their memories and desires are just stuff that keeps them in

01:55.040 --> 02:00.160
the loop, and they don't have to act on those memories and desires, that our memories and

02:00.160 --> 02:02.680
expectations is what make us unhappy.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.520
And the present rarely does.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.160
The day in which we are, for the most part, it's okay, right?

02:08.160 --> 02:13.240
When we are sitting here, right here, right now, we can choose how we feel.

02:13.240 --> 02:18.920
And the thing that affects us is the expectation that something is going to be different from

02:18.920 --> 02:24.360
what we wanted to be or the memory that something was different from what we wanted it to be.

02:24.360 --> 02:29.160
And once we basically zoom out from all this, what's left is not a person.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.800
What's left is this state of being conscious, which is a software state.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.840
And software doesn't have an identity.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.960
It's a physical law.

02:37.960 --> 02:42.440
And it's a law that acts in all of us, and it's embedded in a suitable substrate.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.800
And we didn't pick that substrate, right?

02:43.800 --> 02:47.080
We are mostly randomly instantiated on it.

02:47.080 --> 02:52.160
And they're all these individuals, and everybody has to be one of them.

02:52.160 --> 02:56.240
And eventually, you're stuck on one of them and have to deal with that.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.400
So you're like a leaf floating down the river.

02:59.400 --> 03:05.160
You just have to accept that there's a river, and you just float wherever there are.

03:05.160 --> 03:09.720
The thing is that the illusion that you are an agent is a construct.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.480
What part of that is actually under your control.

03:13.560 --> 03:18.440
I think that our consciousness is largely a control model for our own attention.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.680
So we notice where we are looking, and we can influence what we are looking,

03:22.680 --> 03:25.880
how we are disambiguating things, how we put things together in our mind.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.920
And the whole system that runs us is this big cybernetic motivational system.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.840
So we're basically like a little monkey sitting on top of an elephant.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.320
And we can prod this elephant here and there to go this way or that way.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.960
And we might have the illusion that we are the elephant,

03:41.960 --> 03:43.480
or that we are telling it what to do.

03:43.480 --> 03:47.400
And sometimes we notice that it walks into a completely different direction.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.000
And we didn't set this thing up.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.800
It just is the situation that we find ourselves in.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.840
How much prodding can we actually do of the elephant?

03:56.360 --> 04:02.360
A lot. But I think that our consciousness cannot create the motive force.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.320
Is the elephant consciousness in this metaphor?

04:05.320 --> 04:07.880
No, the monkey is the consciousness.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.360
The monkey is the attentional system that is observing things.

04:10.360 --> 04:14.360
There is a large perceptual system combined with a motivational system

04:14.360 --> 04:18.680
that is actually providing the interface to everything and our own consciousness,

04:18.680 --> 04:22.440
I think, is the tool that directs the attention of that system,

04:22.440 --> 04:26.920
which means it singles out features and performs conditional operations

04:26.920 --> 04:28.840
for which it needs an index memory.

04:28.840 --> 04:32.680
But this index memory is what we perceive as our stream of consciousness.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.880
But the consciousness is not in charge. That's an illusion.

04:35.880 --> 04:41.320
So everything outside of that consciousness is the elephant.

04:41.320 --> 04:45.480
So it's the physics of the universe, but it's also society that's outside of your...

04:46.040 --> 04:48.280
I would say the elephant is the agent.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.320
So there is an environment in which the agent is stomping.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.440
And you are influencing a little part of that agent.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.280
So can you, is the agent a single human being?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.480
What's, which object has agency?

05:02.280 --> 05:03.800
That's an interesting question.

05:03.800 --> 05:09.480
I think a way to think about an agent is that it's a controller with a set point generator.

05:10.360 --> 05:13.800
The notion of a controller comes from cybernetics and control theory.

05:14.360 --> 05:20.840
Control system consists out of a system that is regulating some value

05:20.840 --> 05:23.880
and the deviation of that value from a set point.

05:23.880 --> 05:28.280
And it has a sensor that measures the system's deviation from that set point

05:28.840 --> 05:32.520
and an effector that can be parametrized by the controller.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.400
So the controller tells the effector to do a certain thing.

05:35.400 --> 05:40.760
And the goal is to reduce the distance between the set point and the current value of the system.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.480
And there's an environment which disturbs the regulated system,

05:43.480 --> 05:45.480
which brings it away from that set point.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.720
So the simplest case is the thermostat.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.120
And the thermostat is really simple because it doesn't have a model.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.680
The thermostat is only trying to minimize the set point deviation in the next moment.

05:55.720 --> 05:59.800
And if you want to minimize the set point deviation over a longer time span,

05:59.800 --> 06:03.640
you need to integrate it. You need to model what is going to happen.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.560
So for instance, when you think about that your set point is to be comfortable in life,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.440
maybe you need to make yourself uncomfortable first.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.960
Right? So you need to make a model of what's going to happen when.

06:13.960 --> 06:20.520
And this is the task of the controller is to use its sensors to measure the state of the environment

06:20.520 --> 06:24.120
and the system that is being regulated and figure out what to do.

06:24.840 --> 06:29.640
And if the task is complex enough, the set points are complicated enough,

06:30.040 --> 06:34.840
and if the controller has enough capacity and enough sensor feedback,

06:34.840 --> 06:39.000
then the task of the controller is to make a model of the entire universe that it's in,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.240
the conditions under which it exists and of itself.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.920
And this is a very complex agent and we are in that category.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.320
And an agent is not necessarily a thing in the universe.

06:49.320 --> 06:53.480
It's a class of models that we use to interpret aspects of the universe.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.720
And when we notice the environment around us, a lot of things only make sense at the level

06:59.720 --> 07:03.160
that should be entangled with them, if we interpret them as control systems

07:03.160 --> 07:07.160
that make models of the world and try to minimize their own set points.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.400
So the models are the agents?

07:10.360 --> 07:14.520
The agent is a class of model. And we notice that we are an agent ourselves.

07:14.520 --> 07:18.680
We are the agent that is using our own control model to perform actions.

07:18.680 --> 07:23.320
We notice we would use a change in the model and things in the world change.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.680
And this is how we discover the idea that we have a body,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.960
that we are a situated environment and that we have a first person perspective.

07:31.080 --> 07:38.120
Still don't understand what's the best way to think of which object has agency with respect

07:38.120 --> 07:45.880
to human beings. Is it the body? Is it the brain? Is it the contents of the brain that has agency?

07:45.880 --> 07:48.120
Like what's the actuators that you're referring to?

07:49.080 --> 07:51.960
What is the controller and where does it reside?

07:51.960 --> 07:56.920
Or is it these impossible things? Because I keep trying to ground it to space time,

07:57.560 --> 08:00.680
the three-dimensional space, and the one-dimension of time.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.880
What's the agent in that for humans?

08:04.440 --> 08:08.680
There is not just one. It depends on the way in which you're looking at this thing,

08:08.680 --> 08:13.480
in which you're framing it. Imagine that you are, say, Angela Merkel,

08:13.480 --> 08:19.240
and you are acting on behalf of Germany. And you could say that Germany is the agent.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.480
And in the mind of Angela Merkel, she is Germany to some extent,

08:23.480 --> 08:27.400
because in the way in which she acts, the destiny of Germany changes.

08:27.960 --> 08:33.480
There are things that she can change that basically affect the behavior of that nation state.

08:33.480 --> 08:38.680
Okay, so it's hierarchies to go to another one of your tweets with, I think, your

08:39.640 --> 08:44.040
playfully mocking Jeff Hawkins with saying his brain's all the way down.

08:45.720 --> 08:51.640
So it's agents all the way down. It's agents made up of agents made up of agents.

08:51.640 --> 08:56.440
Like if Angela Merkel is Germany, and Germany's made up a bunch of people,

08:56.440 --> 09:00.200
and the people are themselves agents in some kind of context.

09:00.920 --> 09:06.520
And then people are made up of cells, each individual. So is it agents all the way down?

09:07.080 --> 09:12.200
I suspect that has to be like this in a world where things are self-organizing.

09:12.840 --> 09:17.640
Most of the complexity that we are looking at, everything in life is about self-organization.

09:18.440 --> 09:27.400
So I think up from the level of life, you have agents. And below life, you rarely have agents,

09:27.400 --> 09:32.680
because sometimes you have control systems that emerge randomly in nature and try to achieve

09:32.680 --> 09:37.800
a set point. But they're not that interesting agents that make models. And because to make

09:37.800 --> 09:41.720
an interesting model of the world, you typically need a system that is during complete.

09:42.200 --> 09:49.400
Can I ask you a personal question? What's the line between life and non-life? It's personal

09:49.400 --> 09:56.360
because you're a life form. So what do you think in this emerging complexity, at which point,

09:56.360 --> 09:58.840
does the things that are being living and have agency?

09:59.800 --> 10:03.560
Personally, I think that the simplest answer there is that life is cells, because...

10:04.440 --> 10:09.640
Life is what? Cells, biological cells. So it's a particular kind of principle

10:09.640 --> 10:15.160
that we have discovered to exist in nature. It's modular stuff that consists out of

10:16.680 --> 10:22.600
basically this DNA tape with a redried head on top of it that is able to perform arbitrary

10:22.600 --> 10:27.800
computations and state transitions within the cell. And it's combined with a membrane that

10:27.800 --> 10:35.000
insulates the cell from its environment. And there are chemical reactions inside of the cell

10:35.000 --> 10:40.360
that are in disequilibrium. And the cell is running in such a way that this disequilibrium

10:40.360 --> 10:45.880
doesn't disappear. And the cell goes... If the cell goes into an equilibrium state, it dies.

10:46.520 --> 10:52.440
And it requires some things like a neck entropy extractor to maintain this disequilibrium. So

10:52.440 --> 10:57.240
it's able to harvest neck entropy from its environment and keep itself running.

10:58.040 --> 11:04.280
Yeah, so there's information and there's a wall to protect, to maintain this disequilibrium.

11:04.280 --> 11:07.960
But isn't this very earth-centric? Like what you're referring to...

11:09.000 --> 11:13.560
I'm not making a normative notion. You could say that there are probably other things in the

11:13.560 --> 11:18.760
universe that are cell-like and lifelike. And you could also call them life. But eventually,

11:18.760 --> 11:25.240
it's just a willingness to find an agreement of how to use the terms. I like cells because

11:25.240 --> 11:29.880
it's completely co-extensional. This is the way that we use the word even before we knew about

11:29.880 --> 11:35.240
cells. So people were pointing at some stuff and saying, this is somehow animate. And this is very

11:35.240 --> 11:39.480
different from the non-animate stuff. And what's the difference between the living and the dead

11:39.480 --> 11:45.480
stuff? And it's mostly whether the cells are working or not. And also this boundary of life,

11:45.480 --> 11:49.640
where we say that, for instance, a virus is basically an information packet that is subverting

11:49.640 --> 11:56.360
the cell and not life by itself. That makes sense to me. And it's somewhat arbitrary. You could,

11:56.360 --> 12:01.720
of course, say that systems that permanently maintain a disequilibrium and can self-replicate

12:01.720 --> 12:09.320
are always life. And maybe that's a useful definition too. But this is eventually just

12:09.320 --> 12:12.920
how you want to use the word. Is it so useful for conversation? But

12:14.040 --> 12:19.960
is it somehow fundamental to the universe? Do you think there's an actual line to eventually

12:19.960 --> 12:25.560
be drawn between life and non-life? Or is it all kind of continuum? I don't think it's a continuum,

12:25.560 --> 12:30.520
but there's nothing magical that is happening. Living systems are a certain type of machine.

12:31.160 --> 12:36.440
What about non-living systems? Is it also a machine? There are non-living machines. But

12:36.440 --> 12:42.760
the question is at which point is a system able to perform arbitrary state transitions

12:42.760 --> 12:48.360
in to make representations? And living things can do this. And of course, we can also build

12:48.360 --> 12:53.880
non-living things that can do this. But we don't know anything in nature that is not a cell

12:54.600 --> 12:57.240
and is not created by a stellar life that is able to do that.

12:57.800 --> 13:05.000
Not only do we not know, I don't think we have the tools to see otherwise.

13:06.280 --> 13:13.160
I always worry that we look at the world too narrowly. There could be life

13:13.800 --> 13:19.800
of a very different kind right under our noses that we're just not seeing because we're not

13:20.760 --> 13:26.280
either limitations of our cognitive capacity or we're just not open-minded enough.

13:27.080 --> 13:31.000
Either with the tools of science or just the tools of our mind.

13:32.120 --> 13:37.480
Yeah, that's possible. I find this thought very fascinating. And I suspect that many of us ask

13:37.480 --> 13:41.960
ourselves since childhood, what are the things that we are missing? What kind of systems and

13:41.960 --> 13:52.520
interconnections exist that are outside of our gaze? But we are looking for it and physics doesn't

13:53.080 --> 14:00.280
have much room at the moment for opening up something that would not violate the conservation

14:00.280 --> 14:08.280
of information as we know it. Yeah, but I wonder about timescale and spatial scale,

14:08.280 --> 14:16.280
whether we just need to open up our idea of how life presents itself. It could be operating in a

14:16.280 --> 14:23.640
much slower timescale, a much faster timescale. And it's almost sad to think that there's all this

14:23.640 --> 14:30.040
life around us that we're not seeing because we're just not thinking in terms of the right

14:31.320 --> 14:37.400
scale, both time and space. What is your definition of life? What do you understand as life?

14:37.400 --> 14:45.880
Hmm. Entities of sufficiently high complexity that are full of surprises.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.200
I don't know. I don't have a free will. So that just came out of my mouth. I'm not sure

14:56.200 --> 15:01.480
that even makes sense. There's certain characteristics. So complexity seems to be a

15:01.480 --> 15:11.640
necessary property of life. And I almost want to say it has ability to do something unexpected.

15:13.240 --> 15:16.680
It seems to me that life is the main source of complexity on Earth.

15:18.680 --> 15:26.360
Yes. And complexity is basically a bridgehead that order builds into chaos by modeling,

15:27.080 --> 15:32.280
by processing information in such a way that you can perform reactions that would not be possible

15:32.280 --> 15:37.240
for dump systems. And this means that you can harvest like entropy that dump systems cannot

15:37.240 --> 15:43.160
harvest. And this is what complexity is mostly about. In some sense, the purpose of life is to

15:43.160 --> 15:52.280
create complexity. Yeah. Increasing complexity. There seems to be some kind of universal drive

15:52.280 --> 15:58.440
towards increasing pockets of complexity. I don't know what that is. That seems to be like a

15:58.440 --> 16:03.960
fundamental, I don't know if it's a property of the universe, or it's just a consequence

16:03.960 --> 16:09.960
of the way the universe works. But there seems to be this small pockets of emergent complexity

16:09.960 --> 16:15.800
that builds on top of each other and starts having like greater and greater complexity by

16:15.800 --> 16:20.600
having like a hierarchy of complexity, like little organisms building up a little society

16:20.680 --> 16:25.640
that then operates almost as an individual organism itself. And all of a sudden, you have

16:25.640 --> 16:31.320
Germany and Merkel. That's not obvious to me. Everything that goes up has to come down at some

16:31.320 --> 16:38.520
point. So if you see this big exponential curve somewhere, it's usually the beginning of an S-curve,

16:39.240 --> 16:43.320
where something eventually reaches a saturation. And the S-curve is the beginning of some kind

16:43.320 --> 16:52.120
of bump that goes down again. And there is just this thing that when you are inside of an evolution

16:52.120 --> 16:59.880
of life, you are on top of a puddle of negentropy that is being sucked dry by life. And during

16:59.880 --> 17:04.760
that happening, you see an increase in complexity, because life forms are competing with each other

17:04.760 --> 17:11.000
to get more and more and finer and finer corner of that, like entropy extraction.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.760
But that, I feel like that's a gradual, beautiful process, like that's almost,

17:15.720 --> 17:22.200
follows a process akin to evolution. And the way it comes down is not the same way it came up.

17:22.840 --> 17:29.800
The way it comes down is usually harshly and quickly. So usually there's some kind of catastrophic

17:29.800 --> 17:38.040
event. The Roman Empire took a long time. Would that be, would you classify that as a

17:38.040 --> 17:43.240
decrease in complexity, though? Yes. I think that this size of the cities that could be fed has

17:43.240 --> 17:48.600
decreased dramatically. And you could see that the quality of the art decreased, and it did so

17:48.600 --> 17:55.720
gradually. And maybe future generations, when they look at the history of the United States

17:55.720 --> 18:00.120
in the 21st century, will also talk about the gradual decline, not something that suddenly

18:00.200 --> 18:09.640
happens. Do you have a sense of where we are? Are we on the exponential rise?

18:09.640 --> 18:15.720
Are we at the peak? Or are we at the down slope of the United States empire?

18:15.720 --> 18:21.640
It's very hard to say from a single human perspective, but it seems to me that we are

18:21.640 --> 18:28.840
probably at the peak. I think that's probably the definition of optimism and cynicism.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.600
So my nature of optimism is, I think we're on the rise.

18:37.000 --> 18:41.080
I think it's just all a matter of perspective that nobody knows. But I do think that

18:41.080 --> 18:46.280
erring on the side of optimism, you need a sufficient number. You need a minimum

18:46.280 --> 18:52.040
number of optimists in order to make that up thing actually work. And so I tend to be on

18:52.040 --> 18:56.840
the side of the optimists. I think that we are basically a species of grasshoppers that have

18:56.840 --> 19:03.480
turned into locusts. And when you are in that locust mode, you see an amazing rise of population

19:03.480 --> 19:10.920
numbers and of the complexity of the interactions between the individuals. But ultimately, the

19:10.920 --> 19:17.320
question is, is it sustainable? See, I think we're a bunch of lions and tigers that have become

19:17.320 --> 19:24.200
domesticated cats to use a different metaphor. And so I'm not exactly sure we're so destructive,

19:24.200 --> 19:30.040
we're just softer and nicer and lazier. But I think we have monkeys and not the cats. And if

19:30.040 --> 19:35.880
you look at the monkeys, they are very busy. The ones that have a lot of sex, those monkeys?

19:35.880 --> 19:40.040
Not just the bonobos. I think that all the monkeys are basically a discontent species that

19:40.040 --> 19:45.720
always needs to meddle. Well, the gorillas seem to have a little bit more of a structure,

19:45.720 --> 19:54.120
but it's a different part of the tree. Okay, you mentioned the elephant and the monkey riding

19:54.120 --> 20:03.080
the elephant. And consciousness is the monkey. And there's some prodding that the monkey gets to do.

20:03.080 --> 20:09.720
And sometimes the elephant listens. I heard you got into some content maybe you can correct me,

20:09.720 --> 20:15.000
but I heard you got into some contentious free will discussions. Is this with Sam Harris or

20:15.000 --> 20:21.800
something like that? Not that I know of. Some people in clubhouse told me you made a bunch of

20:22.360 --> 20:29.640
big debate points about free will. Well, let me just then ask you where in terms of the monkey

20:29.640 --> 20:36.360
and the elephant, do you think we land in terms of the illusion of free will? How much control does

20:36.360 --> 20:43.880
the monkey have? We have to think about what the free will is in the first place. We are not the

20:43.880 --> 20:48.600
machine. We are not the thing that is making the decisions. We are a model of that decision-making

20:48.600 --> 20:54.920
process. And there is a difference between making your own decisions and predicting your

20:54.920 --> 21:03.160
own decisions. And that difference is the first person perspective. And what basically makes

21:03.160 --> 21:09.320
decision-making and the conditions of free will distinct from just automatically doing the best

21:09.320 --> 21:15.400
thing is that we often don't know what the best thing is. We make decisions under uncertainty.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.960
We make informed bets using a betting algorithm that we don't yet understand because we haven't

21:19.960 --> 21:24.120
reverse engineered our own minds efficiently. We don't know the expected rewards. We don't

21:24.120 --> 21:28.200
know the mechanism by which we estimate the rewards and so on. But there is an algorithm.

21:28.200 --> 21:35.720
We observe ourselves performing, where we see that we weight facts and factors and the future.

21:35.720 --> 21:42.360
And then some kind of possibility, some motive gets raised to an intention. And that's informed

21:42.360 --> 21:47.640
bet that the system is making. And that making of the informed bet, the representation of that is

21:47.640 --> 21:53.320
what we call free will. And it seems to be paradoxical because we think that the crucial

21:53.320 --> 21:59.000
thing is that it's somehow indeterministic. And yet, if it was indeterministic, it would be random.

22:00.200 --> 22:04.840
And it cannot be random because if it was random, if just dice were being thrown in the

22:04.840 --> 22:09.640
universe randomly, forces you to do things, it would be meaningless. So the important part

22:09.640 --> 22:14.920
of the decisions is always the deterministic stuff. But it appears to be indeterministic to

22:14.920 --> 22:20.200
you because it's unpredictable. Because if it was predictable, you wouldn't experience it as a free

22:20.200 --> 22:26.360
will decision. You would experience it as just doing the necessary right thing. And you see this

22:26.360 --> 22:32.760
continuum between the free will and the execution of automatic behavior when you're observing other

22:32.760 --> 22:37.560
people. So for instance, when you are observing your own children, if you don't understand them,

22:37.640 --> 22:44.360
you will use this agent model where you have an agent with a set point generator. And the agent is

22:44.360 --> 22:48.680
doing the best it can to minimize the difference to the set point. And it might be confused and

22:49.320 --> 22:54.680
sometimes impulsive or whatever, but it's acting on its own free will. And when you understand

22:54.680 --> 23:00.280
what happens in the mind of the child, you see that it's automatic. And you can outmodel the child,

23:00.280 --> 23:05.160
you can build things around the child that will lead the child to making exactly the decision

23:05.160 --> 23:09.640
that you are predicting. And under these circumstances, like when you are a stage

23:09.640 --> 23:16.120
misvision, or somebody who is dealing with people that you sell a car to, and you completely

23:16.120 --> 23:20.520
understand the psychology and the impulses and the space of thoughts that this individual can

23:20.520 --> 23:24.280
have at that moment. Under these circumstances, it makes no sense to attribute free will.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.560
Because it's no longer decision making under uncertainty. You are already certain. For them,

23:29.560 --> 23:31.800
there's uncertainty, but you already know what they're doing.

23:32.520 --> 23:40.440
But what about for you? So is this akin to like systems like cellular automata,

23:41.480 --> 23:46.600
where it's deterministic? But when you squint your eyes a little bit,

23:47.800 --> 23:54.440
it starts to look like there's agents making decisions at the higher sort of when you zoom

23:54.440 --> 24:00.440
out and look at the entities that are composed by the individual cells, even though there's

24:01.240 --> 24:08.760
underlying simple rules that make the system evolve in deterministic ways, it looks like

24:08.760 --> 24:16.280
there's organisms making decisions. Is that where the illusion of free will emerges? That jump in scale.

24:17.320 --> 24:22.520
It's a particular type of model, but this jump in scale is crucial. The jump in scale happens

24:22.520 --> 24:26.360
whenever you have too many parts to count, and you cannot make a model at that level,

24:26.360 --> 24:31.640
and you try to find some higher level regularity. And the higher level regularity is a pattern that

24:31.640 --> 24:37.400
you project into the world to make sense of it. And agency is one of these patterns. You have all

24:37.400 --> 24:42.680
these cells that interact with each other, and the cells in our body are set up in such a way

24:42.680 --> 24:48.200
that they benefit if their behavior is coherent, which means that they act as if they were serving

24:48.200 --> 24:54.200
a common goal. And that means that they will evolve regulation mechanisms that act as if

24:54.200 --> 24:59.000
they were serving a common goal. And now you can make sense of all these cells by projecting the

24:59.000 --> 25:04.920
common goal into them. Right. So for you, then, free will is an illusion? No, it's a model,

25:04.920 --> 25:09.880
and it's a construct. It's basically a model that the system is making of its own behavior,

25:09.880 --> 25:14.360
and it's the best model that it can come up with under the circumstances, and it can get replaced

25:14.360 --> 25:18.520
by a different model, which is automatic behavior, when you fully understand the mechanism under

25:18.520 --> 25:25.320
which you are acting. Yeah, but another word for model is what story. So it's the story you're

25:25.320 --> 25:31.400
telling. I mean, do you actually have control? Is there such a thing as a you? And is there such a

25:31.400 --> 25:41.880
thing as you having control? So like, are you manifesting your evolution as an entity?

25:41.880 --> 25:46.920
In some sense, the you is the model of the system that is in control. It's a story that the system

25:46.920 --> 25:52.600
tells itself about somebody who is in control. Yeah. And the contents of that model are being

25:52.600 --> 26:00.360
used to inform the behavior of the system. Okay. So the system is completely mechanical,

26:00.360 --> 26:05.960
and the system creates that story like a loom. And then it uses the contents of that story

26:05.960 --> 26:11.080
to inform its actions and writes the results of that actions into the story.

26:11.080 --> 26:19.000
So how's that non-illusion? The story is written then? Or a rather, we're not the writers of the

26:19.000 --> 26:26.600
story? Yes, but we always knew that. No, we don't know that. When did we know that?

26:26.600 --> 26:32.520
I think that's mostly a confusion about concepts. The conceptual illusion in our culture comes from

26:32.520 --> 26:37.320
the idea that we live in physical reality, and that we experience physical reality,

26:37.320 --> 26:42.040
and that you have ideas about it. And then you have this dualist interpretation where you have

26:42.760 --> 26:48.840
two substances, res extensor, the world that you can touch, and that is made of extended things,

26:48.840 --> 26:53.880
and res cogitans, which is the world of ideas. And in fact, both of them are mental representations.

26:54.520 --> 26:59.240
One is the representations of the world as a game engine that your mind generates to make

26:59.240 --> 27:04.040
sense of the perceptual data. And the other one, yes, that's what we perceive as the physical

27:04.040 --> 27:07.880
world. But we already know that the physical world is nothing like that. Quantum mechanics is

27:07.880 --> 27:13.480
very different from what you and me perceive as the world. The world you and me perceive is a game

27:13.480 --> 27:18.280
engine. And there are no colors and sounds in the physical world that only exist in the game

27:18.280 --> 27:24.680
engine generated by your brain. And then you have ideas that cannot be mapped onto extended regions.

27:24.680 --> 27:29.960
So the objects that have a spatial extension in the game engine, res extensor, and the objects

27:30.040 --> 27:35.800
that don't have a physical extension in the game engine are ideas. And they both interact in our

27:35.800 --> 27:44.120
mind to produce models of the world. But when you play video games, I understand that what's

27:44.120 --> 27:53.240
actually happening is zeros and ones inside of a computer, inside of a CPU and a GPU, but you're

27:53.320 --> 28:01.800
still seeing like the rendering of that. And you're still making decisions whether to shoot,

28:01.800 --> 28:06.520
to turn left or to turn right. If you're playing a shooter or every time you start thinking about

28:06.520 --> 28:11.640
Skyrim and Elder Scrolls and walking around a beautiful nature and swinging a sword. But it

28:11.640 --> 28:16.440
feels like you're making decisions inside that video game. So even though you don't have direct

28:16.440 --> 28:23.640
access in terms of perception to the bits, to the zeros and ones, it still feels like you're

28:23.640 --> 28:28.840
making decisions. And your decisions are actually feels like they're being applied

28:30.040 --> 28:34.280
all the way down to the zeros and ones. So it feels like you have control even though you don't

28:34.280 --> 28:39.720
direct access to reality. So there is basically a special character in the video game that is

28:39.720 --> 28:44.360
being created by the video game engine. And this character is serving the aesthetics of the video

28:44.360 --> 28:51.880
game. And that is you. Yes, but I feel like I have control inside the video game, like all those

28:51.880 --> 28:57.960
like 12 year olds that kick my ass on the internet. So for when you play the video game, it doesn't

28:57.960 --> 29:01.960
really matter that there's zeros and ones, right? You don't care about the vids of the bus, you don't

29:01.960 --> 29:06.360
care about the nature of the CPU that it runs on. What you care about are the properties of the

29:06.360 --> 29:11.640
game that you're playing. And you hope that the CPU is good enough. Yes. And a similar thing happens

29:11.640 --> 29:15.880
when we interact with physics. The world that you and me are in is not the physical world.

29:15.880 --> 29:21.400
The world that you and me are in is a dream world. How close is it to the real world, though?

29:23.400 --> 29:27.480
We know that it's not very close, but we know that the dynamics of the dream world

29:27.480 --> 29:30.920
match the dynamics of the physical world to a certain degree of resolution.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.160
Right. The causal structure of the dream world is different.

29:35.160 --> 29:39.080
So you see, for instance, waves crashing on your feet, right? But there are no waves in the

29:39.160 --> 29:43.880
ocean. There's only water molecules that have tangents between the molecules that are

29:45.880 --> 29:49.960
the result of electrons in the molecules interacting with each other.

29:49.960 --> 29:57.800
Aren't they very consistent where you're seeing a very crude approximation? Isn't our dream world

29:57.800 --> 30:04.200
very consistent to the point of being mapped directly one to one to the actual physical world,

30:04.200 --> 30:09.080
as opposed to us being completely tricked? This is like where you have like Donald Hock.

30:09.080 --> 30:13.560
It's not a trick. That's my point. It's not an illusion. It's a form of data compression.

30:13.560 --> 30:17.640
It's an attempt to deal with the dynamics of too many parts to count at the level at which

30:17.640 --> 30:22.600
we are entangled with the best model that you can find. Yeah. So we can act in that dream world

30:22.600 --> 30:28.200
and our actions have impact in the real world, in the physical world, to which we don't have

30:28.200 --> 30:33.080
access. Yes. But it's basically like accepting the fact that the software that we live in,

30:33.080 --> 30:37.960
the dream that we live in is generated by something outside of this world that you and me are in.

30:37.960 --> 30:41.400
So is the software deterministic and do we not have any control?

30:43.880 --> 30:52.520
So free will is having a conscious being. Free will is the monkey being able to steer the elephant.

30:55.320 --> 31:01.560
No. It's slightly different. Basically, in the same way as you are modeling the water molecules

31:01.560 --> 31:06.360
in the ocean that engulf your feet when you are walking on the beach as waves and there are no

31:06.360 --> 31:11.960
waves, but only the atoms on more complicated stuff underneath the atoms and so on. And you

31:11.960 --> 31:17.880
know that, right? You would accept, yes, there is a certain abstraction that happens here. It's a

31:17.880 --> 31:23.160
simplification of what happens and the simplification that is designed in such a way that your brain

31:23.160 --> 31:28.280
can deal with it temporarily and spatially in terms of resources and tuned for the predictive

31:28.280 --> 31:33.240
value. So you can predict with some accuracy whether your feet are going to get wet or not.

31:33.240 --> 31:38.120
But it's a really good, it's a really good interface and approximation. Yes. It's like

31:38.120 --> 31:43.720
e equals mc squared is a good, equations are good approximation for what they're much better

31:43.720 --> 31:50.920
approximation. So to me waves is a really nice approximation of what's all the complexity

31:50.920 --> 31:54.360
that's happening underneath. Basically, it's a machine learning model that is constantly tuned

31:54.360 --> 31:58.920
to minimize surprises. So it basically tries to predict as well as it can what you're going to

31:58.920 --> 32:04.680
perceive next. Are we talking about which is the machine learning our perception system or the dream

32:04.680 --> 32:11.080
world? The dream world is the result of the machine learning process of the perception system.

32:11.080 --> 32:18.040
That's doing the compression. Yes. And the model of you as an agent is not a different type of model

32:18.040 --> 32:25.160
or it's a different type, but not different as in its model like nature from the model of the ocean,

32:25.160 --> 32:30.680
right? Some things are oceans, some things are agents. And one of these agents is using your

32:30.680 --> 32:35.320
own control model, the output of your model, the things that you perceive yourself as doing.

32:36.200 --> 32:41.720
And that is you. What about the fact that is like when you're standing

32:41.720 --> 32:52.040
with the water on your feet and you're looking out into the vast open water of the ocean and

32:52.040 --> 32:57.960
then there's a beautiful sunset and the fact that it's beautiful and then maybe you have friends

32:57.960 --> 33:03.000
or loved one with you and you feel love. What is that as the dream world? What is that? Yes,

33:03.000 --> 33:10.360
it's all happening inside of the dream. Okay. But see the word dream makes it seem like it's not real.

33:11.240 --> 33:17.560
Yeah, of course, it's not real. The physical universe is real, but the physical universe

33:17.560 --> 33:22.120
is incomprehensible and it doesn't have any feeling of realness. The feeling of realness that

33:22.120 --> 33:26.520
you experience gets attached to certain representations where your brain assesses,

33:26.520 --> 33:31.000
this is the best model of reality that I have. So the only thing that's real to you is the

33:31.000 --> 33:37.560
thing that's happening at the very base of reality. Yeah, for something to be real,

33:37.640 --> 33:44.440
it needs to be implemented. So the model that you have of reality is real in as far as it is a

33:44.440 --> 33:49.320
model, right? It's an appropriate description of the world to say that there are models that

33:49.320 --> 33:56.200
are being experienced. But the world that you experience is not necessarily implemented.

33:56.760 --> 34:03.560
There is a difference between a reality, a simulation and a simulacrum. The reality that

34:03.560 --> 34:08.520
we're talking about is something that fully emerges over a causally close lowest layer.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.680
And the idea of physicalism is that we are in that layer, that basically our world emerges

34:12.680 --> 34:17.160
over that. Every alternative to physicalism is a simulation theory, which basically says

34:17.160 --> 34:21.080
that we are in some kind of simulation universe and the real world needs to be an apparent

34:21.080 --> 34:26.440
universe of that, where the actual causal structure is, right? And when you look at the ocean and

34:26.440 --> 34:30.600
your own mind, you are looking at a simulation that explains what you're going to see next.

34:31.320 --> 34:35.080
So we are living in a simulation. Yes, but a simulation generated by our own brains.

34:36.120 --> 34:40.920
And this simulation is different from the physical reality because the causal structure

34:40.920 --> 34:44.840
that is being produced, what you are seeing is different from the causal structure of physics.

34:44.840 --> 34:45.640
But consistent.

34:46.840 --> 34:51.480
Hopefully, if not, then you are going to end up in some kind of institution where people will

34:51.480 --> 34:56.600
take care of you because your behavior will be inconsistent, right? Your behavior needs to work

34:56.600 --> 35:01.400
in such a way that it's interacting with an accurately predictive model of reality. And

35:01.400 --> 35:06.120
if your brain is unable to make your model of reality predictive, you will need help.

35:06.120 --> 35:12.680
So what do you think about Donald Hoffman's argument that it doesn't have to be consistent,

35:12.680 --> 35:19.400
the dream world, to what he calls like the interface to the actual physical reality,

35:19.400 --> 35:23.960
where there could be evolution. I think he makes an evolutionary argument, which is like,

35:23.960 --> 35:30.840
it could be an evolutionary advantage to have the dream world drift away from physical reality.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.280
I think that only works if you have tenure. As long as you're still interacting with the

35:34.280 --> 35:37.320
ground tools, your model needs to be somewhat predictive.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.720
Well, in some sense, humans have achieved a kind of tenure in the animal kingdom.

35:45.080 --> 35:49.080
Yeah. At some point, we became too big to fail. So we became postmodernist.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.680
It all makes sense now.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.040
It's a version of reality that we like.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.760
Oh, man. Okay.

35:57.320 --> 36:02.440
Yeah, but basically, you can do magic. You can change your assessment of reality,

36:02.440 --> 36:06.760
but eventually, reality is going to come by to you in the ass if it's not predictive.

36:06.760 --> 36:15.480
Do you have a sense of what is that base layer of physical reality? You have these attempts

36:15.560 --> 36:21.880
at the theories of everything, the very, very small of like string theory, or what

36:22.680 --> 36:28.440
Stephen Wolfram talks about with the hypergrass. These are these tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny objects,

36:28.440 --> 36:34.840
and then there is more like quantum mechanics that's talking about objects that are much larger,

36:34.840 --> 36:40.600
but still very, very, very tiny. Do you have a sense of where the tiniest thing is that is like

36:41.560 --> 36:45.240
at the lowest level, the turtle at the very bottom? Do you have a sense?

36:45.880 --> 36:50.680
I don't think that you can talk about where it is because space is emergent over the activity

36:50.680 --> 36:59.560
of these things. So coordinates only exist in relation to other things. And so you could,

36:59.560 --> 37:04.200
in some sense, abstract it into locations that can hold information and trajectories

37:04.200 --> 37:07.880
that the information can take between the different locations. And this is how we

37:07.880 --> 37:14.920
construct our notion of space. And physicists usually have a notion of space that is continuous.

37:15.640 --> 37:21.880
And this is a point where I tend to agree with people like Stephen Wolfram, who are very skeptical

37:21.880 --> 37:27.400
of the geometric notions. I think that geometry is the dynamics of too many parts to count. And

37:29.080 --> 37:34.120
when there are no infinities, if there were two infinities, you would be running into contradictions,

37:34.120 --> 37:39.080
which is in some sense what Gödel and Turing discovered in response to Hilbert's call.

37:39.720 --> 37:45.240
There are no infinities. There are no infinities. There is unboundedness. But if you have a language

37:45.240 --> 37:48.920
that talks about infinity, at some point, the language is going to contradict itself,

37:49.480 --> 37:53.960
which means it's no longer valid. In order to deal with infinities and mathematics,

37:53.960 --> 37:59.480
you have to postulate the existence initially. You cannot construct the infinities. And that's

37:59.480 --> 38:04.680
an issue. You cannot build up an infinity from zero. But in practice, you never do this. When

38:04.680 --> 38:10.360
you perform calculations, you only look at the dynamics of too many parts to count. And usually,

38:10.360 --> 38:16.840
these numbers are not that large. They're not Googles or something. The infinities that we are

38:16.840 --> 38:24.280
dealing with in our universe are, mathematically speaking, relatively small integers. And still,

38:24.760 --> 38:32.120
what we're looking at is dynamics, where a trillion things behave similar to 100 trillion

38:32.120 --> 38:39.960
things or something that is very, very large because they're converging. And these converging

38:39.960 --> 38:44.120
dynamics, these operators, this is what we deal with when we are doing the geometry.

38:44.840 --> 38:50.440
The geometry is stuff where we can pretend that it's continuous, because if we subdivide the

38:50.440 --> 38:57.000
space sufficiently, fine-grained, these things approach a certain dynamic. And this approached

38:57.000 --> 39:02.760
dynamic, that is what we mean by it. But I don't think that infinity would work, so to speak,

39:02.760 --> 39:07.720
that you would know the last digit of pi and that you have a physical process that rests on knowing

39:07.720 --> 39:14.040
the last digit of pi. Yeah, that could be just a peculiar quirk of human cognition that we like

39:14.040 --> 39:19.720
discrete. Discrete makes sense to us. Infinity doesn't. So in terms of our intuitions.

39:19.720 --> 39:24.840
No, the issue is that everything that we think about needs to be expressed in some kind of mental

39:24.840 --> 39:30.040
language, not necessarily natural language, but some kind of mathematical language that your

39:30.040 --> 39:35.880
neurons can speak, that refers to something in the world. And what we have discovered is that

39:36.760 --> 39:41.160
we cannot construct a notion of infinity without running into contradictions, which means that

39:41.160 --> 39:46.920
such a language is no longer valid. And I suspect this is what made Pythagoras so unhappy when

39:46.920 --> 39:51.000
somebody came up with the notion of irrational numbers before it was time, right? There's this

39:51.000 --> 39:55.160
myth that he had this person killed when he blabbed out the secret that not everything can be

39:55.160 --> 39:59.960
expressed as a ratio between two numbers, but there are numbers between the ratios. The world

39:59.960 --> 40:05.960
was not ready for this. And I think he was right that has confused mathematicians very seriously

40:05.960 --> 40:11.480
because these numbers are not values, they are functions. And so you can calculate these functions

40:11.480 --> 40:16.120
to a certain degree of approximation, but you cannot pretend that pi has actually a value.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.400
Pi is a function that would approach this value to some degree,

40:21.400 --> 40:23.560
but nothing in the world rests on knowing pi.

40:26.200 --> 40:29.880
How important is this distinction between discrete and continuous

40:30.920 --> 40:33.560
for you to get to the bottom? Because there's a, I mean,

40:35.000 --> 40:40.360
in discussion of your favorite flavor of the theory of everything, there's a few on the table.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.120
So there's string theory, there's a particular, there's a loop quantum gravity,

40:48.120 --> 40:56.280
which focuses on one particular unification. There's just a bunch of favorite flavors of

40:56.280 --> 41:03.880
different people trying to propose a theory of everything. Eric Weinstein and a bunch of people

41:03.880 --> 41:08.840
throughout history. And then of course, Stephen Wolfram, who I think is one of the only people

41:08.840 --> 41:13.800
doing a discrete. No, no, there's a bunch of physicists who do this right now. And

41:16.120 --> 41:23.800
Topoli and Tomasello and the digital physics is something that is, I think, growing in popularity.

41:24.360 --> 41:34.520
But the main reason why this is interesting is because it is important sometimes to settle

41:34.520 --> 41:38.840
disagreements. I don't think that you need infinities at all and you never needed them.

41:39.720 --> 41:43.320
You can always deal with very large numbers and you can deal with limits, right? You are

41:43.320 --> 41:47.640
fine with doing that. You don't need any kind of affinity. You can build your computer algebra

41:47.640 --> 41:51.000
systems just as well without believing in infinity in the first place.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.120
So you're okay with limits?

41:52.680 --> 41:58.920
Yeah. So basically a limit means that something is behaving pretty much the same if you make the

41:58.920 --> 42:03.720
number larger, right? Because it's converging to a certain value and at some point the difference

42:03.720 --> 42:08.760
becomes negligible and you can no longer measure it. And in this sense, you have things that

42:09.960 --> 42:14.600
if you have an n-gon which has enough corners, then it's going to behave like a circle at some

42:14.600 --> 42:19.800
point, right? And it's only going to be in some kind of esoteric thing that cannot exist in a

42:19.800 --> 42:25.000
physical universe that you would be talking about this perfect circle. And now it turns out that

42:25.000 --> 42:29.160
it also wouldn't work in mathematics because you cannot construct mathematics that has infinite

42:29.160 --> 42:35.160
resolution without running into contradictions. So that is itself not that important because

42:35.160 --> 42:39.720
we never did that, right? It's just a thing that some people thought we could. And this leads to

42:39.720 --> 42:45.400
confusion. So for instance, Roger Penrose uses this as an argument to say that there are certain

42:45.400 --> 42:52.280
things that mathematicians can do dealing with infinities and by extension our mind can do

42:53.160 --> 42:55.080
that computers cannot do.

42:55.080 --> 43:02.200
Yeah, he talks about that the human mind can do certain mathematical things that the computer

43:02.200 --> 43:08.840
has defined by the universal Turing machine cannot. So that it has to do with infinity.

43:08.840 --> 43:14.280
Yes, it's one of the things. So he is basically pointing at the fact that there are things that

43:14.280 --> 43:24.120
are possible in the mathematical mind and in pure mathematics that are not possible in machines that

43:24.120 --> 43:29.800
can be constructed in the physical universe. And because he is an honest guy, he thinks this

43:29.800 --> 43:34.760
means that present physics cannot explain operations that happen in our mind.

43:34.760 --> 43:40.680
Do you think he's right? So let's leave his discussion of consciousness aside for the moment.

43:40.680 --> 43:46.280
Do you think he's right about just what he's basically referring to as intelligence? So

43:47.960 --> 43:53.880
is the human mind fundamentally more capable as a thinking machine than a universal Turing machine?

43:53.960 --> 44:01.240
No. So he's suggesting that, right? So our mind is actually less than a Turing machine. There can

44:01.240 --> 44:06.840
be no Turing machine because it's defined as having an infinite tape and we always only have a finite

44:06.840 --> 44:11.960
tape. But he's saying it's better. Or minds can only perform finitely many operations. He can do

44:11.960 --> 44:15.960
the kind of computation that the Turing machine cannot. And that's because he thinks that our

44:15.960 --> 44:22.440
minds can do operations that have infinite resolution in some sense. And I don't think

44:22.520 --> 44:26.920
that's the case. Our minds are just able to discover these limit operators over too many

44:26.920 --> 44:37.400
parts to count. What about his idea that consciousness is more than a computation?

44:37.400 --> 44:43.720
So it's more than something that a Turing machine can do. So again, saying that there's

44:43.720 --> 44:47.560
something special about our mind, they cannot be replicated in the machine.

44:48.520 --> 44:55.240
The issue is that I don't even know how to construct a language to express this statement

44:55.240 --> 45:08.120
correctly. Well, the basic statement is there's a human experience that includes intelligence,

45:08.120 --> 45:13.960
that includes self-awareness, that includes the hard problem of consciousness. And the question is,

45:13.960 --> 45:20.840
can that be fully simulated in the computer, in the mathematical model of the computer,

45:20.840 --> 45:30.600
as we understand it today? Roger Prenos says no. So the universal Turing machine cannot

45:30.600 --> 45:36.440
simulate the universe. So the interesting question is, and you have to ask him this, is why not?

45:36.440 --> 45:42.200
What is this specific thing that cannot be modeled? And when I looked at his writings,

45:42.200 --> 45:48.040
and I haven't read all of it, but when I read, for instance, the section that he writes in the

45:48.040 --> 45:54.760
introduction and wrote to infinity, the thing that he specifically refers to is the way in which

45:54.760 --> 46:01.800
human minds deal with infinities. And that itself can, I think, easily be deconstructed.

46:02.920 --> 46:07.480
A lot of people feel that our experience cannot be explained in a mechanical way.

46:08.440 --> 46:14.600
And therefore, it needs to be different. And I concur, our experience is not mechanical. Our

46:14.600 --> 46:19.480
experience is simulated. It exists only in assimilation. The only assimilation can be

46:19.480 --> 46:23.960
conscious. Physical systems cannot be conscious because they're only mechanical. Cells cannot

46:23.960 --> 46:28.040
be conscious. Neurons cannot be conscious. Brains cannot be conscious. People cannot be

46:28.040 --> 46:33.880
conscious as far as you, if you understand them as physical systems. What can be conscious is

46:33.960 --> 46:38.600
the story of the system in the world where you write all these things into the story.

46:39.240 --> 46:43.480
You have experiences for the same reason that a character and novel have experiences because

46:43.480 --> 46:49.240
it's written into the story. And now the system is acting on that story. And it's not a story that

46:49.240 --> 46:53.560
is written in a natural language. It's written in a perceptual language, in this multimedia

46:53.560 --> 46:59.240
language of the game engine. And in there, you write in what kind of experience you have,

46:59.240 --> 47:02.840
and what this means for the behavior of the system, for your behavior tendencies,

47:02.840 --> 47:06.920
for your focus, for your attention, for your experience of valence and so on. And

47:06.920 --> 47:11.480
this is being used to inform the behavior of the system in the next step. And then the

47:12.840 --> 47:17.640
story updates with the reactions of the system and the changes in the world and so on.

47:17.640 --> 47:21.240
And you live inside of that model. You don't live inside of the physical reality.

47:23.400 --> 47:30.680
And I mean, just to linger on it, like, you see, okay, it's in the perceptual language,

47:30.680 --> 47:36.840
the multimodal perceptual language, that's the experience. That's what consciousness is within

47:36.840 --> 47:45.160
that, within that model, within that story. But do you have agency? When you play a video game,

47:45.160 --> 47:51.000
you can turn left and you can turn right in that story. So in that dream world,

47:51.000 --> 47:56.200
how much control do you have? Is there such a thing as you in that story?

47:57.160 --> 48:02.680
Like, is it right to say the main character, you know, everybody's NPCs, and then there's the main

48:02.680 --> 48:08.600
character, and you're controlling the main character? Or is that an illusion? Is there a main

48:08.600 --> 48:13.320
character that you're controlling? I'm getting to the point of like, the free will point.

48:13.320 --> 48:19.160
Imagine that you are building a robot that plays soccer. And you've been to MIT computer science,

48:19.160 --> 48:25.080
you basically know how to do that. Right. And so you would say the robot is an agent that solves

48:25.640 --> 48:30.680
the control problem. How to get the ball into the goal. And it needs to perceive the world and

48:30.680 --> 48:35.000
the world is disturbing him in trying to do this. Right. So he has to control many variables to make

48:35.000 --> 48:40.040
that happen and to project itself and the ball into the future and understand its position on

48:40.040 --> 48:46.040
the field relative to the ball and so on in the position of its limbs or in the space around it

48:46.040 --> 48:50.280
and so on. So it needs to have an adequate model that abstracting reality in a useful way.

48:51.240 --> 48:57.320
And you could say that this robot does have agency over what it's doing in some sense.

48:58.280 --> 49:03.320
And the model is going to be a control model. And inside of that control model, you can

49:04.280 --> 49:09.320
possibly get to a point where this thing is sufficiently abstract to discover its own agency.

49:09.320 --> 49:13.000
Our current robots don't do that. They don't have a unified model of the universe.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
But there's not a reason why we shouldn't be getting there at some point in the

49:17.000 --> 49:23.400
not too distant future. And once that happens, you will notice that the robot tells a story about

49:23.400 --> 49:30.600
the robot playing soccer. So the robot will experience itself playing soccer in a simulation

49:30.600 --> 49:37.320
of the world that it uses to construct a model of the locations of its legs and limbs in space on

49:37.320 --> 49:41.400
the field with relationship to the ball. And it's not going to be at the level of the molecules.

49:42.120 --> 49:47.320
It will be an abstraction that is exactly at the level that is most suitable for past planning

49:47.320 --> 49:52.280
of the movements of the robot. It's going to be a high level abstraction, but a very useful one

49:52.280 --> 49:57.400
that is as predictive as we can make it. And in that side of that story, there is a model of

49:57.400 --> 50:04.680
the agency of that system. So this model can accurately predict that the contents of the model

50:04.680 --> 50:08.760
are going to be driving the behavior of the robot in the immediate future.

50:08.760 --> 50:16.120
But there's the hard problem of consciousness, which I would also, there's a subjective experience

50:16.120 --> 50:22.520
of free will as well, that I'm not sure where the robot gets that where that little leap is.

50:22.520 --> 50:27.080
Because for me right now, everything I imagine with that robot, as it gets more and more and

50:27.080 --> 50:35.000
more sophisticated, the agency comes from the programmer of the robot still of what was programmed

50:35.000 --> 50:40.200
in. You would probably do an end to end learning system. You maybe need to give it a few priors,

50:40.200 --> 50:44.200
so you nudge the architecture in the right direction that it converges more quickly.

50:44.200 --> 50:49.320
But ultimately, discovering the suitable hyperparameters of the architecture is also only a

50:49.320 --> 50:55.240
search process, right? And as the search process was evolution, it has informed our brain architecture

50:55.240 --> 51:00.200
so we can converge in a single lifetime on useful interaction with the world and the formation of

51:00.280 --> 51:06.280
the problem is if we define hyperparameters broadly, so it's not just the parameters that

51:06.280 --> 51:10.680
control this end to end learning system, but the entirety of the design of the robot.

51:13.320 --> 51:17.240
You have to remove the human completely from the picture and then in order to build the robot,

51:17.240 --> 51:22.520
you have to create an entire universe because you have to go, you can't just shortcut evolution,

51:22.520 --> 51:26.760
you have to go from the very beginning in order for it to have, because I feel like there's always

51:26.760 --> 51:34.280
a human pulling the strings and that makes it seem like the robot is cheating, it's getting a

51:34.280 --> 51:38.520
shortcut to consciousness. And you are looking at the current Boston Dynamics robots, it doesn't

51:38.520 --> 51:42.760
look as if there is somebody pulling the strings, it doesn't look like cheating anymore. Okay, so

51:42.760 --> 51:47.000
let's go there because I got to talk to you about this. So obviously with the case of Boston Dynamics,

51:47.640 --> 51:54.440
as you may or may not know, it's always either hard coded or remote controlled. There's no

51:54.440 --> 51:59.000
intelligence. So I don't know how the current generation of Boston Dynamics robots works,

51:59.000 --> 52:04.440
but what I've been told about the previous ones was that it's basically all cybernetic control,

52:05.080 --> 52:11.000
which means you still have feedback mechanisms and so on, but it's not deep learning for the most

52:11.000 --> 52:16.840
part as it's currently done. It's for the most part just identifying a control hierarchy

52:16.840 --> 52:21.480
that is congruent to the limbs that exist and the parameters that need to be optimized for

52:21.480 --> 52:25.560
the movement of these limbs. And then there is a convergence progress. So it's basically just

52:25.560 --> 52:29.560
regression that you would need to control this. But again, I don't know whether that's true. That's

52:29.560 --> 52:34.360
just what I've been told about how that works. We have to separate several levels of discussions

52:34.360 --> 52:40.840
here. So the only thing they do is pretty sophisticated control with no machine learning

52:40.840 --> 52:48.040
in order to maintain balance or to write itself. It's a control problem in terms of

52:48.040 --> 52:53.560
using the actuators to when it's pushed or when it steps on a thing that's uneven,

52:53.560 --> 52:58.040
how to always maintain balance. And there's a tricky heuristics around that, but

52:59.080 --> 53:04.600
that's the only goal. Everything you see Boston Dynamics doing in terms of that to us humans

53:04.600 --> 53:11.800
is compelling, which is any kind of higher order movement like turning, wiggling its butt,

53:12.520 --> 53:21.640
like jumping back and it's two feet dancing. Dancing is even worse because dancing is hard

53:21.640 --> 53:29.080
coded in. It's choreographed by humans. There's choreography software. So there is no, of all

53:29.080 --> 53:35.800
that high level movement, there's no anything that you can call, certainly can't call AI.

53:35.880 --> 53:44.360
There's no even like basic heuristics. It's all hard coded in. And yet we humans immediately

53:44.360 --> 53:52.520
project agency onto them, which is fascinating. So the gap here is it doesn't necessarily have

53:52.520 --> 53:57.320
agency. What it has is cybernetic control. And the cybernetic control means you have a hierarchy

53:57.320 --> 54:02.600
of feedback loops that keep the behavior in certain boundaries so the robot doesn't fall over and it's

54:02.600 --> 54:07.800
able to perform the movements. And the choreography cannot really happen with motion capture,

54:07.800 --> 54:11.400
because the robot would fall over because the physics of the robot, the weight distribution

54:11.400 --> 54:17.480
and so on is different from the weight distribution in the human body. So if you were using the

54:17.480 --> 54:21.960
directly motion captured movements of a human body to project it into this robot, it wouldn't

54:21.960 --> 54:25.960
work. You can do this with a computer animation that will look a little bit off, but who cares.

54:25.960 --> 54:32.200
But if you want to correct for the physics, you need to basically tell the robot where it should

54:32.280 --> 54:38.200
move, its limbs. And then the control algorithm is going to approximate a solution that makes

54:38.200 --> 54:43.960
it possible within the physics of the robot. And you have to find the basic solution for

54:43.960 --> 54:49.000
making that happen. And there's probably going to be some regression necessary to get the control

54:49.000 --> 54:54.280
architecture to make these movements. But those two layers are separate. So the thing,

54:54.280 --> 54:59.640
the higher level instruction of how you should move and where you should move is the higher

54:59.720 --> 55:04.200
level. I expect that the control level of these robots at some level is dumb. This is just the

55:05.000 --> 55:09.720
physical control movement, the motor architecture. But it's a relatively smart motor

55:09.720 --> 55:13.640
architecture. It's just that there is no high level deliberation about what decisions to make

55:13.640 --> 55:19.400
necessarily. But it doesn't feel like free will or consciousness. No, that was not where I was

55:19.400 --> 55:26.200
trying to get to. I think that in our own body, we have that too. So we have a certain thing that

55:26.280 --> 55:30.520
is basically just a cybernetic control architecture that is moving our limbs.

55:31.240 --> 55:36.280
And deep learning can help in discovering such an architecture if you don't have it in the first

55:36.280 --> 55:41.400
place. If you already know your hardware, you can maybe handcraft it. But if you don't know your

55:41.400 --> 55:46.920
hardware, you can search for such an architecture. And this work already existed in the 80s and 90s,

55:46.920 --> 55:51.160
people were starting to search for control architectures by motor babbling and so on and

55:51.160 --> 55:57.480
just use reinforcement learning architectures to discover such a thing. And now imagine that you

55:57.480 --> 56:03.640
have the cybernetic control architecture already inside of you. And you extend this a little bit.

56:03.640 --> 56:10.760
So you are seeking output, for instance, or rest or and so on. And you get to have a baby at some

56:10.760 --> 56:17.160
point. And now you add more and more control layers to this. And the system is reverse

56:17.160 --> 56:23.000
engineering its own control architecture and builds a high level model to synchronize the

56:23.000 --> 56:28.120
pursuit of very different conflicting goals. And this is how I think you get to purposes.

56:28.120 --> 56:32.760
Purposes are models of your goals. The goals may be intrinsic as the result of the different

56:32.760 --> 56:38.120
set point violations that you have, hunger and thirst for very different things and rest and

56:38.120 --> 56:43.080
pain avoidance and so on. And you put all these things together and eventually you need to come

56:43.160 --> 56:49.240
up with a strategy to synchronize them all. And you don't need just to do this alone by yourself

56:49.240 --> 56:54.040
because we are state building organisms. We cannot function as an isolation the way that

56:54.040 --> 56:59.800
Homo sapiens is set up. So our own behavior only makes sense when you zoom out very far

56:59.800 --> 57:06.440
into a society or even into ecosystemic intelligence on the planet and our place in it.

57:06.440 --> 57:10.760
So the individual behavior only makes sense in these larger contexts. And we have a number of

57:10.760 --> 57:16.040
priors built into us. So we are behaving as if we are acting on these high level goals pretty

57:16.040 --> 57:21.480
much right from the start. And eventually in the course of our life, we can reverse engineer the

57:21.480 --> 57:26.840
goals that we are acting on what actually are our higher level purposes. And the more we understand

57:26.840 --> 57:32.360
that the more our behavior makes sense. But this is all at this point, complex stories within stories

57:32.360 --> 57:39.160
that are driving our behavior. Yeah, I just don't know how big of a leap it is to start

57:40.120 --> 57:42.600
creating a system that's able to tell stories within stories.

57:44.200 --> 57:47.560
Like how big of a leap that is from where currently Boston Dynamics is

57:48.120 --> 57:57.000
or any robot that's operating in the physical space. And that leap might be big if it requires

57:57.000 --> 58:00.840
to solve the hard problem of consciousness, which is telling a hell of a good story.

58:01.400 --> 58:06.200
I suspect that consciousness itself is relatively simple. What's hard is perception

58:07.160 --> 58:09.320
and the interface between perception and reasoning.

58:10.920 --> 58:16.440
There's, for instance, the idea of the consciousness prior that would be built into such a system by

58:17.080 --> 58:24.920
Yoshua Bengio. And what he describes, and I think that's accurate, is that our own

58:26.360 --> 58:30.200
model of the world can be described through something like an energy function. The energy

58:30.200 --> 58:35.080
function is modeling the contradictions that exist within the model at any given point. And you try

58:35.080 --> 58:40.360
to minimize these contradictions, the tangents in the model. And to do this, you need to sometimes

58:40.360 --> 58:45.560
test things. You need to conditionally disambiguate figure and ground. You need to distinguish

58:45.560 --> 58:49.400
whether this is true or that is true. And so on. Eventually, you get to an interpretation,

58:49.400 --> 58:54.520
but you will need to manually depress a few points in your model to let it snap into a state that

58:54.520 --> 58:58.680
makes sense. And this function that tries to get the biggest dip in the energy function in your

58:58.680 --> 59:03.480
model, according to Yoshua Bengio, is related to consciousness. It's a low dimensional

59:03.480 --> 59:08.040
discrete function that tries to maximize this dip in the energy function.

59:09.640 --> 59:15.480
Yeah, I think I would need to get into details because I think the way he uses the word consciousness

59:15.480 --> 59:21.560
is more akin to self-awareness, like modeling yourself within the world, as opposed to the

59:21.560 --> 59:27.160
subjective experience, the hard problem. No, it's not even the self within the world. The self is

59:27.160 --> 59:31.560
the agent and you don't need to be aware of yourself in order to be conscious. The self is

59:31.640 --> 59:37.080
just a particular content that you can have, but you don't have to have. But you can be conscious

59:37.080 --> 59:42.200
in, for instance, a dream at night or during a meditation state where you don't have a self,

59:43.080 --> 59:47.800
where you're just aware of the fact that you are aware. And what we mean by consciousness

59:47.800 --> 59:54.920
and colloquial sense is largely this reflexive self-awareness, that we become aware of the

59:54.920 --> 59:59.160
fact that we are paying attention, that we are the thing that pays attention.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:06.600
We are the thing that pays attention. I don't see the awareness that we're aware.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:13.960
The hard problem doesn't feel like it's solved. It's called a hard problem for a reason,

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.360
because it seems like there needs to be a major leap.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:24.360
Yeah, I think the major leap is to understand how it is possible that a machine can dream,

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.920
that a physical system is able to create a representation, that a physical system is acting

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:36.600
on and that is spun force and so on. But once you accept the fact that you are not in physics,

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.560
but that you exist inside of the story, I think the mystery disappears. Everything is possible

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.720
in a story. You exist inside the story. Your consciousness is being written into the story.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:49.720
The fact that you experience things is written to the story. You ask yourself,

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.240
is this real what I'm seeing? And your brain writes into the story, yes, it's real.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:01:01.640
So what about the perception of consciousness? So to me, you look conscious. So the illusion

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:07.640
of consciousness, the demonstration of consciousness, I ask for the legged robot,

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:13.560
how do we make this legged robot conscious? So there's two things that maybe you can tell me

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:20.440
if they're neighboring ideas. One is actually making conscious and the other is make it appear

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:28.600
conscious to others. Are those related? Let's ask from the other direction, what would it take to

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:36.120
make you not conscious? So when you are thinking about how you perceive the world, can you decide

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:43.800
to switch from looking at qualia to looking at representational states? And it turns out you

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:49.480
can. There is a particular way in which you can look at the world and recognize its machine

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:54.760
nature, including your own. And in that state, you don't have that conscious experience in this way

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:03.000
anymore. It becomes apparent as a representation. Everything becomes opaque. And I think this

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.440
thing that you recognize everything as a representation, this is typically what we

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:13.240
mean with enlightenment states. And you can have a motivational level, but you can also do this on

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:18.280
the experiential level and the perceptual level. See, but then I can come back to a conscious state.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:29.240
Okay, I particularly, I'm referring to the social aspect that the demonstration of consciousness

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:37.240
is a really nice thing at a party when you're trying to meet a new person. It's a nice thing to

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:43.320
know that they're conscious and they can, I don't know how fundamental consciousness is in human

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:50.200
interaction, but it seems like to be at least an important part. And I asked that in the same kind

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:58.440
of way for robots, you know, in order to create a rich, compelling human robot interaction, it

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.720
feels like there needs to be elements of consciousness within that interaction.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:08.680
My cat is obviously conscious. And so my cat can do this party trick. She also knows that I am

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:13.640
conscious. We are able to have feedback about the fact that we are both acting on models of our

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:21.400
own awareness. The question is, how hard is it for the robot artificially created robot to achieve

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:29.000
cat level in party tricks? Yes. So the issue for me is currently not so much on how to build a system

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.760
that creates a story about a robot that lives in the world, but to make an adequate representation

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:42.440
of the world. And the model that you and me have is a unified one. It's one where you basically

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.000
make sense of everything that you can perceive every feature in the world that enters your

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.080
perception can be relationally mapped to a unified model of everything. And we don't have an AI that

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.760
is able to construct such a unified model yet. So you need that unified model to do the party trick?

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.200
Yes, I think that it doesn't make sense if this thing is conscious, but not in the same universe

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.640
because you could not relate to each other. So what's the process, would you say, of engineering

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:17.800
consciousness in a machine? What are the ideas here? So you probably want to have some kind of

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.320
perceptual system. This perceptual system is a processing agent that is able to track sensory

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.400
data and predict the next frame and the sensory data from the previous frames of the sensory

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.600
data in the current state of the system. So the current state of the system is in perception

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:39.720
instrumental to predicting what happens next. And this means you build lots and lots of functions

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.840
that take all the blips that you feel on your skin and that you see on your retina or that you hear

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:51.080
and puts them into a set of relationships that allows you to predict what kind of sensory data,

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.960
what kind of sensor of blips, your vector of blips, you're going to perceive in the next frame.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:05:00.920
This is tuned and it's constantly tuned until it gets as accurate as it can.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:08.440
You build a very accurate prediction mechanism that is step one of the perceptions. At first,

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.640
you predict, then you perceive and see the error in your prediction.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.880
And you have to do two things to make that happen. One is you have to build a network of

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:22.200
relationships that are constraints, that take all the variants in the world, put each of the

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:27.880
variances into a variable that is connected with relationships to other variables.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:31.720
And these relationships are computable functions that constrain each other. So when you see a

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:36.120
nose that points in a certain direction in space, you have a constraint that says there

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.280
should be a phase nearby that has the same direction. And if that is not the case,

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.560
you have some kind of contradiction that you need to resolve because it's probably not a

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.600
nose what you're looking at. It just looks like one. So you have to reinterpret the data and

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.720
until you get to a point where your model converges.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:57.400
And this process of making the sensory data fit into your model structure is what

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:03.960
Piaget calls the assimilation. And echomodation is the change of the models

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.000
where you change your model such a way that you can assimilate everything.

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:12.280
So you're talking about building a hell of an awesome perception system

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.960
that's able to do prediction and perception correct and improving.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.040
Wait, there's more. Yes, there's more. So the first thing that we wanted to do is we want to

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.920
minimize the contradictions in the model. And of course, it's very easy to make a model in which

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:31.320
you minimize the contradictions just by allowing that it can be in many, many possible states.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:36.360
Right? So if you increase degrees of freedom, you will have fewer contradictions. But you also

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.600
want to reduce the degrees of freedom because degrees of freedom mean uncertainty. You want

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:46.600
your model to reduce uncertainty as much as possible. But reducing uncertainty is expensive.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:52.440
So you have to have a trade-off between minimizing contradictions and reducing uncertainty.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:57.640
And you have only a finite amount of compute and experimental time and effort available to

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:03.160
reduce uncertainty in the world. So you need to assign value to what you observe. So you need

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.200
some kind of motivational system that is estimating what you should be looking at and what you

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.960
should be thinking about it, how you should be applying your resources to model what that is.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.760
Right? So you need to have something like convergence links that tell you how to get

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.680
from the present state of the model to the next one. You need to have these compatibility links

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:27.320
that tell you which constraints exist and which constraint violations exist. And you need to have

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.720
some kind of motivational system that tells you what to pay attention to. So now we have a second

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.280
agent next to the perceptual agent. We have a motivational agent. This is a cybernetic system

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:41.160
that is modeling what the system needs, what's important for the system, and that interacts

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.120
with the perceptual system to maximize the expected reward. And you're saying the motivational system

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:52.840
is some kind of, like, what is it, a high-level narrative over some lower level? No, it's just

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:57.320
your brainstem stuff, the limbic system stuff that tells you, okay, now you should get something

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.920
to eat because I've just measured your geo blood sugar. So you mean the motivational system,

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.400
like the lower level stuff, like Hungary? Yes. But there's basically a physiological

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.840
needs and some cognitive needs and some social needs, and they all interact. And they're all

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:12.920
implemented at different parts in your nervous system as the motivational system. But they're

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:18.520
basically cybernetic feedback loops. It's not that complicated. It's just a lot of code. And

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:24.520
so you now have a motivational agent that makes your robot go for the ball or that makes your warm

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:30.040
go to eat food and so on. And you have the perceptual system that lets it predicts the

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.760
environment so it's able to solve that control problem to some degree. And now what we learned

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.520
is that it's very hard to build a machine learning system that looks at all the data

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:43.800
simultaneously to see what kind of relationships could exist between them. So you need to

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.280
selectively model the world. You need to figure out, where can I make the biggest difference

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:53.000
if I would put the following things together? Sometimes you find a gradient for that, right?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
When you have a gradient, you don't need to remember where you came from. You just follow

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.320
the gradient until it doesn't get any better. But if you have a world where the problems are

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:07.240
discontinuous and the search spaces are discontinuous, you need to retain memory of what you explored.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:13.000
You need to construct a plan of what to explore next. And this thing that means that you have

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.840
next to this perceptual construction system and the motivational cybernetics,

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:23.320
an agent that is paying attention to what it should select at any given moment to maximize

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:29.000
reward. And this scanning system, this attention agent is required for consciousness. And

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:36.440
consciousness is its control model. So it's the index memories that this thing retains when it

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:43.080
manipulates the perceptual representations to maximize the value and minimize the conflicts and

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.960
it to increase coherence. So the purpose of consciousness is to create coherence in your

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:53.320
perceptual representations, remove conflicts, predict the future, construct counterfactual

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:58.680
representations so you can coordinate your actions and so on. And in order to do this,

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.240
it needs to form memories. These memories are partial binding states of the working memory

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.920
contents that are being revisited later on to backtrack, to undo certain states to look for

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.200
alternatives. And these index memories that you can recall, that is what you perceive as your

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.320
stream of consciousness. And being able to recall these memories, this is what makes you conscious.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.440
If you could not remember what you paid attention to, you wouldn't be conscious.

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.480
So consciousness is the index in the memory database. Okay.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:38.040
But let me sneak up to the questions of consciousness a little further. So we usually

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.040
relate suffering to consciousness. So the capacity to suffer.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.640
I think to me, that's a really strong sign of consciousness, is a thing that can suffer.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:58.440
How is that useful? Suffering. And like in your model, what you just described,

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.480
which is indexing of memories, and what is the coherence with the perception,

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.040
with this predictive thing that's going on in the perception, how does suffering relate to any of

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.760
that, the higher level of suffering that humans do?

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:23.320
Basically, pain is a reinforcement signal. Pain is a signal that one part of your brain

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:28.200
sends to another part of your brain, or an abstract sense, part of your mind sends to

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.520
another part of the mind to regulate its behavior, to tell it the behavior that you're

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:38.920
currently exhibiting should be improved. And this is a signal that I tell you to move away

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.920
from what you're currently doing and push into a different direction. So pain gives you a part

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:50.760
of you an impulse to do something differently. But sometimes this doesn't work, because the

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.800
training part of your brain is talking to the wrong region. Or because it has the wrong model

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.400
of the relationships in the world, maybe you're mismodeling yourself or you're mismodeling the

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.800
relationship of yourself to the world or you're mismodeling the dynamics of the world. So you're

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.520
trying to improve something that cannot be improved by generating more pain. But the system

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:13.880
doesn't have any alternative. So it doesn't get better. What do you do if something doesn't get

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.600
better and you want it to get better? You increase the strengths of the signal. And when the signal

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.320
becomes chronic, when it becomes permanent, without a change inside, this is what we call suffering.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.640
And the purpose of consciousness is to deal with contradictions, with things that cannot be resolved.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:35.640
The purpose of consciousness, I think, is similar to a conductor in an orchestra. When everything

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.680
works well, the orchestra doesn't need much of a conductor as long as it's coherent. But when

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.120
there is a lack of coherence or something is consistently producing disharmony and mismatches,

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.080
then the conductor becomes alert and interacts with it. So suffering attracts the activity

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.600
of our consciousness. And the purpose of that is ideally that we bring new layers online,

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:03.400
new layers of modeling that are able to create a model of the dysregulation so we can deal with it.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:09.240
And this means that we typically get higher level consciousness, so to speak. We get some

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:13.640
consciousness above our pay grade, maybe, if we have some suffering early in our life. Most of the

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:19.880
interesting people had trauma early on in their childhood. And trauma means that you are suffering

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.320
an injury for which the system is not prepared, which it cannot deal with, which it cannot insulate

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.760
itself from. So something breaks. And this means that the behavior of the system is permanently

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:38.600
disturbed in a way that some mismatch exists now in a regulation that just by following your

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.920
impulse, by following the pain in the direction where it hurts, your situation doesn't improve

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:49.480
but get worse. And so what needs to happen is that you grow up. And that part that is grown up

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:53.160
is able to deal with the part that is stuck in this earlier phase.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.720
Yeah, so it leads to growth, adding extra layers to your cognition.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.560
Let me ask you then, because I gotta stick on suffering, the ethics of the whole thing.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:12.360
So not our consciousness, but the consciousness of others. You've tweeted, one of my biggest fears

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:18.680
is that insects could be conscious. The amount of suffering on earth would be unthinkable.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:30.520
So when we think of other conscious beings, is suffering a property of consciousness that we're

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:42.680
most concerned about? So I'm still thinking about robots, how to make sense of other non-human things

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:52.760
that appear to have the depth of experience that humans have. And to me, that means consciousness

01:14:52.760 --> 01:15:00.680
and the darkest side of that, which is suffering, the capacity to suffer. And so I started thinking,

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:06.920
how much responsibility do we have for those other conscious beings? That's where the

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:14.600
the definition of consciousness becomes most urgent. Like having to come up with the definition of

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:21.160
consciousness becomes most urgent, is who should we and should we not be torturing?

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.960
There's no general answer to this. Was Chinggis Khan doing anything wrong?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.080
It depends on how you look at it. Well, he drew a line somewhere

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:44.680
where this is us and that's them. It's the circle of empathy. You don't have to use the word consciousness,

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:51.240
but these are the things that matter to me if they suffer or not, and these are the things that

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.680
don't matter to me. Yeah, but when one of his commanders failed him, he broke his spine and

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:03.080
let him die in a horrible way. And so in some sense, I think he was indifferent to suffering.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:09.240
Or he was not indifferent in the sense that he didn't see it as useful if he inflicted suffering.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.320
But he did not see it as something that had to be avoided. That was not the goal.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:21.160
The question was, how can I use suffering and the infliction of suffering to reach my goals

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:28.200
from his perspective? I see. So like different societies throughout history put different value

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:34.520
on the different individuals, different psychies, but also even the objective of avoiding suffering.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:42.600
Some societies probably, I mean, this is where religious belief really helps that after life,

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.720
that doesn't matter that you suffer or die. What matters is you suffer honorably,

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:54.280
right? So that you enter the afterlife. It seems to be superstitious to me. Basically,

01:16:54.280 --> 01:17:02.120
beliefs that assert things for which no evidence exists are incompatible with sound epistemology.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:06.040
And I don't think that religion has to be superstitious. Otherwise, it should be condemned

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.200
in all cases. You're somebody who's saying, we live in a dream world, we have zero evidence for

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:16.760
anything. It's not the case. They are limits to what languages can be constructed. Mathematics

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:23.160
breaks solid evidence for its own structure. And once we have some idea of what languages exist

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:28.200
and how a system can learn and what learning itself is in the first place, and so on, we can

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:35.080
begin to realize that our intuitions, that we are able to learn about the regularities of the world

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.600
and minimize surprise and understand the nature of our own agency to some degree of abstraction,

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:47.000
that's not an illusion. So useful approximation. Just because we live in a dream world doesn't

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:54.840
mean mathematics can't give us a consistent glimpse of physical, of objective reality.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:18:01.640
We can basically distinguish useful encodings from useless encodings. And when we apply our

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:06.680
truths seeking to the world, we know we usually cannot find out whether a certain thing is true.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.240
What we typically do is we take the state vector of the universe, separate it into

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.800
separate objects that interact with each other, so interfaces. And this distinction that we are

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.960
making is not completely arbitrary. It's done to optimize the compression that we can apply

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:27.160
to our models of the universe. So we can predict what's happening with our limited resources.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:32.360
In this sense, it's not arbitrary. But the separation of the world into objects that are

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:37.400
somehow discrete and interacting with each other is not the true reality. The boundaries

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.040
between the objects are projected into the world, not arbitrarily projected, but still,

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.080
it's only an approximation of what's actually the case.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.200
And we sometimes notice that we run into contradictions when we try to understand

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:55.880
high-level things like economic aspects of the world and so on, or political aspects or

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.200
psychological aspects where we make simplifications. And the objects that we are using to separate

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:06.120
the world are just one of many possible projections of what's going on. And so it's not in this

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.200
postmodernist sense completely arbitrary, and you're free to pick what you want or dismiss

01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:15.320
what you don't like because it's all stories. No, that's not true. You have to show for every model

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.320
of how well it predicts the world. So the confidence that you should have in the

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.080
entities of your models should correspond to the evidence that you have.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:33.320
Can I ask you in a small tangent to talk about your favorite set of ideas and people,

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:44.440
which is postmodernism? What is postmodernism? How would you define it? And why, to you,

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:51.560
is it not a useful framework of thought? Postmodernism is something that I'm really

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:59.000
not an expert on. And postmodernism is a set of philosophical ideas that is difficult to lump

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:06.280
together, that is characterized by some useful thinkers, some of them poststructuralists and so

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:11.720
on. And I'm mostly not interested in it because I think that it's not leading me anywhere that I

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:17.880
find particularly useful. It's mostly, I think, born out of the insight that the ontologies

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:23.000
that we impose on the world are not literally true, and that we can often get to a different

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.400
interpretation by the world by using a different ontology that is different separation of the

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:34.280
world into interacting objects. But the idea that this makes the world a set of stories that are

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:40.600
arbitrary, I think, is wrong. And the people that are engaging in this type of philosophy

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:45.480
are working in an area that I largely don't find productive. There is nothing useful coming out of

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:51.080
this. So this idea that truth is relative is not something that has in some sense informed physics

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:57.000
or theory of relativity. And there is no feedback between those. There is no meaningful influence

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.920
of this type of philosophy on the sciences or on engineering or on politics. But there is a very

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:11.240
strong information of this on ideology, because it basically has become an ideology that is

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:18.120
justifying itself by the notion that truth is a relative concept. And it's not being used in such

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:24.600
a way that the philosophers or sociologists that take up these ideas say, oh, I should doubt my

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.760
own ideas, because maybe my separation of the world into objects is not completely valid. And I

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:35.320
should maybe use a different one and be open to a pluralism of ideas. But it mostly exists to dismiss

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:42.040
the ideas of other people. It becomes a political weapon of sorts to achieve power.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:50.520
Basically, there's nothing wrong, I think, with developing a philosophy around this. But to develop

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:56.520
norms around the idea that truth is something that is completely negotiable is incompatible

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:03.720
with the scientific project. And I think if the academia has no defense against the ideological

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:11.400
parts of the postmodernist movement, it's doomed. Right. You have to acknowledge the ideological

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:17.160
part of any movement, actually, including postmodernism. Well, the question is what an ideology

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:23.960
is. And to me, an ideology is basically a viral memeplex that is changing your mind in such a way

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:28.760
that reality gets warped. It gets warped in such a way that you're being cut off from the rest of

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.960
human thought space. And you cannot consider things outside of the range of ideas of your own

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:38.520
ideology as possibly true. Right. So, I mean, there's certain properties to an ideology that

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:46.440
make it harmful. One of them is that dogmatism of just certainty, dogged certainty in that you're

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:50.600
you have the truth and nobody else does. Yeah. But what is creating this certainty? It's very

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:55.800
interesting to look at the type of model that is being produced. Is it basically just a strong

01:22:55.800 --> 01:23:00.760
prior? And you tell people, oh, this idea that you consider to be very true, the evidence for this

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.320
is actually just much weaker than you thought and look here at some studies. No, this is not how it

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:12.760
works. It's usually normative, which means some thoughts are unthinkable because they would change

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:19.320
your identity into something that is no longer acceptable. And this cuts you off from considering

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:25.000
an alternative. And many de facto religions use this trick to lock people into a certain mode of

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.720
thought. This removes agency over your own thoughts. And it's very ugly to me. It's basically

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:36.200
not just a process of domestication, but it's actually an intellectual castration that happens.

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:40.600
It's an inability to think creatively and to bring forth new thoughts.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:49.960
Can I ask you about substances, chemical substances that affect the video game,

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:58.760
the dream world? So psychedelics that increasing have been getting a lot of research done on them.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:05.160
So in general psychedelics, psilocybin, MDMA, but also a really interesting one, the big one,

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:11.000
which is DMT. What and where are the places that these substances take

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.120
the mind that is operating in the dream world? Do you have an interesting sense how this

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:25.000
throws a wrinkle into the prediction model? Is it just some weird little quirk? Or is there

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.680
some fundamental expansion of the mind going on?

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:37.240
I suspect that a way to look at psychedelics is that they induce particular types of lucid dreaming

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:44.520
states. So it's a state in which certain connections are being severed in your mind and no longer

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:49.880
active. Your mind basically gets free to move in a certain direction because some inhibition,

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:55.240
some particular inhibition doesn't work anymore. And as a result, you might stop having yourself

01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:03.800
or you might stop perceiving the world as three-dimensional. And you can explore that state.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:08.840
And I suppose that for every state that can be induced with psychedelics, there are people that

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:14.200
are naturally in that state. So sometimes psychedelics that shift you through a range of

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:19.000
possible mental states. And they can also shift you out of the range of permissible mental states

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:25.000
that is where you can make predictive models of reality. And what I observe in people that

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.080
use psychedelics a lot is that they tend to be overfitting. Overfitting means that you are

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:39.560
using more bits for modeling the dynamics of a function than you should. And so you can fit

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:44.360
your curve to extremely detailed things in the past, but this model is no longer predictive

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:51.000
for the future. What is it about psychedelics that forces that? I thought it would be the opposite.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:26:02.200
I thought it's a good mechanism for generalization, for regularization. So it feels like psychedelics

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:09.480
expansion of the mind, like forcing your model to be non-predictive is a good thing.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:17.640
Meaning like it's almost like, okay, what I would say is psychedelics I akin to is traveling to a

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:22.760
totally different environment. Like going if you've never been to like India or something like that

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.720
from the United States. Very different set of people, different culture, different food, different

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:34.440
roads and values and all those kinds of things. So psychedelics can for instance teleport people

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:41.240
into a universe that is hyperbolic, which means that if you imagine a room that you are in,

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.240
you can turn around 360 degrees and you didn't go full circle. You need to go

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.760
20 degrees to go full circle. Exactly. So the things that people learn in that state

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.640
cannot be easily transferred in this universe that we are in. It could be that if they're able

01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:01.000
to abstract and understand what happened to them, that they understand that some part of their spatial

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.200
cognition has been desynchronized and has found a different synchronization. And this different

01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:10.280
synchronization happens to be a hyperbolic one, right? So you learn something interesting about

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.520
your brain. It's difficult to understand what exactly happened, but we get a pretty good idea

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.400
once we understand how the brain is representing geometry. Yeah, but doesn't give you a fresh

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:29.880
perspective on the physical reality? Who's making that sound? Is it inside my head or is it external?

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:37.560
Well, there is no sound outside of your mind, but it's making sense. Phenomenal physics.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:46.200
Yeah, in the physical reality, there's sound waves traveling through air. Okay.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:50.360
That's our model of what happened. That's our model of what happened. Right.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.520
Don't second-hand, let's give you a fresh perspective on this physical reality.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:02.600
Like, not this physical reality, but this more...

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.800
What do you call the dream world that's mapped directly to it?

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.240
The purpose of dreaming at night, I think, is data augmentation.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.400
Exactly. So that's very different. That's very similar to second-hand.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:24.040
Exchange parameters about the things that you have learned. And for instance, when you are young,

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.600
you have seen things from certain perspectives, but not from others. So your brain is generating

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:33.720
new perspectives of objects that you already know, which means they can learn to recognize them

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:38.280
later from different perspectives. And I suspect that's the reason why many of us remember to have

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.880
flying dreams as children, because it's just different perspectives of the world that you

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:48.440
already know, and that it starts to generate these different perspective changes, and then it

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.920
fluidly turns this into a flying dream to make sense of what's happening. So you fill in the

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:58.200
gaps, and suddenly you see yourself flying. And similar things can happen with semantic

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.400
relationships. So it's not just spatial relationships, but it can also be the

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:07.320
relationships between ideas that are being changed. And it seems that the mechanisms that make that

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:16.360
happen during dreaming are interacting with these same receptors that are being simulated by psychedelics.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:23.160
So I suspect that there is a thing that I haven't read really about, the way in which dreams are

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:28.680
induced in the brain. It's not just that the activity of the brain gets tuned down because

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:34.200
you are somehow, your eyes are closed and you no longer get enough data from your eyes. But there

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:40.040
is a particular type of neurotransmitter that is saturating your brain during these phases,

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:45.880
during the RM phases, and you produce controlled hallucinations. And psychedelics

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:52.760
are linking into these mechanisms, I suspect. So isn't that another trickier form of data

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:59.720
augmentation? Yes. But it's also data augmentation that can happen outside of the specification

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.320
that your brain is tuned to. So basically, people are overclocking their brains,

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.440
and that produces states that are subjectively extremely interesting.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:12.840
Yeah, I just... But from the outset, very suspicious.

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:18.200
So I think I'm over-applying the metaphor of a neural network in my own mind, which

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:26.040
I just think that doesn't lead to overfitting, right? But you were just sort of anecdotally

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:30.360
saying my experiences with people that have no psychedelics are that kind of quality.

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:34.360
I think it typically happens. So if you look at people like Timothy Leary,

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:40.120
and he has written beautiful manifestos about the effect of LSD on people,

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.880
he genuinely believed, he writes on these manifestos, that in the future,

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:48.120
science and art will only be done on psychedelics because it's so much more efficient and so much

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:54.440
better. And he gave LSD to children in this community of a few thousand people that he

01:30:54.440 --> 01:31:01.000
had near San Francisco. And basically, he was losing touch with reality. He did not

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.520
understand the effects that the things that he was doing would have on the reception of psychedelics

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:11.000
by society because he was unable to think critically about what happened. What happened

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.520
was that he got in a euphoric state. That euphoric state happened because he was overfitting.

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:22.520
He was taking this sense of euphoria and translating it into a model of actual success

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:28.760
in the world. He was feeling better. Limitations had disappeared that he experienced to be

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:32.360
existing, but he didn't get superpowers. I understand what you mean by overfitting now.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.400
There's a lot of interpretation to the term overfitting in this case,

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:44.280
but I got you. So he was getting positive rewards from a lot of actions that he shouldn't have.

01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:49.480
But not just this. So if you take, for instance, John Lilly, who was studying dolphin languages

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:54.680
and aliens and so on, a lot of people that used psychedelics became very loopy.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:00.840
And the typical thing that you notice when people are on psychedelics is that they are in a state

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:05.800
where they feel that everything can be explained now. Everything is clear. Everything is obvious.

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:12.520
And sometimes they have indeed discovered a useful connection, but not always. Very often

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:19.400
these connections are over interpretations. I wonder, there's a question of correlation

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:25.480
versus causation. And also, I wonder if it's the psychedelics or if it's more the social,

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:32.280
like being the outsider and having a strong community of outside and having a leadership

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:38.120
position in an outsider cult-like community, that could have a much stronger effect of overfitting

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.320
than do psychedelics themselves, the actual substances, because it's a counterculture thing.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:48.680
So it could be that as opposed to the actual substance. If you're a boring person who wears

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:54.600
a suit and tie and works at a bank and takes psychedelics, that could be a very different

01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:00.760
effect of psychedelics on your mind. I'm just sort of raising the point that the people you

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:06.200
referenced are already weirdos. I'm not sure exactly. No, not necessarily. A lot of the people that

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:13.960
tell me that they use psychedelics in a useful way started out as squares and were liberating

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.360
themselves because they were stuck. They were basically stuck in local optimum of their own

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:23.240
self-model, of their relationship to the world, and suddenly they had data augmentation. They

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:28.440
basically saw an experience, a space of possibilities. They experienced what it would be like to be

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:33.560
another person. And they took important lessons from that experience back home.

01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:44.040
Yeah. I mean, I love the metaphor of data augmentation because that's been the primary

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:50.680
driver of self-supervised learning in the computer vision domain is data augmentation. So it's funny

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:58.280
to think of data augmentation, like chemically induced data augmentation in the human mind.

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:05.800
There's also a very interesting effect that I noticed. I know several people who

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:14.440
sphere to me that LSD has cured their migraines. So severe cluster headaches or migraines that

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.800
didn't respond to standard medication that disappeared after a single dose. And I don't

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:25.640
recommend anybody doing this, especially not in the US where it's illegal. And there are no studies

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:31.000
on this for that reason. But it seems that anecdotally that it basically

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:37.960
can reset the serotonergic system. So it's basically pushing them outside of their normal

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:42.680
boundaries. And as a result, it needs to find a new equilibrium and then some people that

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:47.720
equilibrium is better. But it also follows that in other people, it might be worse. So

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:54.040
if you have a brain that is already teetering on the boundary to psychosis, it can be permanently

01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:57.720
pushed over that boundary. Well, that's why you have to do good science, which they're starting

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:01.480
to do on all these different substances of how it actually works for the different conditions

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:09.400
like MDMA seems to help with PTSD. Same with psilocybin. You need to do good science, meaning

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:15.240
large studies of large N. Yeah. So based on the existing studies with MDMA, it seems that

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:20.360
if you look at Rick Doblin's work and what he has published about this and talks about

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:26.200
MDMA seems to be a psychologically relatively safe drug, but it's physiologically not very

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:32.280
safe. That is, there is neurotoxicity if you would use a too large dose. And if you

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.960
combine this with alcohol, which a lot of kids do in party settings during raves and so on,

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:44.280
it's very hepatotoxic. So basically, you can kill your liver. And this means that it's probably

01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:49.320
something that is best and most productively used in clinical setting by people who really know

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:53.880
what they're doing. And I suspect that's also true for the other psychedelics. That is,

01:35:54.680 --> 01:36:01.080
while the other psychedelics are probably not as toxic as say alcohol, the effects on Nisaki

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:07.000
can be much more profound and lasting. Yeah. Well, as far as I know psilocybin, so mushrooms,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.560
magic mushrooms, as far as I know in terms of the studies they're running, I think have no over,

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:18.920
like they're allowed to do what they're calling heroic doses. So that one does not have a toxicity.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.480
So they can do like huge doses in a clinical setting when they're doing study on psilocybin,

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:29.160
which is kind of fun. Yeah, it seems that most of the psychedelics work in extremely small doses,

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:35.560
which means that the effect on the rest of the body is relatively low. And MDMA is probably the

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.440
exception. Maybe ketamine can be dangerous and larger doses because it can depress breathing and

01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:47.160
so on. But the LSD and psilocybin work in very, very small doses, at least the active part of them

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:54.280
of psilocybin LSD is only the active part. And the, but the effect that it can have on

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.320
your mental wiring can be very dangerous, I think. Let's talk about AI a little bit.

01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:07.080
What are your thoughts about GPT-3 and language models trained with self-supervised learning?

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.400
It came out quite a bit ago, but I wanted to get your thoughts on it. Yeah.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:20.520
In the 90s, I was in New Zealand and I had an amazing professor, Ian Witten,

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:27.640
who realized I was bored in class and put me in his lab. And he gave me the task to discover

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:33.720
grammatical structure in an unknown language. And the unknown language that I picked was English

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:39.640
because it was the easiest one to find a corpus four construct one. And he gave me the largest

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:44.600
computer at the whole university. It had two gigabytes of RAM, which was amazing. And I wrote

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:51.000
everything in C with some in-memory compression to do statistics over the language. And I first

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.920
would create a dictionary of all the words, which basically tokenizes everything and compresses

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:02.920
things so that I don't need to store the whole word, but just a code for every word. And then I

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:09.480
was taking this all apart in sentences. And I was trying to find all the relationships between

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:15.080
all the words in the sentences and do statistics over them. And that proved to be impossible,

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:20.360
because the complexity is just too large. So if you want to discover the relationship

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.360
between an article and a noun, and there are three adjectives in between, you cannot do

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:29.240
n-gram statistics and look at all the possibilities that can exist, at least not with the resources

01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:34.120
that we had back then. So I realized I need to make some statistics over what I need to make

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:41.080
statistics over. So I wrote something that was pretty much a hack that did this for at least

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:45.400
first-order relationships. And I came up with some kind of mutual information graph that was

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:50.440
indeed discovering something that looks exactly like the grammatical structure of the sentence,

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.840
just by trying to encode the sentence in such a way that the words would be written in the

01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:02.520
optimal order inside of the model. And what I also found is that if we would be able to increase

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:08.840
the resolution of that and not just use this model to reproduce grammatically correct sentences,

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:13.480
we would also be able to correct stylistically correct sentences by just having more bits in

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:17.720
these relationships. And if we wanted to have meaning, we would have to go much higher order.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.320
And I didn't know how to make higher order models back then without spending way more years in

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.800
research on how to make the statistics over what we need to make statistics over. And this thing

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:34.040
that we cannot look at the relationships between all the bits in your input is being solved in

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:40.440
different domains in different ways. So in computer graphics, the computer vision standard method

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.680
for many years now is convolutional neural networks. Convolutional neural networks are

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.880
hierarchies of filters that exploit the fact that neighboring pixels in images are usually

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.520
semantically related and distance pixels in images are usually not semantically related.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.000
So you can just by grouping the pixels that are next to each other,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.680
hierarchically together reconstruct the shape of objects. And this is an important prior that

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:09.880
we built into these models so they can converge quickly. But this doesn't work in language for

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:15.480
the reason that adjacent words are often but not always related and distant words are sometimes

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:21.720
related while the words in between are not. So how can you learn the topology of language?

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.840
And I think for this reason that this difficulty existed, the transformer was invented in

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:35.800
natural language processing not in vision. And what the transformer is doing, it's a hierarchy

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:41.480
of layers where every layer learns what to pay attention to in the given context in the previous

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:50.760
layer. So what to make the statistics over. And the context is significantly larger than the adjacent

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:58.440
word. Yes. So the context that GP3 has been using, the transformer itself is from 2017,

01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:04.920
and it wasn't using that large of a context. OpenAI has basically scaled up this idea

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:12.760
as far as they could at the time. And the context is about 2048 symbols, tokens in the language.

01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:18.120
These symbols are not characters, but they take the words and project them into a vector space.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.880
Words that are statistically co-occurring a lot are neighbors already. So it's already a

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:29.160
simplification of the problem a little bit. And so every word is basically a set of coordinates

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:34.760
in a high dimensional space. And then they use some kind of trick to also encode the order

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:41.240
of the words in a sentence or in the not just sentence, but 2048 tokens is about couple pages

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.760
of text or two and a half pages of text. And so they managed to do pretty exhaustive statistics

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:51.880
over the potential relationships between two pages of text, which is tremendous, right? I was

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:58.840
just using a single sentence back then. And I was only looking for first order relationships. And

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:04.200
they were really looking for much, much higher level relationships. And what they discover

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.920
after they've fed this with an enormous amount of trim linear pretty much the written internet

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.520
or the subset of it that had some quality, but substantial portion of the common flaw

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:20.360
that they're not only able to reproduce style, but they're also able to reproduce some

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.400
pretty detailed semantics, like being able to add three digit numbers and multiply two

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:29.480
digit numbers or to translate between pro and languages and things like that.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:34.120
So the results that GBT3 got, I think were amazing.

01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:39.560
By the way, I actually didn't check carefully. It's funny you just mentioned

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:46.040
how you coupled semantics to the multiplication. Is it able to do some basic math and two digit

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:52.440
numbers? Yes. Okay, interesting. I thought, I thought there's a lot of failure cases.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.720
Yeah, it basically fails if you take larger digit numbers. So four digit numbers and so on

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:03.320
makes carrying mistakes and so on. And if you take large, larger numbers, you don't get useful

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:11.560
results at all. And this could be an issue of the training set, but not many examples of success

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:18.040
for long form addition and standard human written text. And humans aren't very good at doing three

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:23.720
digit numbers either. Yeah, they're not, you're not writing a lot about it. And the other thing

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.960
is that the loss function that is being used is only minimizing surprises. So it's predicting what

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:32.920
comes next in a typical text. It's not trying to go for causal closure first as we do.

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:42.680
Yeah. But the fact that that kind of prediction works to generate text that's semantically rich

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:47.320
and consistent is interesting. Yeah. So yeah, so it's amazing that it's able to

01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:53.000
generate semantically consistent text. It's not consistent. So the problem is that it loses

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.640
coherence at some point. But it's also, I think not correct to say that GPT-3 is unable to deal

01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.840
with semantics at all, because you ask it to perform certain transformations in text and it

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:10.040
performs these transformations in text. And the kind of additions that it's able to perform are

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.280
transformations in text, right? And there are proper semantics involved. You can also do more.

01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:23.240
There was a paper that was generating lots and lots of mathematically correct text

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.960
and was feeding this into a transformer. And as a result, it was able to learn how to do

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.920
differentiation integration in race that according to the authors, matematica could not.

01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:41.320
To which some of the people in matematica responded that they were not using the

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.840
matematica in the right way and so on. I have not really followed the

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:50.040
resolution of this conflict. This part, as a small tangent, I really don't like

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:58.200
in machine learning papers, which they often do anecdotal evidence. They'll find like one example

01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:03.080
in some kind of specific use of matematica and demonstrate, look, here's, they'll show successes

01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:09.000
and failures, but they won't have a very clear representation of how many cases this actually

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.600
represents. Yes, but I think as a first paper, this is a pretty good start. And so the take-home

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:21.480
message, I think, is that the authors could get better results from this in their experiments

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.800
than they could get from the vein, which they were using computer algebra systems,

01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:33.720
which means that was not nothing. And it's able to perform substantially better than GPTS-V can,

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:38.920
based on a much larger amount of training data, using the same underlying algorithm.

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:48.280
Let me ask, again, so I'm using your tweets as if this is like Play-Doh, as if this is

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:55.480
well thought out novels that you've written. You tweeted, GPT-4 is listening to us now.

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:05.320
This is one way of asking, what are the limitations of GPT-3 when it scales? So what do you think

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:11.720
will be the capabilities of GPT-4, GPT-5, and so on? What are the limits of this approach?

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:16.680
So obviously, when we are writing things right now, everything that we are writing now is going

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:21.080
to be training data for the next generation of machine learning models. So yes, of course,

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:26.760
GPT-4 is listening to us. And I think the tweet is already a little bit older. And we now have

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:33.400
Vudao and we have a number of other systems that basically are placeholders for GPT-4.

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.880
I don't know what open AIS plans are in this regard.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:42.200
I read that tweet in several ways. So one is obviously everything you put on the

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:50.280
internet has used this training data. But in a second way, I read it is in a, we talked about

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:57.320
agency. I read it is almost like GPT-4 is intelligent enough to be choosing to listen.

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:03.560
So not only like did a programmer tell it to collect this data and use it for training,

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:09.000
I almost saw the humorous angle, which is like it has achieved AGI kind of thing.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.920
Well, the thing is, could VB already be living in GPT-5?

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.680
So GPT-4 is listening and GPT-5 actually constructed the entirety of the reality?

01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.800
Of course, in some sense, what everybody is trying to do right now in AI is to extend the

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:32.280
transformer to be able to deal with video. And there are very promising extensions, right?

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:39.640
There's a work by Google that is called Perceiver and that is overcoming some of the limitations

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:44.280
of the transformer by letting it learn the topology of the different modalities separately

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:51.960
and by training it to find better input features. So the basically feature abstractions that are

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:59.800
being used by this successor to GPT-3 are chosen such a way that it's able to deal with video input.

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:07.720
And there is more to be done. So one of the limitations of GPT-3 is that it's amnesiac.

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.280
So it forgets everything beyond the two pages that it currently reads also during generation,

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:18.520
not just during learning. Do you think that's fixable within the space of deep learning?

01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:21.240
Can you just make a bigger, bigger, bigger input?

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.680
No, I don't think that our own working memory is infinitely large. It's probably also just a few

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:32.920
thousand bits. But what you can do is you can structure this working memory. So instead of just

01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:38.280
force feeding this thing, a certain thing that it has to focus on and it's not allowed to focus

01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:44.520
on anything else because it's network, you allow it to construct its own working memory as we do,

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.400
right? When we are reading a book, it's not that we are focusing our attention in such a way that

01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:55.880
we can only remember the current page. We will also try to remember other pages and try to undo

01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.280
what we learn from them or modify what we learned from them. We might get up and take another book

01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:05.960
from the shelf. We might go out and ask somebody that we can edit our working memory in any way

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:11.240
that is useful to put a context together that allows us to draw the right inferences and to

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:18.600
learn the right things. This ability to perform experiments on the world based on an attempt

01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.880
to become fully coherent and to achieve causal closure, to achieve a certain aesthetic of your

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:30.120
modeling, that is something that eventually needs to be done. At the moment, we are skirting this

01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:35.000
in some sense by building systems that are larger and faster so they can use dramatically larger

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:40.360
resources and human beings can do much more training data to get to models that in some sense

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:47.880
are already very superhuman and in other ways are laughingly incoherent. Do you think making

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:59.800
the systems multi-resolutional, some of the language models are focused on two pages,

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:07.480
some are focused on two books, some are focused on two years of reading, some are focused on a

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:14.600
lifetime like stacks of GPT-3s all the way down? You want to have gaps in between them. It's not

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:20.840
necessarily two years, there's no gaps. It stinks out of two years or out of 20 years or 2000 years

01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.680
or two billion years where you are just selecting those bits that are predicted to be the most useful

01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:32.440
ones to understand what you're currently doing. This prediction itself requires a very complicated

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.440
model. That's the actual model that you need to be making. It's not just that you are trying to

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.000
understand the relationships between things but what you need to make relationships or discover

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:47.720
relationships over. I wonder what that thing looks like, what the architecture for the thing

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:53.080
that's able to have that kind of model. I think it needs more degrees of freedom than the current

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:58.840
models have. It starts out with the fact that you possibly don't just want to have a feed-forward

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:05.240
model but you want it to be fully recurrent. To make it fully recurrent, you probably need to

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:11.160
loop it back into itself and allow it to skip connections. Once you do this, you're predicting

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:17.480
the next frame and your internal next frame in every moment and you are able to skip connection,

01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:24.280
it means that signals can travel from the output of the network into the middle of the network

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.400
faster than the inputs do. Do you think it can still be differentiable? Do you think it still

01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:35.000
can be in your network? Sometimes it can and sometimes it cannot. It can still be in your

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.760
network but not the fully differentiable one. When you want to deal with non-differentiable ones,

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:45.480
you need to have an attention system that is discreet and no-dimensional and can perform

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:50.120
grammatical operations. You need to be able to perform program synthesis. You need to be able

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.240
to backtrack in these operations that you perform on this thing. This thing needs a model of what

01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:59.640
it's currently doing. I think this is exactly the purpose of our own consciousness.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:07.560
Yeah, the program things are tricking along with your networks. Let me ask you, it's not

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:12.680
quite program synthesis but the application of these language models to generation

01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:18.360
to program synthesis but generation of programs. If you look at GitHub OpenPilot,

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:23.080
which is based on OpenAI's codecs, I don't know if you've got a chance to look at it, but it's

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:29.160
the system that's able to generate code once you prompt it with what is it,

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:34.600
like the header of a function with some comments. It seems to do an incredibly good job

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:41.880
or not a perfect job but it's very important but an incredibly good job of generating functions.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.320
What do you make of that? Is this exciting or is this just a party trick, a demo? Or is this

01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:56.360
revolutionary? I haven't worked with it yet so it's difficult for me to judge it but I would not

01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:01.720
be surprised if it turns out to be revolutionary. That's because the majority of programming tasks

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:07.240
that are being done in the industry right now are not creative. People are writing code that other

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:11.560
people have written or they're putting things together from code fragments that others have had

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:17.400
and a lot of the work that programmers do in practice is to figure out how to overcome the

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.200
gaps in the current knowledge and the things that people have already done. How to copy and paste

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:28.440
from Stack Overflow, that's right. And so of course we can automate that. Yeah, to make it

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:32.760
much faster to copy and paste from Stack Overflow. Yes, but it's not just copying and pasting,

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:38.360
it's also basically learning which parts you need to modify to make them fit together. Yeah,

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.600
like literally sometimes as simple as just changing the variable names

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:47.400
so it fits into the rest of your code. Yes, but this requires that you understand the semantics

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:52.040
of what you're doing to some degree. Yeah, and you can automate some of those things. The thing

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:59.320
that makes people nervous of course is that a little bit wrong in a program can have a dramatic

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:06.360
effect on the actual final operation of that program. So that's one little error which in the

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:12.360
space of language doesn't really matter but in the space of programs can matter a lot. Yes,

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:18.840
but this is already what is happening when humans program code. Yeah, so we have a technology to

01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:25.240
deal with this. Somehow it becomes scarier when you know that a program generated code that's

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:33.960
running a nuclear power plant. You know humans have errors too. Exactly. But it's scarier when

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:48.120
a program is doing it because why? There's a fear that a program may not be as good as humans to

01:54:48.120 --> 01:55:00.120
know when stuff is important to not mess up. There's a misalignment of priorities, of values,

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.720
that's potential, that maybe that's the source of the worry. I mean, okay, if I give you code

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:15.960
generated by GitHub OpenPilot and code generated by a human and say, here, use one of these,

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:21.720
which how do you select today and in the next 10 years, which code do you use?

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:23.560
Wouldn't you still be comfortable with the human?

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:31.880
At the moment when you go to Stanford to get an MRI, they will write a bill to the insurance

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:39.320
over $20,000 and of this maybe half of that gets paid by the insurance and the quarter gets paid

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:47.080
by you and the MRI cost them $600 to make, maybe probably less. And what are the values of the

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:53.480
person that writes the software and deploys this process? It's very difficult for me to say

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.840
whether I trust people. I think that what happens there is a mixture of

01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:04.120
proper Anglo-Saxon Protestant values where somebody is trying to serve an abstract

01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:14.200
greater whole and organize crime. Well, that's a very harsh, I think that's a harsh view of

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:20.520
humanity. There's a lot of bad people, whether incompetent or just malevolent in this world,

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:27.880
yes. But it feels like the more malevolent, so the more damage you do to the world,

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:34.440
the more resistance you have in your own human heart.

01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.080
But not explain with malevolence or stupidity what can be explained by just people acting on

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:46.600
their incentives. So what happens in Stanford is not that somebody is evil, it's just that they do

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:53.960
what they're being paid for. No, it's not evil. I see that as malevolence. I see,

01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:05.000
even like being a good German, as I told you offline, it's not absolute malevolence,

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.280
but it's a small amount. It's cowardice. I mean, when you see there's something wrong with the world,

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:17.240
it's either incompetence that you're not able to see it, or it's cowardice that you're not able to

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:25.160
stand up, not necessarily in a big way, but in a small way. So I do think that is in a bit of

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.800
malevolence. I'm not sure the example you're describing is a good example.

01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:34.200
So the question is, what is it that you are aiming for? And if you don't believe in the future,

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:38.760
if you, for instance, think that the dollar is going to crash by what you try to save dollars,

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.960
if you don't think that humanity will be around in 100 years from now, because

01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:49.160
global warming will wipe out civilization, why would you need to act as if it were?

01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:56.040
So the question is, is there an overarching aesthetics that is projecting you and the world

01:57:56.040 --> 01:58:00.440
into the future, which I think is the basic idea of religion, that you understand the

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.920
interactions that we have with each other as some kind of civilization level agent that is

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:12.040
projecting itself into the future. If you don't have that shared purpose, what is there to be

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:18.760
ethical for? So I think when we talk about ethics and AI, we need to go beyond the insane bias

01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:24.600
discussions and so on, where people are just measuring the distance between a statistic to their

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:31.080
preferred current world model. But the optimism, I was a little confused by the previous thing,

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:42.840
just to clarify, there is a kind of underlying morality to having an optimism that human

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:48.680
civilization will persist for longer than 100 years. I think a lot of people believe

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:54.280
that it's a good thing for us to keep living. Yeah, of course. And thriving.

01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:59.560
This morality itself is not an end to itself. It's instrumental to people living in 100 years

01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:07.240
from now, or 500 years from now. So it's only justifiable if you actually think that it will

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:12.440
lead to people or increase the probability of people being arrived in that time frame.

01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:15.880
And a lot of people don't actually believe that, at least not actively.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:22.280
But I believe what exactly? Most people don't believe that they can afford to act on such a

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:27.560
model. Basically, what happens in the US is I think that the healthcare system is for a lot of

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:31.480
people no longer sustainable, which means that if they need the help of the healthcare system,

01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:36.840
they're often not able to afford it. And when they cannot help it, they are often going bankrupt.

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:41.560
It's I think the leading course of personal bankruptcy in the US is the healthcare system.

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:47.720
And that would not be necessary. It's not because people are consuming more and more

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:52.520
medical services and are achieving a much, much longer life as a result. That's not actually the

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:56.840
story that is happening, because you can compare it to other countries. And life expectancy in

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.000
the US is currently not increasing. And it's not as high as in all the other industrialized

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.560
countries. So some industrialized countries are doing better with a much cheaper healthcare system.

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:12.760
And what you can see is, for instance, administrative bloat, the healthcare system has

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:19.400
maybe to some degree deliberately set up as a job placement program to allow people to continue

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:26.600
living in middle class existence, despite not having a useful use case in productivity.

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:31.880
So they are being paid to push paper around. And the number of administrators in the healthcare

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:36.360
system has been increasing much faster than the number of practitioners. And this is something

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.640
that you have to pay for, right? And also the revenues that are being generated in the healthcare

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:46.280
system are relatively large, and somebody has to pay for them. And the result why they are so

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:52.120
large is because market mechanisms are not working. The FDA is largely not protecting

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:58.760
people from malpractice of healthcare providers. The FDA is protecting healthcare providers from

02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:04.680
competition. So this is a thing that it has to do with values. And this is not because people

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:10.680
are malicious on all levels. It's because they are not incentivized to act on a greater whole on

02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:15.320
this idea that you treat somebody who comes to you as a patient like you would treat a family

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:20.440
member. Yeah, but we're trying. I mean, you're highlighting a lot of the flaws of the different

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:25.080
institutions, the systems we're operating under. But I think there's a continued throughout history

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:31.720
mechanism design of trying to design incentives in such a way that these systems behave better and

02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.320
better and better. I mean, it's a very difficult thing to operate a society of hundreds of millions

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:44.920
of people effectively with. Yes. Do we live in a society that is ever-correcting? Do we observe

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:50.280
that our models of what we are doing are predictive of the future? And when they are not,

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:55.880
we improve them. Our laws are adjudicated with clauses that you put into every law,

02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:59.960
what is meant to be achieved by that law, and the law will be automatically repealed

02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:04.200
if it's not achieving that. If you are optimizing your own laws, if you're writing your own source

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:09.320
code, you probably make an estimate of what is this thing that's currently wrong in my life?

02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:14.200
What is it that I should change about my own policies? What is the expected outcome? And

02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:19.240
if that outcome doesn't manifest, I will change the policy back, right? Or I would change it to

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.880
do something different. Are we doing this on a societal level? I think so. I think it's easy

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:30.360
to sort of highlight the... I think we're doing it in the way that I operate my current life. I

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:36.120
didn't sleep much last night. You would say that Lex, the way you need to operate your life is you

02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:41.320
need to always get sleep. The fact that you didn't sleep last night is totally the wrong way to

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:47.640
operate in your life. Like, you should have gotten all your shit done in time and gotten to sleep

02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.520
because sleep is very important for health. And you're highlighting, look, this person is not sleeping.

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:59.560
Look, the medical, the healthcare system is operating... But the point is we just... It seems

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:04.520
like this is the way, especially in the capitalist society, we operate... We keep running into trouble

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:10.120
and last minute, we try to get our way out through innovation. And it seems to work.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.880
You have a lot of people that ultimately are trying to build a better world and get

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:23.400
urgency about them when it's... The problem becomes more and more imminent. And that's

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:30.360
the way this operates. But if you look at the history, the long arc of history, it seems like

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:36.920
that operating on deadlines produces progress and builds better and better systems.

02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:43.960
You probably agree with me that the US should have engaged in mass production in January 2020

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.920
and that we should have shut down the airports early on and that we should have made it mandatory

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:57.880
that the people that work in nursery homes are living on campus rather than living at home

02:03:57.880 --> 02:04:03.240
and then coming in and infecting people in the nursing homes that had no immune response to COVID.

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:09.400
And that is something that was, I think, visible back then. The correct decisions haven't been

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:14.520
made. We would have the same situation again. How do we know that these wrong decisions are not

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:19.240
being made again? Have the people that made the decisions to not protect the nursing homes been

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:25.720
punished? Have the people that made the wrong decisions with respect to testing that prevented

02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:30.840
the development of testing by startup companies and the importing of tests from countries that

02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:35.160
already had them? Have these people been held responsible? Yeah, but first of all, so what do

02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:41.160
you want to put before the firing squad? I think they are. No, just make sure that this doesn't

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:47.480
happen again. No, but it's not that, yes, they're being held responsible by many voices by people

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:53.480
being frustrated. There's new leaders being born now. They're going to see rise to the top in 10

02:04:53.480 --> 02:05:01.160
years. This moves slower than there's obviously a lot of older incompetence and bureaucracy

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:08.840
in these systems move slowly. They move like science one depth at a time. So yes, I think

02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:15.480
the pain has been felt in the previous year is reverberating throughout the world.

02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:20.120
Maybe I'm getting old. I suspect that every generation in the U.S. after the war has lost

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:24.600
the plot even more. I don't see this development. The war of World War II?

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:30.360
Yes, so basically there was a time when we were modernist and in this modernist time,

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:36.760
the U.S. felt actively threatened by the things that happened in the world. The U.S. was worried

02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:45.320
about possibility of failure and this imminence of possible failure led to decisions. There was

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:51.160
a time when the government would listen to physicists about how to do things. The physicists

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:55.240
were actually concerned about what the government should be doing. They would be writing letters

02:05:55.240 --> 02:06:00.120
to the government. For instance, the decision for the Manhattan Project was something that was

02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:05.400
driven in a conversation between physicists and the government. I don't think such a discussion

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:11.240
would take place today. I disagree. I think if the virus was much deadlier, we would see a very

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:16.360
different response. I think the virus was not sufficiently deadly. Instead, because it wasn't

02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:23.720
very deadly, what happened is the current system started to politicize it. This is what I realized

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:30.760
with masks early on. They were not very quickly became not as a solution, but they became a thing

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:36.280
that politicians used to divide the country. The same things happened with vaccines,

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:42.040
so people weren't talking about solutions to this problem because I don't think the problem

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:49.240
was bad enough. When you talk about the war, I think our lives are too comfortable. I think

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:56.520
in the developed world, things are too good and we have not faced severe dangers. The

02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:02.200
severe dangers existential threats are faced. That's when we step up on a small scale and a large

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:12.360
scale. That's my argument here, but I did think the virus, I was hoping that it was actually

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:19.800
sufficiently dangerous for us to step up because especially in the early days, it was unclear. It

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:31.560
still is unclear because of mutations, how bad it might be. I thought we would step up. The mask's

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:39.400
point is a tricky one because to me, the manufacture of masks isn't even the problem. I'm still to

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:44.680
this day and I was involved with a bunch of this work, have not seen good signs done on whether

02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:51.160
masks work or not. There still has not been a large-scale study. To me, there should be large

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:56.360
scale studies on every possible solution, aggressive. In the same way that the vaccine

02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:01.480
development was aggressive, there should be masks which test what kind of tests work really well.

02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:08.840
Even the question of how the virus spreads, there should be aggressive studies on that.

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:14.120
To understand, I'm still, as far as I know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about that.

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:21.400
Nobody wants to see this as an engineering problem that needs to be solved. That I was surprised

02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:26.280
about. I find that our views are largely convergent but not completely. I agree with

02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:31.880
the thing that because our society in some sense perceives itself as too big to fail.

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:37.720
The virus did not alert people to the fact that we are facing possible failure

02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:43.240
that basically put us into the post-modernist mode. I don't mean in a philosophical sense,

02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:49.240
but in a societal sense. The difference between a post-modern society and the modern society is

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.560
that the modernist society has to deal with the ground tools and the post-modernist society has

02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:59.240
to deal with appearances. Politics becomes a performance. The performance is done for an

02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:05.480
audience and the organized audience is the media. The media evaluates itself via other media.

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:10.360
We have an audience of critics that evaluate themselves. I don't think it's so much the

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:15.640
failure of the politicians because to get in power and to stay in power, you need to be able

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.000
to deal with the published opinion. I think it goes in cycles because what's going to happen

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:27.320
is all of the small business owners, all the people who truly are suffering and will suffer

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:33.640
more because the effects of the closure of the economy and the lack of solutions to the virus,

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:40.760
they're going to a prize. Hopefully, this is where charismatic leaders can get the

02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:49.880
world in trouble. Hopefully, we'll elect great leaders that will break through this

02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:57.240
post-modernist idea of the media and the perception and the drama on Twitter and all that kind of

02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:03.880
stuff. You know this can go either way. When the Weimar Republic was unable to deal with the

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:11.000
economic crisis that Germany was facing, there was an option to go back. There were people

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.760
which thought, let's get back to a constitutional monarchy and let's get this to work because

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:23.240
democracy doesn't work. Eventually, there was no way back. People decided there was no way back.

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:28.840
They needed to go forward. The only options for going forward was to become Stalinist

02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:36.520
communists, basically an option to completely expropriate the factories and so on and nationalize

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:44.120
them and to reorganize Germany in communist terms and ally itself with Stalin and fascism.

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:51.320
Both options were obviously very bad. The one that the Germans picked led to a catastrophe

02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:58.520
that devastated Europe. I'm not sure if the US has an immune response against that. I think that

02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:02.760
the far-right is currently very weak in the US, but this can easily change.

02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:11.400
Do you think from a historical perspective Hitler could have been stopped from within

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:19.480
Germany or from outside? It depends on who you want to focus, whether you want to focus on Stalin

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:24.200
or Hitler, but it feels like Hitler was the one as a political movement that could have been stopped.

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:31.480
I think that the point was that a lot of people wanted Hitler, so he got support from a lot of

02:11:31.480 --> 02:11:36.280
quarters. There were a number of industrialists who supported him because they thought that the

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:42.040
democracy is obviously not working in unstable and you need a strongman. He was willing to play

02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:48.680
that part. There were also people in the US who thought that Hitler would stop Stalin and would

02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:55.560
act as a bulwark against Bolshevism, which he probably would have done at which cost.

02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:03.480
Many of the things that he was going to do, like the Holocaust, was something where people

02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:08.520
thought this is rhetoric. He's not actually going to do this, especially many of the Jews

02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:13.080
themselves, which were humanists. For them, this was outside of the scope that was thinkable.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:22.920
I wonder if Hitler is uniquely, I want to carefully use this term, but uniquely evil.

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:32.040
Hitler was never born if somebody else would come in this place. Just thinking about the

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:39.400
progress of history, how important are those singular figures that lead to mass destruction

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:49.480
and cruelty? Because my sense is, Hitler was unique. It wasn't just about the environment and

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:56.680
the context that gave him. Another person would not come in his place to do as destructive of

02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:04.440
the things that he did. There was a combination of charisma, of madness, of psychopathy,

02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:10.840
of just ego, all those things, which are very unlikely to come together in one person in the

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:16.760
right time. It also depends on the context of the country that you're operating in. If you

02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:24.680
tell the Germans that they have a historical destiny in this romantic country, the effect is

02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:32.440
probably different than it is in other countries. Stalin has killed a few more people than

02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:40.600
Hitler did. If you look at the probability that you're survived under Stalin, Hitler killed people

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:48.760
if he thought they were not worth living, or if they were harmful to his racist project.

02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:55.080
Basically, he felt that the Jews would be too cosmopolitan and would not be willing to participate

02:13:55.080 --> 02:14:01.240
in the racist redefinition of society and the value of society and an ethno-state in this way,

02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:08.040
as he wanted it to have it. He saw them as a harmful danger, especially since they played

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:17.880
such an important role in the economy and culture of Germany. Basically, he had some radical,

02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:25.320
but rational reason to murder them. Stalin just killed everyone. The Stalinist purges were such

02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:33.320
a random thing where he said that there is a certain possibility that this particular part

02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:37.320
of the population has a number of German collaborators or something, and we just killed

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:43.800
them all. Or if you look at what Mao did, the number of people that were killed in absolute

02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:50.360
numbers were much higher than the Mao that they were under Stalin. It's super hard to say. The

02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:57.400
other thing is that you look at Genghis Khan and so on, how many people he killed. You see

02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:02.040
there are a number of things that happen in human history that actually put a substantial

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:09.480
dent in the existing population, or Napoleon. It's very difficult to eventually measure it,

02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:17.320
because what's happening is basically evolution on a human scale where one monkey figures out a

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:24.520
way to become viral and is using this viral technology to change the patterns of society

02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:31.240
at a very large scale. What we find so abhorrent about these changes is the complexity that is

02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:35.800
being destroyed by this. It's basically like a big fire that burns out a lot of the existing

02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:41.640
culture and structure that existed before. Yeah, and it all just starts with one monkey,

02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:47.400
one charismatic ape, and there's a bunch of them throughout history. Yeah, but it's in a given

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:52.280
environment. It's basically similar to wildfires in California. The temperature is rising,

02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:58.360
there is less rain falling, and then suddenly a single spark can have an effect that in other

02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:06.600
times would be contained. Okay, speaking of which, I love how we went to Hitler and Stalin from

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:15.400
20, 30 minutes ago, GPT-3 generating, doing programs that this is. The argument was about

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:26.920
morality of AI versus human. Specifically in the context of writing programs, specifically in the

02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:32.680
context of programs that can be destructive. So running nuclear power plants or autonomous

02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:40.600
weapons systems, for example. And I think your inclination was to say that it's not so obvious

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:47.880
that AI would be less moral than humans or less effective at making a world that would make humans

02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:55.720
happy. So I'm not talking about self-directed systems that are making their own goals at

02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:01.080
the global scale. If you just talk about the deployment of technological systems that are able

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:07.480
to see order and patterns and use this as control models to act on the goals that we give them,

02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:13.080
then if we have the correct incentives to set the correct incentives for these systems,

02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:18.760
I'm quite optimistic. So humans versus AI, let me give you an example.

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:27.480
Autonomous Weapon Systems. Let's say there's a city somewhere in the Middle East that has

02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:34.920
a number of terrorists. And the question is, what's currently done with drone technologies,

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.040
you have information about the location of a particular terrorist, and you have a targeted

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:45.960
attack, you have a bombing of that particular building. And that's all directed by humans at

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:53.160
the high level strategy and also the deployment of individual bombs and missiles. Everything is

02:17:53.160 --> 02:18:01.240
done by human except the final targeting and the spot, similar thing, like control the flight.

02:18:02.680 --> 02:18:11.480
What if you give AI control and saying, write a program that says, here's the best information

02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:17.080
available about the location of these five terrorists, here's the city, make sure all the

02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:22.680
bombing you do is constrained to the city, make sure it's precision based, but you take care of

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:28.440
it. So you do one level of abstraction out and saying, take care of the terrorists in the city.

02:18:29.640 --> 02:18:36.120
Which are you more comfortable with? The humans or the JavaScript GPT-3 generated code that's doing

02:18:36.120 --> 02:18:46.440
the deployment. This is the kind of question I'm asking, is the kind of bugs that we see in human

02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:52.440
nature, are they better or worse than the kind of bugs we see in AI? They're different bugs.

02:18:52.440 --> 02:19:00.760
There is an issue that if people are creating an imperfect automation of a process that normally

02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:07.480
requires a moral judgment, and this moral judgment is the reason why it cannot be automated often,

02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:14.840
it's not because the computation is too expensive, but because the model that you give the AI is not

02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:19.720
an adequate model of the dynamics of the world, because the AI does not understand the context

02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:24.680
that it's operating in the right way. And this is something that already happens with Excel,

02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:30.280
where you don't need to have an AI system to do this. If you have an automated process in place,

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:35.960
where humans decide using automated criteria whom to kill when, and whom to target when,

02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:41.480
which already happens. And you have no way to get off the kill list once that happens,

02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:45.720
once you have been targeted according to some automatic criterion by people, right,

02:19:45.720 --> 02:19:51.560
in a bureaucracy. That is the issue. The issue is not the AI, it's the automation.

02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:57.960
So there's something about, right, it's automation, but there's something about the,

02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:03.640
there's a certain level of abstraction where you give control to AI to do the automation.

02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:10.760
There's a scale that could be achieved that it feels like the scale of bug and scale mistake

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:17.960
and scale of destruction that could be achieved of the kind that humans cannot achieve. So AI is

02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:23.560
much more able to destroy an entire country accidentally, versus humans. It feels like

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:30.360
the more civilians die as a react or suffer as a consequence of your decisions,

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:35.240
the more weight there is on the human mind to make that decision.

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:42.680
And so like it becomes more and more unlikely to make that decision for humans. For AI, it feels

02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:49.640
like it's harder to encode that kind of weight. In a way, the AI that we're currently building

02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:55.160
is automating statistics, right? Intelligence is the ability to make models so you can act on them

02:20:55.160 --> 02:21:01.560
and AI is a tool to make better models. So in principle, if you're using AI wisely,

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:07.880
you're able to prevent more harm. And I think that the main issue is not on the side of the AI,

02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:12.280
it's on the side of the human command hierarchy that is using technology irresponsibly.

02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:19.000
So the question is how hard is it to encode, to properly encode the right incentives into the AI?

02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:24.440
So for instance, there's this idea of what happens if we let our airplanes being flown

02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:29.800
with AI systems and the neural network is a black box and so on. And it turns out our neural

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:35.640
networks are actually not black boxes anymore. There are function approximators losing linear

02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:41.800
algebra, and there are performing things that we can understand. But we can also, instead of

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:46.040
letting the neural network fly the airplane, use the neural network to generate approval,

02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:51.080
be correct program with a degree of accuracy of the proof that a human could not achieve.

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:56.920
And so we can use our AI by combining different technologies to build systems that are much

02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:03.480
more reliable than the systems that a human being could create. And so in this sense, I would say

02:22:03.480 --> 02:22:11.320
that if you use an early stage of technology to save labor and don't employ competent people,

02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:15.720
but just to hack something together because you can, that is very dangerous. And if people

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:20.600
are acting under these incentives that they get evasive, delivering shoddy work more

02:22:20.600 --> 02:22:25.080
cheaply using AI is less human oversight than before. That's very dangerous.

02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:30.280
The thing is though, AI is still going to be unreliable, perhaps less so than humans,

02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:37.480
but it'll be unreliable in novel ways. And yeah, but this is an empirical question. And it's

02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:43.080
something that we can figure out and work with. So the issue is, do we trust the systems,

02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:47.960
the social systems that we have in place and the social systems that we can build and maintain,

02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:53.960
that they're able to use AI responsibly? If they can, then AI is good news. If they cannot,

02:22:53.960 --> 02:22:56.040
then it's going to make the existing problems worse.

02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:01.160
Well, and also who creates the AI, who controls it, who makes money from it,

02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:06.920
because it's ultimately humans. And then you start talking about how much you trust the humans.

02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:11.080
So the question is, what does who mean? I don't think that we have identity per se.

02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:17.240
I think that the story of a human being is somewhat random. What happens is more or less that

02:23:17.240 --> 02:23:21.960
everybody is acting on their local incentives, what they perceive to be their incentives.

02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:27.960
And the question is, what are the incentives that the one that is pressing the button is operating

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:35.480
under? Yeah, it's nice for those incentives to be transparent. So for example, I'll give you

02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:38.920
there seems to be a significant distrust of

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:46.920
tech, like entrepreneurs in the tech space, or people that run, for example, social media

02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:53.320
companies like Mark Zuckerberg. There's not a complete transparency of incentives under

02:23:54.120 --> 02:24:00.600
which that particular human being operates. We can listen to the words he says,

02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:06.200
or what the marketing team says for a company, but we don't know. And that's becomes a problem

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:13.560
when that the algorithms and the systems created by him and other people in that company

02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:20.680
start having more and more impact on society. And that it starts, you know, if the incentives

02:24:20.680 --> 02:24:29.080
were somehow the definition and the explainability of the incentives was decentralized such that

02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:36.680
nobody can manipulate it. No propaganda type manipulation of like how these systems actually

02:24:36.680 --> 02:24:45.560
operate could be done. Then yes, if you know, I think, I think AI could achieve much fair, much

02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:54.680
more effective sort of like solutions to difficult ethical problems. But when there's like humans

02:24:54.680 --> 02:25:01.560
in the loop, manipulating the dissemination, the communication of how the system actually

02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:07.000
works, that feels like you can run to a lot of trouble. And that's why there's currently a lot

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:12.360
of distrust for people at the heads of companies that have increasingly powerful AI systems.

02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:19.320
I suspect what happened traditionally in the US was that since our decision making is much more

02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:25.080
decentralized than in an authoritarian state, people are making decisions autonomously at many,

02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:31.400
many levels in the society. What happened that was we created coherence and cohesion in society

02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:37.160
by controlling what people thought and what information they had. The media synchronized

02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:43.160
public opinion. And social media have disrupted this. It's not, I think, so much Russian influence

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:48.680
or something. It's everybody's influence. It's that a random person can come up with a conspiracy

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:55.720
theory and disrupt what people think. And if that conspiracy theory is more compelling or more

02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:01.080
attractive than the standardized public conspiracy theory that we give people as a default,

02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.880
then it might get more traction, right? You suddenly have the situation that a single individual

02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:12.920
somewhere on a farm in Texas has more listeners than CNN. Which particular farmer you're referring

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:22.280
to in Texas? Probably no. Yes, I had dinner with him a couple of times. Okay. Right. It's an

02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:27.160
interesting situation because you cannot get to be an anchor in CNN if you don't go through a

02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:33.640
complicated gatekeeping process. And suddenly you have random people without that gatekeeping

02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:39.560
process just optimizing for attention. Not necessarily with a lot of responsibility for

02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:46.120
the long-term effects of projecting these theories into the public. And now there is a push of making

02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:51.400
social media more like traditional media, which means that the opinion that is being projected in

02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:57.560
social media is more limited to an acceptable range with the goal of getting society into

02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:01.960
safe waters and increase the stability and cohesion of society again, which I think is

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:07.480
a laudable goal. But of course, it also is an opportunity to cease the means of indoctrination.

02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:13.320
And the incentives that people are under when they do this are in such a way that

02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:20.520
the AI ethics that we would need becomes very often something like AI politics,

02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:26.040
which is basically partisan and ideological. And this means that whatever one side says,

02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:31.080
another side is going to be disagreeing with, right? In the same way as when you turn masks or

02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:36.600
the vaccine into a political issue, if you say that it is politically virtuous to get vaccinated,

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:41.560
it will mean that the people that don't like you will not want to get vaccinated. And as soon

02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:47.000
as you have this partisan discourse, it's going to be very hard to make the right decisions,

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.400
because the incentives get to be the wrong ones. AI ethics needs to be super boring. It needs to

02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:58.120
be done by people who do statistics all the time and have extremely boring, long-winded discussions

02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:02.360
that most people cannot follow because they are too complicated, but that are dead serious.

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:06.920
These people need to be able to be better at statistics than the leading machine learning

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:13.080
researchers. And at the moment, the AI ethics debate is the one where you don't have any barrier

02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:18.680
to entry, right? Everybody who has a strong opinion and is able to signal that opinion in the right

02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:24.280
way can enter it. Strong words to judge it back. And to me, that is a very frustrating thing,

02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:28.440
because the field is so crucially important to our future. It's so crucially important, but

02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:33.960
the only qualification you currently need is to be outraged by the injustice in the world.

02:28:34.680 --> 02:28:37.640
It's more complicated, right? Everybody seems to be outraged.

02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:42.520
So let's just say that the incentives are not always the right ones. So basically,

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:49.000
I suspect that a lot of people that enter this debate don't have a vision for what society

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.200
should be looking like in a way that is nonviolent, where we preserve liberal democracy, where we

02:28:54.200 --> 02:29:01.240
make sure that we all get along and we are around in a few hundred years from now, preferably

02:29:01.240 --> 02:29:03.960
with the comfortable technological civilization around us.

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:12.440
I generally have a very foggy view of that world, but I tend to try to follow and I think

02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:18.040
society should in some degree follow the gradient of love, increasing the amount of love in the

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:23.880
world. And whenever I see different policies or algorithms or ideas that are not doing so,

02:29:24.520 --> 02:29:27.240
obviously, that's the ones that kind of resist.

02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:34.520
So the thing that terrifies me about this notion is I think that German fascism was driven by love.

02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:39.000
It was just a very selective love. It was a love that basically-

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.760
Well, now you're just manipulating. I mean, that's, you have to be very careful.

02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:50.520
You're talking to the wrong person in this way about love.

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:55.960
So let's talk about what love is. And I think that love is the discovery of shared purpose.

02:29:55.960 --> 02:30:01.880
It's the recognition of the sacred and the other. And this enables non-transactual interactions.

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:08.920
But the size of the other that you include needs to be maximized.

02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:16.280
So it's basically appreciation, like deep appreciation of

02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:25.800
the world around you fully, including the people that are very different than you,

02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:30.200
the people that disagree with you completely, including people, including living creatures

02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:36.680
outside of just people, including ideas and appreciation of the full mess of it.

02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:43.320
And also it has to do with empathy, which is coupled with a lack of confidence,

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:51.000
uncertainty about your own rightness. It's like a radical open-mindedness to the way forward.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:56.440
I agree with every part of what you said. And now, if you scale it up, what you recognize is that

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:02.840
love is, in some sense, the service to a next level agency, to the highest level agency that

02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:09.640
you can recognize. It could be, for instance, life on earth or beyond that, where you could say

02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:13.400
intelligent complexity in the universe that you try to maximize in a certain way.

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:20.280
But when you think it through, it basically means a certain aesthetic. And there is not one possible

02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:25.320
aesthetic. There are many possible aesthetics. And once you project an aesthetic into the future,

02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:30.440
you can see that there are some which defect from it, which are in conflict with it,

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:36.280
that are corrupt, that are evil. You and me would probably agree that Hitler was evil,

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:41.480
because the aesthetic of the world that he wanted is in conflict with the aesthetic of

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:49.400
the world that you and me have in mind. And so the thing that he destroyed, we want to keep them

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:58.040
in the world. There's ways to deal. I mean, Hitler's an easier case, but perhaps he wasn't so easy

02:31:58.120 --> 02:32:01.720
in the 30s, to understand who's Hitler and who's not.

02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:07.400
No, it's just that there was no consensus that the aesthetics that he had in mind were unacceptable.

02:32:07.400 --> 02:32:17.720
Yeah. I mean, it's difficult. Love is complicated, because you can't just be so open-minded that

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:27.800
you let evil walk into the door. But you can't be so self-assured that you can always identify

02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:34.040
evil perfectly, because that's what leads to Nazi Germany, having a certainty of what is and

02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:43.320
wasn't evil, like always drawing lines of good versus evil. There has to be a dance between

02:32:46.920 --> 02:32:54.680
like hard stances extending up against what is wrong. And at the same time, empathy and open

02:32:54.680 --> 02:33:00.760
mind towards not knowing what is right and wrong. And like a dance between those.

02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:06.040
I found that when I watched the Miyazaki movies that there is nobody who captures my spirituality

02:33:06.040 --> 02:33:12.280
as well as he does. It's very interesting and just vicious. There is something going on in

02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:18.520
his movies that is very interesting. So, for instance, Mononoka is discussing not only an answer

02:33:18.520 --> 02:33:25.320
to Disney's simplistic notion of Mowgli, the jungle boy who was raised by wolves. And as soon

02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:33.240
as he sees people, realizes that he's one of them. And the way in which the moral life and nature

02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:38.440
is simplified and romanticized and turned into kitsch is disgusting in the Disney movie. And he

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:43.880
answers to this. You see, he's replaced by Mononoka, this wolf girl who was raised by wolves and who

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:49.640
was fierce and dangerous and who cannot be socialized because he cannot be tamed. He cannot

02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:53.560
be part of human society. And you see human society, it's something that is very, very

02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:59.640
complicated. You see people extracting resources and destroying nature. But the purpose is not

02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:06.440
to be evil, but to be able to have a life that is free from, for instance, oppression and violence

02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:14.520
and to curb death and disease. And you basically see this conflict which cannot be resolved in a

02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:19.640
certain way. You see this moment when nature is turned into a garden and it loses most of what

02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:25.560
it actually is when humans no longer submitting to life and death and nature. And to these questions,

02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:30.440
there is no easy answer. So, he just turns it into something that is being observed as a journey

02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.280
that happens and that happens with a certain degree of inevitability. And the nice thing about

02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:40.360
all his movies is there is a certain main character and it's the same in all movies.

02:34:41.160 --> 02:34:48.520
It's this little girl that is basically Heidi and I suspect that happened because when he did

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:55.080
field work for working on the Heidi movies back then, the Heidi animations, before he did his

02:34:55.080 --> 02:35:02.040
own movies, he traveled to Switzerland and south-eastern Europe and the Adriatic and so on

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:06.440
and got an idea about a certain aesthetic and a certain way of life that informed his

02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:12.600
future thinking. And Heidi has a very interesting relationship to herself and to the world.

02:35:13.160 --> 02:35:18.680
There's nothing that she takes for herself. She is in a way fearless because she is committed

02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:23.960
to a service to a greater whole. Basically, she is completely committed to serving God.

02:35:23.960 --> 02:35:28.680
And it's not an institutionalized God. It has nothing to do with the Roman Catholic Church or

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:33.880
something like this. But in some sense, Heidi is an embodiment of the spirit of European

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:40.680
Protestantism. It's this idea of a being that is completely perfect and pure. And it's not a

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:50.520
feminist vision because she is not a girl boss or something like this. She is the justification

02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:55.080
for the men in the audience to protect her, to build the civilization around her that makes

02:35:55.080 --> 02:36:00.920
her possible. So she is not just the sacrifice of Jesus who is innocent and therefore,

02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:06.840
nailed to the cross. She is not being sacrificed. She is being protected by everybody around her

02:36:06.840 --> 02:36:13.000
who recognizes that she is sacred and there are enough around her to see that. So that's a very

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.880
interesting perspective. There's a certain notion of innocence. And this notion of innocence is not

02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:24.280
universal. It's not in all cultures. Hitler wasn't innocent. His idea of Germany was not

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:28.680
that there is innocence that is being protected. There was a predator that was going to triumph.

02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:33.000
And it's also something that is not at the core of every religion. There are many religions

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:39.800
which don't care about innocence. They might care about increasing the status of something.

02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:47.560
And that's a very interesting notion that is quite unique and not claiming it's the optimal one.

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:53.480
It's just a particular kind of aesthetic which I think makes Miyazaki into the most relevant

02:36:53.480 --> 02:37:00.840
Protestant philosopher today. And you're saying in terms of all the ways that society can operate

02:37:00.840 --> 02:37:08.840
perhaps the preservation of innocence might be one of the best? No, it's just my aesthetic.

02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:15.320
Your aesthetic. It's a particular way in which I feel that I relate to the world that is natural

02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:20.920
to my own civilization and maybe it's not an accident that I have cultural roots in Europe

02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:28.040
in a particular world. And so maybe it's a natural convergence point and it's not something that you

02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:35.720
will find in all other times in history. So I'd like to ask you both Solzhenitsyn and our individual

02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:42.440
role as ants in this very large society. So he says that some version of the line between good

02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.240
and evil runs to the heart of every man. Do you think all of us are capable of good and evil?

02:37:47.240 --> 02:37:57.320
Like what's our role in this play in this game while playing? Is all of us capable to play any

02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:04.840
role? Like is there an ultimate responsibility to you mentioned maintaining innocence or whatever

02:38:04.840 --> 02:38:11.400
the whatever the highest ideal for society you want are all of us capable of living up to that?

02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:16.520
And that's our responsibility or are there significant limitations to what we're able to

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:24.040
do in terms of good and evil? So there is a certain way if you are not parable,

02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:31.080
if you are committed to some kind of civilizational agency, a next level agent that you are serving,

02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:36.200
some kind of transcendent principle. In the eyes of that transcendental principle,

02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:39.800
you are able to discern good from evil, otherwise you cannot, otherwise you have just

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:46.200
individual aesthetics. The cat that is torturing a mouse is not evil because the cat does not envision

02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:52.760
or not part of the cat is envisioning a world where there is no violence and nobody is suffering.

02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:58.840
If you have an aesthetic where you want to protect innocence, then torturing somebody

02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:05.640
needlessly is evil, but only then. No, but within, I guess the question is within the aesthetic,

02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:14.680
like within your sense of what is good and evil, it seems like we're still able to

02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:21.160
commit evil. Yes. So basically, if you are committing to this next level agent, you are not

02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:26.040
necessarily are this next level agent, right? You are part of it. You have a relationship to it,

02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:31.320
like it sailed us to its organism, its hyperorganism, and it only exists to the degree

02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:37.800
that it's being implemented by you and others. And that means that you're not completely fully

02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:42.520
serving it. You have freedom in what you decide, whether you are acting on your impulses and local

02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:47.160
incentives and your verbal impulses, so to speak, or whether you're committing to it.

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:53.640
And what you perceive then is a tension between what you would be doing with respect to the thing

02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:59.800
that you recognize as the sacred, if you do, and what you're actually doing. And this is the line

02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:05.640
between good and evil, right? Where you see, oh, I'm here acting on my local incentives or impulses,

02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:09.720
and here I'm acting on what I consider to be sacred. And there's a tension between those.

02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:15.080
And this is the line between good and evil that might run through your heart. And if you don't

02:40:15.080 --> 02:40:19.320
have that, if you don't have this relationship to a transcendental agent, you could call this

02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:24.280
relationship to the next level agent soul, right? It's not a thing. It's not an immortal thing that

02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:28.760
is intrinsically valuable. It's a certain kind of relationship that you project to understand

02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:32.440
what's happening. Somebody is serving this transcendental sacredness or they're not.

02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:39.080
If you don't have a soul, you cannot be evil. You're just a complex natural phenomenon.

02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:44.920
So if you look at life, like starting today, or starting tomorrow, when we leave here today,

02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.720
there's a bunch of trajectories that you can take through life,

02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:59.800
maybe countless. Do you think some of these trajectories in your own conception of yourself,

02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:08.520
some of those trajectories are the ideal life, a life that if you were to be the hero of your life

02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:13.720
story, you would want to be? Like is there some Joshua Bach that you're striving to be?

02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:20.360
Like this is the question I ask myself as an individual trying to make a better world in the

02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:26.440
best way that I could conceive of. What is my responsibility there? And how much am I responsible

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:34.840
for the failure to do so? Because I'm lazy and incompetent too often in my own perception.

02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:41.720
In my own world view, I'm not very important. So I don't have place for me as a hero in my

02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:50.360
own world. I'm trying to do the best that I can, which is often not very good. And so it's not

02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:57.080
important for me to have status or to be seen in a particular way. It's helpful if others can see

02:41:57.080 --> 02:41:59.640
me, or a few people can see me, that can be my friends.

02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:05.480
No, sorry, I want to clarify. The hero didn't mean status or perception or

02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:12.920
some kind of marketing thing, but more in private, in the quiet of your own mind.

02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:19.800
Is there the kind of man you want to be and would consider it a failure if you don't become that?

02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:21.880
That's what I meant by hero.

02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.960
Yeah, not really. I don't perceive myself as having such an identity.

02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:38.520
And it's also sometimes frustrating. But it's basically a lack of having this notion of

02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:40.360
father that I need to be emulating.

02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:49.720
It's interesting. I mean, it's the leaf floating down the river. I worry that...

02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:53.320
Sometimes it's more like being the river.

02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:06.360
I'm just a fat frog sitting on a leaf on a dirty muddy lake.

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:15.800
Waiting for a princess to kiss me. Or the other way. I forgot which way it goes.

02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:17.000
Somebody kisses somebody.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.880
Can I ask you, I don't know if you know who Michael Malis is, but

02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:28.760
in terms of constructing systems of incentives, it's interesting to ask.

02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:35.560
I don't think I've talked to you about this before. Malis espouses anarchism.

02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:43.080
So he sees all government as fundamentally getting in the way or even being destructive to

02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:50.360
collaborations between human beings thriving. What do you think?

02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:58.920
What's the role of government in a society that thrives? Is anarchism at all compelling to you

02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:04.040
as a system? Not just small government, but no government at all?

02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:07.320
Yeah, I don't see how this would work.

02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:15.080
The government is an agent that imposes an offset on your reward function, on your payout

02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:19.320
metrics, so your behavior becomes compatible with the common good.

02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:27.640
So the argument there is that you can have collectives, like governing organizations,

02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:33.560
but not government, like where you're born in a particular set of land, and therefore you must

02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:43.960
follow this rule or else. You're forced by what they call violence, because there's an implied

02:44:43.960 --> 02:44:53.240
violence here. So the key aspect of government is it protects you from the rest of the world

02:44:53.240 --> 02:45:01.560
with an army and with police. It has a monopoly on violence. It's the only one that's able to do

02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:06.760
violence. There are many forms of government. Not all governments do that, but we find that

02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:15.160
in successful countries, the government has a monopoly on violence. That means that you cannot

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.320
get ahead by starting your own army, because the government will come down on you and destroy you

02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:24.360
if you try to do that. In countries where you can build your own army and get a way visit,

02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:29.000
some people will do it. These countries is what we call failed countries in a way.

02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:36.440
If you don't want to have violence, the point is not to appeal to the moral intentions of people,

02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:41.720
because some people will use strategies if they get ahead with them that feel a particular kind

02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:48.120
of ecological niche. So you need to destroy that ecological niche. And if an effective government

02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:53.400
has a monopoly on violence, it can create a world where nobody is able to use violence

02:45:53.400 --> 02:45:58.600
and get ahead. So you want to use that monopoly on violence not to exert violence,

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:04.440
but to make violence impossible, to raise the cost of violence. So people need to get ahead with

02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:10.280
nonviolent means. So the idea is that you might be able to achieve that in an anarchist state

02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:17.560
with companies. So with the forces of capitalism is create security companies

02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:23.320
where the one that's most ethically sound rises to the top. Basically, it would be a much better

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:32.360
representative of the people, because there is less sort of stickiness to the big military force

02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:36.280
sticking around, even though it's long, overlived, outlived.

02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:41.640
So you have groups of militants that are hopefully officially organized, because otherwise they're

02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:46.760
going to lose against the other groups of militants, and they are coordinating themselves with the

02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:52.760
rest of society until they are having a monopoly on violence. How is that different from a government?

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:56.120
So it's basically converging to the same thing.

02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:01.080
So I think it always, in my, as I was trying to argue with Malice, I feel like it always converges

02:47:01.080 --> 02:47:06.360
towards government at scale. But I think the idea is you can have a lot of collectives that are,

02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:14.120
you basically never let anything scale too big. So one of the problems with governments is it

02:47:14.120 --> 02:47:21.240
gets too big in terms of the size of the group over which it has control.

02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:30.600
My sense is that would happen anyway. So a successful company like Amazon or Facebook,

02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:37.800
it starts forming a monopoly over the entire populations, not over just hundreds of millions,

02:47:37.800 --> 02:47:45.000
but billions of people. So I don't know. But there is something about the abuses of power

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:51.640
the government can have when it has a monopoly on violence. And so that's attention there.

02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:57.080
So the question is, how can you set the incentives for government correctly? And this

02:47:57.080 --> 02:48:02.200
mostly applies at the highest levels of government. And we, because we haven't found a way to set

02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:07.080
them correctly, we made the highest levels of government relatively weak. And this is,

02:48:07.080 --> 02:48:11.320
I think, part of the reason why we had difficulty to coordinate the pandemic response.

02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:17.720
And China didn't have that much difficulty. And there is, of course, a much higher risk of the

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:24.200
abuse of power that exists in China, because the power is largely unchecked. And that's

02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:28.440
basically what happens in the next generation, for instance, imagine that we would agree that

02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.920
the current government of China is largely correct and by never limit. And maybe we don't agree on

02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:39.080
this. But if we did, how can we make sure that this stays like this? And if you don't have checks

02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:44.520
and balances and division of power, it's hard to achieve. You don't have a solution for that problem.

02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.720
But the abolishment of government basically would remove the control structure from a

02:48:49.720 --> 02:48:55.720
cybernetic perspective. There is an optimal point in the system that the regulation should be

02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:00.840
happening, right? Where you can measure the current incentives and the regulator would

02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:06.120
properly incentivize to make the right decisions and change the payout metrics of everything below

02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:10.840
it in such a way that the local prisoners' dilemmas get resolved. You cannot resolve the

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:17.080
prisoners' dilemma without some kind of eternal control that emulates an infinite game in a way.

02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:25.800
Yeah. I mean, there's a sense in which it seems like the reason government, the parts of government

02:49:25.800 --> 02:49:35.240
that don't work well currently is because there's not good mechanisms through which to interact

02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:40.520
for the citizenry to interact with government is basically it hasn't caught up in terms of

02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:47.000
technology. And I think once you integrate some of the digital revolution of being able to

02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:53.080
have a lot of access to data, be able to vote on different ideas at a local level, at all levels,

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:59.480
at the optimal level, like you're saying, that can resolve the prisoner dilemmas and to integrate

02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:08.600
AI to help you out, automate things that don't require the human ingenuity. I feel like that's

02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:14.520
where government could operate that well and can also break apart the inefficient bureaucracies,

02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:20.520
if needed. There'll be a strong incentive to be efficient and successful.

02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:25.800
So out human history, we see an evolutionary competition of modes of government and of

02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:30.520
individual governments as in these modes. And every nation state in some sense is some kind

02:50:30.520 --> 02:50:36.280
of organism that has found different solutions for the problem of government. And you could look at

02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:41.560
all these different models and the different scales at which it exists as empirical attempts to

02:50:41.560 --> 02:50:49.080
validate the idea of how to build a better government. And I suspect that the idea of anarchism,

02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:56.200
similar to the idea of communism, is the result of being disenchanted with the ugliness of the real

02:50:56.200 --> 02:51:03.000
existing solutions and the attempt to get to an utopia. And I suspect that communism originally

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:08.520
was not a utopia. I think that in the same way as original Christianity, it had a particular kind

02:51:08.600 --> 02:51:15.240
of vision. And this vision is a society, a mode of organization within the society,

02:51:15.240 --> 02:51:22.920
in which humans can coexist at scale without coercion. The same way as we do in a healthy

02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:29.480
family. In a good family, you don't terrorize each other into compliance, but you understand what

02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:33.960
everybody needs and what everybody can is able to contribute and what the intended future of the

02:51:33.960 --> 02:51:39.480
whole thing is. And everybody coordinates their behavior in the right way and informs each other

02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:44.360
about how to do this and all the interactions that happen are instrumental to making that happen.

02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:50.680
Could this happen at scale? And I think this is the idea of communism. Communism is opposed to the

02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:56.280
idea that we need economic terror or other forms of terror to make that happen. But in practice,

02:51:56.280 --> 02:52:02.120
what happened is that the proto-communist countries, the real existing socialism, replaced a part of

02:52:02.120 --> 02:52:07.480
the economic terror with moral terror. So we were told to do the right thing for moral reasons.

02:52:07.480 --> 02:52:12.200
And of course, it didn't really work and the economy eventually collapsed. And the moral

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:17.640
terror had actual real cost. People were imprisoned because they were morally non-compliant.

02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:25.960
The other thing is that the idea of communism became a utopia. So it basically was projected

02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:32.040
into the afterlife. We were told in my childhood that communism was a hypothetical society

02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:36.280
to which we were in a permanent revolution that justified everything that was presently wrong

02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:41.880
with society morally. But it was something that our grandchildren probably would not ever see

02:52:41.880 --> 02:52:46.040
because it was too ideal and too far in the future to make it happen right now. And

02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:51.720
people were just not there yet morally. And the same thing happened with Christianity. This notion

02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:57.000
of heaven was mythologized and projected into an afterlife. And I think this was just the idea of

02:52:57.080 --> 02:53:01.880
God's kingdom, of this world in which we instantiate the next level transcendental agent in the

02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:07.240
perfect form. So everything goes smoothly and without violence and without conflict and without

02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:13.160
this human messiness on this economic messiness and the terror and coercion that existed in the

02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:18.840
present societies. And the idea of whether humans can exist at scale in a harmonious way

02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:24.440
non-coercively is untested. A lot of people tested it but didn't get it to work so far.

02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:29.560
And the utopia is a world in where you get all the good things without any of the bad things.

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:35.560
And you are, I think, very susceptible to believe in utopias when you are very young and don't

02:53:35.560 --> 02:53:40.840
understand that everything has to happen in causal patterns, that there is always feedback loops that

02:53:40.840 --> 02:53:45.800
ultimately are closed. There's nothing that just happens because it's good or bad. Good or bad

02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:49.800
don't exist in isolation. They only exist with respect to larger systems.

02:53:50.600 --> 02:54:00.360
So can you intuit why utopias fail as systems? So like having a utopia that's out there beyond

02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:08.040
the horizon, is it because then, it's not only because it's impossible to achieve utopias,

02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:14.920
but it's because what certain humans, certain small number of humans start to

02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:24.360
sort of greedily attain power and money and control and influence

02:54:25.480 --> 02:54:34.280
as they become, as they see the power in using this idea of a utopia.

02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:38.760
It's a little like saying, why is my garden not perfect? It's because some evil weeds are

02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:44.760
overgrowing it and they always do. But this is not how it works. A good garden is a system that

02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:51.880
is in balance and requires minimal interactions by the gardener. And so you need to create a system

02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:56.840
that is designed to self-stabilize. And the design of social systems requires not just the

02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:01.800
implementation of the desired functionality but the next level design, also in biological systems.

02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:05.320
You need to create a system that wants to converge to the intended function.

02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:10.920
And so instead of just creating an institution like the FDA that is performing a particular kind

02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:17.160
of role in society, you need to make sure that the FDA is actually driven by a system that wants to

02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:22.680
do this optimally, that is incentivized to do it optimally and then makes the performance that is

02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:28.600
actually enacted in every generation instrumental to that thing, that actual goal. And that is much

02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:34.360
harder to design and to achieve. So you have to design a system where, and listen, communism also

02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:43.960
was quote unquote incentivized to be a feedback loop system that achieves that utopia. It just,

02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:47.960
it wasn't working given human nature. The incentives were not correct given human nature.

02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:53.240
So how do you incentivize people when they are getting coal off the ground to work as hard as

02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:59.240
possible? Because it's a terrible job and it's very bad for your health. And right, how do you do

02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:05.320
this? And you can give them prices and metals and status to some degree, right? There's only so much

02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:10.120
status to give for that. And most people will not fall for this, right? Or you can pay them.

02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:15.800
And you probably have to pay them in an asymmetric way because if you pay everybody the same and

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:21.800
you nationalize the coal mines, eventually people will figure out that they can game the system.

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:29.080
Yes. So you're describing capitalism. Capitalism is the present solution to the system. And

02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:34.280
what we also noticed that I think that Marx was correct in saying that capitalism is prone to

02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:40.680
crisis, that capitalism is a system that in its dynamics is not convergent but divergent.

02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:48.280
It's not a stable system. And that eventually it produces an enormous potential for productivity.

02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:53.960
But it also is systematically misallocating resources. So a lot of people cannot participate

02:56:54.680 --> 02:56:59.480
in the production and consumption anymore. And this is what we observe. We observe that

02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:05.480
the middle class in the US is tiny. A lot of people think that they're middle class,

02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:08.280
but if you are still flying economy, you're not middle class.

02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:14.600
Right. Every class is a menu to a smaller than the previous class.

02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:23.080
The thing about classes is really like airline classes.

02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:29.240
It's the no-play class. A lot of people are economy class. Business class and very few

02:57:29.240 --> 02:57:35.000
are first class and summer budget. I mean, I understand. I think there is, yeah,

02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:39.640
maybe some people, probably I would push back against that definition of the middle class.

02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:44.200
It does feel like the middle class is pretty large, but yes, there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth.

02:57:45.720 --> 02:57:51.720
So think about the terms of the productivity that our society could have. There is no reason

02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:57.000
for anybody to fly economy. We would be able to let everybody travel in style.

02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:03.160
Well, but also some people like to be frugal even when they're billionaires. So let's take

02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:08.440
that into account. Yes, but I mean, we probably don't need to be a traveling lavish, but you also

02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:13.400
don't need to be tortured, right? There is a difference between frugal and subjecting yourself

02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:17.880
to torture. Listen, I love economy. I don't understand why you're comparing a flying economy

02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:25.480
to torture. Although the flight here, there's two crying babies next to me. But that has

02:58:25.480 --> 02:58:32.200
nothing to do with crime babies. They're very cute though. I have two kids and sometimes I have

02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:41.160
to go back to visit the grandparents and back means going from the west coast to Germany.

02:58:41.160 --> 02:58:47.480
And that's a long flight. Is it true that when you're a father, you grow immune to the crying

02:58:47.480 --> 02:58:54.120
and all that kind of stuff? Because like me just not having kids, other people's kids can be quite

02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:58.520
annoying when they're crying and screaming and all that kind of stuff. When you have children

02:58:58.520 --> 02:59:03.400
and you're wired up in a default natural way, you're lucky in this regard, you fall in love with

02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:09.640
them. And this falling in love with them means that you basically start to see the world through

02:59:09.640 --> 02:59:13.720
their eyes and you understand that in a given situation, they cannot do anything but

02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:21.000
being expressing despair. And so it becomes more differentiated. I noticed that, for instance,

02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:29.480
my son is typically acting on a pure experience of what things are like right now. And he has

02:59:29.480 --> 02:59:34.920
to do this right now. And you have this small child that is, when he was a baby and so on,

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:39.080
where he was just immediately expressing what he felt. And if you cannot regulate this from the

02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:44.360
outside, there's no point to be upset about it. It's like dealing with weather or something like

02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:50.440
this. You all have to get through it. And it's not easy for him either. But if you also have

02:59:51.160 --> 02:59:54.760
a daughter, maybe she is planning for that. Maybe she understands that

02:59:56.520 --> 03:00:00.040
she's sitting in the car behind you and she's screaming at the top of her lungs and you're

03:00:00.040 --> 03:00:04.920
almost doing an accident. And you really don't know what to do. What should I have done to

03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:07.720
make you stop screaming? You could have given me candy.

03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:14.600
I think that's like a cat versus dog discussion. I love it. Because you said the

03:00:15.240 --> 03:00:21.080
like a fundamental aspect of that is love that makes it all worth it.

03:00:22.200 --> 03:00:29.480
What in this monkey riding an elephant in a dream world, what role does love play

03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:35.960
in the human condition? I think that love is the facilitator of non-transactual interaction.

03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:43.480
When you are observing your own purposes, some of these purposes go beyond your ego. They go

03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:47.400
beyond the particular organism that you are and your local interests.

03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:49.240
That's what you mean by non-transactual.

03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.760
Yes. So basically, when you are acting in a transactional way, it means that you are

03:00:52.760 --> 03:00:57.400
respecting something in return for you from the one that you're interacting with.

03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:02.360
You are interacting with a random stranger. You buy something from them on eBay. You expect

03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:07.000
a fair value for the money that you send them and vice versa because you don't know that person.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:11.080
You don't have any kind of relationship to them. But when you know this person a little bit better

03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:15.320
and you know the situation that they're in, you understand what they try to achieve in their life

03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:20.360
and you approve because you realize that they're in some sense serving the same

03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:25.880
human sacredness as you are. They need to think that you have. Maybe you give it to them as a present.

03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:33.880
The feeling itself of joy is a kind of benefit, is a kind of transaction.

03:01:35.080 --> 03:01:39.800
Yes, but the joy is not the point. The joy is the signal that you get. It's the reinforcement

03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:44.920
signal that your brain sends to you because you are acting on the incentives of the agent that

03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:50.920
you're part of. We are meant to be part of something larger. That is the way in which we out-competed

03:01:50.920 --> 03:02:00.920
other hominids. Take that, Neanderthals. Yes, and also other humans. There was a population

03:02:00.920 --> 03:02:07.960
bottleneck for human society that leads to an extreme lack of genetic diversity among humans.

03:02:07.960 --> 03:02:13.960
If you look at Bushmen in the Kalahari that basically tribes that are not that far

03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:19.080
distant to each other have more genetic diversity than exist between Europeans and Chinese.

03:02:20.120 --> 03:02:25.480
That's because basically the out-of-Africa population at some point had a bottleneck

03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:31.960
of just a few thousand individuals. What probably happened is not that at any time the number of

03:02:31.960 --> 03:02:37.800
people shrunk below a few hundred thousand. What probably happened is that there was a small group

03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:42.360
that had a decisive mutation that produced an advantage. This group multiplied and killed

03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:50.920
everybody else. We are descendants of that group. I wonder what the peculiar characteristics of

03:02:50.920 --> 03:03:01.560
that group. We can only just listen to the echoes and the ripples that are still within us.

03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:08.600
I suspect what eventually made a big difference was the ability to organize at scale, to program

03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:15.000
each other with ideas. That we became programmable, that we were willing to work on lockstep, that we

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:21.240
went above the tribal level, that we no longer were groups of a few hundred individuals and

03:03:21.240 --> 03:03:27.320
acted on direct reputation systems transactionally, but that we basically evolved an adaptation

03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:35.640
to become state building. To form collectives outside of the direct collectives.

03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:41.000
Yes, and that's basically a part of us became committed to serving something outside of what

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:46.120
we know. Then that's kind of what love is. It's terrifying because it meant that we

03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:52.840
eradicated the others. It's a force. It's an adaptive force that gets us ahead in evolution,

03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:55.160
which means we displace something else that doesn't have that.

03:03:56.680 --> 03:04:01.480
Oh, so we had to murder a lot of people that warned about love. Love led to destruction.

03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:07.320
They didn't have the same strong love as we did. That's why I mentioned this thing with fascism.

03:04:07.320 --> 03:04:15.080
When you see these speeches, do you want total war? Everybody says yes. This is this big,

03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:20.040
oh my God, be a part of something that is more important than me that gives meaning to my existence.

03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:32.440
Fair enough. Do you have advice for young people today in high school, in college,

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:39.800
that are thinking about what to do with their career, with their life, so that at the end of

03:04:39.800 --> 03:04:46.440
the whole thing, they could be proud of what they did? Don't cheat. Have integrity.

03:04:47.400 --> 03:04:51.800
Integrity. So what does integrity look like when you're at the river, or at the leaf,

03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:59.320
or the fat frog in a lake? It basically means that you try to figure out what the thing is that

03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:05.880
is the most right. This doesn't mean that you have to look for what other people tell you

03:05:05.880 --> 03:05:12.120
what's right, but you have to aim for moral autonomy. Things need to be right independently

03:05:12.120 --> 03:05:20.840
of what other people say. I always felt that when people told me to listen to what others say,

03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:26.520
like read the room, build your ideas of what's true based on the high status people of your

03:05:26.520 --> 03:05:31.880
in-group, that does not protect me from fascism. The only way to protect yourself from fascism

03:05:31.880 --> 03:05:36.680
is to decide it's the world that is being built here, the world that I want to be in.

03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:43.480
Yeah. So in some sense, try to make your behavior sustainable. Act in such a way that you

03:05:43.480 --> 03:05:47.880
would feel comfortable on all sides of the transaction. Realize that everybody is you

03:05:47.880 --> 03:05:52.440
in a different timeline, but is seeing things differently and has reasons to do so.

03:05:53.880 --> 03:06:00.600
Yeah. I've come to realize this recently. There is an inner voice that tells you what's right

03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:08.360
and wrong. And speaking of reading the room, there's times what integrity looks like is there's

03:06:08.360 --> 03:06:14.280
times when a lot of people are doing something wrong and what integrity looks like is not going

03:06:14.280 --> 03:06:20.440
on Twitter and tweeting about it, but not participating quietly, not doing. So it's

03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:27.000
not like signaling or not all this kind of stuff, but actually living your what you think is right,

03:06:27.880 --> 03:06:33.320
like living it. That's also sometimes this expectation that others are like us. So imagine

03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:37.880
the possibility that some of the people around you are space aliens that only look human.

03:06:39.160 --> 03:06:43.400
Right. So they don't have the same prayers as you do. They don't have the same

03:06:43.400 --> 03:06:48.920
impulses that what's right and wrong. There's a large diversity in these basic impulses that

03:06:48.920 --> 03:06:53.640
people can have in a given situation. And now realize that you are a space alien.

03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:58.760
Right. You are not actually human. You think that you're human, but you don't know what it means,

03:06:58.760 --> 03:07:03.160
like what it's like to be human. You just make it up as you go along like everybody else.

03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:10.280
And you have to figure that out what it means that you are a full human being, what it means to be

03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:16.200
human in the world and how to connect with others on that. And there is also something, don't be

03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:22.360
afraid in the sense that if you do this, you're not good enough. Because if you are acting on these

03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:27.320
incentives of integrity, you become trustworthy. That's the way in which you can recognize each

03:07:27.320 --> 03:07:32.360
other. There is a particular place where you can meet and you can figure out what that place is,

03:07:32.920 --> 03:07:38.360
where you will give support to people because you realize that they act with integrity,

03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:42.360
and they will also do that. So in some sense, you are safe if you do that.

03:07:43.720 --> 03:07:47.800
You're not always protected. There are people which will abuse you and that might,

03:07:48.600 --> 03:07:52.120
that are bad actors in a way that it's hard to imagine before you meet them.

03:07:52.680 --> 03:07:56.840
But there is also people which will try to protect you.

03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:02.600
Yeah, that's such a, thank you for saying that. There's such a hopeful message

03:08:03.800 --> 03:08:09.880
that no matter what happens to you, there'll be a place, there's people you'll meet

03:08:10.520 --> 03:08:19.160
that also have what you have. And you will find happiness there and safety there.

03:08:19.160 --> 03:08:25.640
Yeah, but it doesn't need to end well. It can also all go wrong. So there's no guarantee in this life.

03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:31.880
So you can do everything right and you still can fail. And horrible things happen to you that

03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:36.680
traumatize you and mutilate you. And you have to be grateful if it doesn't happen.

03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:45.240
And ultimately be grateful no matter what happens, because even just being alive is pretty damn nice.

03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:53.400
Yeah, even that, you know. The gratefulness in some sense is also just generated by your brain

03:08:53.400 --> 03:09:01.560
to keep you going. It's all the trick. Speaking of which, Camus said,

03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:09.000
I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. I see others

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:14.040
paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living.

03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:18.200
What is called the reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying.

03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:23.800
I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions.

03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:33.640
So I have to ask what Josh Abok is the meaning of life. It is an urgent question according to Camus.

03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:41.240
I don't think that there's a single answer to this. Nothing makes sense unless a mind makes it so.

03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:48.120
So you basically have to project a purpose. And if you zoom out far enough, there's the heat test

03:09:48.120 --> 03:09:52.280
of the universe and everything is meaningless. Everything is just a blip in between. And the

03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:58.680
question is, do you find meaning in this blip in between? Do you find meaning in observing squirrels?

03:09:59.640 --> 03:10:04.600
Do you find meaning in raising children and projecting a multi-generational organism into

03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:10.600
the future? Do you find meaning in projecting an aesthetic of the world that you like to the future

03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:16.280
and trying to serve that aesthetic? And if you do, then life has that meaning. And if you don't,

03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:25.560
then it doesn't. I enjoy the idea that you just create the most vibrant, the most weird,

03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:31.880
the most unique kind of blip you can, given your environment, given your set of skills.

03:10:31.880 --> 03:10:43.560
Just be the most weird set of local pocket of complexity you can be. So that when people study

03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:50.760
the universe, they'll pause and be like, that's weird. It looks like a useful strategy, but of

03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:57.640
course it's still motivated reasoning. You're obviously acting on your incentives here.

03:10:57.640 --> 03:11:03.800
It's still a story we tell ourselves within a dream that's hardly in touch with the reality.

03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:05.880
It's definitely a good strategy if you are a podcaster.

03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:12.760
And a human, which I'm still trying to figure out if I am.

03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:15.000
Yeah, there's a mutual relationship somehow.

03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:22.600
Josh, you're one of the most incredible people I know. I really love talking to you. I love

03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:27.320
talking to you again. And it's really an honor that you spend your valuable time with me. I hope

03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:32.600
we get to talk many times throughout our short and meaningless lives.

03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:34.520
More meaningful.

03:11:34.520 --> 03:11:35.800
More meaningful.

03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:37.800
Thank you, Alex. I enjoyed this conversation very much.

03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:42.760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Yosha Bach. And thank you to

03:11:42.760 --> 03:11:49.880
Coinbase, Codecademy, Linode, Netsuite, and ExpressVPN. Check them out in the description

03:11:49.880 --> 03:11:54.680
to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

03:11:55.720 --> 03:12:01.000
People will do anything, no matter how absurd in order to avoid facing their own souls.

03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:07.160
One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness

03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:12.600
conscious. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
