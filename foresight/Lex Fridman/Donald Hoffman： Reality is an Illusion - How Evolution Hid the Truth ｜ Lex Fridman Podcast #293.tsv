0	3680	Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.
4880	9760	What you see is just an adaptive fiction.
12560	14920	The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,
14920	17920	professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,
17920	21200	focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,
21200	23920	visual perception, and consciousness.
23920	27760	He's the author of over 120 scientific papers
27760	31120	on these topics, and his most recent book titled
31120	34080	The Case Against Reality, Why Evolution
34080	36640	Hid the Truth from Our Eyes.
36640	39520	I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,
39520	42720	like those of Donald Hoffman's attempt to shake
42720	45840	the foundation of our understanding of reality,
45840	50240	and thus they take a long time to internalize deeply.
50240	54400	So proceed with caution. Questioning the fabric of reality
54400	58400	can lead you to either madness or the truth.
58400	62400	And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.
62400	65120	This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,
65120	67600	please check out our sponsors in the description.
67600	72000	And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.
72000	74320	In your book The Case Against Reality,
74320	77120	Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes,
77120	81920	you make the bold claim that the world we see with our eyes is not real.
81920	84480	It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.
84480	89600	It is completely detached from objective reality.
89600	91120	Can you explain this idea? Right.
91120	94240	So this is a theorem from Evolution of a Natural Selection.
94240	98400	So the technical question that I and my team asked was,
98400	102080	what is the probability that natural selection would shape
102080	106240	sensory systems to see true properties of objective reality?
106240	110560	And to our surprise, we found that the answer is precisely zero, except for one
110720	112400	kind of structure that we can go into if you want to.
112400	116000	But for any generic structure that you might think the world might have,
116000	122160	a total order, a topology metric, the probability is precisely zero
122160	126400	that natural selection would shape any sensory system of any organism
126400	128480	to see any aspect of objective reality.
128480	135200	So in that sense, what we're seeing is what we need to see
136480	138800	to stay alive long enough to reproduce.
138800	142880	So in other words, we're seeing what we need to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.
143520	150000	So the evolutionary process, the process that took us from the original life on earth
150000	155280	to the humans that we are today, that process does not maximize
156640	159280	for truth and maximizes for fitness, as you say.
159280	160400	Fitness beats truth.
161280	165680	And fitness does not have to be connected to truth is the claim.
166560	171680	And that's where you have an approach towards zero of probability that we
172720	178240	have evolved human cognition, human consciousness, whatever it is,
178240	186160	the magic that makes our mind work, evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,
186160	189040	but its ability to survive in the environment.
189040	190160	That's exactly right.
190240	197360	So most of us intuitively think that surely the way that evolution will make our senses
197360	202880	more fit is to make them tell us more truths, or at least the truths we need to know
202880	205360	about objective reality, the truths we need in our niche.
206000	206880	That's the standard view.
206880	207840	And it was the view I took.
207840	211760	I mean, that's sort of what we're taught or just even assume.
211760	214080	It's just sort of like the intelligent assumption that we would all make.
214640	217760	But we don't have to just wave our hands.
217760	220240	Evolution of a natural selection is a mathematically precise theory.
221120	225600	John Maynard Smith in the 70s created evolutionary game theory.
225600	230400	And we have evolutionary graph theory and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.
230400	232320	And so we don't have to wave our hands.
232320	236640	It's a matter of theorem and proof and or simulation before you get the theorems and proofs.
236640	241120	And a couple of graduate students of mine, Justin Mark and Brian Marion,
241120	245440	did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off that there was something going on here.
246400	250400	And then I went to a mathematician, Chaitan Prakash and Manish Singh and
251440	253680	some other friends of mine, Chris Fields.
253680	256880	And but Chaitan was the real mathematician behind all this.
256880	261680	And he's proved several theorems that uniformly indicate that with one exception,
261680	267760	which has to do with probability measures, there's no the probability zero.
268560	270880	The reason there's an exception for probability measures,
270880	278480	so-called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes, is that for any scientific theory,
280560	284880	there is the assumption that needs to be made that the whatever
287280	291040	structure, the whatever probabilistic structure the world may have,
291680	296160	is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure of our perceptions.
296160	298880	If they were completely unrelated, then no science would be possible.
299600	306160	So this is technically, the map from reality to our senses has to be a so-called
306160	308480	measurable map, has to preserve sigma algebras.
308480	314160	But that means it could be infinite to one and it could collapse all sorts of event information.
314160	320880	But other than that, there's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory for fitness payoff
320880	325520	functions, for example, to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.
325520	328880	So you can ask the technical question. This is one of the avenues we took.
330800	337520	If you look at all the fitness payoffs from whatever world structure you might want to
337520	340240	imagine, so a world with, say, a total order on it.
341280	344000	So it's got n states and they're totally ordered.
344000	349120	And then you can have a set of maps from that world into a set of payoffs,
349120	351920	say from zero to a thousand or whatever you want your payoffs to be.
352640	355440	And you can just literally count all the payoff functions.
356160	358000	And just do the combinatorics and count them.
358000	359840	And then you can ask a precise question.
359840	363840	How many of those payoff functions preserve the total order?
363840	364720	If that's what you're looking for.
364720	366400	Or how many preserve the topology?
367280	368960	And you just count them and divide.
368960	373120	So the number that are homomorphisms versus the total number,
373120	376560	and then take the limit as the number of states in the world,
376560	379760	and the number of payoff values goes very large.
379760	381600	And when you do that, you get zero every time.
381600	384320	Okay, there's a million things to ask here.
384320	389520	But first of all, just in case people are not familiar with your work,
390800	395360	let's sort of linger on the big, bold statement here,
396480	399040	which is the thing we see with our eyes
400960	404400	is not some kind of limited window into reality.
404960	407840	It is completely detached from reality,
407840	409520	likely completely detached from reality.
409520	411040	You're saying 100% likely.
412560	417680	Okay, so none of this is real in the way we think is real.
417680	419920	In the way we have this intuition,
419920	425200	there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,
425200	427760	but underneath it all, there's atoms.
427760	429760	And there's an entire century of physics
429760	431920	that describes the functioning of those atoms
431920	433680	and the quarks that make them up.
433680	439760	There's many Nobel Prizes about particles and fields
439760	443200	and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up
443200	445040	to something that's perceivable to us,
445040	449280	both with our eyes, with our different senses as this table.
449840	452640	Then there's also ideas of chemistry
453520	458480	that overlays of abstraction from DNA to embryos,
458480	462000	the cells that make the human body.
462800	465760	So all of that is not real.
466560	472400	It's a real experience and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.
472400	475200	So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.
476320	478320	We want to think that the perceptions are real.
478320	480640	So their perceptions are real as perceptions.
481680	483440	We are having our perceptions,
483440	486800	but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship
486800	488800	between our perceptions and reality.
488880	491520	If I look up and see the moon,
491520	495040	then there is something that exists in space and time
495040	498880	that matches what I perceive.
498880	504400	And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution
504400	509520	by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.
509520	511760	That our perceptions are there.
511760	515040	They're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.
515040	516720	They're not there to show you the truth.
516720	520000	In fact, the way I think about it is they're there to hide the truth
520560	522400	because the truth is too complicated.
522400	526320	It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop to write an email.
527520	530160	What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,
530160	531760	but good luck trying to do it that way.
532640	534240	The reason why we have a user interface
534240	536480	is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,
536480	539520	the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.
539520	540960	If you had to know all that truth,
542080	542960	your friends wouldn't hear from you.
543920	548240	So what evolution gave us was perceptions
548240	550080	that guide adaptive behavior.
550080	551920	And part of that process, it turns out,
551920	555840	means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.
556640	560080	So what's the difference between hiding the truth
560640	566480	and forming abstractions, layers upon layers of abstractions
566480	572720	over these over low level voltages and transistors and chips
572720	577600	and programming languages from assembly to Python
577600	580880	that then leads you to be able to have an interface like Chrome
580880	586240	where you open up another set of JavaScript and HTML programming
586240	589280	languages that lead you to have a graphical user interface
589280	591840	on which you can then send your friends an email.
592160	597760	So is that completely detached from the zeros and ones
598320	600640	that are firing away inside the computer?
601440	601920	It's not.
602720	605440	Of course, when I talk about the user interface on your desktop,
606720	610960	there's this whole sophisticated backstory to it,
610960	612960	right, that the hardware and the software
612960	614160	that's allowing that to happen.
614960	617120	Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?
617120	620320	So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate
620320	622960	to tell you what is that backstory.
622960	626960	It's going to say that whatever reality is,
626960	627840	and that's the interesting thing.
627840	630560	It says whatever reality is, you don't see it.
631200	633600	You see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you
634320	638720	what that user interface is, how it's built, right?
638720	643760	Now, we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface,
643760	645920	but already we're going to look at that and go,
645920	647840	okay, before I would look at neurons,
647840	649520	and I was assuming that I was seeing something
649520	651840	that was at least partially true.
652720	654720	And now I'm realizing it could be like looking
654720	659120	at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop,
659120	662480	and good luck going from that to the data structures
662480	663520	and then the voltages.
663520	665280	And I mean, good luck.
665280	666880	There's just no way.
666880	669600	So what's interesting about this is that our scientific theories
670640	675280	are precise enough and rigorous enough to tell us certain limits,
675840	678640	but, and even limits of the theories themselves.
678640	682160	But they're not going to tell us what the next move is,
682160	684320	and that's where scientific creativity comes in.
684320	687360	So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,
687360	689680	is not alien to physicists.
689680	692480	The physicists are saying precisely the same thing,
692480	693920	that space time is doomed.
693920	695920	We've assumed that space time is fundamental.
695920	698240	We've assumed that for several centuries,
698240	699360	and it's been very useful.
699360	700800	So all the things that you were mentioning,
700800	702640	the particles and all the work that's been done,
702640	704080	that's all been done in space time,
704960	707360	but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.
707360	711040	There's no such thing as space time fundamentally
711600	713040	in the laws of physics.
713920	718800	And that comes actually out of gravity together
718800	719760	with quantum field theory.
719760	720960	It just comes right out of it.
720960	724880	It's a theorem of those two theories put together.
725680	727920	But it doesn't tell you what's behind it.
727920	731120	So the physicists know that their best theories,
731680	733840	Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together,
735040	737280	entail that space time cannot be fundamental,
737280	739760	and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.
740720	742400	They're just irreducible representations
742400	743600	of the symmetries of space time.
743600	744640	That's what they are.
744640	747440	So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.
747440	749600	We put together what the physicists are discovering,
749600	752080	and we can talk about how they do that.
752080	753680	And then we, the new discoveries
753680	755280	from evolution of a natural selection,
755280	757680	both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.
758640	762080	And what both are saying is space time has had a good ride.
763040	764160	It's been very useful.
764160	766400	Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.
766400	768240	And it's time for us to go beyond.
768240	771200	When you say space time is doomed, is it the space?
772240	773040	Is it the time?
773040	777200	Is it the very hard coded specification of four dimensions?
779600	782320	Or are you specifically referring to the kind of
783440	786240	perceptual domain that humans operate in,
786240	787200	which is space time?
787200	788960	You think like there's a 3D,
789920	793120	like our world is three-dimensional,
793120	795280	and time progresses forward.
795280	798000	Therefore, three dimensions plus one, 4D.
798000	800400	What exactly do you mean by space time?
801840	803920	What do you mean by space time is doomed?
803920	804560	Great, great.
804560	806480	So this is, by the way, not my quote.
806480	808960	This is from, for example, Nima Arkany Ahmed
809680	811600	at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.
811600	814160	Ed Whitten also there.
814160	816480	David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.
816480	819200	So this is not just something the cognitive scientists,
819200	820560	this is what the physicists are saying.
820560	824240	Yeah, the physicists, they're space time skeptics.
824960	828080	Yeah, they're saying that, and I can say exactly why
828640	831520	they think it's doomed, but what they're saying is that,
831520	833760	because your question was what aspect of space time,
833760	834880	what are we talking about here?
834880	836720	It's both space and time.
836720	839600	They're union into space time as in Einstein's theory.
839600	840320	That's doomed.
841200	844240	And they're basically saying that
845200	849120	even quantum theory, this is Nima Arkany Ahmed especially.
849120	852880	So Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.
852880	855440	So that the notion of Hilbert space,
855440	858880	which is really critical to quantum field theory,
858880	861920	quantum information theory, that's not going to figure
861920	865200	in the fundamental new laws of physics.
865200	869440	So what they're looking for is some new mathematical structures
869920	875200	beyond space time, beyond Einstein's four-dimensional space time,
875200	878720	or super symmetric version, geometric algebra,
878720	881040	signature, two comma four kind of,
881040	883200	there are different ways that you can represent it,
883200	885440	but they're finding new structures.
885440	887200	And then by the way, they're succeeding now.
887200	888880	They're finding, they found something called the amplitude
888880	889520	to hydrant.
889520	893520	This is Nima and his colleagues, the cosmological polytope.
893520	897280	These are, so there are these like polytopes,
897280	901520	these polyhedra in multi-dimensions, generalizations of simplices
902400	907200	that are coding for, for example, the scattering amplitudes
907200	910800	of processes in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.
910800	914480	So they're finding that if they let go of space time completely,
915280	918720	they're finding new ways of computing these scattering amplitudes
918720	922240	that turn literally billions of terms into one term.
923600	926640	When you do it in space and time, because it's the wrong framework,
926720	929440	it's, it's, it's just a user interface from,
929440	930800	that's now from the evolutionary point of view,
930800	932080	it's just user interface.
932080	934560	It's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.
934560	936800	So it's missing deep symmetry,
936800	938880	it's something called a dual conformal symmetry,
938880	940800	which turns out to be true of the scattering data,
940800	942640	but you can't see it in space time.
942640	946160	And it's making the computations way too complicated
946160	949120	because you're trying to compute all the loops and Feynman diagrams
949120	950240	and all the Feynman integrals.
950240	952880	So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes
952880	956400	is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,
956480	957840	locality and uniterity.
958480	960320	And so by, when you enforce those,
960320	963520	you get all these loops and multiple, you know,
963520	964480	different levels of loops.
964480	967440	And for each of those, you have to add new terms to your computation.
967440	970080	But when you do it outside of space time,
971040	973600	you don't have the notion of uniterity.
973600	975600	You don't have the notion of locality.
975600	977200	You have something deeper.
977200	980080	And it's capturing some symmetries that are actually true of the data.
980720	984640	And, but then when you look at the geometry of the facets of these polytopes,
985360	990720	then certain of them will code for uniterity and locality.
990720	993360	So it actually comes out of the structure of these deep polytopes.
993360	996400	So what we're finding is there's this whole new world,
996400	1001920	now beyond space time, that is making explicit symmetries
1001920	1004480	that are true of the data that cannot be seen in space time.
1005040	1007920	And that is turning the computations from billions of terms
1007920	1010320	to one or two or a handful of terms.
1010320	1013200	So we're getting insights into symmetries.
1013200	1015280	And we're, and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple
1015280	1016720	because we're not doing something silly.
1016720	1018880	We're not adding up all these loops in space time.
1018880	1020640	We're doing something far deeper.
1020640	1022240	But they don't know what this world is about.
1022960	1025600	So, you know, they're in an interesting position
1027040	1028880	where we know that space time is doomed.
1028880	1031200	And I should probably tell you why it's doomed,
1031200	1032720	what they're saying about why it's doomed.
1032720	1035440	But, but they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.
1035440	1038560	What, what flashlight are we going to use to look into the dark
1038560	1039600	beyond space time?
1039600	1042800	Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory can't tell us.
1043200	1043920	What's beyond them.
1043920	1046240	All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,
1046240	1050000	space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,
1050000	1051520	10 to the minus 43 seconds.
1051520	1053920	Beyond that, space time doesn't even make sense.
1053920	1055840	It just has no operational definition.
1056960	1058880	So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond.
1058880	1061520	And so they're, they're just looking for deep structures.
1061520	1063600	Like guessing is really fun.
1063600	1067440	So these really brilliant guys, generic, brilliant men and women
1067440	1069760	who are doing this work, physicists,
1069760	1072240	are making guesses about these structures.
1072320	1074080	Informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,
1074080	1076800	well, okay, what deeper structure could give us the stuff
1076800	1078240	that we're seeing in space time,
1078240	1080720	but without certain commitments that we have to make
1080720	1082720	in space time, like locality unit.
1082720	1084560	So they make these brilliant guesses.
1084560	1086560	And of course, most of the time you're going to be wrong.
1086560	1089520	But once you get one or two, that start to pay off.
1089520	1091360	And then you get some lucky breaks.
1091360	1093760	So they got lucky break back in 1986.
1095440	1097360	Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor
1098320	1102560	took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in
1102560	1105520	at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.
1105520	1107120	So that kind of scattering thing.
1107120	1110160	So it's like apparently for people who are into this,
1110160	1111920	that's sort of something that happens so often
1111920	1114240	you need to be able to find it and get rid of those
1114240	1116080	because you already know about that and need to.
1116080	1117120	So you needed to compute them.
1117120	1119760	It was billions of terms and they couldn't do it.
1119760	1121920	Even for the supercomputers couldn't do that
1121920	1124400	for the many billions or millions of times per second
1124400	1125040	they needed to do it.
1125040	1128720	So they bagged, the experimentals bagged the theorists
1128720	1130560	and please can you, you got it.
1131200	1133040	So Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,
1133040	1137440	hundreds of pages and miraculously turned it into nine.
1138000	1140000	And then a little bit later they guessed
1140000	1142400	one term expression that turned out to be equivalent.
1142400	1147120	So billions of terms reduced to one term
1147120	1150720	that's so-called famous Park-Taylor formula, 1986.
1150720	1153840	And that was like, okay, where did that come from?
1153920	1156560	What, this is a pointer into a deep realm
1157200	1160560	beyond space and time, but no one, I mean,
1160560	1161600	what can you do with it?
1161600	1163040	And they thought maybe it was a one-off,
1163040	1165760	but then other formulas started coming up
1165760	1168400	and then eventually Neymar, Connie, Hamad and his team
1168400	1170160	found this thing called the amplituhedron
1170160	1172160	which really sort of captures the whole,
1172880	1174320	a big part of the whole ball of wax.
1175600	1177840	I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.
1177840	1180320	So I won't say they did it all by any means.
1180320	1182640	They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.
1182640	1188880	So what's remarkable to me is that two pillars of modern science,
1189680	1192160	quantum field theory with gravity on the one hand,
1192800	1194560	and evolution by natural selection on the other.
1195440	1198240	Just in the last 20 years have very clearly said
1198960	1200480	space-time has had a good run.
1201040	1203680	Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.
1203680	1205600	So we had a great ontology of space-time,
1205600	1207200	a great methodology of reductionism.
1207920	1209280	Now it's time for a new trick.
1210640	1212080	But now you need to go deeper.
1212080	1215760	And show, by the way, this doesn't mean we throw away everything we've done,
1215760	1216560	not by a long shot.
1217200	1220880	Every new idea that we come up with beyond space-time
1220880	1223200	must project precisely into space-time.
1223200	1226480	And it better give us back everything that we know and love in space-time
1226480	1227680	or generalizations.
1228640	1230800	Or it's not going to be taken seriously and it shouldn't be.
1230800	1234560	So we have a strong constraint on whatever we're going to do
1234560	1235440	beyond space-time.
1235440	1237520	It needs to project into space-time.
1237520	1239280	And whatever this deeper theory is,
1239280	1242720	it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.
1242720	1244320	This may not be part of this deeper realm.
1244320	1247440	But when we take whatever that thing is beyond space-time
1247440	1249120	and project it into space-time,
1249120	1251680	it has to look like evolution by natural selection.
1251680	1252320	Or it's wrong.
1252960	1257360	So that's a strong constraint on this work.
1257360	1264160	So even the evolution by natural selection and quantum field theory
1265120	1270640	could be interfaces into something that doesn't look anything like,
1271520	1272080	like you mentioned.
1272080	1274800	I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution might be
1275360	1278160	a very crappy interface into something much deeper.
1278160	1278880	That's right.
1278880	1283040	They're both telling us that the framework that you've had can only go so far.
1283040	1284000	And it has to stop.
1284000	1285440	And there's something beyond.
1285440	1289040	And that framework, the very framework that is space and time itself.
1289040	1293040	Now, of course, evolution by natural selection is not telling us
1293840	1296240	about like Einstein's relativistic space time.
1296240	1298240	So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.
1298240	1301600	It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,
1302400	1309040	which we have used as the basis for creating first a Newtonian space versus time
1309600	1313440	as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.
1313440	1316560	And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.
1316560	1318960	So the relationship between what evolution is telling us
1318960	1320960	and what the physicists are telling us is that,
1320960	1329440	in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time are formulated as sort of
1330160	1332400	rigorous extensions of our perceptual space,
1334080	1339040	making it mathematically rigorous and laying out the symmetries that they find there.
1339040	1340720	So that's sort of the relationship between them.
1340720	1347040	So it's the perceptual space time that evolution is telling us is just a user interface effectively.
1347680	1350640	And then the physicists are finding that even the mathematical extension
1350960	1354880	of that into the Einsteinian formulation has to be,
1354880	1356880	as well, not the final story.
1356880	1358080	There's something deeper.
1358080	1363120	So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces.
1363120	1369040	As we march forward from Newtonian physics to quantum mechanics,
1369920	1373280	these are all, in your view, interfaces.
1376160	1378640	Are we getting closer to objective reality?
1379280	1384000	How do we know if these interfaces in the process of science,
1384800	1389680	the reason we like those interfaces is because they're predictive of some aspects,
1389680	1392880	strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.
1394080	1399440	Is that completely deviating from our understanding of that reality?
1399440	1401920	Or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?
1402640	1407200	Well, of course, one critical constraint on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested
1407200	1410800	and pass the experiments that we have for them.
1410800	1414400	So no one's arguing against experiments being important
1414400	1420560	and wanting to test all of our current theories and any new theories on that.
1420560	1423520	So that's all there.
1424240	1430800	But we have good reason to believe that science will never get a theory of everything.
1432320	1433520	Everything, everything.
1433520	1435680	Everything, everything, right, a final theory of everything, right?
1436320	1439600	I think that my, my own take is for what it's worth is that
1439600	1443040	girdles in completeness theorem sort of points us in that direction,
1443040	1448480	that even with mathematics, any finite axiomatization that's
1448480	1450400	sophisticated enough to be able to do arithmetic,
1451040	1454160	it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true,
1454160	1458800	that can't be proven, can't be deduced from within that framework.
1459440	1461840	And if you add the new statements to your axioms,
1461840	1464160	then there'll be always new statements that are true,
1464160	1466000	but can't be proven with a new axiom system.
1466880	1472560	And the best scientific theories in physics, for example,
1472560	1474960	and also now evolution, are mathematical.
1474960	1477440	So our theories are going to be, they're going to have their own assumptions,
1478400	1481600	and they'll be mathematically precise.
1481600	1484320	And there'll be theories perhaps of everything except those assumptions,
1484320	1486960	because assumptions are, we say,
1486960	1488160	please grant me these assumptions.
1488160	1490640	If you grant me these assumptions, then I can explain this other stuff.
1491440	1497520	But so you have the assumptions that are like miracles,
1497520	1499360	as far as the theory is concerned, they're not explained,
1499360	1501600	they're the starting points for explanation.
1501600	1504240	And then you have the mathematical structure of the theory itself,
1504240	1506880	which will have the girdle limits.
1507520	1516400	And so my take is that reality, whatever it is, is always going to transcend
1516400	1522320	any conceptual theory that we can come up with.
1522320	1524000	There's always going to be mystery at the edges.
1527520	1529360	Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.
1529360	1529680	Okay.
1531440	1532080	And truths.
1532720	1537840	So there's this idea that is brought up in the financial space of settlement,
1537840	1538720	of transactions.
1539280	1542400	It's often talked about in cryptocurrency especially.
1542480	1547600	So you could do, money, cash is not connected to anything.
1548480	1552080	It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,
1552080	1556240	but then you can use money to exchange value to transact.
1557200	1558880	So when it was on the gold standard,
1559760	1565280	the money would represent some stable component of reality.
1565280	1571280	Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation
1572160	1574160	if we generalize that idea?
1574160	1581520	Isn't it better to connect your, whatever we humans are doing in the social interaction
1581520	1586560	space with each other, isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective to connect it
1586560	1593600	to some degree to reality so that the transactions are settled with something that's universal,
1593600	1597360	as opposed to us constantly operating in something that's a complete illusion?
1598160	1600160	Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?
1601280	1610800	Like where you really deviate very, very far away from the underlying reality?
1610800	1612720	Or do you not never get in trouble for this?
1613600	1620800	Can you just completely drift far, far away from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?
1621440	1622240	That's a great question.
1622720	1626800	On the financial side, there's two levels at least that we could take your question.
1626800	1630720	One is strictly evolutionary psychology of financial systems.
1631520	1632800	And that's pretty interesting.
1633440	1639360	And there, the decentralized idea, the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies may make
1639360	1641920	good sense from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.
1643520	1649600	Human nature being what it is, putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers
1650560	1657040	depends a lot on the veracity of those and trustworthiness of those few central controllers.
1657440	1661200	We have ample evidence time and again that's often betrayed.
1661840	1667040	So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say, to have a decentralized, I mean,
1667040	1668480	democracy is a step in that direction.
1670240	1672160	We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do.
1672160	1677760	We decentralize things, because if you have Marcus Aurelio says you're emperor,
1677760	1678480	you're great.
1678480	1681040	If you have Nero, it's not so great.
1681040	1682240	And so we don't want that.
1682240	1684160	So democracy is a step in that direction.
1684640	1688800	But I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step
1688800	1693120	and is going to even make the democratization even greater.
1693120	1694640	So that's one level.
1694640	1698720	Also, the fact that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is also
1699520	1702320	a consequence of evolution.
1704080	1706080	That's also a feature, I think.
1706880	1712480	You can argue from the long span of living organisms, it's nice for power to corrupt.
1713440	1721840	So mad men and women throughout history might be useful to teach us a lesson.
1722880	1724640	We can learn from our negative example, right?
1724640	1725120	Exactly.
1727280	1727920	Right.
1727920	1732240	Power does corrupt, and I think that you can think about that again from an evolutionary
1732240	1732720	point of view.
1733440	1735440	But I think that your question was a little deeper.
1735760	1743200	When that was, does the evolutionary interface idea sort of unhinge science from
1745120	1748480	some kind of important test for the theories?
1750400	1755760	Does it mean that anything goes in scientific theory, but if we don't see the truth,
1755760	1758080	is there no way to tether our theories and test them?
1758560	1764080	And I think there's no problem there.
1764800	1769520	We can only test things in terms of what we can measure with our senses in space and time.
1769520	1776000	So we're going to have to continue to do experiments, but we're going to understand
1776000	1778240	a little bit differently what those experiments are.
1778880	1785600	We had thought that when we see a pointer on some machine in an experiment,
1785600	1789920	that the machine exists, the pointer exists, and the values exist even when no one
1789920	1792640	is looking at them, and that they're an objective truth.
1792640	1794880	And our best theories are telling us no.
1796400	1801840	Pointers are just pointers, and that's what you have to rely on for making your judgments.
1802800	1809840	But even the pointers themselves are not the objective reality.
1810480	1815840	So and I think Gertl is telling us that not that anything goes, but
1816800	1820800	as you develop new axiom systems, you will find out what goes within that axiom system
1821520	1823600	and what testable predictions you can make.
1823600	1825680	So I don't think we're untethered.
1825680	1827840	We continue to do experiments.
1827840	1832960	What I think we won't have that we want is a conceptual understanding
1833920	1836640	that gives us a theory of everything that's final and complete.
1837440	1842720	I think that this is, to put it another way, this is job security for scientists.
1843920	1845120	Our job will never be done.
1845120	1846720	It's job security for neuroscience.
1847600	1850640	Because before we thought that when we looked in the brain,
1850640	1857440	we saw neurons and neural networks and action potentials and synapses and so forth,
1857440	1859680	and that was the reality.
1860240	1861680	Now we have to reverse engineer that.
1861680	1863680	We have to say what is beyond space-time?
1864640	1865680	What is going on?
1865680	1868240	What is a dynamical system beyond space-time?
1868240	1870480	That when we project it into Einstein space-time,
1870480	1873920	gives us things that look like neurons and neural networks and synapses.
1875200	1876400	So we have to reverse engineer.
1876400	1878880	So there's going to be lots more work for neuroscience.
1878880	1883760	It's going to be far more complicated and difficult and challenging.
1883760	1884960	But that's wonderful.
1884960	1885920	That's what we need to do.
1885920	1889280	We thought neurons exist when they are perceived and they don't.
1889280	1891920	In the same way that if I show you, when I say they don't exist,
1891920	1893360	I should be very, very concrete.
1894320	1900400	If I draw on a piece of paper a little sketch of something that is called the necker cube,
1900400	1902640	it's just a little line drawing of a cube.
1902640	1903920	It's on a flat piece of paper.
1903920	1908320	If I execute it well and I show it to you, you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.
1908320	1909680	Sometimes you'll see one face in front.
1909680	1911120	Sometimes you'll see the other face in front.
1911760	1914960	But if I ask you, which face is in front when you don't look?
1917200	1920320	The answer is, well, neither face is in front because there's no cube.
1921200	1922560	This is a flat piece of paper.
1923200	1927520	So when you look at the piece of paper, you perceptually create the cube.
1928400	1933120	And when you look at it, then you fix one face to be in front and one face to be in front.
1933120	1935920	So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.
1935920	1938080	Space time itself is like the cube.
1938080	1941840	It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,
1941840	1947280	whatever your sensory systems mean now, because we now have to even take that for granted.
1947280	1950720	But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly.
1951280	1953920	And they're data structures and the computer science says,
1953920	1955600	and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.
1955600	1957360	So you create them and garbage collect them.
1957360	1965440	But is it possible that it's mapped well in some concrete, predictable way to objective reality?
1965440	1970560	The sheet of paper, the two-dimensional space, or we can talk about space time,
1971200	1978480	maps in some way that we maybe don't yet understand, but we'll one day understand
1978560	1979520	what that mapping is.
1979520	1980800	But it maps reliably.
1980800	1982320	It is tethered in that way.
1982880	1983440	Well, yes.
1983440	1987600	And so the new theories that the physicists are finding beyond space time have that kind of
1987600	1988080	tethering.
1988080	1991760	So they show precisely how you start with an amplitude hydrant
1991760	1997600	and how you project this high-dimensional structure into the four dimensions of space time.
1998240	2002240	So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.
2002240	2005040	And they're doing the same thing with the cosmological polytopes.
2005600	2012800	So they're the ones that are making the most concrete and fun advances going beyond space time.
2012800	2014400	And they're tethering it.
2015200	2020960	They say this is precisely the mathematical projection from this deeper structure into space time.
2021760	2026800	One thing I'll say about, as a nonphysicist, what I find interesting is that they're finding just
2027600	2030320	geometry, but there's no notion of dynamics.
2031040	2034960	Right now, they're just finding these static geometric structures,
2035840	2037120	which is impressive.
2037120	2038240	So I'm not putting them down.
2038240	2045440	This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated and brilliant and adventurous.
2047280	2048160	It's all those things.
2048160	2052800	And beautiful from a human aesthetic perspective because geometry is beautiful.
2052800	2054000	It's absolutely.
2054000	2057680	And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data that can't be seen in space time.
2058640	2064160	But I'm looking for a theory beyond space time that's a dynamical theory.
2065120	2069840	I would love to find, and we can talk about that at some point, a theory of consciousness in which
2070800	2076320	the dynamics of consciousness itself will give rise to the geometry that the physicists are
2076320	2077760	finding beyond space time.
2077760	2081520	If we can do that, then we'd have a completely different way of looking at how consciousness
2081520	2086160	is related to what we call the brain or the physical world more generally.
2086240	2091360	Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues, about 99% of them, are trying to...
2093920	2095600	They're assuming space time is fundamental.
2096560	2100880	They're assuming that particles are fundamental, quarks, gluons, leptons, and so forth.
2101920	2104000	Elements, atoms, and so forth are fundamental.
2104000	2107920	And that therefore neurons and brains are part of objective reality.
2108720	2111840	And that somehow when you get matter that's complicated enough,
2112720	2117760	it will somehow generate conscious experiences by its functional properties.
2117760	2123040	Or if you're panpsychist, maybe in addition to the physical properties of particles, you add
2124000	2127120	consciousness property as well.
2127120	2132080	And then you combine these physical and conscious properties to get more complicated ones.
2132080	2134480	But they're all doing it within space time.
2136320	2139680	All of the work that's being done on consciousness and its relationship
2140640	2145760	to the brain has all assumed something that our best theories are telling us is doomed,
2145760	2146720	space time.
2146720	2150240	Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?
2150240	2151680	So you bring up space time.
2153520	2158320	I mean, that's just one useful interface we've used for a long time.
2159600	2161600	Surely there's other interfaces.
2161600	2165360	Is space time just one of the big ones that you...
2165360	2169520	To build up people's intuition about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?
2170320	2176240	Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw in the way we see the world?
2177360	2181600	Well, everything else that we think we know are things in space time.
2183360	2184160	Sure.
2184160	2192720	And so when you say space time is doomed, this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,
2192720	2195040	the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.
2196000	2201760	Not to the scientific method, but to the fundamental ontology and also the fundamental
2201760	2207280	methodology, the ontology of space time and its contents, and the methodology of reductionism,
2207280	2213920	which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time, we will find more and more fundamental
2213920	2214240	laws.
2215040	2220720	And that's been very useful for space and time for centuries, reductionism for centuries.
2221360	2224640	But now we realize that that's over.
2224640	2228640	Reductionism is in fact dead as a space time.
2228640	2230480	What exactly is reductionism?
2230480	2237600	What is the process of reductionism that is different than some of the physicists that
2237600	2241920	you mentioned that are trying to let go of the assumption of space time?
2241920	2242640	What can be on?
2242640	2247200	Isn't that still trying to come up with a simple model that explains this whole thing?
2247200	2248480	Isn't it still reducing?
2249280	2253040	It's a wonderful question because it really helps to clarify two different notions,
2253040	2259280	which is scientific explanation on the one hand and a particular kind of scientific explanation
2259280	2260800	on the other, which is the reductionist.
2260800	2266720	So the reductionist explanation is saying, I will start with things that are smaller
2266720	2271040	in space time and therefore more fundamental, where the laws are more fundamental.
2271040	2274800	So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.
2274800	2280160	Whereas in science, more generally, we just say like when Einstein did the special theory
2280160	2283440	of relativity, he's saying, let me have a couple postulates.
2283440	2291040	I will assume that the speed of light is universal for all observers in uniform motion
2291840	2298080	and that the laws of physics, for uniform motion, are that's not a reductionist.
2298080	2299920	Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.
2299920	2303280	I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.
2303280	2304400	It's not a reductionist thing.
2304480	2306800	You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.
2307680	2310560	You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.
2310560	2312160	Same thing with this theory of gravity.
2312960	2315600	It's the falling elevator idea, right?
2315600	2317440	So it's not a reductionist kind of thing.
2318880	2319680	It's something different.
2319680	2324320	So simplification is a bigger thing than just reductionism.
2325440	2329440	Reductionism has been a particularly useful kind of scientific explanation,
2329440	2333360	for example, in thermodynamics, where the notion that we have of heat,
2333360	2335760	some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat.
2336560	2341040	It turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered, well, hey, if we go to smaller
2341040	2343840	and smaller scales, we find these things called molecules or atoms.
2344480	2348640	If we think of them as bouncing around and having some kind of energy,
2348640	2353840	then what we call heat is really can be reduced to that.
2355200	2358960	So that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,
2358960	2363760	is a useful kind of scientific explanation that works within a range of scales
2363760	2365280	within space time.
2365280	2368320	But we know now precisely where that has to stop,
2368320	2372080	at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.
2372640	2377360	And I would be impressed if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.
2377360	2379760	I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
2383360	2386160	I don't even know how to comprehend either of those numbers, frankly.
2387120	2391360	Just a small aside, because I am a computer science person,
2391360	2393360	I also find cellular automata beautiful.
2394800	2401280	So you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram, who recently has been very excitedly exploring
2402320	2407920	a proposal for a data structure that could be the numbers that would make you a little bit
2407920	2411440	happier in terms of scale, because they're very, very, very, very tiny.
2411680	2417920	So do you like this space of exploration of really thinking, letting go of space time,
2418480	2422080	letting go of everything and trying to think what kind of data structures could be
2422080	2423760	underneath this whole mess?
2423760	2424240	That's right.
2424240	2427680	So if they're thinking about these as outside of space time,
2427680	2429040	then that's what we have to do.
2429040	2430560	That's what our best theories are telling us.
2430560	2432480	You now have to think outside of space time.
2432480	2440240	Now, of course, I should back up and say, we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?
2440240	2442880	But that doesn't mean that there's not good work to do Newton.
2442880	2446080	There's all sorts of Newtonian physics that takes us to the moon and so forth,
2446080	2449840	and there's lots of good problems that we want to solve with Newtonian physics.
2449840	2451200	The same thing will be true of space time.
2451200	2453840	We'll still, it's not like we're going to stop using space time.
2453840	2456320	We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.
2456320	2464080	But for those scientists who are really looking to go deeper, to actually find the next,
2464080	2467360	just like what Einstein did to Newton, what are we going to do to Einstein?
2467360	2470880	How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory to something deeper?
2470880	2473120	Then we have to actually let go.
2473120	2477520	And if we're going to do like this automata kind of approach,
2478720	2483520	it's critical that it's not automata in space time, it's automata prior to space time,
2483520	2485760	from which we're going to show how space time emerges.
2485760	2489520	If you're doing automata within space time, well, that might be a fun model,
2489520	2491840	but it's not the radical new step that we need.
2492240	2496080	Yeah, so the space time emerges from that whatever system,
2496080	2499360	and like you're saying, it's a dynamical system.
2499360	2503360	Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means when we go beyond?
2505600	2509600	When you start to think about dynamics, that could mean a lot of things.
2510240	2516320	Even causality could mean a lot of things if we realize that everything's an interface.
2518160	2521280	Like what, how much do we really know is an interesting question?
2521280	2525360	Because you brought up neurons, I got to ask you on another, yet another tangent.
2525360	2528000	There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at called,
2528640	2531440	Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?
2531440	2535360	And I just enjoyed that thought experiment that they provided, which is,
2535920	2541360	they basically, it's a couple of neuroscientists, Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,
2542240	2547680	who use the tools of neuroscience to analyze a microprocessor.
2547680	2549520	I saw a computer chip.
2550240	2554320	If we lesion it here, what happens and so forth, and if you go and lesion in a computer,
2555680	2559040	it's very, very clear that lesion experiments on computers are not going to give you a lot
2559040	2560320	of insight into how it works.
2560320	2564000	And also the measurement devices and the kind of sort of just using the basic approaches of
2564000	2569360	neuroscience collecting the data, trying to intuit about the underlying function of it.
2569360	2575440	And that helps you understand that our scientific exploration of concepts,
2575440	2584080	depending on the field, are maybe in the very, very early stages.
2584880	2587360	I wouldn't say it leaves us astray.
2588320	2593920	Perhaps it does sometimes, but it's not a, it's not anywhere close to some fundamental
2593920	2596320	mechanism that actually makes the thing work.
2596320	2600960	I don't know if you can sort of comment on that in terms of using neuroscience to understand
2600960	2604080	the human mind and neurons.
2604080	2609280	Are we really far away potentially from understanding in the way we understand
2610480	2613680	the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?
2613680	2619200	So one thing about understanding is you can understand for fun.
2620560	2624960	The other one is to understand so you could build things.
2625760	2627760	And that's when you really have to understand.
2629040	2629840	Exactly.
2629920	2637520	In fact, what got me into the field that I at MIT was work by David Maher on this very topic.
2637520	2642720	So David Maher was a professor at MIT, but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience, studying
2642720	2645200	just the architectures of the brain.
2645200	2648480	But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.
2649920	2656960	He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was, left him unsatisfied because he didn't
2656960	2661680	know what the cerebellum was for and why it had that architecture.
2661680	2669120	And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there and he said, he had this three-level
2669120	2670640	approach that really grabbed my attention.
2670640	2674720	So when I was an undergrad at UCLA, I read one of his papers in a class and said,
2674720	2675280	who is this guy?
2675280	2677440	Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.
2677440	2678720	What is being computed and why?
2680240	2681280	An algorithm.
2681280	2682320	How is it being computed?
2682320	2684880	What are the algorithms?
2684880	2685920	And then the hardware.
2685920	2687760	How does it get instantiated in the hardware?
2687760	2692640	And so to really do neuroscience, he argued, we needed to have understanding at all those levels.
2692640	2694320	And that really got me.
2694320	2698320	I loved the neuroscience, but I realized this guy was saying, if you can't build it,
2698320	2700000	you don't understand it effectively.
2700000	2701840	And so that's why I went to MIT.
2701840	2707520	And I had the pleasure of working with David until he died just a year and a half later.
2709120	2713920	So there's been that idea that with neuroscience, we have to have,
2713920	2718800	in some sense, a top-down model of what's being computed and why
2718800	2719920	that we would then go after.
2719920	2724800	And the same thing with the trying to reverse engineer a computing system like your laptop.
2725360	2729520	We really need to understand what the user interface is about and why we have
2730080	2734080	what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.
2734080	2739360	You need to know why to really understand all the circuitry and what it's for.
2740320	2748880	Now, evolution of a natural selection does not tell us the deeper question
2750480	2753120	that we're asking, the answer to the deeper question, which is why.
2756000	2758800	What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?
2759520	2765200	All it tells us is that whatever reality is, it's not what you see.
2766160	2771360	What you see is just an adaptive fiction.
2772080	2778000	So just to linger on this fascinating bold question that shakes you out of your dream state,
2778880	2787040	does this fiction still help you in building intuitions as literary fiction does about reality?
2787680	2796240	The reason we read literary fiction is it helps us build intuitions and an understanding
2796240	2800320	in indirect ways sneak up to the difficult questions of human nature.
2800320	2801280	Great fiction.
2801920	2804160	Same with this observed reality.
2806000	2809120	Does this interface that we get, this fictional interface,
2809120	2814080	help us build intuition about deeper truths of how this whole mess works?
2814960	2820480	Well, I think that each theory that we propose will give its own answer to that question.
2821760	2826240	When the physicists are proposing these structures like the amplitude
2826240	2831040	hydrant and cosmological polytope, associated hydrant and so forth, beyond space time,
2831040	2834960	we can then ask your question for those specific structures and say,
2834960	2839840	how much information, for example, does evolution of a natural selection and the
2840720	2846880	kinds of sensory systems that we have right now give us about this deeper reality?
2846880	2849920	And why did we evolve this way?
2849920	2852960	We can try to answer that question from within the deeper.
2852960	2854880	So there's not going to be a general answer.
2854880	2859280	I think what we'll have to do is posit these new deeper theories
2859280	2863520	and then try to answer your question within the framework of those deeper theories,
2863520	2866480	knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.
2867120	2869200	So is this paralyzing though?
2869760	2875840	Because how do we know we're not completely adrift out to see
2875840	2880000	lost forever from, so like that our theories are completely lost?
2880000	2887680	So if it's all, if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,
2889120	2891680	if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,
2892000	2897440	isn't that paralyzing for a scientific mind?
2897440	2901200	Well, it's interesting that you say introspect to the bottom,
2903040	2908800	because there is that, there is one, again, this isn't the same spirit of what I said before,
2908800	2912640	which is it depends on what answer you give to what's beyond space time,
2912640	2915120	what answer we would give to your question, right?
2915120	2920880	So but one answer that is interesting to explore is something that spiritual traditions
2920880	2923600	have said for thousands of years, but haven't said precisely.
2923600	2926800	So we can't take it seriously in science until it's made precise,
2926800	2928240	but we might be able to make it precise.
2929200	2934640	And that is that they've also said something like space and time aren't fundamental,
2934640	2936000	they're Maya, they're illusion.
2936720	2941120	And but that if you look inside, if you introspect
2943120	2945600	and let go of all of your particular perceptions,
2947200	2950080	you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.
2951200	2958720	And that is, they claim, being in contact with the deep ground of being that transcends
2958720	2960480	any particular conceptual understanding.
2961120	2963280	If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,
2964240	2967520	but and I'm not saying it's not correct, I'm just saying if that's correct,
2968320	2973200	then it would be the case that as scientists, because we also are in touch with this ground of
2973200	2979360	being, we would then not be able to conceptually understand ourselves all the way.
2980000	2982160	But we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.
2983520	2989920	And so we would, there would be a sense in which there is a fundamental grounding to the whole
2989920	2992640	enterprise, because we're not separate from the enterprise.
2993200	2997280	This is the opposite of third, the impersonal third person science.
2997280	3000640	This would make science go personal all the way down.
3001600	3005600	And but but nevertheless, scientific, because the scientific method would still be
3005840	3010400	what we would use all the way down for the conceptual understanding.
3010400	3012720	Unfortunately, you still don't know if you went all the way down.
3012720	3017200	It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is, and we'll talk about it,
3017200	3022320	is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.
3025040	3030320	It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality, but you still don't know when you
3030320	3034720	get to the bottom, you know, a lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs, and they'll
3034720	3039600	say, well, that takes my mind to certain places where it feels like that is
3040320	3042960	revealing some deeper truth of reality.
3042960	3046800	But you still, it could be interfaces on top of interfaces.
3046800	3052400	That's, that's in your view of this, you really don't know.
3052400	3055600	I mean, Gato's incompleteness is that you really don't know.
3055600	3060560	My own view on it, for what it's worth, because I don't know the right answer,
3060560	3064880	but my own view on it right now is that it, it's never ending.
3065680	3071040	I think that there will never, that this is great, as I said before, great job security for science,
3072000	3077680	and that we, if this is true, and if, if consciousness is somehow important or
3077680	3081440	fundamental in the universe, this may be an important fundamental fact about consciousness
3081440	3086480	itself, that, that it's never ending exploration that's going on in some sense.
3087440	3091760	Well, well, that's interesting, let me push back on the job security.
3091760	3092080	Okay.
3094400	3100800	So maybe as we understand this kind of idea deeper and deeper, we understand that the pursuit
3100800	3108320	is not a fruitful one, that maybe we need to, maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere,
3108320	3111120	is you get smarter and smarter and smarter.
3111120	3118240	You realize that like exploration is, there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.
3119200	3125520	You could be, you could be sort of living maximally in some way that's not exploration.
3126800	3130960	You know, I could, there's all kinds of video games you can construct and put yourself inside
3130960	3134400	of them that don't involve you going outside of the game world.
3135040	3140880	It's, you know, feeling for my human perspective, what seems to be fun is challenging yourself,
3140880	3142480	and overcoming those challenges.
3142480	3146000	So you can constantly artificially generate challenges for yourself,
3146000	3150640	like Sisyphus and his boulder, just, and that's it.
3150640	3154960	So the scientific method that's always reaching out to the stars, that's always trying to figure
3154960	3159360	out the puzzle on bottom puzzle, the trick, always trying to get to the bottom turtle.
3160480	3166880	Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition that that's infinite pursuit, we get,
3167600	3173760	we agree to start deviating from that pursuit, start enjoying the here and now versus the
3174320	3176480	looking out into the unknown always.
3176480	3187440	Maybe that's looking out into the unknown is a early activity for a species that's evolved.
3187440	3192400	I'm just sort of saying pushing back is you probably got a lot of scientists excited in terms
3192400	3193520	of job security.
3193520	3200320	I could envision where it's not job security or scientists become more and more useless.
3201920	3209600	Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom that allows us to study our own history,
3209600	3212160	but not much more than that.
3212160	3214400	Just to find pushback.
3214400	3215200	That's good pushback.
3216400	3219520	I'll put one in there for the scientists again, but sure.
3219520	3221440	But then I'll take the other side too.
3221440	3229200	So when Faraday did all of his experiments with magnets and electricity and so forth,
3230160	3234160	came with all this wonderful empirical data and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it and
3234720	3238080	wrote down a few equations, which we can now write down in a single equation,
3238080	3240880	the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra, just one equation.
3243840	3249360	That opened up unbelievable technologies where people are zooming and talking to each other
3249360	3252720	around the world, the whole electronics industry.
3253680	3258160	There was something that transformed our lives in a very positive way.
3259440	3264560	With the theories beyond space time, here's one potential.
3266400	3271040	Right now, most of the galaxies that we see, we can see them,
3271040	3274000	but we know that we could never get to them no matter how fast we traveled.
3274000	3279200	They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond, so we can't ever get to them.
3279280	3282640	There's all this beautiful real estate that's just smiling and waving at us,
3282640	3283680	and we can never get to it.
3284720	3286160	But that's if we go through space time.
3287200	3291600	But if we recognize that space time is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.
3292640	3296160	We're not little things inside space time.
3296160	3299440	Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.
3300160	3301360	It's just the other way around.
3302000	3306960	Once we understand that and we get equations for the stuff that's beyond space time,
3306960	3310560	maybe we won't have to go through space time.
3310560	3311680	Maybe we can go around it.
3311680	3314160	Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri and not go through space.
3314160	3316640	I can just go right there directly.
3316640	3317520	It's a data structure.
3317520	3318800	We can start to play with it.
3320160	3326480	I think that for what it's worth, my take would be that the endless
3328480	3334000	sequence of theories that we could contemplate building will lead to an endless
3334960	3341360	sequence of new remarkable insights into the potentialities, the possibilities
3341360	3347520	that would seem miraculous to us, and that we will be motivated to continue the exploration
3347520	3352000	partly just for the technological innovations that come out.
3352800	3357680	But the other thing that you mentioned, though, what about just being?
3357680	3362240	What have we decided instead of all this doing and exploring what about being?
3362320	3369840	My guess is that the best scientists will do both and that the act of being
3371520	3377840	will be a place where they get many of their ideas and that they then pull into their conceptual
3377840	3378640	realm.
3378640	3383040	And I think many of the best scientists, Einstein comes to mind where these guys say,
3383040	3386880	look, I didn't come up with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.
3387520	3393920	I was thinking in vague images and it was just something non-conceptual.
3393920	3398720	And then it took me a long, long time to pull it out into concepts and then
3398720	3400560	longer to put it into math.
3400560	3405600	But the real insights didn't come from just slavishly playing with equations.
3405600	3407600	They came from a deeper place.
3408240	3413600	And so there may be this going back and forth between the complete non-conceptual
3414560	3417520	where there's essentially no end to the wisdom.
3417520	3421520	And then conceptual systems where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.
3422160	3426240	And that may be if consciousness is important and fundamental.
3426240	3429600	That may be what consciousness, at least part of what consciousness is about, is this
3430240	3433920	discovering itself, discovering its possibilities, so to speak.
3433920	3440800	And we can talk about what that might mean by going from the non-conceptual to the conceptual
3441360	3445520	back and forth to get better and better and better at being.
3446400	3446720	Right.
3447280	3452080	Let me ask you, just to link on the evolutionary, because you mentioned
3452080	3456560	evolutionary game theory and that's really where you, the perspective from which you come
3458400	3459920	to form the case against reality.
3462000	3468880	At which point in our evolutionary history do we start to deviate the most from reality?
3469440	3474960	Is it way before life even originated on earth?
3475760	3480800	Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?
3482160	3487520	Or is it when some inklings of what we think of as intelligence or maybe even
3489040	3492800	complex consciousness started to emerge?
3492800	3498720	So where did this deviation, just like with the interfaces in a computer,
3499360	3507040	you start with transistors and then you have assembly and then you have C, C++,
3507040	3511360	then you have Python, then you have GUIs, all that kind of, you have layers upon layers.
3511360	3512560	When did we start to deviate?
3513200	3520080	Well, David Maher, again, my advisor at MIT, in his book Vision, suggested that the more
3520080	3526560	primitive sensory systems were less realistic, less theoretical, but that by the time you got
3526560	3530240	to something as complicated as the humans, we were actually estimating the true
3531120	3533280	shapes and distances to objects and so forth.
3533840	3540160	So his point of view, and I think it was probably, it's not an uncommon view among
3540800	3547280	my colleagues, that the sensory systems of lower creatures may just not be complicated
3547280	3548960	enough to give them much, much truth.
3549920	3554800	But as you get to 86 billion neurons, you can now compute the truth or at least
3554800	3556160	the parts of the truth that we need.
3557120	3559120	When I look at evolutionary game theory,
3561680	3567120	one of my graduate students, Justin Mark, did some simulations using genetic algorithms.
3567680	3574400	So there, he was just exploring, we start off with random organisms, random sensory genetics
3574400	3579600	and random actions and the first generation was unbelievably, there was a foraging situation,
3579600	3584080	they were foraging for resources and most of them, you know, stayed in one place,
3584080	3591840	didn't do anything important and, but we could then just look at how the genes evolved and what
3591840	3604080	we found was, what he found was that basically you never even saw the truth organisms even come
3604080	3604560	on the stage.
3605920	3608720	If they came, they were gone in one generation, they just weren't.
3609360	3616240	So they came and went, even just in one generation, they just are not good enough.
3616240	3620160	The ones that were just tracking, their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs
3620880	3626400	were far more fit than the truth seekers.
3626960	3631760	So from, so an answer at one level, I want to give an answer to a deeper level,
3631760	3636160	but just with evolutionary game theory, because my attitude as a scientist is,
3637120	3638480	I don't believe any of our theories.
3640000	3643680	I take them very, very seriously, I study them, I look at their implications, but
3643680	3646640	none of them are the gospel, they're just the latest ideas that we have.
3648080	3652320	So the reason I study evolutionary game theory is because that's the best tool we have
3652960	3654240	right now in this area.
3654880	3657280	There is nothing else that competes.
3657280	3661360	So as a scientist is my responsibility to take the best tools and see what they mean.
3661920	3665840	And the same thing the physicists are doing, they're taking the best tools and looking at what
3665920	3666480	they entail.
3667120	3672720	But I don't, I think that science now has enough experience to realize that we should not
3673600	3677040	believe our theories in the sense that we've now arrived.
3677840	3682320	In 1890, it was a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.
3682320	3688240	They were discouraging bright young students from going into physics because it was all done.
3688800	3690720	And that's precisely the wrong attitude.
3691760	3693840	Forever is the wrong attitude forever.
3694400	3700400	The attitude we should have is a century from now, they'll be looking at us and laughing
3700400	3701600	at what we didn't know.
3701600	3704080	And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.
3704080	3708720	Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant right now, our final theory of
3708720	3709200	everything.
3709200	3713600	A century from now, they'll look at us like we look at the physicists of 1890 and go,
3713600	3715280	how could they have been so dumb?
3715280	3717600	Yeah, so I don't want to make that mistake.
3717600	3722800	So I'm not Dr. Nair about any of our current scientific theories.
3722800	3725200	I am Dr. Nair about this.
3726160	3728320	We should use the best tools we have right now.
3729040	3731040	And with humility.
3731040	3733360	Well, so let me ask you about game theory.
3733360	3740240	There's, I love game theory, evolution game theory, but I'm always suspicious of it,
3741040	3742160	like economics.
3743360	3750160	When you construct models, it's too easy to construct things that oversimplify
3751120	3758800	just because we are human brains enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables
3758800	3765280	that somehow represent organisms or represent people and running a simulation that then allows
3765280	3766960	you to build up intuition.
3766960	3771760	And then it feels really good because you can get some really deep and surprising intuitions.
3771760	3777760	But how do you know your models aren't the assumptions underlying your models on some
3777840	3778800	fundamentally flawed.
3778800	3782880	And because of that, your conclusions are fundamentally flawed.
3782880	3787920	So I guess my question is, what are the limits in your use of game theory,
3787920	3790160	evolution game theory, your experience with it?
3790160	3791760	What are the limits of game theory?
3792400	3798640	So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues and friends who have tried to rerun
3798640	3802400	simulations and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth is not comfortable.
3802400	3806320	And so many of my colleagues are very interested in trying to show that we're wrong.
3806320	3810480	And so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something, as you're suggesting,
3810480	3812880	maybe something special that wasn't completely general.
3813600	3818160	We've got some little special part of the whole search space and evolutionary game theory
3818160	3819440	in which this happens to be true.
3819440	3822560	But more generally, organisms would evolve to see the truth.
3822560	3827360	So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.
3828080	3833840	And they suggested that if you use thousands of payoff functions,
3834720	3837600	our simulations would just use a couple, one or two,
3838720	3840160	because it was our first simulations.
3840160	3841120	So that would be a limit.
3841120	3843680	We had one or two payoff functions we showed the result in those,
3844960	3846960	at least for the genetic algorithms.
3846960	3852400	And they said, if you have 20,000 of them, then we can find these conditions in which
3854240	3858400	truth-seeing organisms would be the ones that evolved and survived.
3859280	3865120	And so we looked at their simulations, and it certainly is the case that you can find
3865120	3867520	special cases in which truth can evolve.
3867520	3870400	So when I say it's probability zero, it doesn't mean it can't happen.
3870400	3871120	It can happen.
3871120	3872880	In fact, it could happen infinitely often.
3872880	3874320	It's just probability zero.
3874320	3877600	So if probability zero things can happen infinitely often.
3877600	3881040	When you say probability zero, you mean probability close to zero.
3881840	3882960	To be very precise.
3882960	3886560	So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane,
3888640	3896080	and I use a probability measure in which the area of a region is this probability,
3898240	3901520	then if I draw a curve in that unit square,
3902320	3907840	it has measure precisely zero, precisely, not approximately, precisely zero.
3907840	3909280	And yet it has infinitely many points.
3910000	3913360	So there's an object that for that probability measure has probability zero,
3913360	3916240	and yet there's infinitely many points in it.
3916240	3919840	So that's what I mean when I say that the things that are probability zero
3919840	3921840	can happen infinitely often in principle.
3921840	3927280	Yeah, but infinity, as far as I, and I look outside often at walk around
3928000	3931280	and I look at people, I haven't never seen infinity in real life.
3932880	3935920	That's an interesting issue.
3935920	3936720	I've been looking.
3936720	3937440	I've been looking.
3937440	3941120	I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.
3941120	3945600	And so the tools of mathematics, you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism
3945600	3949120	that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.
3949120	3950400	That's a big debate in mathematics.
3950400	3954960	The intuitionist versus the ones who take, for example, the real numbers as real.
3954960	3956960	And that's a fun discussion.
3956960	3960800	Nicholas Giesen has a physicist who has a really interesting work recently
3960800	3963760	on how if you go with intuitionist mathematics,
3965680	3973440	you could effectively quantize Newton, and you find that Newtonian theory and quantum theory
3973440	3976320	aren't that different once you go with it.
3976320	3976880	It's funny.
3976880	3978000	It's really quite interesting.
3978000	3982640	So the issue you raise is a very, very deep one, and one that I think we should take quite
3982640	3990400	seriously, which is how shall we think about the reality of the contrast hierarchy,
3990400	4001760	a1, a2, and all these different infinities versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?
4002240	4005200	So everything's computable in some sense.
4005200	4009520	Everything's finite as big as you want, but nevertheless finite.
4010480	4017520	So yeah, ultimately boils down to whether the world is discrete or continuous in some
4017520	4018400	general sense.
4019200	4026320	And again, we can't really know, but there's just a mind-breaking thought, just common sense
4026320	4032560	reasoning, that something can happen and is yet probability of it happening is 0%.
4033760	4038160	That doesn't compute for common sense computer.
4038160	4038800	Right.
4038800	4043520	This is where you have to be a sharp mathematician to really, and I'm not.
4043520	4044880	Sharp is one word.
4044880	4051440	What I'm saying is common sense computer is, I mean that in a very kind of,
4052080	4058000	in a positive sense, because we've been talking about perception systems and interfaces,
4058560	4064960	if we are to reason about the world, we have to use the best interfaces we got.
4064960	4072480	And I'm not exactly sure that game theory is the best interface we got for this.
4073360	4079280	And applications of mathematics, tricks and tools of mathematics to game theory is the
4079280	4085360	best we got when we're thinking about the nature of reality and fitness functions and
4085360	4086560	evolution, period.
4087440	4090000	Well, that's a fair rejoinder.
4090000	4094000	And I think that that was the tool that we used.
4094000	4097840	And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool, and here's why.
4097840	4102400	This is this mathematical tool better captures the essence of Darwin's idea.
4103200	4106160	John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it with evolutionary game theory.
4106160	4107440	There's this better, this thing.
4107440	4112240	Now, there are tools like evolutionary graph theory, which generalize evolutionary game
4112240	4112880	theory.
4112880	4115520	And then there's quantum game theory.
4115520	4123760	So you can use quantum tools like entanglement, for example, as a resource in games,
4124400	4130640	that change the very nature of the solutions, the optimal solutions of the game theory.
4132240	4134320	Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.
4134320	4140640	It's a really interesting challenge of these ideas where, okay, if you have a very large
4140640	4147440	number of fitness functions, or let's say you have a nearly infinite number of fitness functions,
4147440	4153680	or a growing number of fitness functions, what kind of interesting things start to emerging?
4153680	4159760	If you are to be an organism, if to be an organism that adapts means having to deal with
4159760	4162080	an ensemble of fitness functions.
4162400	4163920	Right.
4163920	4168960	And so we've actually redone some of our own work based on theirs.
4168960	4172240	And this is the back and forth that we expect in science, right?
4172240	4177520	And what we found was that in their simulations, they were assuming that you
4178240	4179760	couldn't carve the world up into objects.
4181200	4183920	And so we said, well, let's relax that assumption.
4183920	4186960	Allow organisms to create data structures that we might call objects.
4187600	4191520	And an object would be you take, you would do hierarchical clustering
4191520	4194720	of your fitness payoff functions, the ones that have similar shapes.
4194720	4199440	If you have 20,000 of them, maybe these 50 are all very, very similar.
4199440	4205600	So I can take all the perception action fitness stuff and make that into a data structure,
4205600	4207600	and we'll call that a unit or an object.
4208160	4211440	And as soon as we did that, then all of their results went away.
4211520	4216640	It turned out they were the special case and that the organisms that were allowed
4216640	4222240	to only see, that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs were the ones that were.
4222880	4227120	So the idea is that objects then, what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?
4227120	4231360	This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle, it was because I was seeing a true
4231360	4233200	object that existed whether or not it was perceived.
4234320	4237920	Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.
4237920	4244960	I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding a convenient way of looking at various fitness
4244960	4250640	payoffs. I can use this for drinking. I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.
4250640	4256080	I could beat someone with head with it. If my goal is mating, this is pointless.
4256640	4264080	So I'm seeing for what I'm coding here is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.
4264080	4268560	When I pick up an apple, now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs for.
4268560	4273520	When I pick up a rock, I'm getting, so for every object, what I'm getting is a different set
4273520	4283440	of payoff functions with various actions. And so once you allow that, then what you find is once
4283440	4288720	again that truth goes extinct and the organisms that just get an interface are the ones that that
4288720	4296800	win. But the question I'm just sneaking up on, this is fascinating, from where do fitness functions
4296800	4303440	originate? What gives birth to the fitness functions? So if there's a giant black box that
4303440	4306960	just keeps giving you fitness functions, what are we trying to optimize? You said that water
4308480	4318560	has different uses than an apple. So there's these objects. What are we trying to optimize?
4318800	4323520	And why is not reality a really good generator of fitness functions?
4325360	4329760	So each theory makes its own assumptions and says, grant me this and I'll explain that. So
4329760	4336320	evolutionary game theory says grant me fitness payoffs, right? And grant me strategies with payoffs
4336320	4340960	and I can write down the matrix for this strategy interacts with that strategy. These are the payoffs
4340960	4344960	that come up. If you grant me that, then I can start to explain a lot of things. Now you can ask
4344960	4353440	for a deeper question like, okay, how does physics evolve biology and where do these fitness payoffs
4354160	4362240	come from? Now that's a completely different enterprise and of course evolutionary game
4362240	4366560	theory then would be not the right tool for that. It would have to be a deeper tool that
4366560	4374800	shows where evolutionary game theory comes from. My own take is that there's going to be a
4374800	4384640	problem in doing that because space time isn't fundamental. It's just a user interface and
4384640	4389840	that the distinction that we make between living and non-living is not a fundamental distinction.
4390560	4397120	It's an artifact of the limits of our interface. So this is a new wrinkle and this is an important
4397120	4403600	wrinkle. It's so nice to take space and time as fundamental because if something looks like it's
4403600	4410080	inanimate, it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living. Now it's much more complicated.
4410720	4416480	Certain things are obviously living. I'm talking with you. I'm obviously interacting with something
4416480	4421920	that's alive and conscious. I think we've let go of the word obviously in this conversation.
4421920	4426720	I think nothing is obvious. Nothing's obvious, that's right. But when we get down to like
4427680	4434400	an ant, it's obviously living but I'll say it appears to be living. When we get down to a virus,
4434400	4440160	now people wonder and when we get down to protons, people say it's not living and my attitude is,
4440160	4445680	look, I have a user interface. The interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality
4445680	4453040	and others to... It's an uneven representation, put it that way. Certain things just get
4453120	4459760	completely hidden. Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy and matter that's out there.
4459760	4465520	Our interface just flat out hides them. The only way we get some hint is because
4465520	4471920	gravitational things are going wrong within our... So most things are outside of our interface.
4471920	4476640	The distinction between living and non-living is not fundamental. It's an artifact of our
4476640	4485360	interface. So if we really want to understand where evolution comes from to answer the question,
4485360	4489040	the deep question you asked, I think the right way we're going to have to do that is to come up
4489040	4497680	with a deeper theory than spacetime in which there may not be the notion of time and show that
4497680	4503360	whatever this dynamics of that deeper theory is. By the way, I'll talk about how you could have
4503360	4508320	dynamics without time, but the dynamics of this deeper theory, when we project it into,
4509920	4514160	in certain ways, then we do get spacetime and we get what appears to be evolution by natural
4514160	4518720	selection. So I would love to see evolution by natural selection. Nature, red and tooth and
4518720	4522880	claw, people fighting and animals fighting for resources and the whole bit, come out of a deeper
4522880	4527840	theory in which perhaps it's all cooperation. There's no limited resources and so forth,
4527840	4533840	but as a result of projection, you get space and time, and as a result of projection, you get
4533840	4539040	nature, red and tooth and claw, the appearance of it, but it's all an artifact of the interface.
4539040	4544720	I like this idea that the line between living and non-living is very important
4546400	4552080	because that's the thing that would emerge before you have evolution, the idea of death.
4552080	4560960	So that seems to be an important component of natural selection, and if that emerged,
4560960	4567040	because that's also asking the question, I guess, that I ask, where do fitness
4568240	4573920	functions come from? That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right? It's what's the
4573920	4582560	why, why, why? And one of the big underlying whys, okay, you can start with evolution on earth,
4582560	4588000	but without living, without life and death, without the line between the living and the dead,
4588560	4593440	you don't have evolution. So what if underneath it, there's no such thing as the living and the dead?
4594960	4602000	There's no, like this concept of an organism period. There's a living organism that's defined
4602720	4611840	by a volume and space time that somehow interacts, that over time maintains its integrity somehow,
4612880	4618320	it has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind, the outside world, the environment,
4618320	4624160	and then inside there's an organism. So you're defining an organism, and also you're defining
4624160	4631280	that organism by the fact that it can move, and it can become alive, which you kind of think of as
4631280	4636320	moving, combined with the fact that it's keeping itself separate from the environment. So you can
4636320	4642720	point out that thing is living, and then it can also die. That seems to be of all very
4643680	4650000	powerful components of space time that enable you to have something like natural selection and
4650000	4655600	evolution. Well, and there's a lot of interesting work, some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston
4655680	4662960	and others where they have Bayes net kind of stuff that they build on and the notion of a
4662960	4668560	Markov blanket. So you have some states within this network that are inside the blanket, then you
4668560	4672880	have the blanket, and then the states outside the blanket, and the states inside this Markov blanket
4672880	4676800	are conditionally independent of the states outside the blanket conditioned on the blanket.
4677360	4684400	And what they're looking at is that the dynamics inside of the states inside the Markov blanket
4684480	4689360	seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside and react to them in a way. So it seems
4689360	4694240	like you're doing probabilistic inferences in ways that might be able to keep you alive. So
4694240	4700800	there's interesting work going on in that direction. But what I'm saying is something
4700800	4706480	slightly different. And that is, like when I look at you, all I see is skin heronize, right? That's
4706480	4712240	all I see. But I know that there's a deeper reality. I believe that there's a much deeper
4712240	4715840	reality. There's the whole world of your experiences, your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.
4715840	4722720	In some sense, the face that I see is just a symbol that I create, right? And as soon as I
4722720	4728480	look away, I delete that symbol. But I don't delete you. I don't delete the conscious experience,
4728480	4734880	the whole world of your... So I'm only deleting an interface symbol. But that interface symbol
4734880	4745520	is a portal, so to speak. Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal into your beliefs, into your
4745520	4750800	conscious experiences, into... That's why we can have a conversation. Your consciousness is
4750800	4756800	genuinely affecting mine. Mine is genuinely affecting yours. Through these icons, which I
4756800	4761120	create on the fly. I mean, I create your face when I look, I delete it. I don't create you,
4761200	4768000	your consciousness, that's there all the time. But I do... So now when I look at a cat, I'm creating
4768000	4774320	something that I still call living, and I still think is conscious. When I look at an ant, I create
4774320	4779920	something that I still would call living, but maybe not conscious. When I look at something I call a
4779920	4785200	virus, now I'm not even sure I would call it living. And when I look at a proton, I would say,
4785360	4792000	I don't even think it's not alive at all. It could be that I'm nevertheless
4793120	4796640	interacting with something that's just as conscious as you. I'm not saying the proton is
4796640	4801360	conscious. The face that I'm creating when I look at you, that face is not conscious. That face
4801360	4807280	is a data structure in me. That face isn't... It's an experience. It's not an experiencer.
4808240	4814960	Similarly, a proton is something that I create when I look or do a collision
4814960	4821360	in the Large Hadron Collider or something like that. But what is behind the entity and space time?
4821360	4825520	So I've got this space-time interface, and I just got this entity that I call a proton.
4825520	4830720	What is the reality behind it? Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures,
4830720	4836880	ample two Hadron, the associate Hadron. What's behind those? Could be consciousness,
4837760	4840640	what I'm playing with. In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,
4842000	4845680	I could be interacting with consciousness. Again, to be very, very clear, because it's
4845680	4850320	easy to... Listen, I'm not saying a proton is conscious. Just like I'm not saying your face
4850320	4856880	is conscious. Your face is a symbol I create and then delete as I look. And so your face is not
4856880	4861760	conscious, but I know that that face in my interface, the Lex Friedman face that I create,
4861760	4868800	is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal into your consciousness. The portal is less clear
4868800	4874320	for a cat, even less clear for an ant. And by the time we get down to a proton, the portal is not
4874320	4878240	clear at all. But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness. It just means
4878240	4884960	my interface gave up. And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after. So your question
4884960	4888400	really forces out a big part of this whole approach that I'm talking about.
4889040	4895600	So this portal and consciousness, I wonder why you can't... Your portal is not as good to a cat,
4896720	4901360	to a cat's consciousness than it is to a human. Does it have to be...
4901360	4908320	It has to do with the fact that you're human and just similar organisms, organisms of similar
4909040	4914160	complexity, are able to create portals better to each other? Or is it just...
4914160	4916800	As you get more and more complex, you get better and better portals?
4917760	4922800	Well, let me answer one aspect that I'm more confident about. Then I'll speculate on that.
4923680	4930000	Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons and elementary particles more generally? So quarks,
4930000	4935440	leptons, and gluons, and so forth? Well, the reason for that is because those are just
4936160	4941120	symmetries of spacetime. More technically, they're irreducible representations of the
4941120	4951440	Poincaré group of spacetime. So they're just literally representations of the data structure
4951440	4957200	of spacetime that we're using. So that's why they're not very much insightful. They're just almost
4957200	4962400	entirely tied to the data structure itself. There's not much... They're telling you only
4962400	4965920	something about the data structure, not behind the data structure. It's only when we get to higher
4965920	4971520	levels that we're starting to, in some sense, build portals to what's behind spacetime.
4972240	4981280	Sure. Yeah. So there's more and more complexity built on top of the interface of spacetime with the
4981280	4991280	cat. So you can actually build a portal, right? Yeah, right. Yeah, this interface of face and hair
4991280	5002560	and so on, skin. There's some sinking going on between humans, though, where we sink. You're
5002560	5011120	getting a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head and starting to get a foggy view of my
5011120	5017840	memories in my head. Even though this is the first time we're talking, you start to project your own
5017920	5025840	memories. You start to solve a giant hierarchy of puzzles about a human, because we're all... There's
5025840	5030160	a lot of similarities, a lot of it rhymes. So you start to make a lot of inferences and you build
5030160	5036080	up this model of a person. You have a pretty sophisticated model of what's going on underneath.
5037120	5042960	Again, I just... I wonder if it's possible to construct these models about each other and
5043040	5050080	nevertheless be very distant from an underlying reality. There's a lot of work on this. So there's
5050080	5055520	some interesting work called Signaling Games, where they look at how people can coordinate and
5057520	5062480	come to communicate. There's some interesting work that was done by some colleagues and friends of
5063200	5070000	mine, Louis Naranze and Natalia Komarova and Kimberly Jamison, where they were looking at
5071840	5080000	evolving color words. So you have a circle of colors, the color circle, and they wanted to see
5080000	5084640	if they could get people to cooperate and how they carved the color circle up into units of words.
5086800	5091680	So they had a game, theoretic kind of thing that they'd had people do. What they found was that
5092400	5098720	so most people are trichromats. You have three kinds of cone photoreceptors, but there are some
5098720	5103600	a lot of men, 7% of men have our dichromats. They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.
5104320	5111680	They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence on the final ways that the whole
5111680	5117840	space of colors was carved up and labels attached. You needed to be able to include the dichromats
5117840	5121760	in the conversation. So they had a bigger influence on how you made the boundaries
5121760	5126400	of the language. I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight that there's going
5126400	5132560	to be, again, a game, perhaps a game or evolutionary or genetic algorithm kind of thing that goes on
5132560	5140320	in terms of learning to communicate in ways that are useful. So yeah, you can use game theory to
5140320	5145360	actually explore that or signaling games. There's a lot of brilliant work on that. I'm not doing it,
5145360	5152080	but there's work out there. So if it's okay, let us tackle once more and perhaps several more
5152080	5160240	times after the big topic of consciousness. This very beautiful, powerful things that perhaps is
5160240	5166880	the thing that makes us human. What is it? What's the role of consciousness in, let's say even just
5166880	5169920	the thing we've been talking about, which is the formation of this interface,
5170000	5178400	any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking about it?
5178400	5185680	Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say. 99% are, again, assuming that
5185680	5192320	spacetime is fundamental. Particles in spacetime matter is fundamental. And most are reductionist.
5192560	5202960	And so the standard approach to consciousness is to figure out what complicated systems of matter
5203760	5208480	with the right functional properties could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.
5208480	5216880	That's the general idea. So maybe you have to have neurons. Maybe only if you have neurons,
5216880	5221040	but that might not be enough. They have certain kinds of complexity in their
5221040	5224640	organization and their dynamics, certain kind of network abilities, for example.
5226560	5234560	So there are those who say, for example, that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse
5234560	5242400	of quantum states of microtubules and neurons. So this is Hamroff and Kenrose have this kind of.
5242400	5248240	So you start with something physical, a property of quantum states of neurons,
5249120	5255040	of microtubules and neurons. And you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those
5255600	5260560	is consciousness or conscious experiences. Or integrated information theory. Again,
5260560	5264720	you start with something physical. And if it has the right kind of functional properties,
5264720	5268000	it's something they call fee, with the right kind of integrated information,
5268000	5274800	then you have consciousness. Or you can be a panpsychist, Philip Goff, for example,
5274800	5280560	where you might say, well, in addition to the particles in space and time,
5281200	5285280	those particles are not just matter, they also could have a unit of consciousness.
5286720	5290480	And so, but once again, you're taking space and time and particles as fundamental.
5291120	5296160	And you're adding a new property to them, say consciousness. And then you have to talk about
5296160	5301760	how when a proton and a neutron or proton and electron get together to form hydrogen,
5301760	5308400	then how those consciousnesses merge to or interact to create the consciousness of hydrogen,
5308400	5313520	so forth. There's attention schema theory, which again, this is how neural network
5314960	5320880	processes representing to the network itself, it's attentional processes, that could be
5320880	5327600	consciousness. There's global workspace theory. And neuronal global workspace theory.
5327600	5331840	Workspace theory. So there's many, many theories of this type. What's common to all of them
5332800	5338160	is they assume that space time is fundamental. They assume that physical processes in space
5338160	5342480	time is fundamental. Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,
5342480	5350320	it's almost dualist in that regard. And my attitude is, our best science is telling us
5351040	5358320	that space time is not fundamental. So why is that important here? Well, for centuries,
5359920	5366080	deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water as the fundamental elements.
5366080	5370800	It was a reductionist kind of idea. Nothing was more elemental than those. And you could
5370800	5375840	sort of build everything up from those. When we got the periodic table of elements,
5376800	5383040	we realized that, of course, we want to study earth, air, fire, and water. There's combustion
5383040	5390960	science for fire. There's sciences for all these other things, water and so forth. So we're going
5390960	5396080	to do science for these things, but fundamental, no, no. If you're looking for something fundamental,
5396080	5401360	those are the wrong building blocks. Earth has many, many different kinds of elements
5402080	5406080	that project into the one thing that we call earth. If you don't understand that there's
5406080	5409520	silicon, that there's iron, that there's all these different kinds of things that project
5409520	5416240	into what we call earth, you're hopelessly lost. You're not fundamental. You're not going to get
5416240	5422160	there. And then after the periodic table, then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,
5422160	5429760	the particles of the standard model of physics. And so we actually now know that if you really
5429760	5435920	want to get fundamental, the periodic table isn't it. It's good for chemistry and it's just
5435920	5440720	wonderful for chemistry. But if you're trying to go deep, fundamental, what is the fundamental
5440720	5446000	science? That's not it. You're going to have to go to quarks, leptons, and gluons, and so forth.
5446000	5453360	Well, now we've discovered spacetime itself is doomed. Quarks, leptons, and gluons are just
5453360	5460640	irreducible representations of the symmetries of spacetime. So the whole framework on which
5461280	5467840	consciousness research is being based right now is doomed. And for me, these are my friends and
5467840	5474800	colleagues that are doing this, they're brilliant. They're absolute, they're brilliant. I, my feeling
5474800	5483920	is, I'm so sad that they're stuck with this old framework, because if they weren't stuck,
5483920	5487920	like with earth, air, fire, and water, you could actually make progress. So it doesn't matter how
5487920	5491920	smart you are. If you start with earth, air, fire, and water, you're not going to get anywhere, right?
5491920	5497440	Can I actually just, because the word doomed is so interesting. Let me give you some options,
5497440	5506160	multiple choice quiz. It's spacetime, we could say is reality, the way we perceive it, doomed,
5509840	5521520	wrong, or fake. Because doomed just means it could still be right, and we're now ready to go deeper.
5522480	5523280	It would be that.
5523760	5529920	So it's not wrong. It's not a complete deviation from a journey toward the truth.
5530800	5535600	Right. It's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong. There is earth, air, fire, and water.
5535600	5537920	That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.
5538880	5544320	Right. Well, there's also wrong, which is, they used to believe, as I recently learned,
5544320	5548640	that George Washington was the president, the first president in the United States,
5548640	5553040	was blood to death for something that could have been easily treated,
5553920	5558000	because it was believed that you can get, actually, I need to look into this further,
5558000	5562160	but I guess you get toxins out or demons out. I don't know what you're getting out with the
5562160	5570080	bleeding of a person, but so that ended up being wrong, but widely believed as a medical tool.
5570720	5578080	So it's also possible that our assumption of spacetime is not just doomed, but it's wrong.
5578800	5584320	Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong. But if we believe it's a useful tool,
5584320	5589840	that's right. But bleeding somebody to death was believed to be a useful tool.
5591040	5598400	It wasn't just not fundamental. I'm sure there's cases in which bleeding somebody
5598400	5605280	would work, but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases. So it could be that it's
5605360	5611600	wrong, like it's a side road that's ultimately leading to a dead end, as opposed to a truck
5611600	5617280	stop or something that you can get off of. My feeling is it's not the dead end kind of thing.
5617280	5621040	I think that what the physicists are finding is that there are these structures beyond
5621040	5627120	spacetime, but they project back into spacetime. And so spacetime, when they say
5627120	5630640	spacetime is doomed, they're explicit. They're saying it's doomed in the sense that
5630640	5634400	we thought it was fundamental. It's not fundamental. It's a useful,
5634400	5640400	absolutely useful and brilliant data structure, but there are deeper data structures like cosmological
5640400	5646720	polytool. And spacetime is not fundamental. What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong
5647600	5652880	is reductionism. Which is saying spacetime is fundamental.
5653760	5656560	Essentially. Right, right. The idea that somehow
5658000	5666800	being smaller in spacetime is a fundamental nature of reality, that's just wrong. It turned out to
5666800	5671200	be a useful heuristic for thermodynamics and so forth, and several other places,
5671200	5677760	reductionism has been very useful. But that's in some sense an artifact of how we use our interface.
5678160	5683680	Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter. Okay, this is very important for me to write
5683680	5690960	down ultimately. It's useful for theories like thermodynamics and also for understanding brain
5690960	5698400	networks in terms of individual neurons and neurons in terms of chemical systems inside cells.
5698400	5703840	That's all very, very useful. But the idea that we're getting to the more fundamental nature of
5703840	5709120	reality, no. When you get all the way down in that direction, you get down to the quarks and
5709120	5713760	gluons. What you realize is what you've gotten down to is not fundamental reality, just the
5713760	5718720	irreducible representations of a data structure. That's all you've gotten down to. So you're always
5718720	5724400	stuck inside the data structure. So you seem to be getting closer and closer. I went from neural
5724400	5728560	networks to neurons, to neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles, particles to clerks and
5728560	5735760	gluons. No, I'm getting closer and closer to the actual structure of the data structure of
5735760	5739760	space and time, the irreducible representations. That's what you're getting closer to,
5739760	5743040	not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space-time.
5743040	5749040	We'll also refer, we'll return again to this question of dynamics, because you keep
5749920	5754800	saying that space-time is doomed, but mostly focusing on the space part of that. It's very
5754800	5761040	interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too, because how do you have dynamics without time is
5761040	5768720	the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about. But let us return your brilliant whirlwind
5768720	5772160	overview of the different theories of consciousness that are out there.
5774480	5780240	What is consciousness if outside of space-time? If we think that we want to have a model of
5780240	5786000	consciousness, we as scientists then have to say, what do we want to write down? What kind of
5786000	5790000	mathematical model are we going to write down? And if you think about it, there's lots of things
5790000	5793840	that you might want to write down about consciousness. It's a really complicated subject.
5795520	5798560	So most of my colleagues are saying, let's start with matter or neurons and
5799840	5803440	say what properties of matter could create consciousness. But I'm saying that that whole
5803440	5809200	thing is out. Space-time is doomed, that whole thing is out. We need to look at consciousness,
5809200	5814320	qua consciousness. In other words, not as something that arises in space and time,
5814320	5816880	but perhaps as something that creates space and time as a data structure.
5818160	5822880	So what do we want? And here again, there's no hard and fast rule, but what you as a
5822880	5830240	scientist have to do is to pick what you think are the minimal assumptions that are going to
5830240	5838560	allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory. That is the trick. So what do I want? So what I
5838560	5844880	chose to do was to have three things. I said that there are conscious experiences,
5846240	5853920	feeling of headache, the smell of garlic, experiencing the color red. So that's a
5853920	5858000	primitive of theory. And the reason I want few primitives, because those are the miracles of
5858000	5861440	the theory, right? The primitives, the assumptions of the theory are the things you're not going
5861440	5866080	to explain. Those are the things you assume. And those experiences you particularly mean
5866080	5872480	there is a subjectiveness to them. That's the thing when people refer to the hard problem
5872480	5878080	of consciousness is it feels like something to look at the color red. Okay.
5878080	5882800	Exactly. It feels like something to have a headache or to feel upset to your stomach.
5882800	5890560	It feels like something. And so I'm going to grant that in this theory, there are experiences
5890560	5895040	and they're fundamental in some sense. So conscious experience. So they're not derived
5895040	5901600	from physics. They're not functional properties of particles. They are sui generis. They exist.
5901600	5906240	Just like we assume space time exists. I'm now saying space time is just a data structure. It
5906240	5911520	doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences. Sorry to interrupt once again, but should we be
5911520	5921280	focusing in your thinking on humans alone? Or is there something about in relation to other kinds
5921280	5927760	of organisms that have a sufficiently high level of complexity? Or is there some kind of
5929360	5934720	generalization of the panpsychist idea that all consciousness permeates all matter
5935680	5941120	outside of the usual definition of what matter is inside space time?
5941120	5947120	So it's beyond human consciousness. Human consciousness, from my point of view, would be
5947200	5952400	one of a countless variety of consciousnesses. And even within human consciousness, there's
5952400	5957200	countless variety of consciousnesses within us. You have your left and right hemisphere.
5958320	5962880	And apparently, if you split the corpus callosum, the personality of the left hemisphere and the
5962880	5965760	religious belief of the left hemisphere can be very different from the right hemisphere.
5966320	5972400	And their conscious experiences can be disjoint. One could have one conscious experience.
5972400	5976000	They can play 20 questions. The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind and the right
5976000	5982160	hemisphere has to guess. And it might not get it. So even within you, there is more than just
5982160	5987920	one consciousness. It's lots of consciousnesses. So the general theory of consciousness that I'm
5987920	5993120	after is not just human consciousness. It's going to be just consciousness. And I presume human
5993120	5999200	consciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.
5999200	6008000	That said, I should clarify that the black hole of consciousness is the home cat. I'm pretty sure
6008000	6015760	cat's lack is the embodiment of evil and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.
6015760	6018560	So I just want to lay that out. But that's the theory I'm working on. I don't have any
6018560	6025520	good evidence, but it's just a shout out. Sorry to distract. So that's the first assumption.
6025520	6030000	The first assumption is right. The second assumption is that these experiences have
6030000	6036640	consequences. So I'm going to say that conscious experiences can trigger other conscious experiences
6036640	6045040	somehow. So really, in some sense, there's two basic assumptions. There's some kind of
6045040	6049360	causality. Is there is a chain of causality? Does it relate to dynamics?
6050160	6055680	I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship. So I'm trying to be
6056640	6062720	as nonspecific to begin with and see where it leads me. So what I can write down are probability
6062720	6069040	spaces. So probability space, which contains the conscious experiences that this consciousness
6069040	6078400	can have. So I call this a conscious agent. This technical thing. Anika Harris and I've
6078400	6083600	talked about this and she rightly cautions me that people will think that I'm bringing in a
6083600	6088240	notion of a self or agency and so forth when I say conscious agent. So I just want to say that I
6088240	6095040	use the term conscious agent merely as a technical term. There is no notion of self in my fundamental
6095040	6100640	definition of a conscious agent. There are only experiences and probabilistic relationships
6100640	6105200	that of how they trigger other experiences. So the agent is the generator of the conscious
6105200	6111120	experience. The agent is a mathematical structure that includes a probability measure,
6111760	6117520	the probability space of possible conscious experiences and what an Amarcovian kernel,
6118080	6122720	which describes how if this agent has certain conscious experiences,
6122720	6127360	how that will affect the experiences of other conscious agents, including itself.
6127360	6132960	But you don't think of that as a self? No, there is no notion of a self here.
6133600	6141120	There's no notion of really of an agent. But is there a locality? Is there an organism?
6142800	6149040	So these are conscious units, conscious entities. But they're distinct
6149760	6153920	in some way because they have to interact. Well, so here's the interesting thing. When we write
6153920	6160800	down the mathematics, when you have two of these conscious agents interacting, the pair
6161600	6165280	satisfy a definition of a conscious agent. So they are a single conscious agent.
6166080	6172880	So there is one conscious agent. But it has a nice analytic decomposition into as many
6172880	6179120	conscious agents. So that's a nice interface. It's a very useful scientific interface. It's
6179120	6185200	a scale free or if you like a fractal like approach to it in which we can use the same
6185200	6191520	unit of analysis at all scales in studying consciousness. But if I want to talk about
6192240	6199920	so there's no notion of learning, memory, problem solving, intelligence, self, agency.
6200720	6208480	So none of that is fundamental. So and the reason I did that was because I want to assume
6208480	6212880	as little as possible. Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory. It's not something you
6212880	6217120	explain as something you assume. So I have to build networks of conscious agents.
6218720	6223120	If I want to have a notion of a self, I have to build a self. I have to build learning, memory,
6223120	6227200	problem solving, intelligence, and planning, all these different things. I have to build
6227200	6232320	networks of conscious agents to do that. It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents
6232320	6236720	are computationally universal. That's trivial. So anything that we can do with neural networks
6236720	6240960	or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents. That's trivial.
6243120	6249520	But you can also do more. The events in the probability space need not be computable. So
6249520	6255920	the Markovian dynamics is not restricted to computable functions because the very events
6255920	6261680	themselves need not be computable. So this can capture any computable theory. Anything we can
6261680	6267280	do with neural networks, we can do with conscious agent networks. But it leaves open the door for
6267280	6273760	the possibility of non computable interactions between conscious agents. So we have to, if we
6273760	6279600	want a theory of memory, we have to build it. And there's lots of different ways you could build.
6279600	6284160	We've actually got a paper, Chris Fields took the lead on this. And he, we have a paper called
6284160	6288320	conscious agent networks where Chris takes the lead and shows how to use these networks of
6288320	6292560	conscious agents to build memory and to build primitive kinds of learning.
6293760	6301520	But can you provide some intuition of what conscious networks, networks of conscious agents
6302480	6308880	helps you? Well, first of all, what that looks like. And I don't just mean mathematically,
6308880	6313600	of course, maybe that might help build up intuition, but how that helps us potentially
6313680	6321200	solve the hard problem of consciousness. Right. Or is that baked in that that exists?
6324160	6329600	Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness? Why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious
6329600	6336000	ice cream with networks of conscious agents? Or is that taken as an assumption?
6336000	6344480	So the standard way the hard problem is thought of is we're assuming space and time in particles
6344480	6350240	or neurons, for example. These are just physical things that have no consciousness. And we have
6350240	6354960	to explain how the conscious experience of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those. So
6354960	6360880	that's the typical hard problem of consciousness is that problem, right? How do you boot up the taste
6360880	6367440	of chocolate, the experience of the taste of chocolate from neurons, say, or the right kind
6367440	6373440	of artificial intelligence circuitry? How do you boot that up? That's typically what the hard
6373440	6379040	problem of consciousness means to researchers. Notice that I'm changing the problem. I'm not
6379040	6384240	trying to boot up conscious experiences from the dynamics of neurons or silicon or something like
6384240	6389840	that. I'm saying that that's the wrong problem. My hard problem would go in the other direction.
6389840	6395520	If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time?
6395520	6399280	How do I build up what I call the physical world? How do I build up what we call brains?
6400480	6404560	Because I'm saying consciousness is not something that brains do.
6405600	6413280	Brains are something that consciousness makes up. It's an ephemeral experience
6413280	6418480	in consciousness. I look inside, so to be very, very clear, right now I have no neurons.
6419920	6425200	If you looked, you would see neurons. That's a data structure that you would create on the fly,
6425200	6429920	and it's a very useful one. As soon as you look away, you garbage collect that data structure,
6429920	6432880	just like that Necker cube that I was talking about on the piece of paper.
6432880	6439520	When you look, you see a 3D cube. You create it on the fly. As soon as you look away, that's gone.
6439520	6442320	When you say you, you mean a human being scientist?
6442960	6448320	Right now, that's right. More generally, it'll be conscious agents, because as you pointed out,
6448880	6454320	asking for theory of consciousness only about humans, no, it's consciousness, which human
6454320	6461840	consciousness is just a tiny sliver. But you are saying that there's a useful data structure.
6461840	6466480	How many other data structures are there? That's why I said you human. If there's another earth,
6467360	6471520	if there's another alien civilization and doing these kinds of investigations,
6471520	6474800	would they come up with similar data structures? Probably not.
6474880	6477600	What is the space of data structures, I guess, is what I'm asking.
6480160	6485040	My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental, consciousness is all there is,
6487120	6492800	then the only thing that mathematical structure can be about is possibilities of consciousness.
6495520	6499920	And that suggests to me that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses,
6500880	6507600	and a vanishingly small fraction of them use spacetime data structures,
6507600	6511840	and the kinds of structures that we use. There's an infinite variety of data structures.
6511840	6515920	Now, this is very similar to something that Max Tegmark has said, but I want to distinguish it.
6515920	6522080	He has his level four multiverse idea. He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.
6522880	6526480	And so that's the fundamental reality. And since there's an infinite variety of,
6527200	6530960	endless variety of mathematical structures, there's an infinite variety of multiverses
6530960	6537040	in his view. I'm saying something similar in spirit, but importantly different. There's
6537040	6542240	an infinite variety of mathematical structures, absolutely. But mathematics isn't the fundamental
6542240	6548480	reality in this framework. Consciousness is, and mathematics is to consciousness,
6549280	6555280	like bones are to an organism. You need the bones. So mathematics is not divorced from
6555280	6561040	consciousness, but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means. And so there's an
6561040	6569200	infinite variety of consciousnesses and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.
6570000	6576480	And therefore worlds, common worlds, data structures that they can use to communicate.
6577120	6583600	So spacetime is just one of an infinite variety. And so I think that what we'll find is that as
6583600	6592080	we go outside of our little spacetime bubble, we will encounter utterly alien forms of conscious
6592080	6601360	experience that we may not be able to really comprehend in the following sense. If I ask
6601360	6609200	you to imagine a color that you've never seen before. Does anything happen? Nothing happens.
6609600	6616080	No. Nothing happens. And that's just one color. I'm asking for just a color. We actually know,
6616080	6623200	by the way, that apparently there are women called tetrafemes who have four color receptors,
6624560	6629920	not just three. And Kimberly Jamison and others who've studied these women have good evidence
6629920	6636080	that they apparently have a new dimension of color experience that the rest of us don't have.
6636560	6641920	So these women are apparently living in a world of color that you and I can't even
6641920	6647600	concretely imagine. No man can imagine them. And yet they're real color experiences. And so
6647600	6652720	in that sense, I'm saying now take that little baby step. Oh, there are women who have color
6652720	6658080	experiences that I could never have. Well, that's shocking. Now take that infinite. There are
6658080	6663920	consciousnesses where every aspect of their experiences is like that new color. It's something
6663920	6669920	utterly alien to you. You have nothing like that. And yet these are all possible varieties
6669920	6675440	of conscious experience. When you say there's a lot of consciousnesses as a singular consciousness,
6676400	6680880	basically the set of possible experiences you can have in that subjective way,
6682160	6688960	as opposed to the underlying mechanism. Because you say that, you know, having an
6688960	6694880	extra color receptor, you know, ability to have new experiences that somehow
6694880	6699520	a different consciousness, is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,
6699520	6706000	the subjectivity itself? Right. Because when we have two of these conscious agents interacting,
6706000	6709920	the mathematics, they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent. So in fact,
6709920	6715600	they are a single conscious agent. So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying, I'm
6715600	6720080	postulating with my colleagues, Chaitanya and Chris and others, Robert Prettner and so forth.
6721920	6727760	There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated. But fortunately, we can, for analytic
6727760	6732080	purposes, break it down all the way to, in some sense, the simplest conscious agent, which has
6732080	6739200	one conscious experience, one. This one agent can experience red 35. That's it. That's what
6739280	6746320	experiences. You can get all the way down to that. So you think it's possible that consciousness,
6747680	6756160	whatever that is, is much more, is fundamental, or at least much more in the direction of the
6756160	6764320	fundamental than is space time as we perceive it. That's the proposal. And therefore, what I have
6764320	6771040	to do in terms of the heart problem of consciousness is to show how dynamical systems of conscious
6771040	6777120	agents could lead to what we call space and time and neurons and brain activity. In other words,
6777120	6785440	we have to show how you get space time and physical objects entirely from a theory of
6785440	6792320	conscious agents outside of space time with the dynamics outside of space time. So I can tell you
6792320	6798560	how we plan to do that. But that's the idea. Okay. The magic of it, that chocolate is delicious.
6799760	6805280	So there's a mathematical kind of thing that we could say here, how it can emerge within the system
6805840	6807920	of networks of conscious agents. But
6811120	6818960	is there going to be at the end of the proof why chocolate is so delicious? Or no? I guess I'm
6818960	6823120	going to ask different kinds of dumb questions to try to sneak up.
6823120	6827920	Oh, well, that's the right question. And when I say that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,
6827920	6834000	what that means is in the current version of my theory, I'm not explaining conscious experiences
6834000	6838560	where they came from. That's the miracle. That's one of the miracles. So I have two
6838560	6841600	miracles in my theory. There are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate,
6842240	6848560	and that there's a probabilistic relationship when certain conscious experiences occur,
6848560	6853440	others are more likely to occur. Those are the two miracles that are possible to
6854320	6861440	get beyond that and somehow start to chip away at the miracle-ness of that miracle.
6862240	6867200	That chocolate is still delicious. I hope so. I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right
6867200	6873040	now. But I can just say at top level how we would think about that. That would get at this
6873440	6887040	consciousness without form. This is really tough because it's consciousness without form versus
6887040	6891760	the various forms that consciousness takes for the experiences that it has.
6892640	6902880	Right. So when I write down a probability space for these conscious experiences,
6902880	6905520	I say, here's a probability space for the possible conscious experiences.
6906880	6911280	It's just like when I write down a probability space for an experiment. I'm going to flip a coin
6911280	6915680	twice. I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes. So I have to write down a
6915680	6919600	probability space. There could be heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails.
6922480	6925520	Any class in probability, you're told, write down your probability space. If you don't
6925520	6929440	write down your probability space, you can't get started. So here's my probability space for
6929440	6934480	consciousness. How do I want to interpret that structure? The structure is just sitting there.
6934480	6939520	There's going to be a dynamics that happens on it. Experiences appear and then they disappear.
6939520	6946320	Just like heads appears and disappears. So one way to think about that fundamental
6946320	6950960	probability space is that corresponds to consciousness without any content.
6952880	6958080	The infinite consciousness that transcends any particular content.
6958640	6961040	Well, do you think of that as a mechanism, as a thing,
6962400	6967920	like the rules that govern the dynamics of the thing outside of space-time?
6968960	6972640	If you think consciousness is fundamental, isn't it essentially getting like,
6972640	6979760	if it is solving the hard problem, which is like, from where does this thing pop up?
6980880	6986240	Which is the mechanism of the thing popping up. Whatever the consciousness is, the different
6986240	6994640	kinds was so on. That mechanism. And also the question I want to ask is, how tricky do you think
6994640	7001120	it is to solve that problem? You've solved a lot of difficult problems throughout the history of
7001120	7011200	humanity. There's probably more problems to solve left than we've solved by an infinity.
7012800	7020880	But along that long journey of intelligent species, when will we solve this consciousness one?
7020880	7022960	Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.
7023920	7029760	So I'll give two answers. There's one problem I think we can solve, but we haven't solved yet.
7029840	7033520	And that is the reverse of what my colleagues call the hard problem.
7034800	7038240	The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences in the way that I've just described
7038240	7044720	them and the dynamics, and build up space and time and brains. That I think is a tough technical
7044720	7048640	problem, but some principle solvable. So I think we can solve that. So we would solve the hard
7048640	7052480	problem, not by showing our brains create consciousness, but how networks of conscious
7052480	7055760	agents create what we call the symbols that we call brains.
7059920	7063440	But does that allow you to... So that's interesting. That's an interesting idea.
7063440	7067360	Consciousness creates the brain, not the brain creates consciousness. But does that allow you
7067360	7075200	to build the thing? My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies. And I'll tell
7075200	7079920	you why. I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing. So this theory of consciousness
7080560	7084480	will be even deeper than the structures that the physicists are finding, like the Amplitude
7084480	7092160	Hadron. But the other answer to your question is less positive. As I said earlier, I think that
7092160	7100320	there is no such thing as a theory of everything. So that I think that the theory that my team is
7100320	7108320	working on, this conscious agent theory, is just a 1.0 theory. We're using probability
7108320	7112960	spaces and Markovian kernels. I can easily see people now saying, well, we can do better if we
7112960	7119520	go to category theory. And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting. And then someone will
7119520	7123840	say, well, now I'll go to Topoi theory. And then there'll be... So I imagine that there'll be,
7123840	7132800	you know, conscious agents 5, 10, 3 trillion, 0.0. But I think it will never end. I think ultimately,
7133680	7141680	this question that we sort of put our fingers on of, how does the formless give birth to form,
7142960	7150080	to the wonderful taste of chocolate? I think that we will always go deeper and deeper,
7150080	7155760	but we will never solve that. That in some sense, that will be a primitive. I hope I'm wrong.
7156720	7164960	Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination. So I'll just say my imagination
7164960	7172240	right now doesn't peer that deep. Hopefully... So by the way, I'm saying this, I don't want to
7172240	7178880	discourage some brilliant 20-year-old who then later on proves me dead wrong. I hope to be proven
7178880	7182720	dead wrong. But just like you said, essentially from now, everything we're saying now, everything
7182720	7190400	you're saying, all your theories will be laughing stock. They will respect the puzzle-solving
7190400	7197040	abilities and how much we were able to do with so little. But outside of that, it will all be just
7198240	7202880	the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager. Especially the silliness when we
7202880	7208400	thought that we were so smart and we knew it all. So it would be interesting to explore your ideas
7208400	7216720	by contrasting, you mentioned Annika Harris, you mentioned Philip Goff. So outside of,
7216720	7222480	if you're not allowed to say the fundamental disagreement is the fact that space-time is
7222480	7229120	fundamental, what are interesting distinctions between ideas of consciousness between you and
7229120	7236240	Annika, for example? You guys have been on a podcast together, I'm sure in private,
7236240	7241600	you guys have some incredible conversations. So where are some interesting sticking points,
7241600	7247520	some interesting disagreements, let's say with Annika first. Maybe there'll be a few other people.
7247520	7250960	Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning where we were talking about
7250960	7256000	our ideas. And what we discovered really in our conversation was that we're pretty much on the
7256000	7262400	same page. It was really just- About consciousness. Yeah, our ideas about consciousness are pretty
7262400	7269520	much on the same page. She rightly has cautioned me to, when I talk about conscious agents,
7270080	7276480	to point out that the notion of agency is not fundamental in my theory. The notion of self
7276480	7281360	is not fundamental. And that's absolutely true. I can use this network of conscious agents.
7283920	7287440	As a technical term, conscious agent is a technical term for that probability space
7287440	7292800	with the Markovian dynamics. I can use that to build models of a self and to build models of
7292800	7302000	agency, but they're not fundamental. So she has really been very helpful in helping me to be a
7302000	7307360	little bit clear about these ideas and not say things that are misleading. Sure. I mean,
7307360	7312240	this is the interesting thing about language, actually, is that language, quite obviously,
7312240	7325040	is an interface to truth. It's so fascinating that individual words can have so much ambiguity
7326640	7332880	and the slight, the specific choices of a word within a particular sentence, within the context
7332880	7339120	of a sentence can have so much such a difference in meaning. It's quite fascinating, especially when
7339120	7344480	you're talking about topics like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term. It means a lot
7344480	7350080	of things to a lot of people. And the entire concept of shrouded in a mystery. So combination
7350080	7355520	of the fact that it's a loaded term and that there's a lot of mystery, people can just interpret it
7355520	7364160	in all kinds of ways. And so you have to be both precise and help them avoid getting stuck on some
7364160	7370720	kind of side road of miscommunication, loss in translation, because you use the wrong word.
7370720	7378080	That's interesting. I mean, because for, for a lot of people, consciousness is ultimately connected
7378080	7388000	to a self. I mean, that's our experience of consciousness is very, it's connected to this
7388000	7394720	ego. I mean, I just, I mean, what else could it possibly be? I can't even, how do you begin to
7394720	7400960	comprehend, to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness that's not connected to like this
7400960	7406720	particular organism? Well, I have a way of thinking about this whole problem now that's,
7406720	7413280	that's, that comes out of this, this framework that's different. So we can imagine a dynamics of
7413280	7420560	consciousness, not in space and time, just abstractly. It could be cooperative, for all we know, it
7420560	7427120	could be very friendly, I don't know. And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics that is
7427120	7432960	so-called stationary. And that's a technical term, which means that the entropy effectively is not
7432960	7437040	increasing. There is some entropy, but it's constant. So there's no increasing entropy.
7437040	7445360	And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless. There is no entropic time. But it's a trivial theorem,
7447040	7453760	three line proof, that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make
7453760	7458000	of that dynamics by conditional probability, and if you want, I can state a little more,
7458000	7463440	even more mathematically precisely for, for some readers or listeners. But if any projection you
7463440	7470160	take by conditional probability, the induced image of that Markov chain will have increasing entropy.
7472800	7479760	You will have entropic time. So, so I'll be very, very precise. I have a Markov chain x1 x2
7479760	7488880	through xn, where xn, n goes to infinity, right? The entropy h, capital H of xn is equal to the
7488880	7499840	entropy h of xn minus one for all n. So the entropy is the same. But it's a, it's a theorem that h
7499840	7509200	of xn, say given x sub one is greater than or equal to h of xn minus one, given x1.
7510880	7515520	Sure. Where does the grader come from? Because with the theorem, the three line proof,
7516080	7527280	h of xn given x1 is greater than or equal to h of xn given x1 and x2, because conditioning reduces.
7528720	7537040	But then h of xn minus one given x1 comma x2 is equal to h of xn
7537680	7546160	given x2, xn minus one given x2 by the Markov property. And then because it's stationary,
7546160	7555360	it's equal to h of x. I have to write it down. xn minus, I have to write it down. Anyway,
7555360	7560640	there's a three line proof. Sure. So, but the assumption of stationarity,
7562000	7565040	we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand, doesn't matter.
7565760	7573440	So there's some kind of, some Markovian dynamics is basically trying to model some kind of system
7573440	7577600	with some probabilities and there's agents and they interact in some kind of way. And you could
7577600	7587040	say something about that system as it evolves. Stationarity, so stationary system is one that
7587040	7592960	has certain properties in terms of entropy very well. But we don't know if it's stationary or not.
7592960	7598480	We don't know what the properties, right? You see, you have to kind of take assumptions and see,
7598480	7603520	okay, well, what is, what does the systems behave like under these different properties?
7603520	7608240	The more constraints, the more assumptions you take, the more predictive, the more
7608240	7611040	interesting, powerful things you can say, but sometimes they're limiting.
7612160	7620080	That said, we're talking about consciousness here. How does that, you said cooperative,
7620080	7627680	okay, competitive. It just, I like chocolate. I'm sitting here. I have a brain. I'm wearing a suit.
7628400	7635680	It sure as hell feels like I'm a self. Right. Now, what am I tuning in? Am I plugging into
7635680	7642880	something? Am I a projection, a simple trivial projection into space time from some much larger
7642880	7648480	organism that I can't possibly comprehend? How the hell, you're saying some, you're building
7648480	7655040	up mathematical intuitions. Fine. Great. But I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here,
7655040	7660560	and I'm going to die soon. We'll all die pretty quickly. So I, I want to, I want to figure out
7660560	7666080	why chocolate is so delicious. So help me out here. So let's just keep sneaking up to this.
7667040	7674880	Right. So the whole technical, technical thing was to say this, even if the dynamics of consciousness
7674880	7682320	is stationary so that there is no entropic time, any projection of it, any view of it
7683840	7692000	will have the artifact of entropic time. That's a limited resource, limited resources.
7692560	7698400	So the fundamental dynamics may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever. Any projection
7698400	7704000	will have certainly time as a limited resource and probably lots of other limited resources.
7704080	7711600	Hence we could get competition and evolution and nature, red, and tooth, and claw as an artifact
7711600	7716720	of a deeper system in which those aren't fundamental. And, and in fact, I take it as
7717360	7722720	something that this theory must do at some point is to show how networks of conscious agents,
7722720	7728400	even if they're not resource limited, give rise to evolution of a natural selection via a projection.
7729200	7733840	Yeah. But you're saying, I'm trying to understand how the limited resources that give rise
7733840	7740640	to, so first the thing gives rise to time, it gives rise to limited resource, it gives rise to
7741440	7745280	evolution by natural selection, how that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious.
7745840	7749840	Well, it's not going to do that directly. It's going to get to this notion of self.
7750640	7752800	Oh, it's going to give you the notion of self.
7752800	7754800	Oh, the evolution gives you the notion of self.
7754800	7761600	And also of a self separate from other selves. So the idea would be that competition has life
7761600	7763200	and death, all those kinds of things.
7763200	7768960	That's right. So it won't, I don't think, as I said, I don't think that I can tell you how
7768960	7773520	the formless gives rise to the experience of chocolate. Right now, my current theory says
7773520	7775920	that's, that's one of the miracles I'm assuming. Yeah.
7776560	7779440	So my theory can't do it. And the reason my theory can't do it is because
7779440	7784960	Hoffman's brain can't do it right now. But, but the notion of self, yes,
7785840	7793520	the notion of self can be an artifact of the projection of it. So there's one conscious agent.
7795200	7798320	Because anytime conscious agents interact, they form a new conscious agent. So there's one
7798320	7805280	conscious agent. Any projection of that one conscious agent gives rise to time, even if
7805280	7810320	there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent. And it gives rise, I want to, I haven't
7810320	7814400	proven this. So this is, so now this is me guessing where the theory is going to go.
7814400	7817840	Not, I haven't done this. There's no paper on this yet. So now I'm speculating.
7818400	7822400	My guess is I'll be able to show, or the, or the, but my brighter colleagues working with me
7822400	7826960	will be able to show that, that we will get evolution of a natural selection, the notion
7826960	7831040	of individual selves, individual physical objects, and so forth coming out as a projection of this
7831040	7836400	thing. And, and, and that the self, this thing will be, be really interesting in terms of how
7836400	7842640	it starts to interact with certain spiritual traditions, right? Where they will say that
7842640	7847360	there is a notion of self that needs to be let go, which is this finite self that's competing
7847360	7853840	with other selves to, you know, get more money and prestige and so forth. That self in some sense
7853840	7857760	has to die. But there's a deeper self, which is the timeless
7858720	7867040	being that preclude, that precedes, not precludes, but precedes any particular
7867040	7872480	conscious experiences, the ground of all experience, that there's that notion of a deep
7872480	7880000	capital self. But our little capital, lowercase s selves could be artifacts of projection.
7880800	7887920	And it may be that what consciousness is doing in this framework is, right? It's projected itself
7887920	7895520	down into a self that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex. And through conversations
7895520	7902320	like this, it's trying to find out about itself, and eventually transcend the limits of the Don
7902320	7910480	and Lex little icons that it's using, and that little projection of itself through this conversation
7910480	7918720	is somehow it's learning about itself. So that thing dressed me up today in order to understand
7918720	7923200	itself. And in some sense, you and I are not separate from that thing, and we're not separate
7923200	7929040	from each other. Yeah. Well, I have to question the fashion choices on my end. All right. So
7929760	7935360	you mentioned you agree on in terms of consciousness on a lot of things with Annika.
7935360	7945440	Is there somebody friend or friendly foe that you disagree with in some nuanced, interesting way,
7945440	7952080	or some major way about consciousness about these topics of reality that you return to
7952080	7963360	often? It's like Christopher Hitchens with Rabbi David Walby have had interesting conversations
7963360	7969040	through years that added to the complexity and the beauty of their friendship. Is there somebody
7969040	7975360	like that, that over the years has been a source of disagreement with you that strengthened your
7975360	7986800	ideas? My ideas have been really shaped by several things. One is the physicalist framework that
7987680	7993680	my scientific colleagues almost to a person have adopted, and that I adopted too, until the reason
7993680	8001040	I walked away from it was because it became clear that we couldn't start with unconscious
8001040	8008160	ingredients and boot up consciousness. Can you define physicalist in contrast to reductionist?
8008960	8015600	So a physicalist, I would say is someone who takes space time and the objects within space
8015600	8022640	time as ontologically fundamental. Right. And then reductionist is saying the smaller,
8022640	8028240	the more fundamental. That's a methodological thing. That's saying within space time as you go
8028240	8033040	to smaller and smaller scales in space, you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental
8033040	8041200	laws. And the reduction of temperature to particle movement was an example of that,
8041200	8047120	but I think that the reason that worked was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.
8047840	8052320	That was for a long time, and your colleagues, including yourself or physicalist, and now
8052320	8057040	you broke away. I broke away because I think you can't start with unconscious ingredients and boot
8057040	8062720	up consciousness. And so even with Roger Penrose, where there's like a gray area.
8063920	8070080	Right. And here's the challenge I would put to all of my friends and colleagues who are,
8071760	8078960	give one specific conscious experience that you can boot up. So if you think that it's
8078960	8084400	integrated information, and this I've asked this of Julia to know me a couple times back in the
8084400	8089120	90s, and then just a couple of years ago, I asked Julia, okay, so great integrated information. So
8089760	8094640	we're all interested in explaining some specific conscious experiences. So what, what is, you
8094640	8100720	know, pick one, the taste of chocolate? What is the integrated information, precise structure
8100720	8106000	that we need for chocolate? And why does that structure have to be for chocolate? And why,
8106880	8111440	why is it that it could not possibly be vanilla? Is there any, last time, is there any one specific
8111520	8117360	conscious experience that you can account for? Because notice, they've set themselves the task
8118240	8122320	of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems. That's the task they've set
8122320	8127440	themselves. But that doesn't mean they're, I understand your intuition, but that doesn't mean
8127440	8132080	they're wrong just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet. That's right. No, that doesn't
8132080	8138240	mean that they're wrong. It just, it just means that they haven't done it. I think it's principled.
8138800	8144160	The reason is principled, but, but I'm happy that they're exploring it. But the fact is, the
8144160	8149840	remarkable fact is there's not one theory. So integrated information theory, orchestrated
8149840	8156160	collapse of microtubules, global workspace theory. These are all theories of consciousness.
8156160	8161840	These are all theories of consciousness. There's not a single theory that can give you a specific
8161840	8166560	conscious experience that they say, here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure
8166560	8171120	that must be the taste of chocolate or whatever one they want. So you're saying it's impossible,
8171120	8179520	they're saying it's just hard. Yeah. My attitude is, okay, no one said you had to start with neurons
8179520	8182640	or physical systems and boot up consciousness. You guys are just taking that. You chose that
8182640	8187520	problem. So since you chose that problem, how much progress have you made? Well,
8188560	8192080	when you've not been able to come up with a single specific conscious experience,
8192880	8195680	and you've had these brilliant people working on it for decades now,
8196560	8202480	that's not really good progress. Let me ask you to be, to play devil's advocate. Can you try to
8202480	8210480	steal man, steal man, meaning argue the best possible case for reality, the opposite of your
8210480	8215920	book title. So, or maybe just stick into consciousness. Can you take the physicalist view?
8216880	8221760	Can you steal man, the physicalist view for a brief moment, playing devil's advocate too?
8221760	8225760	Or steal man, the person you used to be. Right.
8225760	8230960	She's a physicalist. What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now?
8232560	8241360	What would be a convincing argument for that? Well, I think the argument I would give and
8241360	8247360	that I believed was, look, when you have very simple physical systems, like a piece of dirt,
8248240	8251360	there's not much evidence of life for consciousness. It's only when you get really
8251360	8256320	complicated physical systems like that have brains and really the more complicated the brains,
8256320	8261280	the more it looks like there's consciousness and the more complicated that consciousness is.
8261280	8267280	Surely that means that simple physical systems don't create much consciousness,
8267440	8272560	if maybe not any, or maybe panpsychists, they create the most elementary kinds of
8272560	8278400	simple conscious experiences. But you need more complicated physical systems to boot up,
8279360	8283920	to create more complicated consciousnesses. I think that's the intuition that drives most of my
8283920	8292240	colleagues. And you're saying that this concept of complexity is ill-defined when you ground it to
8292320	8297360	space-time. Well, I think it's well-defined within the framework of space-time, right?
8297360	8303120	No, it's ill-defined relative to what you need to actually understand consciousness
8303120	8306160	because you're grounding complexity in just in space-time.
8306160	8315280	Oh, got you. Right. Yeah. What I'm saying is, if it were true that space-time was fundamental,
8316880	8321040	then I would have to agree that if there is such a thing as consciousness, given the data that we've
8321040	8327760	got, that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't, that somehow it's the complexity of
8327760	8333040	the dynamics or organization, the function of the physical system that somehow is creating the
8333040	8339920	consciousness. So under those assumptions, yes. But when the physicists themselves are telling us
8339920	8344880	that space-time is not fundamental, then I can understand. See, then the whole picture starts
8344880	8351920	to come into focus. Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right? These are really smart people.
8351920	8357440	I mean, Francis Crick worked on this for the last 20 years of his life. These are not stupid
8357440	8361600	people. These are brilliant, brilliant people. The fact that we've come up with not a single
8361600	8366640	specific conscious experience that we can explain and no hope. There's no one that says,
8366640	8371440	oh, I'm really close. I'll have it for you in a year. No, there's just like, there's this
8371440	8377520	fundamental gap. So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says, look, he likes the
8377520	8382480	global workspace theory. But he says the last dollop of the theory in which there's something
8382480	8391280	it's like to, he says we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact. Pinker is brilliant,
8391280	8397280	right? He understands the state of play on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,
8397280	8403200	starting with physical assumptions and then trying to boot up consciousness. You've set
8403200	8409120	yourself the problem. I'm starting with physical stuff that's not conscious. I'm trying to get
8409120	8414080	the taste of chocolate out as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.
8414720	8418160	We've not been able to do that. And so Pinker is saying, we may have to punt.
8418960	8424800	We may have to just stipulate that last bit. He calls it the last dollop. And just say,
8424800	8428560	stipulate it as a bare fact of nature that there is something it's like. Well,
8429280	8433120	from my point of view as the physical, the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist was
8433120	8437280	we wouldn't have to stipulate. I was going to start with the physical stuff and explain where
8437280	8441680	the consciousness came from. If I'm going to stipulate consciousness, why don't I just stipulate
8441680	8447440	consciousness and not stipulate all the physical stuff too? So I'm stipulating less. I'm saying,
8447440	8451520	okay, I agree. The panpsychist perspective. Well, it's actually what I call the conscious
8451520	8456880	realist perspective. Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right? They're saying there's physical
8456880	8460960	stuff that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff. So I would go with Pinker
8460960	8465120	and say, look, let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff, but I'm not going to stipulate the
8465120	8469600	physical stuff. I'm going to actually now show how to boot up the physical stuff from just the
8469600	8475120	consciousness stuff. So I'll stipulate less. Is it possible? So if you stipulate less,
8475120	8485520	is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?
8485520	8490880	Is it possible to visualize somehow with the tools of math, with the tools of computers,
8490880	8497280	with the tools of our mind? Are we hopelessly lost? You said there's ways to intuit
8498160	8509920	what's true using mathematics and probability and sort of Markovian dynamics, all that kind
8509920	8516480	of stuff, but that's not visualizing. That's what's the kind of building intuition, but is it possible
8516480	8523680	to visualize in the way we visualize so nicely in space time, in four dimensions, in three dimensions?
8523680	8528000	Sorry. Well, we really are looking through a two-dimensional screen until
8529040	8535360	what we intuit to be a three-dimensional world and also inferring dynamic stuff,
8536320	8541120	making it 4D. Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures that give us
8541920	8548880	a deeper sense of the truth of reality? I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.
8549520	8556560	I think that, for example, the picture that we have of electrons and photons interacting
8557360	8565280	and scattering, it may have not been possible until Faraday did all of his experiments and
8565280	8570800	then Maxwell wrote down his equations, and we were then sort of forced by his equations to think
8570800	8581120	in a new way. And then when Planck in 1900, desperate to try to solve the problem of black
8581120	8585920	body radiation, what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe, where Newton was predicting infinite
8587600	8593920	energies, there weren't infinite energies in black body radiation. And he, in desperation, proposed
8594240	8603600	packets of energy. Then once you've done that, and then you have an Einstein come along five years
8603600	8611600	later and show how that explains the photoelectric effect. And then eventually, in 1926, you get
8611600	8616800	quantum theory. And then you get this whole new way of thinking that was, from the Newtonian point
8617760	8626240	of view, completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly. And maybe if
8626240	8630480	Giesen is right, not contradictory. Maybe if you use intuition as math, they're not contradictory.
8630480	8637040	But still, certainly you wouldn't have gone there. And so here's a case where the experiments
8637600	8645520	and then a desperate mathematical move, sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog,
8646320	8652880	right? And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.
8653600	8660000	I wonder if it's still possible to visualize in the, like we talk about consciousness in,
8660000	8666960	from a self perspective, experience it. Hold that idea in our mind, the way you can experience
8666960	8674480	things directly. We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world. And that's a very rich
8674560	8683040	experience. When you're thinking mathematically, you still, in the end of the day, have to project
8683040	8690720	it down to a low dimensional space to make, to make conclusions. Their conclusions will be a
8690720	8699920	number or a line or a plot or a visual. So I wonder like how we can really touch some deep truth
8700720	8705760	in a subjective way, like experience it, really feel the beauty of it, you know,
8705760	8711680	in the way that humans feel beauty. Right. Are we screwed? I don't think we're screwed.
8711680	8718240	I think that we get little hints of it from psychedelic drugs and so forth. We get hints
8718240	8722640	that there are certain interventions that we can take on our interface. I apply this chemical,
8722640	8730320	which is just some element of my interface, to this other, to a brain. I ingest it. And all of
8730320	8737520	a sudden, I seem like I've opened new portals into conscious experiences. Well, that's very,
8737520	8742400	very suggestive. That's like the black body radiation doing something that we didn't expect,
8742400	8746480	right? It doesn't go to infinity when we thought it was going to go to infinity and we're forced to
8747280	8751920	propose these quanta. So once we have a theory of conscious agents,
8753440	8757760	and it's projection to space, I should sketch what I think that projection is.
8759280	8765680	But then I think we can then start to ask specific questions. When you're taking DMT,
8766720	8773120	or you're taking LSD or something like that. Now that we have this deep model that we've
8773120	8777360	reverse engineered space and time and physical particles, we've pulled them back to this theory
8777360	8784240	of conscious agents. Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future, what are we doing to
8784240	8791120	conscious agents when we apply 5MEO DMT? What are we doing? Are we opening a new portal?
8792240	8797440	So when I say that, I mean, I have a portal into consciousness that I call my body of
8797440	8802880	Lex Friedman that I'm creating. And it's a genuine portal, not perfect, but it's a genuine portal
8802960	8806800	I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness. And we know that we have
8807760	8813280	one technology for building new portals. We know one technology and that is having kids.
8814640	8819920	Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness. It takes a long time.
8819920	8827040	Can you elaborate that? Oh, oh, oh, you mean like your son and your daughter didn't exist.
8827040	8831840	That was a portal though. You're having contact with consciousness that you never would have had
8831840	8836320	before. But now you've got a son or a daughter, you had, you went through this physical process,
8836880	8843040	they were born, then you, there was all the training. But is that portal yours? So when you
8843040	8847600	have kids, are you creating new portals that are completely distinct from the portals that you've
8847600	8852720	created with other consciousness? Like, can you elaborate on that? To which degree are the
8852720	8861440	consciousness of your kids a part of you? Well, so every person that I see, that symbol that I
8861440	8867120	see, the body that I see is, is a portal potentially for me to interact with, with the
8867120	8874560	consciousness. Yeah. And, and each consciousness has a unique character that we call a personality
8875280	8882560	and so forth. So with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that
8882560	8886880	we've never seen before. And a version of consciousness that we've never seen before.
8886880	8892000	At a deeper level, as I said, the theory says there's one agent. So this is a different projection
8892720	8900880	of that one agent. But, but, so that's what I mean by a portal is within my own interface,
8900880	8911200	my own projection, can I see other projections of that one consciousness? So can I get portals in,
8911200	8917040	in that sense? And I, so and I think, I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a
8917040	8922000	theory of portals. And then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting, are they actually
8922000	8928400	creating new portals or not? If they're not, we should nevertheless, then understand how we could
8928400	8932960	create a new portal, right? Maybe we have to just study what happens when we make, when we have kids.
8933840	8939360	We know that that technology creates new portals. So we have to reverse engineer that and then say,
8939360	8946640	okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo with that?
8946640	8951280	With, with something like, like brain-computer interfaces, for example.
8951280	8954560	Yeah, maybe just a chemical or something. So probably more complicated than a chemical. That's
8954560	8959520	why I think that the psychedelics, the psychedelics may, because they might be affecting this portal
8959520	8964880	in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up. Whereas it may be, once we understand what
8964880	8968960	this thing is a portal, your body as a portal, understand all of its complexities, maybe we'll
8969040	8974240	realize that that portal can be shifted and to different parts of the deeper consciousness
8974240	8981040	and give new windows on it. And so in that way, maybe, yes, psychedelics could open up new portals
8981040	8984320	in the sense that they're taking something that's already a complex portal and just
8984320	8990000	tweaking it a bit. Well, but creating is a very powerful difference between morphing.
8990800	8997840	Tweaking versus creating, I agree. But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space
8997840	9001840	of the kinds of things that this particular system is capable of. I mean, you, I mean,
9001840	9007680	the idea, your idea of the consciousness creates brains. I mean, that breaks my brain because
9008400	9013440	there's a, you know, I'm, I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense, because that you could,
9014080	9022240	it's just much easier to intuit the world. It's very, it's practical to think there's a neural
9022240	9031920	network and what are the different ways fascinating capabilities can emerge from this neural network?
9033200	9038720	I agree. It's easier. And so you start to, and then present to yourself the problem of, okay,
9038720	9045360	well, how does consciousness arise? How does intelligence arise? How does emotion arise?
9046320	9053840	How does memory arise in the, how do we filter within the system all the incoming
9053840	9059040	sensory information we're able to allocate attention in different interesting ways? How do
9059040	9064800	all those mechanisms arise to say that there's other fundamental things we don't understand
9064800	9071920	outside of space time that are actually core to how this whole thing works is a bit paralyzing
9071920	9080000	because it's like, oh, we're not, we're not 10% done. We're like 0.001% done.
9080640	9085760	Well, it's the immediate feeling. I certainly understand that. My attitude about it is,
9087360	9092000	if you look at the young physicists who are searching for these structures beyond space
9092000	9099760	time, like the episode of Eden and so forth, they're having a ball. Space time, that's what
9099760	9105760	the old folks did. That's what our, the older generation did. We're doing something that
9105760	9113760	really is fun and new and they're having a blast and they're finding all these new structures.
9113760	9124160	So I think that we're going to succeed in getting a new deeper theory. I can just say what I'm
9124160	9129680	hoping with the theory that I'm working on, I'm hoping to show that I could have this timeless
9129680	9135440	dynamics of consciousness, no entropic time. I take a projection and I show how this timeless
9135440	9142400	dynamics looks like the Big Bang and the entire evolution of space time. In other words, I see
9142400	9149120	how my whole space time interface. So not just the projection, it just doesn't just look like
9149200	9154080	space time. You can explain with it the whole from the origin of the universe.
9154080	9157840	That's what we have to do and that's what the physicists understand. When they go beyond
9157840	9162480	space time to the amplitude and the cosmological polytope, they ultimately know that they have
9162480	9168640	to get back the Big Bang story and the whole evolution, that whole story where there were no
9168640	9175520	living things. There was just a point and then the explosion and then just particles at high energy
9175520	9179120	and then eventually the cooling down and the differentiation and finally
9179840	9185040	matter, condenses and then life and then consciousness. That whole story has to come
9185040	9192880	out of something that's deeper and without time and that's what we're up to. The whole story
9192880	9197040	that we've been telling ourselves about Big Bang and how brains evolve in consciousness
9197040	9205040	will come out of a much deeper theory. For someone like me, it's a lot. But for the
9205040	9211360	younger generation, this is like, oh wow, all the low cherries aren't picked. This is really
9211360	9218160	good stuff. This is really new, fundamental stuff that we can do. I can't wait to read the papers
9218160	9227360	of the younger generation and I want to see them. Kids these days with their non-space time
9227360	9232960	assumptions. It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition of the difficult ideas
9232960	9238720	you struggle with. If you look like somebody like Emmanuel Kant, what are some interesting
9238720	9244000	agreements and disagreements you have with a guy about the nature of reality?
9244880	9251040	So there's a lot in agreement. So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist and
9253200	9260880	he basically had the idea that we don't see nature as it is. We impose a structure on nature.
9263520	9271120	So in some sense, I'm saying something similar. I'm saying that, by the way, I don't call myself
9271120	9275840	an idealist. I call myself a conscious realist because idealism has a long history, a lot of
9275840	9280400	different ideas come under idealism and there's a lot of debates and so forth. It
9282000	9286960	tends to be identified with, in many cases, anti-science and anti-realism. And I don't
9286960	9292080	want either connection with my ideas. And so I just called my conscious realism with an emphasis
9292080	9299680	on realism and not anti-realism. But one place where I would, of course, disagree with Kant was
9299680	9306960	that he thought that Euclidean space time was a priori. We just know that that's false.
9308080	9316080	So he went too far on that. But in general, the idea that we don't start with space time,
9316080	9320240	that space and time is, in some sense, the forms of our perceptions. Yes, absolutely.
9321520	9327040	And I would say that there's a lot in common with Barclay in that regard.
9329040	9336880	There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Barclay. Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly
9336880	9342160	that the hard problem was not solvable. He posed a hard problem and basically dismissed it and
9342160	9347520	just said, you can't do this. And so if he came here and saw where we are, he said,
9347520	9352000	look, guys, I told you this 300 years ago. And he had his monodology. He was trying
9352960	9358320	to do something like this. It's different from what I'm doing. But he had these things that
9358320	9364080	were not in space and time, these monads. He was trying to build something. I'm trying to build
9364080	9370160	a theory of consciousness. My guess is that if he came here, I could just, if he saw what I was
9370160	9376480	doing, he would say, he would understand it and immediately take off with it and go places that
9376480	9383440	I couldn't. He would have no problems. Right. There would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas.
9383440	9387040	Absolutely. It would be totally overlapping. But his genus would then just run with it far
9387040	9391840	faster than I could. I love the humility here. So let me ask you about sort of practical
9391840	9397280	implications of your ideas to our world, our complicated world. When you look at the big
9397360	9410240	questions of humanity of hate, war, what else is there, evil? Maybe there's the positive aspects
9410240	9422560	of that, of meaning, of love. What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived as? What is
9422560	9429280	the conscious realism when applied to daily life? What kind of impact does it have?
9429280	9440000	A lot. And it's sort of scary. We all know that life is ephemeral. And spiritual traditions have
9440000	9443280	said, wake up to the fact that anything that you do here is going to disappear.
9444320	9450400	But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought. I see this bottle because I create it
9450400	9456560	right now. As soon as I look away, that data structure has been garbage collected. That bottle,
9457280	9460960	I have to recreate it every time I look. So I spend all my money. I buy this fancy car.
9462080	9465920	That car, I have to keep recreating it every time I look at it. It's that ephemeral.
9466480	9472160	So all the things that we invest ourselves in, we fight over, we kill each other over,
9472160	9478080	and we have wars over, these are all, it's just like people in a virtual reality simulation.
9479040	9486560	Right? And there's this Porsche. We all see the Porsche. Well, that Porsche exists when I look
9486560	9492160	at it. I turn my headset and I look at it. And then if Joe turns his headset the right way,
9492160	9496400	he'll see his Porsche. But it's not even the same Porsche that I see. He's creating his own Porsche.
9497760	9505120	So these things are exceedingly ephemeral. And now, just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.
9505680	9511360	Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche, but really, the Porsche only exists as long as you
9511920	9518080	look. So this all of a sudden, what the spiritual traditions have been saying for a long, long time,
9518080	9523840	this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science. It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact,
9523840	9528000	it lasts for a few milliseconds, a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it, and then it's
9528000	9539520	gone. So the whole idea, why are we fighting? Why do we hate? We fight over possessions
9541520	9548080	because we think that we're small little objects inside this pre-existing space time. We assume
9548080	9555920	that that mansion, that car exists independent of us and that somehow we, these little things,
9556000	9561680	can have our sense of self and importance enhanced by having that special car or that special house
9561680	9568480	or that special person. In fact, it's just the opposite. You create that mansion every time you
9568480	9575200	look. You're something far deeper than that mansion. You're the entity which can create that
9575200	9581520	mansion on the fly. And there's nothing to the mansion except what you create in this moment.
9582080	9590240	So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view, it has all sorts of implications for how we
9590240	9599520	interact with each other, how we treat each other. And again, a lot of things that spiritual
9599520	9604240	traditions have said, it's a mixed bag. Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag. So let me just be
9604240	9608320	right up front about that. I'm not promoting any particular, but they do have some insights.
9608320	9612080	Yeah, they have wisdom. They have certain wisdom. They have, I can point to nonsense,
9612080	9616560	I won't go into it, but I can also point to lots of nonsense. So the issue is to then
9616560	9624240	to look for the key insights. And I think they have a lot of insights about the ephemeral nature of
9624240	9629760	objects in space and time and not being attached to them, including our own bodies and reversing
9629760	9633840	that I'm not this little thing, a little consciousness trapped in the body. And the
9633840	9637440	consciousness itself is only a product of the body. So when the body dies, the consciousness
9637440	9642880	disappears, it turns completely around, the consciousness is fundamental, the body,
9644640	9651040	my hand exists right now because I'm looking at it. My hand is gone. I have no hand. I have,
9651040	9656080	I have no brain. I have no heart. If you looked, you'll see a heart. Whatever I am
9658240	9664080	is this really complicated thing in consciousness. That's what I am. All the stuff that I thought
9664080	9669600	I was is something that I create on the fly and delete. So this whole, so this is completely
9670400	9678400	a radical restructuring of how we think about possessions, about identity, about survival
9678400	9683520	of death, and so forth. This is completely transformative. But the nice thing is that
9684160	9687840	this whole approach of consciousness agents, unlike the spiritual traditions, which have
9687840	9694000	said, in some cases, similar things, they've said it in precisely. This is mathematics.
9694800	9700080	We can actually now begin to state precisely, here's the mathematical model of consciousness,
9700080	9704400	conscious agents. Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly.
9705600	9713280	And here's why things are ephemeral. And here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral
9713280	9718320	nature of things, because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time,
9719040	9721120	quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time.
9722160	9727840	The I and the am and the I am is all kind of emerging through this whole process of evolution
9727840	9734880	and so on. That's just surface waves. And there's a much deeper ocean that we're trying to figure
9734880	9739520	out here. So how does you said, this said, some of the stuff you're thinking about maps the space
9739520	9744240	time, how does it map the space? Right. So just a very, very high level, and I'll keep it brief.
9745120	9751120	The structures that the physicists are finding, like the amplitude heat, it turns out they're
9751120	9757840	just static structure, they're polytopes. But they remarkably, most of the information in them
9757840	9766480	is contained in permutation matrices. So it's a matrix, like an n by n matrix that just has zeros
9766480	9773680	and ones. That contains almost all of the information. And you can they have these plabbit
9773680	9777840	graphs and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering, you can compute those scattering
9777840	9786320	amplitudes almost entirely from these permutation matrices. So that's just now from my point of
9786320	9792240	view, I have this conscious agent dynamics, it turns out that the stationary dynamics that I was
9792240	9799840	talking about, where the entropy is increasing, all the stationary dynamics are sketched out by
9801120	9809280	permutation matrices. So if you there's so called Birkhoff polytope, all the vertices of this
9809280	9817200	polytope, all the points are permutation matrices, all the internal points are Markovian kernels
9817920	9822080	that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.
9822800	9828400	I need to intuit a little better what the heck you're talking about. But so basically,
9828400	9834960	there's some complicated thing going on with the network of conscious agents, and that's
9834960	9841920	mappable to this. You're saying it to dimensional matrix that scattering has to do with what,
9841920	9846640	without the perception like that's like photon stuff. I mean, I don't know if it's useful to
9846720	9854720	sort of dig into detail. I'll do just the high level thing. Yes. So the high level is the long
9854720	9858640	term behavior of the conscious agent dynamics. So that's the projection of just looking at the
9858640	9866400	long term behavior. I'm hoping we'll give rise to the amplitude, the amplitude, then gives rise to
9866400	9871440	space time. So then I can just use their link to go all the way from consciousness through its
9871440	9877360	asymptotics to through the amplitude and into space time and get the map all the way into our
9877360	9880400	interface. And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix because it gives you a nice
9880400	9885040	thing to try to generate. That's right. It's the connection with the amplitude, the permutation
9885040	9889760	matrices are the core of the amplitude, and it turns out they're the core of the asymptotic
9889760	9894720	description of the conscious agents. So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator,
9894720	9901040	but I like, first of all, I like video games and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.
9901040	9904560	First of all, do you think of it as an interesting idea, this thought experiment that will live in
9904560	9912320	a simulation? And in general, do you think we'll live in a simulation? So the Nick Bostrom's idea
9912320	9919760	about the simulation is typically couched in a physicalist framework. Yes. So there is the bottom
9919760	9925200	level. There's some programmer in a physical space time, and they have a computer that they've
9925200	9931600	programmed really cleverly, where they've created conscious entities. So you have the hard problem
9931600	9935600	of consciousness, right? The standard hard problem, how could a computer simulation create a
9936480	9941840	which isn't explained by that simulation theory. But then the idea is that the next level, the
9942400	9947200	entities that are from the, that are created in the first level simulation, then can write
9947200	9954160	their own simulations and you get this this nesting. So, so the idea that this is a simulation
9954160	9960720	is fine. But the idea that this starts with a physical space, I think is important. There's
9960720	9967440	different properties here, the partial rendering. And to me, that's the interesting idea is not
9967440	9973360	whether the entirety of the universe is simulated, but how efficiently can you
9976480	9983360	create interfaces that are convincing to all other entities that can appreciate such interfaces?
9984000	9988800	How little does it take? Because you said like partial rendering, or like temporal,
9989600	9994800	ephemeral rendering of stuff, only render the tree falling in the forest when there's somebody
9994800	10000240	there to see it. It's interesting to think how can you do that superficially without having
10000240	10005040	to render everything. And that to me is one perspective on the simulation, just like it is
10005040	10009760	with video games, where a video game doesn't have to render every single thing. It's just
10009760	10015520	the thing that the observer is looking at. Right. There is actually, that's a very nice question.
10015520	10020960	And there's whole groups of researchers that are actually studying in virtual reality, what
10022080	10027680	is the sort of minimal requirements on the system? What, how does it have to operate
10027680	10032560	to give you an immersion experience, to give you the feeling that you have a body,
10032560	10036480	to get you to take it real? And there's actually a lot of really good work on that right now.
10036480	10040480	And it turns out it doesn't take that much. You do need to get the perception action loop
10041200	10046880	tight. And you have to give them the perceptions that they're expecting, if you want them to.
10046880	10051600	But if you, you can lead them along, if you give them perceptions that are close to what
10051600	10055440	they're expecting, you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.
10055440	10058480	Yeah, it's a trick engineering problem, especially when you're trying to create a product
10059280	10064000	that costs little, but that's, it feels like an engineering problem, not a deeply scientific
10064000	10069440	problem. Or meaning obviously it's a scientific problem, but as a scientific problem, it's not
10069440	10076400	that difficult to trick us descendants of apes. But here's, here's a case for just us in our own,
10076400	10079840	if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now. So here's something you
10079840	10088400	can try for yourself. If you just close your eyes and look at your experience in front of you,
10088400	10091920	to be aware of your experience in front of you, what you experience is just like a modeled
10092640	10096880	dark gray, where there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it, but it's just dark gray.
10097440	10104160	But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward, put your attention backward,
10104160	10112320	what is it like behind you with your eyes closed? And there, it's like nothing.
10112720	10121120	It's real. So what is going on here? What, what am I experiencing back there?
10124000	10129680	Right. Well, it's, I don't know if it's nothing. It's, it's like, I guess it's the absence of,
10129680	10135760	it's not even like darkness or something. It's not even darkness. There's no, there's no
10136480	10142080	qualia to it. And yet there is a sense of being. And that's the interesting thing.
10142080	10146640	There's a sense of being back. So I close my, I put my attention forward. I just,
10146640	10150240	I have the quality of a gray model thing. But when I put my attention backward,
10150240	10153200	there's no quality at all, but there is a sense of being.
10154320	10159920	I personally, you haven't been to that side of the room. I have been to that side of the room.
10159920	10166960	So for me, memories, I start, I started playing the engine of memory replay,
10168880	10173680	which is like, I take myself back in time and think about that place where I was hanging
10173680	10178640	out in that part. That's when I see what I'm behind. So that's an interesting quirk of humans too,
10178640	10182960	we're able to, we're collecting these experiences and we can replay them in interesting ways,
10182960	10188160	whenever we feel like it. And it's almost like being there, but not really, but almost.
10189120	10194000	That's right. And yet we can go our entire lives in this. You're talking about the minimal thing
10194000	10199680	for VR. We can go our entire lives and not realize that all of my life, it's been like
10199680	10207920	nothing behind me. We're not even aware that all of our lives, if you just, for the,
10207920	10210960	just pay attention, close your eyes, pay attention to what's behind me, you're like,
10210960	10216000	oh, holy smoke. It's sort of scary. I mean, it's like nothing. There's no quality there at all.
10216000	10221280	How did I not notice that my entire life? We're so immersed in the simulation, we buy it so much.
10221280	10226640	Yeah. I mean, you could see this with children, right? Though with persistence, you know, you
10226640	10232320	could do the peek-a-boo game. You can hide from them and appear and they're fully tricked. And in
10232320	10236560	the same way, we're fully tricked. There's nothing behind us and we assume there is.
10237680	10240960	And that's really interesting. These theories are pretty heavy.
10241200	10249840	You as a human being, as a mortal human being, how has these theories been to you personally?
10249840	10255280	Like, are there good days and bad days when you wake up and look in the mirror and the fact that
10255280	10260240	you can't see anything behind you? The fact that it's rendered like, is there interesting quirks?
10261360	10266560	You know, Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.
10266960	10271760	How has these theories, these ideas changed you as a person?
10273360	10280720	It's been very, very difficult. The stuff is not just abstract theory building because it's about us.
10281680	10286160	Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me that my mind is doing all this
10286160	10290400	science and coming with these conclusions. And the rest of me is not integrating. I was just like,
10290400	10295440	I don't believe it. I just don't believe this. I mean, it seems. So as I start to take it seriously,
10295920	10304080	I get scared myself. Then I read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying very,
10304080	10315200	very similar things. There's a lot of convergence. So for me, the first time I thought it might be
10315200	10321440	possible that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986. It was from some mathematics we were doing.
10322400	10328880	And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to sit down. It was, it really,
10330000	10337280	it was scary. It was really a shock to the system. And then to realize that everything that has been
10337280	10345040	important to me, like, you know, getting a house, getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.
10346400	10350720	Well, that car is just like the car I see in the virtual reality. It's there when you
10350800	10354720	perceive it and it's not there. So the whole question of, you know,
10355280	10361040	what am I doing and why? What's worthwhile doing in life? Clearly,
10363120	10367280	getting a big house and getting a big car. I mean, we all knew that we were going to die.
10368080	10373280	So we tend not to know that. We tend to hide it, especially when we were young. Before age 30,
10373280	10378560	we don't believe we're going to die. But we factually maybe know that you kind of are supposed
10378640	10382800	to, yeah. But they'll figure something out and probably the generation that is the first one
10382800	10387520	that doesn't have to die. That's the kind of thing. But when you really face the fact that
10388240	10393680	you're going to die, and then when I start to look at it from this point of view that, well,
10393680	10399280	this thing was an interface to begin with. So what I'm really, is what I'm really going to be doing,
10400080	10404080	just taking off a headset. So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day.
10404080	10410160	And I got lost in the game when I was fighting over a Porsche. And I shot some guys up and I
10410160	10415200	punctured their tires and I got the Porsche. Now I take the headset off. And what was that for?
10415200	10420880	Nothing. It was just, it was a data structure and the data structure is gone. So all of the wars,
10420880	10426720	the fighting and the reputations and all this stuff, you know, where it's just a headset.
10427280	10438880	So now, and so my theory says that intellectually, my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.
10438880	10442880	This is like, you know, and so I have to meditate. I meditate a lot.
10442880	10450960	Well, what percent of the day would you say you spend as a physicalist sort of living life,
10450960	10459600	pretending your car matters, your reputation matters? Like, how much was that Tom Waits song?
10459600	10465680	I like my town with a little drop of poison. How much poison do you allow yourself to have?
10465680	10471280	I think my default mode is physicalist. I think that that's just the default. I, when I'm not
10473120	10475760	being conscious, consciously attentive.
10476480	10482080	Then intellectually conscious, because if you're just, you're still, if you're tasting coffee and
10482080	10486640	not thinking or drinking or just taking it in the sunset, you're not being intellectual,
10487360	10493520	but you're still experiencing it. So it's when you turn on the like the introspective machine,
10493520	10498800	that's when you can start and turn off the thinker. When I actually just start looking
10498800	10505600	without thinking. So that's when I feel like I, all of a sudden, I'm starting to see through.
10506640	10514400	I'm sort of like, okay, part of the addiction to the interface is all the stories I'm telling
10514400	10518560	about it. It's really important for me to get that really important to do that. So I'm telling all
10518560	10524320	these stories and so I'm all wrapped up. Almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head
10524400	10535600	is about attachment to the interface. And so what I found is that the essentially the only way to
10535600	10545360	really detach from the interface is to literally let go of thoughts altogether. And then all of a
10545360	10552560	sudden, even my identity, you know, my whole history, my name, my education, all this stuff
10553120	10562160	is almost irrelevant because it's just now here is the present moment. And this is this is the
10562160	10568880	reality right now. And all of that other stuff is an interface story. But this conscious experience
10568880	10574880	right now, this is the only, this is the only reality as far as I can tell, the rest of it's a
10574880	10582480	story. And, but that is, again, not my default, that is, I have to make a really
10584080	10589600	conscious choice to say, okay, I know intellectually this is all an interface.
10590800	10596640	I'm going to take the headset off and so forth. And then immediately sink back into the game and
10596640	10602080	just be out there playing the game and get lost. And so I'm always lost in the game unless I
10602960	10610880	literally consciously choose to stop thinking. Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge that
10613520	10620880	to look beyond the game? Isn't it scares the hell out of me? It's really a scary
10622000	10625440	because I'm so attached. I'm attached to this body. I'm attached to the interface.
10625440	10631920	Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit? Meaning like, it's,
10634400	10638640	I mean, some of these ideas, when you think about reality, even with like Einstein,
10640080	10647680	just realizing you said interface, just realizing that light, you know, that there's a speed of
10647680	10652160	light and you can't go faster than the speed of light and like what kind of things black holes and
10652880	10659840	can do with light, even that can mess with your head. Yes. But that's still space time.
10660800	10664560	That's a big mess, but it's still just space time. It's still a property of our interface.
10664560	10671360	That's right. But it's still like even, even Einstein realized that this particular thing,
10671360	10678080	some of the stories you tell ourselves is constructing interfaces that are oversimplifying
10678160	10684320	the way things work because it's nice. The stories are nice. Stories are nice.
10684320	10686800	That's what I mean. It's just like video games. They're nice.
10687920	10692560	Right. But Einstein was a realist, right? He was a famous realist in the sense that he
10693200	10698400	was very explicit in a 1935 paper with Podolski and Rosen, the EPR paper where he,
10699600	10707680	they said, if without in any way disturbing a system, I can predict with probability one,
10708480	10714720	the outcome of a measurement, then there exists in reality that element,
10715520	10720640	right? That value, that, and we now know from quantum theory that that's false.
10721840	10726320	That Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.
10727280	10732800	Yeah. And so we can predict, we can set up, in quantum theory, you can set up,
10732880	10738560	and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism, where he, he scouts this out,
10738560	10741360	it was done by the people, but he gives a good presentation of this,
10741360	10744640	where they have a sequence of like something like nine different quantum measurements
10744640	10749840	that you can make. And you can predict with probability one, what a particular outcome
10749840	10757840	will be, but you can actually prove that it's impossible that the value existed before you
10757840	10760640	made the measurement. So you know with probability one, what you're going to get,
10760640	10765760	which you also know with certainty that that value was not there until you made the measurement.
10765760	10771360	So the, so we know from quantum theory that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.
10773120	10777120	And that is built in to what I'm saying with this theory of consciousness.
10777120	10782320	If consciousness is fundamental, space time itself is an act of fact creation. It's,
10782320	10786480	it's an interface that we create, consciousness creates, plus all the objects in it. So local
10786480	10793360	realism is not true. Quantum theory is established that also non-contextual realism
10793360	10798400	is not true. And that, that fits in perfectly with this idea that consciousness is fundamental.
10799440	10802480	These things are, these exist as data structures when we create them.
10803600	10808640	As, as, as Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation is an act of fact creation.
10808640	10817440	But I must say on a personal level, I'm having to spend, I spend a couple hours a day
10819840	10825840	just sitting in meditation on this and facing the rebellion
10826960	10830320	in me that goes to the core, it feels like it goes to the core of my being,
10830320	10834240	rebellion against these ideas. So, so here it's very, very interesting for me to look at this
10834240	10838400	because so here I'm a, I'm a scientist and I'm a person. The science is really clear.
10839040	10843680	Local realism is false. Non-contextual realism is false. Spacetime is doomed. It's, it's very,
10843680	10850720	very clear. It couldn't be clearer. And my, my emotions rebel left and right. When I sit there
10850720	10857600	and say, okay, I am not something in space and time. Something inside of me says, you're crazy.
10857600	10861760	Of course you are. And I'm completely attached to it. I'm completely attached to all this stuff.
10861840	10865840	I'm attached to my body. I'm attached to the headset. I'm attached to my car.
10866720	10872720	Attached to people. I'm attached to all of it. And, and yet I know as a absolute fact,
10872720	10880640	I'm going to walk away from all of it. I'm going to die. It'll, you know, in fact, I almost died
10880640	10888160	last year. COVID almost killed me. I, I sent a goodbye text to my wife. So I was, I thought I
10888160	10894880	was, I sent her a goodbye. I thought I was in the emergency room and it attacked my heart
10895600	10901680	and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours. I, I couldn't last much longer. I knew
10901680	10908880	I, they couldn't stop it. So that was, that was it. So that was it. So, so I texted her goodbye
10908880	10914960	from the emergency room. I love you. Goodbye kind of thing. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And that was it.
10914960	10920240	So, so were you afraid? God, it scares the hell out of you, right? But there, there is,
10920240	10924160	there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway, that, that all, you know, you,
10924160	10927680	that, that sort of, you're scared, but you're just feeling so bad that in some sense,
10927680	10936240	you just want to stop anyway. So, so I've, I've, I've been there and faced it just, just a year ago.
10936880	10942240	How did that change you by the way? Having, having this intellectual reality that's so
10942320	10946080	challenging that you meditate on a year, it's just an interface. And one of the,
10947120	10952640	one of the hardest things to come to terms with is that, that means that, you know, it's going to end.
10955440	10958800	How did I change you having come, come so close to the reality of it? It's not just an
10958800	10965920	intellectual reality. It's, it's a reality of death. It's, it's forced. I've, I've meditated for
10965920	10970160	20 years now. And then I would say averaging three or four hours a day.
10972880	10979920	But it's put a new urgency, but urgency is not the right word because that, that
10980880	10987120	it's, it's riveted my attention. I'll put it that way. It's really riveted my attention. And
10988400	10993600	I've really paid, I spent a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say.
10994560	11000480	I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with the, you know, take it all with a green
11000480	11005840	assault. But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me to ignore it. So I try to listen
11006560	11013600	to the best ideas and, and to sort out nonsense from, and it's just, we all have to do it for
11013600	11019200	ourselves, right? It's not easy. So what makes sense? And I have the advantage of some science,
11019200	11022960	so I can look at what science says and try to compare with spiritual tradition.
11022960	11028880	I try to sort it out for myself. And, but then I also look and realize that there's another
11028880	11034960	aspect to me, which is this whole emotional aspect. The, I seem to be wired up
11036880	11043280	as evolutionary psychology says, I'm wired up, right? All these defensive mechanisms. So, you
11044240	11050880	I'm, I'm inclined to lie if I need to, I'm inclined to, to be angry, to protect myself,
11050880	11057600	to have an in group and an out group, to try to, you know, make my reputation as big as possible,
11057600	11062000	to try to demean the out group. There's all these things that evolutionary psychology
11062000	11067440	is spot on. It's really brilliant about the human condition. And yet I think evolution,
11068240	11072720	as I said, evolutionary theory is a projection of a deeper theory where there may be no
11072720	11081040	competition. So how, so I'm in this very interesting position where I feel like, okay,
11081040	11085440	according to my own theory, I'm consciousness. And maybe this is what it means for consciousness
11086240	11093200	to wake up. It's not easy. It's, it's, it's almost like I have, I feel like I have real
11093200	11100080	skin in the game. It really is scary. I really was scared when I was about to die. It really was
11100080	11104800	hard to say goodbye to my wife. It really, it really pained. And
11107200	11111440	to then look at that, and then look at the fact that I'm going to walk away from this anyway,
11111440	11116880	and it's just an interface. How do I, so it's, it's trying to put all this stuff together and really
11117840	11122560	grok it, so to speak, not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.
11122560	11128480	Yeah. What are you afraid of? You silly evolved organism that's gotten way too attached to the
11128480	11135760	interface. What are you really afraid of? That's right. Is there a very personal, you know, it's
11135760	11142720	very, very personal. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, speaking of the text, what do you think is this whole love
11142720	11150960	thing? What's the role of love in our human condition? This interface thing we have this,
11150960	11155760	is this somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness, this attachment we have to other
11155760	11166400	humans, and this deep, like some quality to it that seems very interesting, peculiar.
11167360	11173120	Well, there are two levels I would think about that. There's love in the sexual sense, and there's
11173120	11179520	love in a deeper sense. And in the sexual sense, we can give an evolutionary account of that and
11179520	11188240	so forth. And I think that's pretty clear to people. In this deeper sense, right? So, of course,
11189040	11193920	I married your, I love my wife in a sexual sense, but there was a deeper sense as well.
11193920	11198080	When I was saying goodbye to her, there was a deeper, much deeper love that was really at play
11198080	11203600	there. That's one place where I think that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions has something
11203600	11207920	right. When they say, you know, love your neighbor as yourself, that some, in some sense, love is
11207920	11215040	fundamental. I think that they're onto something, something very, very deep and profound. And
11216720	11219680	every once in a while, I can get a personal glimpse of that, especially when I'm in the
11221840	11230160	space with no thought. Like when I can really let go of thoughts, I get little glimpses of a love
11230160	11236560	in the sense that I'm not separate. It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that. I,
11236640	11242080	you know, yeah, if you and I are separate, then there's, I can fight you. But if you and I are
11242080	11251280	the same, if there's a union there, the togetherness of it, yeah. What, who's God? All those gods,
11251280	11255760	the stories that have been told throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions,
11256560	11262800	what do you think that is? Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?
11263680	11273200	Oh, well, in many traditions, not all. The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister,
11274720	11284480	we tend to think of God as a being. But I think that that's not right. I think the closest way
11284480	11292240	to think about God is being, period, not a being, but being the very ground of being itself is God.
11292320	11298000	I think that's the deep, and from my point of view, that's the ground of consciousness. So the
11298000	11305200	ground of conscious being is what we might call God. But the word God has always been, you know,
11305200	11309920	for example, you don't believe the same God as my God, so I'm going to fight you. We'll have wars
11309920	11315520	over, because the being, the specific being that you call God is different from the being that I
11315520	11322800	call God, and so we fight. Whereas if it's not a being, but just being, and you and I share being,
11322800	11328240	then you and I are not separate, and there's no reason to fight. We're both part of that one
11328240	11334800	being, and loving you is loving myself, because we're all part of that one being. The spiritual
11334800	11342080	traditions that point to that, I think are pointing in a very interesting direction, and that does seem
11342080	11347280	to match with the mathematics of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on as well,
11347280	11351040	that it really fits with that, although that wasn't my goal.
11351040	11360800	Is there, you mentioned, you mentioned that the young physicist that you talk to or whose work
11360800	11367040	you follow have quite a lot of fun breaking with the traditions of the past, the assumptions of
11367040	11373360	the past. What advice would you give to young people today in high school, in college, not just
11373360	11379840	physicists, but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of, how they can have a life
11379840	11385280	they can be proud of, how to make their way in the world from the lessons, from the wins and
11385280	11392320	the losses in your own life. What little insights could you pull out? I would say the universe is
11392320	11398880	a lot more interesting than you might expect, and you are a lot more special and interesting
11398880	11406800	than you might expect. You might think that you're just a little tiny, irrelevant 100-pound,
11406800	11414960	200-pound person in a vast billions of light years across space, and that's not the case.
11416080	11420640	You are, in some sense, the being that's creating that space all the time, every time you look.
11421360	11429200	So, waking up to who you really are outside of space and time, as the author of space and time,
11429200	11436800	is the author of everything that you see. The author of space and time, you're the author of
11436800	11441680	space and time, and I'm the author of space and time. Space and time is just one little data
11441680	11447120	structure. Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures. They're authors of various
11447200	11453680	other things. So, realizing, and then realizing that I had this feeling that growing up and going
11453680	11460480	and reading all these textbooks, oh man, it's all been done. If I'd just been there 50 years ago,
11460480	11465760	I could have discovered this stuff, but it's all in the textbooks now. Well, believe me,
11465760	11470560	the textbooks are going to look silly in 50 years, and it's your chance to write the new
11470560	11476080	textbook. So, of course, study the current textbooks. You have to understand them. There's
11476080	11484400	no way to progress until you understand what's been done. But then, the only limit is your
11484400	11489840	imagination, frankly. That's the only limit. The greatest books, the greatest textbooks ever written
11489840	11496720	on earth are yet to be written. Exactly. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
11496720	11503280	What's the meaning of life from your limited interface? Can you figure it all out? Why?
11503280	11509200	So, you said the universe is trying to figure itself out through us. Why?
11513840	11522000	Yeah, that's the closest I've come. So, I'll give you. So, I will say that I don't know, but here's
11522000	11526160	my guess, right? That's a good first sentence. That's a good starting point. And maybe that's
11527120	11531120	going to be a profound part of the final answer is to start with the I don't know. It's quite
11531120	11537120	possible that that's really important to start with the I don't know. My guess is that if consciousness
11537120	11544160	is fundamental and if girdle, girdle's incompleteness theorem holds here, and there's infinite variety
11544160	11557120	of structures for consciousness to some sense explore, that maybe that's what it's about.
11557120	11560160	This is something that Onika and I talked about a little bit, and she doesn't like this way of
11560160	11563760	talking about it. And so, I'm going to have to talk with her some more about this way of talking.
11563760	11567040	But right now, I'll just put it this way, and I'll have to talk with her more and see if I
11567040	11571680	can say it more clearly. But the way I'm talking about it now is that
11575600	11584240	there's a sense in which there's being, and then there's experiences or forms that come out of
11584320	11593760	being. That's one deep, deep mystery. And the question that you asked, what's it all about?
11593760	11599600	Somehow it's related to that. Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms?
11599600	11606640	Why does it, why do we have experiences? Why should, why not just have, when you close your eyes
11606640	11610640	and pay attention to what's behind you, there's nothing. But there's being.
11611440	11619280	Why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there? Why did we create all tables and chairs
11619280	11628240	on the sun and moon and people, all this really complicated stuff? Why? And all I can guess right
11628240	11633360	now, and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years and say that was dumb, but all I can
11633360	11638800	guess right now is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself by knowing what it's not.
11639760	11646560	So here I am, I'm not this body. And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face when I
11647520	11653360	sent a text goodbye. But then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like, okay, I sort of don't want to
11653360	11660240	go there, right? Okay, so I just, so I am my body. I go back to the standard thing, I am my body,
11660240	11665920	and then I want to get that car. And even though I was just about to die a year ago, so that comes
11666000	11678000	rushing back. So, so consciousness immerses itself fully into a particular headset, gets lost in it,
11678800	11683600	and then slowly wakes up. Just so it can escape and that is the waking up, but it needs to have
11683600	11688720	a negative. It needs to know what it's not. It needs to know what you are. You have to say,
11688720	11691840	oh, I'm not that, I'm not that, that wasn't important, that wasn't important.
11692000	11700480	That's really powerful done. Let me just say that, because I've been a long-term fan of yours,
11700480	11705600	and we're supposed to have a conversation doing this very difficult moment in your life. Let me
11705600	11710240	just say you're a truly special person. And I for one, I know there's a lot, a lot of others,
11710240	11715440	they agree. I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth, if for a short time.
11715520	11725600	So, whatever, whatever the universe, whatever plan it has for you that brought you close to
11725600	11733920	death, to maybe enlighten you some kind of way, I think, I think has an interesting plan for you.
11733920	11738000	You're one of the truly special humans, and it's a huge honor that you would sit and talk with me
11738000	11741680	today. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lex. I really appreciate that. Thank you.
11742640	11746720	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Donald Hoffman. To support this podcast,
11746720	11751600	please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from
11751600	11759440	Albert Einstein, relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation. Time and space are modes by
11759440	11766320	which we think, and not conditions in which we live. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you
11766320	11775920	next time.
