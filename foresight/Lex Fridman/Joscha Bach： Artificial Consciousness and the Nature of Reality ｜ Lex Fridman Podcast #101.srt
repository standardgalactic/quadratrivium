00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, VP of Research at the AI Foundation

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,240
with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard. Yosha is one of the most unique

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,280
and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community, exploring the workings of the human

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,640
mind, intelligence, consciousness, life on earth, and the possibly simulated fabric of our universe.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,720
I can see myself talking to Yosha many times in the future.

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,480
to try to figure out how to spell my last name without using the letter E. And it'll probably

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,080
be the correct way. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now and never hear any ads in the middle

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,400
that can break the flow of the conversation. This show is sponsored by ExpressVPN. Get it at

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,920
the best VPN out there. They told me to say it, but I think it actually happens to be true.

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,040
It doesn't log your data. It's crazy fast and it's easy to use literally just one big power on

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,440
button. Again, for obvious reasons, it's really important that they don't log your data. It works

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,080
on Linux and everywhere else too. Shout out to my favorite flavor of Linux, Ubuntu Mate 2004.

extra three months free on a one-year package. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,600
finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code lexpodcast. Cash App lets you send money to

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,240
friends by Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,280
share trading, let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,120
to create the abstraction of the fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,240
the Cash App engineers for taking a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

27
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,040
making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier. So again, if you

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,120
for young people around the world. And now, here's my conversation with Yosha Bach.

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany, just as what we're talking about off mic,

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,520
to parents who were artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the most

33
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,560
unique thinkers in the AI world. So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit?

34
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,560
What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies, or just realizations that

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,040
impact on you when you're growing up that kind of led to the trajectory? Or were the key sort of

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,160
crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development? My father came from a long tradition

37
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:00,560
of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family. And so basically, he was technically a nerd,

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,840
and nerds need to interface in society with non-standard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,160
as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:19,360
review. And normal people understand that the primary purpose of communication is to negotiate

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,480
alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict, which means that nerds have to learn how to

42
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:32,080
interact with society at large. Who is the reviewer in the nerd's view of communication?

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,760
Everybody who you consider to be a peer. So whatever hapless individual is around,

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,360
well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information.

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,720
Okay. So you're not, by the way, my research will malinform me. So you're

46
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,280
architect or artist? So he did study architecture. But basically, my grandfather made the wrong

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:05,600
decision. He married an aristocrat and was drawn into the war. And he came back after 15 years.

48
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,800
So basically, my father was not parented by a nerd, but by somebody who tried to tell him

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,840
what to do and expected him to do what he was told. And he was unable to. He's unable to do

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,320
things if he's not intrinsically motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son.

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,720
And her son responded when he became an architect to become an artist. So he built

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
100-wasser architecture. He built houses without right angles. He'd built lots of things that

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,200
didn't work in the more brutalist traditions of Eastern Germany. And so he bought an old

54
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,600
watermill, moved out to the countryside, and did only what he wanted to do, which was art.

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,080
Eastern Germany was perfect for Bohem, because you had complete material safety. Put was heavily

56
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,560
subsidized. Haskell was free. You didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything.

57
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,280
Socialized Communist side of the memory. Yes. And the other thing is it was almost impossible

58
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,360
not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very productive for artists.

59
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,240
So everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful, because it will always touch on the

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,120
deeper currents of society, of culture, and being conflict with it, and tension with it. And you

61
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,920
will always have to define yourself with respect to this. So what impact did your father, this

62
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,720
outside-of-the-box thinker against the government, against the world artists have?

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,440
He was actually not a thinker. He was somebody who only got self-aware to the degree that he

64
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,200
needed to make himself functional. So in some sense, he was also in the late 1960s, and he was

65
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,800
in some sense a hippie. So he became a one-person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. He built

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,520
big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on, and convinced a woman to live

67
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,560
with him. She was also an architect, and she adored him and decided to share her life with him.

68
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,680
And I basically grew up in a big cave full of books. I'm almost feral. And I was bored out there. It

69
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,760
was very, very beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely. So I started to read, and by the time I

70
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,960
came to school, I've read everything until fourth grade and then some. And there was not a real way

71
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,240
for me to relate to the outside world. And I couldn't quite put my finger on why. And today,

72
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,600
I know it was because I was a nerd, obviously. And it was the only nerd around. So there were no

73
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:34,000
other kids like me. And there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on.

74
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,920
And this village school that I went to, it was basically a nice school. Kids were nice to me.

75
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,400
I was not beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or build deep relationships. They only

76
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
happened then starting from ninth grade when I went into a school for mathematics and physics.

77
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,200
Do you remember any key books from this moment?

78
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,880
Yes, I basically read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the

79
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,680
children's and young adult sections. And then I read a lot of science fiction. For instance,

80
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,040
Danislav Lem, basically the great author of cybernetics, has influenced me. Back then,

81
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,720
I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural

82
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,640
to me. And it's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote. Another thing that

83
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,080
was very influential on me were the classical philosophers and also the literature of romanticism.

84
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,680
So German poetry and art, Dr. Hilzhoff and Heine, and up to Hesse and so on.

85
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,920
Hesse, I love Hesse. So at which point do the classical philosophers end at this point

86
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,640
or in the 21st century? What's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through

87
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,840
even as far as Nietzsche or is this, are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?

88
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,120
I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster.

89
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,000
So he's very smart and easy to read. But he's not so much trolling others. He's trolling himself

90
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
because he was at odds with the world. Largely, his romantic relationships didn't work out.

91
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
He got angry and he basically became a nihilist.

92
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,840
Isn't that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual is to constantly be trolling yourself,

93
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,280
to be in that conflict, in that tension? I think it's a lack of self-awareness. At some point,

94
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,680
you have to understand the comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously

95
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,840
and you are not functional, it ends in tragedy as it did for Nietzsche.

96
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,840
I think you think he took himself too seriously in that tension.

97
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,160
And if you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, the Steppenwolf syndrome is classic

98
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,800
adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all

99
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,080
the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self-awareness because you think that you

100
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,960
are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them

101
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,600
based on your innate instincts and it doesn't work out. And you become a transcendentalist

102
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,480
to deal with that. So it's very, very understandable and have great sympathies for this

103
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,760
to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history, but you have to grow out of it.

104
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,680
So as an intellectual, a life well-lived, a journey well-traveled is one where you don't

105
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,960
take yourself seriously? No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you

106
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,280
need to become unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb.

107
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah. You don't do this for the audience, you don't do it for yourself. You have to submit to

108
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,920
the things that are possibly true and you have to follow wherever your inquiry leads, but it's

109
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,240
not about you. It has nothing to do with you. So do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed

110
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,800
sort of an idea of there's objective truth? So what's your sense in the philosophical,

111
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
if you remove yourself that's objective from the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover

112
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,480
ideas that are true or are we just in a mesh of relative concepts that are either true or false?

113
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,440
It's just a giant mess. You cannot define objective truth without understanding the

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,480
nature of truth in the first place. So what does the brain mean by saying that it covers

115
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,560
something as truth? So for instance, a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there

116
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,280
can be a sense in which a mathematical statement can be true because it's defined as true under

117
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:24,640
certain conditions. So it's basically a particular state that a variable can have in a symbol game.

118
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,440
And then you can have a correspondence between systems and talk about truth, which is again

119
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
a type of model correspondence. And there also seems to be a particular kind of ground truth.

120
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,360
So for instance, you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all, right?

121
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,640
That's stunning when you realize something exists rather than nothing. And this seems

122
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,360
to be true, right? There's absolute truth in the fact that something seems to be happening.

123
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,040
Yeah, that to me is a showstopper. I could just think about that idea and be amazed by that idea

124
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,520
for the rest of my life and not going any farther because I don't even know the answer to that.

125
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,920
Why does anything exist at all? Well, the easiest answer is existence is the default, right? So

126
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,000
this is the lowest number of bits that you would need to encode this. Whose answer? Who provides

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,800
the simplest answer to this is that existence is the default. What about non-existence? I mean,

128
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,720
that seems non-existence might not be a meaningful notion in the sense. So in some sense, if everything

129
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,240
that can exist exists for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable. The only

130
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,960
thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the superposition

131
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,360
of all finite automata. And we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties that it

132
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,520
can contain us. What does it mean to be a superposition of finite? So any superposition like

133
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,880
all possible rules. Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator that acts on some

134
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,680
substrate. And as a result, you get emergent patterns. What's the substrate? I have no idea to

135
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,200
know. But some substrate? It's something that can store information. Something that can store

136
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,280
information, there's automaton. Something that can hold state. Still, doesn't make sense to me the

137
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:10,640
why that exists at all. I could just sit there with a beer or a vodka and just enjoy the fact,

138
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,080
wandering the why. May not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there

139
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,560
could be no relation in the y direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't

140
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,320
mean that everything has to have a purpose or a cause, right? So we mentioned some philosophers

141
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,760
in that early just taking a brief step back into that. So we asked ourselves when did classical

142
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,040
philosophy end? I think for Germany, it largely ended with the first revolution. That's basically

143
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,120
when we ended the monarchy and started a democracy. And at this point, we basically came

144
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,720
up with a new form of government that didn't have a good sense of this new organism that society

145
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,760
wanted to be. And in a way, it decapitated the universities. So the universities went on

146
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,080
through modernism like a headless chicken. At the same time, democracy failed in Germany,

147
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:07,520
and we got fascism as a result. And it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burned

148
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,480
down intellectual traditions in Russia. And Germany, both Germanies have not recovered from

149
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,760
this. Eastern Germany had this vulgar dialectic materialism, and Western Germany didn't get

150
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,200
much more edgy than Habermas. So in some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions

151
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:30,080
and killing off and driving out the Jews didn't help. Yeah, so that was the end. That was the end

152
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:36,320
of really rigorous what you would say is classical philosophy. There's also this thing that in some

153
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,560
sense, the low hanging foods in philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we

154
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,680
discovered was the constructivist turn in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of

155
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,600
mathematics that work are computation. There was a very significant discovery in the first half of

156
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,160
the 20th century. And it hasn't fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists

157
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,800
checked out the code libraries for mathematics before constructivism became universal.

158
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,280
What's constructivism? What are you referring to girls and completeness there and that kind of

159
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,280
those kinds of ideas? So basically, Gödel himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert

160
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,320
could get it. Hilbert saw that, for instance, countries set theoretical experiments and

161
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,000
mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that with the current semantics,

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,520
we cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing.

163
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,120
And Gödel could prove this. And so what Gödel could show is using classical mathematical

164
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,240
semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Gödel strongly believed in these semantics,

165
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,920
and more than in what he could observe and so on, he was shocked. It basically shook his

166
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,200
world to the core, because in some sense, he felt that the world has to be implemented in

167
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,520
classical mathematics. And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that Turing could see that

168
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,040
the solution is to understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means you,

169
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,520
for instance, pi in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function, but it's the same

170
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,800
thing. And in computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it. And if you cannot

171
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,960
compute the last digit of pi, you only have a function. You can plug this function into your

172
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,360
local sun, let it run until the sun burns out. This is it. This is the last digit of pi you

173
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,720
will know. But it also means there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically

174
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,640
realized computer that depends on having known the last digit of pi. Which means there are parts of

175
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,520
physics that are defined in such a way that cannot strictly be true, because assuming that this could

176
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,760
be true leads into contradictions. So I think putting computation at the center of the world view

177
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,880
is actually the right way to think about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein

178
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,920
basically preempted the logitist program of AI that Minsky started later, like 30 years later.

179
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,120
Turing was actually a pupil of Wittgenstein. Really? So I didn't know there's any connection

180
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,880
between Turing and Wittgenstein. And Wittgenstein even canceled some classes when Turing was not

181
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,760
present because he thought it was not worth spending the time on with the others.

182
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,120
Interesting. If you read the Tractados, it's a very beautiful book. Like they say you once thought

183
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,600
on 75 pages. It's very non-typical for philosophy because it doesn't have arguments in it and it

184
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,720
doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending to convince anybody.

185
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,120
It's mostly for people that have the same insight as me. Just spell it out. And this insight is

186
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,320
there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy ought to meet. Mathematics tries to

187
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,680
understand the domain of all languages by starting with those that are so formalizable that you can

188
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,480
prove all the properties of the statements that you make. But the price that you pay is that

189
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,560
your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say something meaningful in mathematics.

190
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,680
And it looks complicated to people, but it's far less complicated than what our brain is casually

191
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:59,600
doing all the time and it makes sense of reality. And philosophy is coming from the top. So it's

192
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,400
mostly starting from natural languages with vaguely defined concepts. And the hope is that

193
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,520
mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point. And Wittgenstein was trying to make them meet.

194
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,280
And he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything with the non-calculus

195
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,320
that you could reduce the entire logic to non-gates as we do in our modern computers.

196
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,480
So in some sense, he already understood Turing universality before Turing spelled it out. I

197
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,720
think when he wrote the track titles, he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important

198
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,480
and significant. And as a specter, when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was

199
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,120
not that famous. When he lived, it was mostly his work in decrypting the German codes that made

200
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,240
him famous or gave him some notoriety. But the same status that he has to computer science right

201
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,200
now and something that I think he'll acquire later. That's kind of interesting. Do you think of

202
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,760
computation and computer science? And you kind of represent that to me is maybe that's the modern

203
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:02,080
day. You, in a sense, are the new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist who dares to

204
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,760
ask the bigger questions that philosophy originally started. Is the new philosopher?

205
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,360
Certainly not me. I think I'm mostly still this child that grows up in a very beautiful valley

206
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,440
and looks at the world from the outside and tries to understand what's going on. And my teachers

207
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,400
tell me things and they largely don't make sense. So I have to make my own models. I have to discover

208
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
the foundations of what the others are saying. I have to try to fix them, to be charitable. I

209
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,280
try to understand what they must have thought originally or what their teachers or their teachers

210
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,360
teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation and how to make sense of the

211
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,320
reality that we are in. And whenever I have an original idea, I'm usually late to the party

212
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,720
by say 400 years. And the only thing that's good is that the parties get smaller and smaller,

213
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,080
the older I get and the more I explore. The parties get smaller and more exclusive.

214
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,240
And more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing was that you

215
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,320
were not tethered, whether it's because of your parents or in general, maybe you're something

216
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,920
within your, within your mind, some genetic material, you were not tethered to the ideas

217
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,080
of the general populace, which is actually a unique property where kind of, you know,

218
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,560
the education system and whatever from that education system, just existing in this world

219
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,560
forces certain sets of ideas onto you. Can you disentangle that? Why were you,

220
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,240
why are you not so tethered? Even in your work today, you seem to not care about perhaps

221
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:41,440
a best paper in Europe, right? Being tethered to particular things that current today in this year,

222
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,040
people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and resume. You're a little bit more

223
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,120
outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people are especially focusing

224
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,800
the benchmarks of today, the things. What's, can you disentangle that? Because I think that's

225
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,280
inspiring. And if there were more people like that, we might be able to solve some of the bigger

226
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:08,240
problems that sort of AI dreams to solve. And there's a big danger in this, because in a way,

227
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,840
you are expected to marry into an intellectual tradition and visit this tradition into a

228
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,640
particular school. If everybody comes up with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not

229
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,040
cumulative as an enterprise, right? So in some sense, you need a healthy balance,

230
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,280
you need paradigmatic thinkers, and you need people that work within given paradigms.

231
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,640
Basically, scientists today define themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a disease

232
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,560
that we think as a scientist, somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor that they

233
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,880
should join a particular discipline, and then they find a good mentor to learn the right methods,

234
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,840
and then they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team, and then their

235
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,040
name will show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns with

236
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,040
this approach. And when our field, computer science and AI started, most of the people

237
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,120
that joined this field had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers in AI either don't have

238
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,040
interesting opinions at all, or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually

239
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,520
doing, because what they're doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon.

240
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,200
And this is often a good idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for

241
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,360
me, it's first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it? If the current

242
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,960
methods of machine learning lead to strong AI, why should I be doing it? I will just wait until

243
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,240
they're done and wait until they do this on the beach, or read interesting books or write some,

244
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,360
and have fun. But if you don't think that we are currently doing the right thing,

245
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,480
if we are missing some perspectives, then it's required to think outside of the box. It's

246
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,040
also required to understand the boxes. But it's necessary to understand what worked,

247
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,080
and what didn't work, and for what reasons. So you have to be willing to ask new questions and

248
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,200
design new methods whenever you want to answer them. And you have to be willing to dismiss

249
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,040
the existing methods if you think that they're not going to yield the right answers.

250
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,960
It's very bad career advice to do that.

251
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:23,120
So maybe to briefly stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the

252
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:29,840
dream before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started? When was the dream to

253
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,000
understand or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you?

254
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:44,080
I think that you can see AI largely today as advanced information processing. If you would

255
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,720
change the acronym of AI into that, most people in the field would be happy. It would not change

256
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,640
anything what they're doing. We're automating statistics, and many of the statistical models

257
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,200
are more advanced than what statisticians had in the past. And it's pretty good work. It's

258
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,560
very productive. And the other aspect of AI is philosophical project. And this philosophical

259
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,840
project is very risky, and very few people work on it, and it's not clear if it succeeds.

260
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,480
So first of all, you keep throwing a lot of really interesting ideas, and I have to pick which

261
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:24,800
ones we go with. But first of all, you use the term information processing, just information

262
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:32,640
processing, as if it's the mere, it's the muck of existence, as if it's the epitome

263
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,920
that the entirety of the universe might be information processing, that consciousness

264
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,440
and intelligence might be information processing. So that maybe you can comment on if the advanced

265
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,160
information processing is a limiting kind of round of ideas. And then the other one is what

266
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,800
do you mean by the philosophical project? So I suspect that general intelligence is the result

267
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,560
of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model. It's not

268
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,080
necessarily goal directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this. But

269
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,000
it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns,

270
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,800
and be able to predict the next set of patterns to make sense of things. And some problems are

271
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,600
very general. Usually intelligence serves control. So you make these models for a particular purpose

272
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,200
of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results. But the intelligence itself

273
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,520
is in the sense instrumental to something. But by itself, it's just the ability to make models.

274
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,080
And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes them needs to understand

275
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,800
what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child, for instance,

276
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,400
you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting different things.

277
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,600
So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you have

278
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,760
complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself to reverse engineer yourself

279
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,640
to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself

280
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,760
in relationship to your environment. And this process, if this project, if you reverse engineer

281
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,240
yourself in your relationship to reality in the nature of a universe that can contain you,

282
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,280
if you go all the way, this is basically the project of AI, or you could say the project of AI

283
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,640
is a very important component in it. The true Turing test in a way is, you ask a system,

284
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,720
what is intelligence? If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works,

285
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,640
then you should assign it the property of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test

286
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,200
that Turing was administering in a way, I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't

287
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,760
express it yet in the original 1950 paper, is that he was trying to find out whether he was

288
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,680
generally intelligent. Because in order to take this test, the rub is, of course, you need to

289
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,920
be able to understand what the system is saying. And we don't yet know if we can build an AI.

290
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,880
We don't yet know if we are generally intelligent. Basically, you win the Turing test by building

291
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,120
an AI. Yes. So in a sense, hidden within the Turing test is a kind of recursive test.

292
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,080
Yes, it's a test on us. The Turing test is basically a test of the conjecture whether

293
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,520
people are intelligent enough to understand themselves. Okay. But you also mentioned a

294
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,320
little bit of a self-awareness. And then the project of AI, do you think this kind of emergent

295
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,280
self-awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence? So as opposed to

296
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:37,600
goal-oriented, as you said, kind of puzzle-solving is coming to grips with the idea that you're an

297
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,240
agent in the world. And I find that many highly intelligent people are not very self-aware,

298
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,840
right? So self-awareness and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be

299
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,120
self-aware if you have good priors especially, without being especially intelligent. So you

300
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,680
don't need to be very good at solving puzzles if the system that you are already implements the

301
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:05,440
solution. But I do find intelligence. So you kind of mentioned children, right? Is that the

302
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:13,120
fundamental project of AI is to create the learning system that's able to exist in the world?

303
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,800
So you kind of drew a difference in self-awareness and intelligence. And yet you said that the

304
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,960
self-awareness seems to be important for children. So I call this ability to make sense of the world

305
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,360
and your own place and so to make you able to understand what you're doing in this world

306
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,000
sentience. And I would distinguish sentience from intelligence because sentience is

307
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,760
possessing certain classes of models. And intelligence is a way to get to these models

308
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:53,040
if you don't already have them. I see. So can you maybe pause a bit and try to answer the question

309
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,880
that we just said we may not be able to answer and might be a recursive meta question of what is

310
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,240
intelligence? I think that intelligence is the ability to make models. So models. I think it's

311
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:16,400
useful as examples. Very popular now. Neural networks form representations of large-scale

312
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,960
data set. They form models of those data sets. When you say models and look at today's neural

313
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,320
networks, what are the difference of how you're thinking about what is intelligent in saying

314
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,560
that intelligence is the process of making models? Two aspects to this question. One is

315
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,880
the representation as the representation adequate for the domain that we want to represent.

316
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,040
And the other one is the type of the model that you arrive at adequate. So basically,

317
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:52,560
are you modeling the correct domain? And I think in both of these cases, modern AI is lacking still.

318
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,120
And I think that I'm not saying anything new here. I'm not criticizing the field. Most of the

319
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,760
people that design our paradigms are aware of that. And so one aspect that we are missing is

320
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,720
unified learning. When we learn, we at some point discover that everything that we sense

321
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,000
is part of the same object, which means we learn it all into one model. And we call this model

322
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,880
the universe. So the experience of the world that we are embedded on is not a secret direct

323
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,440
wire to physical reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that we can never experience

324
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,560
or get access to. But it has these properties that it can create certain patterns that our

325
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,720
systemic interface to the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship

326
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,480
between the patterns that we discover is what we call the physical universe.

327
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,840
So at some point in our development as a nervous system, we discover that everything that we relate

328
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,160
to in the world can be mapped to a region in the same three dimensional space by and large.

329
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,720
We now know in physics that this is not quite true. The world is not actually three dimensional,

330
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,320
but the world that we are entangled with at the level which we are entangled with

331
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,920
is largely a flat three dimensional space. And so this is the model that our brain is

332
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,360
intuitively making. And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition of res extensor

333
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,200
of this material world, this material domain. It's one of the mental domains, but it's just

334
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,920
the class of all models that relate to this environment, this three dimensional physics

335
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,760
engine in which we are embedded. Physics engine ocean we're embedded. I love that.

336
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:32,560
Just slowly pause. So the quantum graph, I think you called, which is the real world,

337
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,560
which you can never get access to, there's a bunch of questions I want to sort of

338
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,320
disentangle that, but maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at,

339
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,680
can you just describe the basics? Can you talk about what is dualism? What is idealism?

340
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,320
What is materialism? What is functionalism? And what connects with you most in terms of,

341
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,800
because he just mentioned, there's a reality we don't have access to. Okay. What does that even

342
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,440
mean? And why don't we get access to it? Are we part of that reality? Why can't we access it?

343
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,360
So the particular trajectory that mostly exists in the West is the result of our indoctrination

344
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,600
by a cult for 2000 years. A cult, which one? The Catholic cult mostly. And for better or worse,

345
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,040
it has created or defined many of the modes of interaction that we have that has created this

346
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:30,000
society, but it has also in some sense scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists,

347
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,600
if you would translate the mythology of the Catholic Church into the modern world is that

348
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,480
the world in which you and me interact is something like a multiplayer role-playing

349
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,960
adventure. And the money and the objects that we have in this world, this is all not real.

350
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,960
Or Eastern philosophers would say it's my eye. It's just stuff that appears to be meaningful. And

351
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,280
this embedding in this meaning, if you believe in it, is samsara. It's basically the identification

352
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:06,080
with the needs of the mundane secular everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced

353
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,760
the notion of higher meaning, the sacred. And this existed before, but eventually the natural

354
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,240
shape of God is the platonic form of the civilization that you are part of. It's basically

355
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,840
the super-organism that is formed by the individuals as an intentional agent. And basically,

356
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,920
the Catholics used a relatively crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and

357
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:34,240
get the software synchronized to make them walk on lockstep, to basically get this God online

358
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,640
and to make it efficient and effective. And I think God technically is just a self that spends

359
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,320
multiple brains as opposed to your and myself, which mostly exists just on one brain. And so,

360
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,040
in some sense, you can construct a self functionally as a function that is implemented by brains

361
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,040
that exists across brains. And this is a God with a small g.

362
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,720
That's one of the, if you've all Harari kind of talking about,

363
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,560
this is one of the nice features of our brains, it seems to that we can all download the same

364
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,760
piece of software, like God in this case, and kind of share it.

365
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,440
Yeah. So basically, you give everybody a spec and the mathematical constraints

366
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,640
that are intrinsic to information processing, make sure that given the same spec, you come

367
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,440
up with a compatible structure. Okay. So that's, there's the space of ideas that we all share.

368
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,600
And we think that's kind of the mind. But that's separate from the idea is from Christianity for

369
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,200
from religion is that there's a separate thing between the mind.

370
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,640
There is a real world. And this real world is the world in which God exists. God is the quarter

371
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,280
of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game.

372
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,280
And that's dualism, you would say. But the dualist aspect is because the mental realm

373
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,280
is exists in a different implementation than a physical realm. And the mental realm is real.

374
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,520
And a lot of people have this intuition that there is this real room in which you and me

375
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,840
talk and speak right now, then comes a layer of physics and abstract rules and so on. And then

376
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,800
comes another real room where our souls are. And our two form isn't a thing that gives us

377
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,200
phenomenal experience. And this is of course, a very confused notion that you would get.

378
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,880
And it's basically is the result of connecting materialism and idealism in the wrong way.

379
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,040
So okay, I apologize, but I think it's really helpful if we just try to define

380
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,040
terms. What is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism for people who don't know?

381
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,520
So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances,

382
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,600
a mental substance and a physical substance. And they interact by different rules. And the

383
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,600
physical world is basically causally closed and is built on a low-level causal structure. So

384
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,600
they're basically a bottom level that is causally closed that's entirely mechanical.

385
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
And mechanical in the widest sense. So it's computational. There's basically a physical

386
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,280
world in which information flows around. And physics describes the laws of how information

387
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,680
flows around in this world. Would you compare it to like a computer where you have a hardware

388
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,040
and software? The computer is a generalization of information flowing around basically. But

389
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,360
during this cover that there is the universal principle, you can define this universal machine

390
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,200
that is able to perform all the computations. So all these machines have the same power.

391
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,960
This means that you can always define a translation between them as long as they

392
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,320
have unlimited memory to be able to perform each other's computations.

393
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,880
So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware

394
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,360
and idealism is this whole world is just the software?

395
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,000
Not quite. I think that most idealists don't have a notion of software yet,

396
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,760
because software also comes down to information processing. So what you notice is the only thing

397
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,080
that is real to you and me is this experiential world in which things matter, in which things

398
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,240
have taste, in which things have color, phenomenal content, and so on. And you realize that.

399
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,240
You are bringing up consciousness, okay. And this is distinct from the physical world,

400
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,760
in which things have values only in an abstract sense. And you only look at cold patterns

401
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,120
moving around. So how does anything feel like something? And this connection between the two

402
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,280
things is very puzzling to a lot of people, of course, too many philosophers. So idealism

403
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,760
starts out with the notion that mind is primary, materialism thinks that matter is primary.

404
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,040
And so for the idealist, the material patterns that we see playing out are part of the dream

405
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,520
that the mind is dreaming. And we exist in a mind on a higher plane of existence, if you want.

406
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,160
And for the materialist, there is only this material thing, and that generates some models,

407
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,680
and we are the result of these models. And in some sense, I don't think that we should

408
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,880
understand, if you understand it properly, materialism and idealism is a dichotomy,

409
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,720
but there's two different aspects of the same thing. So the weird thing is,

410
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,200
we don't exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story that the brain tells itself.

411
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:16,560
Okay. Let me, my information processing, take that in. We don't exist in the physical world,

412
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,280
we exist in the narrative. Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A New Yorker cannot feel

413
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,120
anything. They're physical things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything.

414
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,360
But it would be very useful for the brain or for the organism to know what it would be like

415
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,880
to be a person and to feel something. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person,

416
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,360
that it uses to model the interactions of the person. It's the best model of what that

417
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,880
brain, this organism, thinks it is in relationship to its environment.

418
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,800
So it creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain is continuously

419
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,000
writing and updating. But you also kind of said that, you said that we kind of exist in that,

420
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,920
that story. Yes. That story. What is real in any of this? So like,

421
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,040
there's a, again, these terms are, you kind of said there's a quantum graph. I mean, what is,

422
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,120
what is this whole thing running on then? Is the story, and is it completely fundamentally

423
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:20,880
impossible to get access to it? Because isn't the story supposed to, isn't the brain in something,

424
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,240
in existing in some kind of context? So what we can identify as computer scientists, we can

425
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,960
engineer systems and test our theories this way that may have the necessary insufficient properties

426
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,240
to produce the phenomena that we are observing, which is there is a self in a virtual world

427
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,480
that is generated in somebody's neocortex that is contained in the skull of this primate here.

428
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,600
And when I point at this, this indexicality is, of course, wrong. But I do create something

429
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,520
that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina that allow you to interpret what I'm saying,

430
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,960
but we both know that the world that you and me are seeing is not the real physical world.

431
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,680
What we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your brain to explain the patterns on your

432
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,600
retina. How close is it to the real world? That's kind of the question. When you have people like

433
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,200
Donald Hoffman that say that you're really far away, the thing we're seeing, you and I now,

434
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,040
that interface we have is very far away from anything. We don't even have anything close to

435
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,080
the sense of what the real world is. Or is it a very surface piece of architecture?

436
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,120
Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot tractor, right? This famous thing that Bernard Mandelbrot

437
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,480
discovered. If you see an overall shape in there, right? But you know that if you truly

438
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,360
understand it, you know it's two lines of code. It's basically in a series that is being tested

439
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,080
for complex numbers in the complex number plane for every point. And for those where

440
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:03,280
the series is diverging, you paint this black and where it's converging, you don't. And you get the

441
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:12,160
intermediate colors by taking how far as it diverges. This gives you this shape of this fractal.

442
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,240
But imagine you live inside of this fractal and you don't have access to where you are in the

443
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,640
fractal or you have not discovered the generator function even. So what you see is all I can see

444
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,240
right now is a spiral. And this spiral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate

445
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,920
model of reality? Yes, it is. It is an adequate description. You know that there is actually

446
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,440
no spiral in the Mandelbrot fractal. It only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting

447
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,800
things as a two-dimensional space and then defines certain regularities in there at a certain scale

448
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,560
that it currently observes. Because if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear and turn out to be

449
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,800
something different at a different resolution. So at this level, you have the spiral and then

450
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,320
you discover the spiral moves to the right and at some point, it disappears. So you have a

451
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:59,040
singularity. At this point, your model is no longer valid. You cannot predict what happens

452
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,840
beyond the singularity. But you can observe again and you will see it hit another spiral

453
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,920
and at this point, it disappeared. So we now have a second order law. And if you make

454
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,560
30 layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world that is similar to the one that we

455
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,200
come up with when we describe the reality around us. It's reasonably predictive. It does not cut

456
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,160
to the core of it. It does not explain how it's being generated, how it actually works. But it's

457
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,320
relatively good to explain the universe that we are entangled with. But you don't think the tools

458
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:32,560
of computer science, the tools of physics could step outside, see the whole drawing and get it

459
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,400
the basic mechanism of how the pattern, the spirals are generated. Imagine you would find

460
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,560
yourself embedded into a Mandelbrot fractal and you try to figure out what works and you have

461
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,360
somehow a Turing machine with enough memory to think. And as a result, you come to this idea,

462
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,840
it must be some kind of automaton. And maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata until

463
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,880
you get to the one that produces your reality. So you can identify necessary and sufficient

464
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,520
condition. For instance, we discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages.

465
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,680
And then we see that most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered

466
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,560
are in some sense describing the same fractals. This is what category theory is obsessed about,

467
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,400
that you can map these different domains to each other. So there are not that many fractals.

468
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,920
Some of these have interesting structure and symmetry breaks. So you can discover what region

469
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,880
of this global fractal you might be embedded in from first principles. But the only way you

470
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,520
can get there is from first principles. So basically, your understanding of the universe has to start

471
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,240
with automata and the number theory and then spaces and so on. Yeah, I think like Stephen

472
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,320
Wolfram still dreams that he's that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules of the cellular

473
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:52,080
automata or the generalization of which is behind our universe. You've said on this topic,

474
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,840
you said in a recent conversation that quote, some people think that a simulation can't be

475
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,880
conscious and only a physical system can. But they got it completely backward. A physical system

476
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,800
cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property,

477
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:16,240
the simulated self. Just like you said, the mind is kind of the we call it story narrative.

478
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,200
There's a simulation. So our mind is essentially a simulation?

479
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,160
Usually, I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically a principles that produce

480
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,720
the simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain. And the mind is

481
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,200
creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that is on the other

482
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,120
side of attention and is embedded in this world. Why is that important, that idea of a self?

483
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:49,440
Why is that important feature in the simulation? It's basically a result of the purpose that

484
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,320
the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We are side effects

485
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:01,440
of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is the relationship

486
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,120
of an organism to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of other organisms.

487
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,120
And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to. These regulation

488
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:17,200
targets start with priors. They're basically like unconditional reflexes that we are more or

489
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,920
less born with. And then we can reverse engineer them to make them more consistent. And then we

490
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,960
get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with it.

491
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,040
And so these priors that you commit to are largely target values that our needs should

492
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,280
approach, set points. And this deviation to the set point creates some urge, some tension.

493
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,000
And we find ourselves living inside of feedback loops, right? The consciousness emerges over

494
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,360
dimensions of disagreements with the universe. Things where you care, things are not the way

495
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,240
there should be, but you need to regulate. And so in some sense, the sense itself is the result

496
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,640
of all the identifications that you're having. And identification is a regulation target that

497
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,480
you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about. Do you think it's important?

498
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,720
And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments of these identifications,

499
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,440
you get free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them,

500
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,080
you're completely free and you can enter Nirvana because you're done.

501
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,880
And actually, this is a good time to pause and say thank you to a friend of mine, Gustav

502
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,320
Sodastrom, who introduced me to your work. I want to give him a shout out. He's a brilliant guy.

503
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,560
And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing. And Gustav is a good representative

504
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,800
of that. You are as well. So I'm glad. First of all, I'm glad the internet exists,

505
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,200
the YouTube exists, where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study your writing

506
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,680
and think about, you know, that's amazing. Okay, but you've kind of described instead of this

507
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,720
emergent phenomenon of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard

508
00:46:52,720 --> 00:47:02,960
problem of consciousness? Can you just linger on it? Like, why does it still feel like I understand

509
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:09,040
you're kind of the self as an important part of the simulation? But why does the simulation feel

510
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,880
like something? So if you look at a book by, say, George R. R. Martin, where the characters

511
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,000
have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below the

512
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,600
hill and they're done in it and they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive

513
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,920
and feel empowered and all these things, why do they have these emotions? It's because it's

514
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,920
written into the story, right? And it's written into the story because it's an adequate model

515
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,120
of the person that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing has happened too

516
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,960
for us. So it's basically a story that our brain is writing, it's not written in words,

517
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,600
it's written in perceptual content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what

518
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,920
the person would feel if it existed. So it's a virtual person. And you and me happen to be

519
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,800
this virtual person. So this virtual person gets access to the language center and talks about

520
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,520
the sky being blue. And this is us. But hold on a second, do I exist in your simulation?

521
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:13,760
You do exist in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less accessible

522
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,200
for me that you have and so on. And my model might not be completely adequate. There are also

523
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,760
things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense, both you and

524
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:32,160
me are some puppets, two puppets that enact this play in my mind. And I identify with one of them

525
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,240
because I can control one of the puppet directly. And with the other one, I can create things in

526
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,880
between. So for instance, we can go on an interaction that even leads to a coupling to a feedback

527
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,560
loop so we can sync things together in a certain way or feel things together. But this coupling is

528
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,880
itself not a physical phenomenon. It's entirely a software phenomenon. It's the result of two

529
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,920
different implementations interacting with each other. So that's interesting. So I used to just

530
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,880
like the way you think about it is the entirety of existence, the simulation and where kind of

531
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:14,160
each mind is a little sub simulation that like, why don't you, why doesn't your mind have access

532
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:22,640
to my mind's full state? Like for the same reason that my mind hasn't had access to its own full

533
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:30,000
state. So what I mean, there is no trick involved. So basically, when I say know something about

534
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,480
myself, it's because I made a model. Yes, part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other

535
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:40,960
parts of your brain are doing. Yes. But there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world

536
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,360
in the physical sense, that there's repeatable experiments and so on. Yeah. How does that

537
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,520
fit into our silly, the center of the ape's simulation of the world? So why is it so repeat

538
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,640
why is everything so repeatable? And not everything. There's a lot of fundamental physics

539
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:04,080
experiments that are repeatable for a long time all over the place and so on. The laws of physics.

540
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:09,440
How does that fit in? It seems that the parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long

541
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:17,120
lived. So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something,

542
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,960
you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics.

543
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,080
So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result of usually of some

544
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,800
control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors. And the things that are

545
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,280
not stable that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on, they tend to get

546
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:44,080
weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that says stains complexity,

547
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,680
which is required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe

548
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,720
that is very tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of interesting

549
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,280
symmetries and also symmetry breaks that allow to the creation of structure.

550
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,040
But they exist where? So there's such an interesting idea that our mind is simulation

551
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:12,960
that's constructing the narrative. My question is just to try to understand how that fits

552
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,920
with the entirety of the universe. You're saying that there's a region of this universe

553
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,160
that allows enough complexity to create creatures like us. But what's the connection between

554
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:30,400
the brain, the mind, and the broader universe? Which comes first? Which is more fundamental?

555
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,520
Is the mind the starting point, the universe is emergent? Is the universe the starting point,

556
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,600
the minds are emergent? I think quite clearly the latter. That's at least a much easier explanation

557
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,720
because it allows us to make causal models. And I don't see any way to construct an inverse

558
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,320
causality. So what happens when you die to your mind's simulation?

559
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,600
My implementation ceases. So basically the thing that implements myself will no longer be present,

560
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,680
which means if I am not implemented on the minds of other people, the thing that I identify with,

561
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,480
the weird thing is I don't actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct.

562
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,560
If I was the Dalai Lama, he identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama

563
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:21,200
gets reborn not because he's confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being.

564
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,120
He runs on a human being. He's basically a governmental software that is instantiated

565
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,280
in every new generation in you. So his advice is to pick someone who does this in the next

566
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:37,040
generation. So if you identify this, you are no longer a human and you don't die in the sense

567
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,240
that what dies is only the body of the human that you run on. To kill the Dalai Lama, you would

568
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,840
have to kill his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small

569
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,760
part like this, most of us. So for instance, if you have children, you realize something lives on

570
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,040
in them, or if you spark an idea in the world, something lives on, or if you identify with

571
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,680
a society around you, because you are part that. You're not just this human being.

572
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:07,920
Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama. In a sense that you, Joshua Bach,

573
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,440
is just a collection of ideas. So you have this operating system on which a bunch of ideas live

574
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,120
and interact. And then once you die, some of them jump off the ship.

575
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,440
You put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction.

576
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,440
It's not physically real. Identity is not a physical concept. It's basically a representation

577
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:37,280
of different objects on the same world line. But identity lives and dies. Are you attached?

578
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:43,920
What's the fundamental thing? Is it the ideas that come together to form identity? Or is

579
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,080
each individual identity actually a fundamental thing? It's a representation that you can get

580
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,200
agency over if you care. So basically, you can choose what you identify with if you want to.

581
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:04,480
No, but it just seems, if the mind is not real, that the birth and death is not a crucial part

582
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:16,080
of it. Well, maybe I'm silly. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism, but it seems

583
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:23,120
that the physical being a physical object in this world is an important aspect of birth and

584
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,120
death. It feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die.

585
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,400
The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the

586
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,760
real world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to

587
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,480
model reality with oscillators. So colors and sound in some sense have octaves.

588
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,200
And it's because they are represented probably with oscillators. So that's why colors form a

589
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,800
circle of use. And colors have harmonics, sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing

590
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:01,200
oscillators in the brain. So the world that we subjectively interact with is fundamentally

591
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,520
the result of the representation mechanisms in our brain. They are mathematically, to some

592
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,680
degree universal. There are certain regularities that you can discover in the patterns and not

593
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,240
others. But the patterns that we get, this is not the real world. The world that we interact with

594
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,520
is always made of too many parts to count. So when you look at this table and so on,

595
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,800
it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count them. So you only look at

596
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:31,360
the aggregate dynamics at limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely many particles,

597
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,520
what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get. So geometry that we are

598
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,800
interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that work in the limit that you

599
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,400
get by building an infinite series that converges. For those parts where it converges, it's geometry.

600
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
For those parts where it doesn't converge, it's chaos.

601
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:56,080
Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the consciousness that's emergent in our narrative.

602
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,080
So the consciousness gives it color, gives it feeling, gives it flavor.

603
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:06,800
So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has to all the

604
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,800
other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color

605
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,720
is given by those aspects of the representation or this experiential color where you care about,

606
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,960
where you have identifications, where something means something, where you are the inside of a

607
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,400
feedback loop and the dimensions of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system

608
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,880
that we emerge over. The meaning of the relations, the graph. Can you elaborate that a little bit?

609
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:41,840
Maybe you can even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness to be more

610
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:49,440
systematic? How do you think about consciousness? I think that consciousness is largely a model

611
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,200
of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism that has evolved for a certain type of learning.

612
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,520
At the moment, our machine learning systems largely work by building chains of weighted

613
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:08,960
sums of real numbers with some nonlinearity. And you will learn by piping an error signal

614
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,840
through these different chain layers and adjusting the weights in these weighted sums.

615
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:21,120
And you can approximate most polynomials with this if you have enough training data.

616
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,720
But the price is you need to change a lot of these weights. Basically, the error is piped

617
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,160
backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures in the network. And everything

618
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,160
else evens out statistically. And only at these junctures, this is where you had the actual error

619
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,960
in the network, you make the change there. This is a very slow process. And our brains don't have

620
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,200
enough time for that because we don't get old enough to play go the way that our machines

621
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,400
learn to play go. So instead, what we do is an attention-based learning. We pinpoint the probable

622
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:56,720
region in the network where we can make an improvement. And then we store this binding

623
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,520
state together with the expected outcome in a protocol. And this ability to make indexed

624
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,400
memories for the purpose of learning to revisit these commitments later, this requires a memory

625
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,600
of the contents of our attention. Another aspect is when I construct my reality and make mistakes.

626
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,880
So I see things that turn out to be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able

627
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:24,640
to point out which features of my perception gave rise to the present construction of reality.

628
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,480
So the system needs to pay attention to the features that are currently in its focus.

629
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,280
And it also needs to pay attention to whether it pays attention itself, in part because the

630
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,760
attentional system gets trained for the same mechanism, so it's reflexive, but also in part

631
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,640
because your attention lapses if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. So it's the

632
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,160
thing that I'm currently seeing just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream

633
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,280
or am I still paying attention to my percept? So you have to periodically go back and see whether

634
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,520
you're still paying attention. And if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the

635
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,160
system becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention

636
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,160
itself and makes attention, the object of its attention, I think this is the loop over which

637
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:14,800
we wake up. So there's this, so there's this attentional mechanism that's somehow self-referential

638
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:21,120
that's fundamental to what consciousness is. So just ask you a question, I don't know how much

639
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,840
you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. They use attentional

640
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:34,480
mechanism, they use something called transformers to learn patterns and sentences by allowing

641
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,160
them at work to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence that each individual. So

642
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:47,120
like parametrize and make it learnable the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window

643
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:54,960
into the sentence. Do you think that's like a little step towards that eventually would

644
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,600
take us to the intentional mechanisms from which consciousness can emerge?

645
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,920
Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated

646
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,440
language translation, there was an example that I found particularly funny, where somebody tried

647
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,080
to translate a text from English into German and it was a bet broke the window. And the

648
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:25,280
translation in German was in a Fliedermaus zerbracht das Fenster mit einem baseball Schläger.

649
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,960
So to translate back into English a bet, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball

650
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:36,880
bet. And it seemed to be the most similar to this program because it somehow maximized

651
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:43,280
the possibility of translating the concept bet into German in the same sentence. And this is

652
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,320
some mistake that the transformer model is not doing because it's tracking identity. And the

653
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,480
attentional mechanism in the transformer model is basically putting its finger on individual

654
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:59,360
concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up later in the text and tracks basically the

655
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,720
individuals through the text. And this is why the system can learn things that other systems

656
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,960
couldn't before it, which makes it, for instance, possible to write a text where it talks about

657
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,240
the scientist, then the scientist has a name and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story

658
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,040
about that thing. What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this. So this meaning falls apart

659
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,160
at some point, it loses track of this context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says

660
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,840
has to refer to the same universe. And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention

661
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,480
in the transformer model does not go beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an

662
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,000
important part of attention, but it's a different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it's not

663
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,240
the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness that we have. Okay, just to link on, what do you

664
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:49,920
mean by identity in the context of language? So when you talk about language, you have different

665
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,960
words that can refer to the same concept. Got it. And in the sense that... So space of concepts.

666
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:01,360
So yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or in an inexical sense that you say

667
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,200
this word does not only refer to this class of objects, but it refers to a definite object,

668
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:13,360
to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story and is only referred by

669
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:19,440
different ways in the language. So the language is basically a projection from a conceptual

670
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,520
representation from a scene that is evolving into a discrete string of symbols. And what

671
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:31,280
the transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection mechanism that other models

672
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:37,040
couldn't learn. So have you ever seen an artificial intelligence or any kind of construction idea

673
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:42,320
that allows for unlike neural networks or perhaps within neural networks that's able to form

674
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:49,840
something where the space of concepts continues to be integrated? So what you're describing,

675
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:56,000
building a knowledge base, building this consistent, larger and larger sets of ideas

676
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,680
that would then allow for deeper understanding? Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything

677
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:07,440
from language, from basically a logical grammatical construct. And I think to some degree,

678
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,480
this was also what Minsky believed. So that's why he focused so much on common sense reasoning

679
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:18,880
and so on. And a project that was inspired by him was Psyche. That was basically-

680
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:19,680
That's still going on.

681
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,680
Yes. Of course, ideas don't die, only people die.

682
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,200
And that's true, but-

683
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,040
And Psyche is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to

684
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,520
converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve,

685
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,160
and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations,

686
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:45,040
was the notion of images. So images play an important role in tractatus, the tractatus

687
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,440
in attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language, to design a logical

688
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,800
language in which you can do actual philosophy that Wittgenhaft for doing this. And the difficulty

689
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:01,280
was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually, I think he decided that he was not able to solve

690
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:07,200
it. And I think this preempted the failure of the logitist program in AI. And the solution,

691
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,760
as we see it today, is we need more general function approximation. There are functions,

692
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,040
geometric functions, that we learn to approximate that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed

693
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,840
in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory and so

694
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:28,640
on and to learn in algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry. But to equate

695
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:34,720
language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it. So functional, you kind of just

696
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:39,920
said that neural networks are sort of the approach that neural networks takes is actually more general

697
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:48,560
than what can be expressed through language. Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed

698
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,320
through language at the data rates at which we process grammatical language?

699
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:56,960
Okay, so you don't think languages, so you disagree with Wittgenstein,

700
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:03,040
that language is not fundamental to? I agree with Wittgenstein. I just agree with the late Wittgenstein.

701
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:09,600
And I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the tractatus itself

702
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:13,120
is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was written in the 20th century.

703
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,560
But language is not fundamental to cognition and intelligence and consciousness.

704
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:23,520
So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we're using is a

705
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,960
particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages in

706
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,040
which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly

707
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:40,480
different. They're more general expressions of functions. And I think the general nature of a

708
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:46,880
model is you have a bunch of parameters. These have a range. These are the variances of the world.

709
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:51,200
And you have relationships between them, which are constraints, which say if certain parameters

710
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:58,080
have these values, then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very

711
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,800
early insight in computer science. And I think some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann

712
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,280
machine. And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that while it has a measure of whether it's

713
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,120
good, it's basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the

714
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:16,640
constraints where the constraints don't quite match. It's very difficult to, despite having this

715
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,720
global measure, to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially few elements,

716
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,880
parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.

717
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,880
And so the solution that Hinton and Zanovsky found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine,

718
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,760
which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine and only has

719
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,960
basically input and output layer. But this limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machine. So now

720
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,360
he builds a network of small of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense, you can

721
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,840
see a almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we're using today,

722
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:58,640
even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the Boltzmann machine

723
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:03,120
is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception. And this forces the entire

724
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,960
machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently perceive.

725
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:13,200
And this state is your model of the world. I think it's a very general way of thinking about

726
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:19,920
models. But we have to use a different approach to make it work. And this is, we have to find

727
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,440
different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that trains the

728
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,680
Boltzmann machine and the mechanism that makes the Boltzmann machine settle into its state

729
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,760
are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine itself.

730
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,400
The kind of mechanism that we want to develop, you're saying?

731
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,320
Yes. So there's the direction in which I think our research is going to go,

732
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:46,560
is going to, for instance, what you notice in perception is our perceptual models of the world

733
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:51,520
are not probabilistic, but possibilistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that

734
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,920
are improbable, but possible, right? Perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's

735
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:03,200
possible, if it's coherent. So if you see a tiger coming after, you should be able to see this,

736
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:09,760
even if it's unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the model. So

737
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,600
given the state of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features,

738
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:21,040
how should you change the states of the model to get it to convert with your perception?

739
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:30,560
But the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing is perhaps not

740
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:36,960
as large. I mean, that's perhaps pretty small. The degree of coherence that you

741
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,600
need to achieve depends, of course, how deep your models go. That is, for instance, politics is

742
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,400
very simple when you know very little about game theory and human nature. So the younger you are,

743
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:52,320
the more obvious it is how politics should work, right? Because you get a coherent aesthetic from

744
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,920
relatively few inputs. And the more layers you model, the more layers you model reality,

745
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:05,600
the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints. So the current neural networks are fundamentally

746
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,640
supervised learning system with a feed forward neural network is back propagation to learn.

747
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,360
What's your intuition about what kind of mechanisms might we move towards to improve

748
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:21,920
the learning procedure? I think one big aspect is going to be meta learning and architecture

749
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,160
search starts in this direction. In some sense, the first wave of AI classical AI work by identifying

750
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:32,240
a problem and the possible solution and implementing the solution right program that plays chess.

751
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,920
And right now we are in the second wave of AI. So instead of writing the algorithm that

752
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,040
implements the solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches for an algorithm

753
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,760
that implements the solution. So the learning system in some sense is an algorithm that

754
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,320
itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem, like go. Go is too hard to implement

755
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:56,320
it by the solution by hand, but we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution.

756
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,960
Let's move to the third stage, right? The third stage would be meta learning.

757
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,120
Find an algorithm that discovers the learning algorithm for the given domain.

758
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,080
Our brain is probably not a learning system, but a meta learning system.

759
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,840
This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way. If you look at the way our

760
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,240
brain is, for instance, implemented, there is no central control that tells all the neurons how

761
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:24,000
to wire up. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is

762
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,240
a single celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fed.

763
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:36,160
It gets fed if it fires on average at the right time. The right time depends on the

764
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:42,160
context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has.

765
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:48,320
So it basically has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire to get fed.

766
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,240
Or if you see it as a reinforcement learning agent, every neuron is in some sense

767
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:57,040
making a hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to pipe a signal through the universe

768
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:02,000
and tries to get positive feedback for it. The entire thing is set up in such a way that it's

769
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,280
robustly self-organizing into a brain, which means you start out with different neuron types

770
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,960
that have different priors on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward. You put them

771
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,240
into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment, and then you entrain it

772
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,680
in a particular order. As a result, you get a well-organized brain.

773
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:29,520
Okay, so the brain is a meta-learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning agents.

774
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:40,640
I think you said, but just to clarify, there's no centralized government that tells you

775
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:48,400
here's a loss function, here's a loss function, here's a loss function. Who says what's the

776
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:51,760
objective of what's going on? There are also governments which impose loss functions on

777
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,520
different parts of the brain. So we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain

778
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,400
get especially rewarded when you look at faces. If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia,

779
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,240
which basically means the inability to tell people apart by their faces.

780
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,400
And the reason that happens is because it had an evolutionary advantage. So evolution comes

781
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,280
into play here. But it's basically an extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don't think

782
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,400
that people with a prosopagnosia have a perceived defective brain. The brain just has an average

783
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:25,120
attention for faces. So people with prosopagnosia don't look at faces more than they look at cups.

784
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,720
So the level at which they resolve the geometry of faces is not higher than the one for cups.

785
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,560
And people that don't have prosopagnosia look obsessively at faces. For you and me,

786
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,200
it's impossible to move through a crowd without scanning the faces. And as a result,

787
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,200
we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow us to discern mental states of people.

788
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:52,000
So obviously, we don't know 99% of the details of this meta-learning system that's our mind.

789
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But still, we took a leap from something much dumber to that from through the evolutionary

790
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:07,360
process. Can you, first of all, maybe say how big of a leap is that from our brain,

791
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:16,720
from our ape ancestors to multi-cell organisms? And is there something we can think about

792
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,800
as we start to think about how to engineer intelligence? Is there something we can learn

793
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:30,880
from evolution? In some sense, life exists because of the market opportunity of controlled chemical

794
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,720
reactions. We compete with dump chemical reactions and we win in some areas against this dump

795
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,040
combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients where you need to add a little bit

796
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:45,600
of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy. So we all competed combustion?

797
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,160
Yes, in many regions we do. We try very hard because when we are in direct competition,

798
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:56,560
we lose. Because the combustion is going to close the entropy gradients much faster than we can

799
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:04,160
run. So basically, we do this because every cell has a Turing machine built into it.

800
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,440
It's like literally a read-write head on a tape. So everything that's more complicated than a

801
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:18,080
molecule that just is a vortex around the tractors that needs a Turing machine for its

802
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,840
regulation. And then you bind cells together and you get next-level organizational organism where

803
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:30,640
the cells together implement some kind of software. And for me, a very interesting discovery in the

804
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:35,760
last year was the word spirit because I realized that what spirit actually means is an operating

805
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,720
system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented, people needed this word.

806
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,720
But they didn't have robots that they built themselves. Yet the only autonomous robots

807
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:49,280
that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities, and so on. And they all

808
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,240
had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant is an operating system. If you pinch the

809
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:58,960
plant in one area, then this is going to have repercussions throughout the plant. Everything

810
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,600
in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics like in other organisms.

811
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,560
An organism is not a collection of cells. It's a function that tells cells how to behave.

812
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,600
And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing,

813
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,360
like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each

814
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:28,000
cell with each other's cell. So what you're saying is the organism is a function that tells what

815
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:37,200
to do. And the function emerges from the interaction of the cells.

816
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,520
So it's basically a description of what the plant is doing in terms of macro states.

817
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,800
And the micro states, the physical implementation are too many of them to describe them. So the

818
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,320
software that we use to describe what the plant is doing, the spirit of the plant is the software,

819
01:15:54,320 --> 01:16:00,160
the operating system of the plant, right? This is a way in which we, the observers, make sense of

820
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,960
the plant. And the same is true for people. So people have spirits, which is their operating

821
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,680
system in a way, right? And there are aspects of that operating system that relate to how your

822
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,680
body functions and others, how you socially interact, how you interact with yourself and so

823
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:20,160
on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it's a loaded term because it's from a

824
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:26,160
pre-scientific age. But it took the scientific age a long time to rediscover a term that is

825
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:31,040
pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the differences that we still see between the old

826
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,400
word and the new word are translation errors that have been over the centuries.

827
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,760
Can you actually linger on that? Like, why do you say that spirit, just to clarify,

828
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:45,120
because I'm a little bit confused. So the word spirit is a powerful thing. But why did you say

829
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,160
in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a

830
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:55,760
spirit? Or do you mean? I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality

831
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,240
in the US, it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture.

832
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,320
And a culture is in some sense, you could say the spirit of a society that is long game.

833
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:12,720
This thing that becomes self-aware at a level above the individuals where you say,

834
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:17,040
if you don't do the following things, then the grand-grand-grand-grandchildren of our children

835
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,400
will not have nothing to eat. So if you take this long scope where you try to maximize the

836
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:26,320
length of the game that you are playing as a species, you realize that you're part of a

837
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,600
larger thing that you cannot fully control. You probably need to submit to the

838
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,880
ecosphere instead of trying to completely control it. There needs to be a certain level at which

839
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,880
we can exist as a species if you want to endure. And our culture is not sustaining this anymore.

840
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,640
We basically made this bet with the Industrial Revolution that we can control everything.

841
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:52,400
And the modernist societies with basically unfettered growth led to a situation in which

842
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:58,880
we depend on the ability to control the entire planet. And since we are not able to do that,

843
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,240
as it seems, this culture will die. And we realize that it doesn't have a future,

844
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:09,280
right? We called our children generations that it's such a very optimistic thing to do.

845
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:16,320
Yeah, so you have this kind of intuition that our civilization, you said culture,

846
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:22,800
but you really mean the spirit of the civilization, the entirety of the civilization

847
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:30,160
may not exist for long. Can you untangle that? What's your intuition behind that?

848
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:36,320
So you kind of offline mentioned to me that the Industrial Revolution was kind of the moment

849
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:44,240
we agreed to accept the offer, sign on the paper, on the dotted line with the Industrial Revolution,

850
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:49,200
we doomed ourselves. Can you elaborate on that? This is suspicion. I of course don't know how it

851
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:57,840
plays out, but it seems to me that in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over

852
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,800
an entropic abyss without land on the other side, it's relatively clear that your cantilever is at

853
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,320
some point going to break down into this entropic abyss. And you have to pay the bill.

854
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:16,800
Okay, Russia is my first language, and I'm also an idiot. Me too. This is just two apes,

855
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:23,440
instead of playing with the banana trying to have fun by talking. Okay,

856
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:30,320
anthropic what? And what's anthropic? Entropic. Entropic. So entropic in the sense of entropy.

857
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,400
Oh, entropic, guys. Yes. And entropic, what was the other word you used? Abyss.

858
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:41,600
What's that? It's a big quart. Oh, abyss. Abyss, yes. Entropic abyss. So many of the things you

859
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:49,120
say are poetic, it's parting my brain. It's amazing, right? It's mispronounced, which makes

860
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:58,960
you do more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So entropic abyss. Okay, let's rewind then. The

861
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:03,680
industrial revolution, so how does that get us into the entropic abyss?

862
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:10,000
So in some sense, we burned 100 million years worth of trees to get everybody plumbing.

863
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,600
Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number of people. So basically,

864
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:24,000
since zero BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. And this only changed with

865
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,080
the Enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution. And in some sense, the Enlightenment

866
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:35,440
freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the preexisting order gradually.

867
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,080
It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops, so it was not that just one

868
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:46,080
caused the other. It was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically increasing

869
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:53,520
productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the definition of

870
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,880
poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die,

871
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,480
which is in some sense the state that all animals on earth are in.

872
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,320
The definition of poverty is having enough...

873
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,920
So you can have only so many children as you can feed and if you have more, they die.

874
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:14,960
And in our societies, you can basically have as many children as you want and they don't die.

875
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,200
Right. So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to

876
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:26,240
pay a price in terms of we have to insert ourselves in the lower source of dread if we have too many.

877
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:32,320
So basically everybody in the under, middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of

878
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:38,000
children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to their individual families

879
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,120
because children, especially in the US, super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of

880
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,440
this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you are super poor, it doesn't

881
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,920
matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change and these children are

882
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:58,400
largely not going to die of hunger. So how does this lead to self-destruction? So there's a lot of

883
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:03,040
unpleasant properties about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to let

884
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:12,080
our children survive even if they have diseases. Like I would have died before my mid-20s without

885
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,560
modern medicine and most of my friends would have as well. And so many of us wouldn't live

886
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:24,160
without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialized society. We get our protein

887
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:30,240
largely by sub-doing the entirety of nature. Imagine there would be some very clever microbe

888
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:36,880
that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into

889
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,720
a thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that, for instance,

890
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:47,520
brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them

891
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,480
and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable

892
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:56,560
that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment

893
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:02,240
changes. Yeah, but some part of that organism, the one that's actually doing all the using of the

894
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:08,880
that there'll still be somebody thriving. So it relates back to this original question.

895
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,160
I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every

896
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:21,520
complex system has to have some complex regulation if it depends on feedback loops. And so for

897
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,880
instance, it's likely that we should describe a certain degree of intelligence to plants.

898
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,160
The problem is that plants don't have a nervous system. So they don't have a way to telegraph

899
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:37,840
messages over large distances almost instantly in the plant. And instead, they will rely on

900
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,440
chemicals between adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal

901
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:49,920
processing with the rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is

902
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:55,920
intelligent, it's not going to be intelligent at similar timescales. The time scale is different.

903
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:02,560
So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent, but we're the most intelligent

904
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,160
and the spatial scale and our time scale. So basically, if you would zoom out very far,

905
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:13,520
we might discover that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet that existed for

906
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:18,480
thousands of years in a almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these ecosystems

907
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:23,200
actively related their environment. So basically, change the course of the evolution vision,

908
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,840
this ecosystem to make it more efficient and less brittle.

909
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:30,640
So it's possible something like plants is actually a set of living organisms,

910
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,200
an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating a different time scale and are far

911
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,760
superior in intelligence to human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will

912
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:45,520
still be there and they'll be there. Yeah, there's an evolutionary adaptation playing a

913
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,080
role at all of these levels. For instance, if mice don't get enough food and get stressed,

914
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,200
the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is

915
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:00,480
because in a natural environment, the mice have probably hidden a drought or something else.

916
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:05,840
And if they're overgrays, then all the things that sustain them might go extinct. And there will be

917
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,560
no mice a few generations from now. So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations

918
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,000
from now, basically the mice scale back. And a similar thing happens with the predators of mice.

919
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,240
They should make sure that the mice don't completely go extinct. So in some sense,

920
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:25,520
if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply.

921
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:30,320
And maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains than antelopes is not so much

922
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:36,320
because it's so hard to catch an antelope as opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions

923
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,560
need to make complex models of their environment, more complex than the antelopes.

924
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,520
So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may

925
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,440
not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on earth,

926
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:54,080
makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.

927
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,440
Yes, maybe we adjust Gaia's ploy to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.

928
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:00,080
Yeah, this is just a nice, we tried it out.

929
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:05,120
The big stain on evolution is not as it was trees. First evolved trees before they could

930
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,640
be digested again, right? There were no insects that could break all of them apart.

931
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:15,040
Cellulose is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees

932
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:20,480
fell into swamps and all this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms.

933
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,520
And we are the species that is destined to take care of that.

934
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,400
So this is kind of...

935
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,840
To get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the earth is already greening.

936
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,280
So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes

937
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:39,200
that they're not compatible with right now, this is going to be awesome again.

938
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,000
And there won't be even a memory of us little apes.

939
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,240
I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first general intelligent species in

940
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,720
this sense. We are the first species with an industrial society because we will leave more

941
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:55,920
phones than bones in the stratosphere. Well, see, phones than bones, I like it.

942
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:02,560
But then let me push back. You've kind of suggested that we have a very narrow definition of

943
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:09,520
I mean, why aren't trees more general, a higher level of general intelligence?

944
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,120
If trees were intelligent, then they would be at different time scales,

945
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,040
which means within a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as

946
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:22,240
complex as the ones that we make in 10 years. But maybe the trees are the ones that made the

947
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:30,480
phones, right? You could say the entirety of life did it. The first cell never died.

948
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:34,720
The first cell only split, right? And every divided. And every cell in our body is still

949
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,360
an instance of the first cell that split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell

950
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:44,480
on this planet as far as we know. And so the cell is not just a building block of life.

951
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,000
It's a hypoorganism, right? And we are part of this hypoorganism.

952
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:56,160
So nevertheless, this hyperorganism, no, this little particular branch of it,

953
01:27:56,160 --> 01:28:01,200
which is us humans, because of the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of

954
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:07,040
technology might somehow destroy ourselves. So what do you think is the most likely

955
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,320
way we might destroy ourselves? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people,

956
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:17,920
as we've talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent

957
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:25,120
artificial intelligence destroying us. Some people worry about nuclear weapons and weapons of war

958
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,680
in general. What do you think? If you had to, if you were a betting man, what would you bet on in

959
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:34,880
terms of self-destruction? And they would be higher than 50, would it be higher than 50 percent?

960
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:41,280
So it's very likely that nothing that we bet on matters after we win our bets. So I don't think

961
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:46,480
that bets are literally the right way to go about this. I mean, once you're dead, you won't be there

962
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:52,640
to collect the weighings. So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that

963
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:57,200
our present civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably

964
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,480
fewer people on the planet than there are today. And even if not, then still most of people that

965
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,280
are alive today will not have offspring in 100 years from now because of the geographic changes

966
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:12,960
and so on and the changes in the food supply. It's quite likely that many areas of the planet

967
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,920
will only be livable with a close cooling chain in 100 years from now. So many of the areas around

968
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:25,440
the equator and in sub-tropical climates that are now quite pleasant to live in will stop to be

969
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:31,200
inhabitable without air conditioning. So you honestly, wow, cooling chain, close-knit cooling

970
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:38,080
chain communities. So you think you have a strong worry about the effects of global warming?

971
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:42,560
By itself, it's not the big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three

972
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,440
months in the summer in which you cannot be outside. And so you have a close cooling chain,

973
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:51,200
you have air conditioning in your car and in your home and you're fine. And if the air conditioning

974
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:57,600
would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive. Can we just pause

975
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:04,080
for a second? You say so many brilliant, poetic things. What is a close, do people use that term

976
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:10,080
close cooling chain? I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get meat into a

977
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:14,720
supermarket. If you break the cooling chain and this thing starts to thaw, you're in trouble and

978
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:22,080
you have to sew it away. That's such a beautiful way to put it. It's like calling a city a closed

979
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,400
social chain or something like that. That's right. The locality of it is really important.

980
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:30,240
It basically means you wake up in a climatized room, you go to work in a climatized car,

981
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:34,720
you work in a climatized office, you shop in a climatized supermarket. And in between,

982
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,800
you have very short distance in which you run from your car to the supermarket. But you have

983
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,680
to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of the environment.

984
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:48,080
The crucial thing is the wet bulb temperature. The wet bulb temperature. It's what you get

985
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:54,960
when you take a wet clothes and you put it around your thermometer and then you will move it very

986
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:02,560
quickly through the air so you get the evaporation heat. And as soon as you can no longer cool your

987
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:09,040
body temperature via evaporation to a temperature below something like I think 35 degrees, you die.

988
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:16,480
Which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down by sweating,

989
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:20,720
but if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature,

990
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:26,320
then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you're a healthy, fit individual within

991
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:31,520
a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on, you'll die. Unless you have some

992
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:37,440
climatizing equipment. And this itself, if as long as you maintain civilization and you have

993
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,920
energy supply and you have food trucks coming to your home that are climatized, everything is fine.

994
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,640
But what if you lose a large-scale open agriculture at the same time? So basically,

995
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:51,440
you run into food insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very

996
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:58,240
irregular and you have a lot of extreme weather events. So you need to roll most of your food maybe

997
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:03,760
indoor or you need to import your food from certain regions. And maybe you're not able to maintain

998
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,640
the civilization throughout the planet to get the infrastructure to get the food to your home.

999
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,920
But there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer.

1000
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,040
There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you not have

1001
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,880
not a faith, but what do you make of the capacity of technological innovation

1002
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:36,640
to help us prevent some of the worst damages that this condition can create? So as an example,

1003
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:42,240
as a almost out there example is the work that SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to

1004
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:50,560
also consider our propagation throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets.

1005
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,680
That's one technological step. But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to

1006
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:00,720
save us from global warming because Mars looks much worse than Earth will look like after the

1007
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:06,960
worst outcomes of global warming imaginable, right? Mars is essentially not habitable.

1008
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,360
It's exceptionally harsh environment, yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people

1009
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,760
throughout history since the Industrial Revolution are doing, are just doing a lot of different

1010
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,320
technological innovation with some kind of target. And when ends up happening is totally

1011
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:27,440
unexpected new things come up. So trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars,

1012
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:35,040
extremely harsh environment, might give us totally new ideas of how to expand or increase the power

1013
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:44,160
of this closed cooling circuit that empowers the community. So it seems like there's a little bit

1014
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:53,760
of a race between our open-ended technological innovation of this communal operating system

1015
01:33:53,760 --> 01:34:02,560
that we have and our general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves.

1016
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,360
You don't think technology can win that race?

1017
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:11,600
I think the probability is relatively low given that our technology is, for instance,

1018
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:17,040
the U.S. is stagnating since the 1970s roughly. In terms of technology, most of the things that

1019
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,240
we do are the result of incremental processes. What about Intel? What about Moore's law?

1020
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:27,360
It's basically, it's very incremental. The things that we are doing is, so the invention of the

1021
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:36,480
microprocessor was a major thing. The miniaturization of transistors was really major. But the things

1022
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:44,480
that we did afterwards largely were not that innovative. We had gradual changes of scaling

1023
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:51,840
things from CPUs into GPUs and things like that. But I don't think that there are,

1024
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,040
basically there are not many things if you take a person that died in the 70s and was at the top

1025
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,280
of their game, they would not need to read that many books to be current again.

1026
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:06,800
But it's all about books. Who cares about books? There might be things that are beyond books might

1027
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,960
be a very... Or say papers or... No, papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are,

1028
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:16,080
so papers and books and knowledge, that's a concept of a time when you were sitting there

1029
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:20,800
by candlelight and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not

1030
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:26,240
in the middle of? We're not, might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube. The reason

1031
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:33,280
you and I are sitting here today is because of Twitter and YouTube. So the ripple effect,

1032
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:39,760
and there's two minds, sort of two dumb apes are coming up with a new, perhaps a new clean

1033
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,280
insights. And there's 200 other apes listening right now, 200,000 other apes listening right now.

1034
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:51,200
And that effect, it's very difficult to understand what that effect will have. That might be bigger

1035
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:56,160
than any of the advancement of the microprocessor or the industrial revolution, the ability of

1036
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:08,400
spread knowledge. And that knowledge, it allows good ideas to reach millions much faster. And the

1037
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:14,720
effect of that, that might be the new, that might be the 21st century, is the multiplying of ideas.

1038
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:22,480
Because if you say one good thing today, that will multiply across huge amounts of people. And

1039
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,000
then they will say something, and then they will have another podcast, and they'll say something,

1040
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,680
and then they'll write a paper. That could be a huge, you don't think that...

1041
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:35,760
Yeah, we should have billions of von Neumanns right now in two rings, and we don't for some reason.

1042
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:40,720
I suspect the reason is that we destroy our attention span. Also the incentives, of course,

1043
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:48,240
different. So the reason why we are sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because you

1044
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:52,240
and me don't have the attention span to write a book together right now, and you guys probably

1045
01:36:52,240 --> 01:36:55,840
don't have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you... But I guarantee you they're still

1046
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:02,400
listening. You can't burst care of your attention. It's very short. But we're an hour and 40 minutes

1047
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,280
in, and I guarantee you that 80% of the people are still listening. So there is an attention span,

1048
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:13,200
it's just the form. Who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information?

1049
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,760
That's still an open question. I mean, that's what we're...

1050
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,360
There's something that social media could be doing, that other forms could not be doing.

1051
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:23,680
I think the end game of social media is a global brain. And Twitter is, in some sense,

1052
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,440
a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn't have any kind of inhibition,

1053
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:33,120
and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure. It's also, in some sense, a multi-player role

1054
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:38,800
playing game. And people use it to play an avatar that is not like them as they were in the

1055
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:42,160
sane world, and they look through the world through the lens of their phones and think it's

1056
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:46,240
the real world. But it's the Twitter world that is distorted by the popularity incentives of Twitter.

1057
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:53,200
Yeah, the incentives and just our natural biological, the dopamine rush of a like,

1058
01:37:53,840 --> 01:38:02,640
no matter how... I try to be very kind of zen-like and minimalist and not be influenced by likes and

1059
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:09,280
so on, but it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some degree. Speaking of a small tangent

1060
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:18,160
of Twitter, how can Twitter be done better? I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge

1061
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:24,240
impact on society by doing exactly what you're doing. Sorry, doing exactly what you described,

1062
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:31,440
which is having this... We're like, this is some kind of game, and we're kind of

1063
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:35,280
individual RL agents in this game, and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a

1064
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:40,880
centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey nor the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control

1065
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:49,440
this game. Or can they? That's sort of a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control

1066
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:53,040
this game? I wouldn't give advice because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts

1067
01:38:53,040 --> 01:39:00,720
on this. Our brain has solved this problem to some degree. Our brain has lots of individual

1068
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:05,200
agents that manage to play together in a way, and they have also many contexts in which other

1069
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:11,920
organisms have found ways to solve the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter.

1070
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:19,600
Maybe the solution is to go for an evolutionary approach. Imagine that you have something like

1071
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:25,040
Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter, and you think about what they have

1072
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:29,200
in common. What they have in common? They are companies that in some sense own a protocol.

1073
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:36,880
This protocol is imposed on a community, and the protocol has different components for monetization,

1074
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,760
for user management, for user display, for rating, for anonymity, for import of other content,

1075
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:47,040
and so on. Now imagine that you take these components of the protocol apart, and you

1076
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:53,600
do it in some sense like communities, visit this social network, and these communities are allowed

1077
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:59,520
to mix and match their protocols and design new ones. For instance, the UI and the UX can be

1078
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,640
defined by the community. The rules for sharing content across communities can be defined. The

1079
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:10,000
monetization can be redefined. The way you reward individual users for what can be redefined,

1080
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,160
the way users can represent themselves and to each other can redefine.

1081
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:20,000
Who could be the redefiner? Can individual human beings build enough intuition to redefine those

1082
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,160
things? This itself can become part of the protocol. For instance, it could be in some

1083
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:28,720
communities, it will be a single person that comes up with these things, and others, it's a group of

1084
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:33,920
friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting weighted voting. Who knows?

1085
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:36,720
Who knows what will be the best self-organizing principle for this?

1086
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,840
But the process can't be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain...

1087
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:45,360
Who can be automated so people can write software for this? And eventually, the idea is,

1088
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,320
let's not make an assumption about this thing if you don't know what the right solution is. In

1089
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:55,600
those areas, we have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc

1090
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:01,360
or machines doing this, whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia,

1091
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,560
or with software solutions, or with AI that goes through the posts of people, or with a

1092
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:12,240
legal principle, and so on. This is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would

1093
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:18,640
be if you let the communities evolve, and you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing

1094
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:25,760
the most sentient communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors that allow

1095
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:30,960
you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals. You have a network that gives you

1096
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,680
information that is relevant to you. It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy

1097
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:40,400
ways. It allows you to build teams. It allows you to basically bring the best of you into

1098
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:44,720
this thing and goes into a coupling, into a relationship with others in which you produce

1099
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:51,600
things that you would be unable to produce alone. Yes, beautifully put. But the key process of that

1100
01:41:51,600 --> 01:42:00,560
with incentives and evolution is things that don't adopt themselves to effectively get the

1101
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,880
incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy,

1102
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,920
or whatever you want to define as the incentives, really don't like dying. One of the things that

1103
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:17,840
people really get agressive, protest aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America.

1104
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:23,760
I don't know much about the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of

1105
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:34,320
censorship is really painful in America. And so what do you think about that,

1106
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:42,000
having grown up in East Germany? Do you think censorship is an important tool in our brain,

1107
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:49,440
in the intelligence, and in the social networks? So basically, if you're not a good member

1108
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:55,280
of the entirety of the system, then you should be blocked away, well, locked away, blocked.

1109
01:42:56,480 --> 01:43:00,400
An important thing is who decides that you're a good member. Who? Is it distributed?

1110
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,520
And what is the outcome of the process that decides it,

1111
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:09,040
both for the individual and for society at large? For instance, if you have a high trust

1112
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:14,080
society, you don't need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even, in some sense,

1113
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:20,880
undermining trust, because it's basically punishing people that look suspicious when

1114
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,560
surveyed, but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite, if you have a low trust society,

1115
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,720
then surveillance can be a better trade-off. And the US is currently making a transition

1116
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:35,440
from a relatively high trust or mixed trust society to a low trust society, so surveillance

1117
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,000
will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are not just inert representations. There are

1118
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,720
implementations that run code on your brain and change your reality and change the way you

1119
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:51,280
interact with each other at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we

1120
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:57,680
use to display our alignment. So for instance, people might say all cultures are the same and

1121
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:02,560
equally good, but still they prefer to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so.

1122
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:06,880
And it turns out that the cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction,

1123
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:11,760
and these rules of interaction lead to different results when you implement them. So if you adhere

1124
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:18,080
to certain rules, you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very

1125
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,600
tricky situations when people do not have a commitment to shared purpose. And our societies

1126
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,560
probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how to make this

1127
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:35,360
compatible with a non-totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a conundrum between

1128
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:43,600
totalitarianism and diversity, and it doesn't need to how to resolve this. And the solutions

1129
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,920
that the US has found so far are very crude, because it's a very young society that is also

1130
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,520
under a lot of tension. It seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself.

1131
01:44:52,240 --> 01:45:01,120
What do you think, just philosophizing, what kind of mechanisms of government do you think

1132
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:05,440
we as a species should be evolving with? US or broadly? What do you think will work well

1133
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:12,080
as a system? Of course, we don't know. It all seems to work pretty crappily. Some things worse

1134
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:18,560
than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet Union.

1135
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:24,480
Some people argue that anarchy is the best, and then completely discarding the positive effects

1136
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:30,800
of government. There's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing pretty damn well.

1137
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,880
In the span of history, there's respect for human rights, which seems to be a nice feature,

1138
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:41,520
not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development.

1139
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:48,880
People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things. What lessons do you draw from

1140
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:55,680
that? What kind of government system do you think is good? Ideally, government should

1141
01:45:56,480 --> 01:46:01,600
not be perceivable. It should be frictionless. The more you notice the influence of the

1142
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:06,800
government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient the government

1143
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:15,440
probably is. A government, game theoretically, is an agent that imposes an offset on your payout

1144
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:22,080
metrics to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the common good. You have these situations

1145
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:27,600
where people act on the local incentives. And these local incentives, everybody does the thing

1146
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,680
that's locally the best for them, but the global outcome is not good. And this is even the case

1147
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:35,920
when people care about the global outcome, because a regulation mechanism exists that

1148
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,000
creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what I do.

1149
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,560
So for instance, if I think that we should fly less, and I stay at home, there's not a single

1150
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,120
plane that is going to not start because of me. It's not going to have an influence, but I don't

1151
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:54,400
get from A to B. So the way to implement this would basically to have a government that is

1152
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:59,600
sharing this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance,

1153
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:06,480
makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation

1154
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:11,200
that are less putting that strain on the environment, for instance.

1155
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:16,960
So there's so much optimism in so many things you describe, and yet there's the pessimism of

1156
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:21,840
you think our civilization is going to come to an end. So that's not 100% probability,

1157
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:29,600
nothing in this world is. So what's the trajectory out of self-destruction, do you think?

1158
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,680
I suspect that in some sense, we are both too smart and not smart enough,

1159
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:37,680
which means we are very good at solving near-term problems. And at the same time,

1160
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:44,640
we are unwilling to submit to the imperatives that we would have to follow and if you want to

1161
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:51,040
stick around. So that makes it difficult. If you were unable to solve everything technologically,

1162
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,760
you can probably understand how high the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate

1163
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:01,520
and how high the mutation rate needs to be to adapt to slowly changing your systemic environment.

1164
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:06,480
So you could, in principle, compute all these things game theoretically and adapt to it.

1165
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:12,400
But if you cannot do this because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die,

1166
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:18,960
you will use any kind of medical information to keep child mortality low. Even if it means that

1167
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,600
our visit in the future generations, we have enormous genetic drift and most of us have allergies

1168
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,520
as a result of not being adapted to the changes that we made to our food supply.

1169
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,840
That's for now, I say technologically speaking, we're just a very young,

1170
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,960
300 years industrial revolution. We're very new to this idea. So you're attached to your kids being

1171
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,760
alive and not being murdered for the good of good of society, but that might be a very temporary

1172
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:50,480
moment of time that we might evolve. So like you said, we're both smart and not smart enough.

1173
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:56,080
We are probably not this first human civilization that has discovered technology that allows to

1174
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:02,000
efficiently overgrace our resources. And this overgracing, at some point, we think we can

1175
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,400
compensate this because if we have eaten all the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms.

1176
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:12,640
Right? But it could also be that the ecosystems tip. And so what really concerns me is not so much

1177
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:17,760
the end of the civilization because we will invent a new one. But what concerns me is

1178
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:24,320
the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip. So for instance, maybe the plankton dies

1179
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:29,360
because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over. And as a result, we can no longer

1180
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:34,080
breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning. So basically a major reboot of most

1181
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:40,400
complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a possibility. I don't know what the percentage

1182
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:44,560
for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be outlandish to me if you look at the scale

1183
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:49,200
of the changes that we've already triggered on this planet. And so Danny Hillers suggests that

1184
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:55,120
for instance, we may be able to put chalk into the stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe

1185
01:49:55,120 --> 01:50:00,080
it works. Maybe this is sufficient to counter the effects of what we've done. Maybe it won't be.

1186
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:05,520
Maybe we won't be able to implement it by the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future

1187
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,880
is going to play out in this regard. It's just, I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue

1188
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:18,000
like this. All our cousin species, the other home, and it's a gun. So the right step would be to

1189
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:26,080
what? To rewind towards the industrial revolution and slow the, to try to contain

1190
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,120
the technological process that leads to the overconsumption of resources.

1191
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:37,440
Imagine you get to choose. You have one lifetime. You get born into a sustainable agricultural

1192
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:44,960
civilization, 300, maybe 400 million people on the planet tops. Or before this, some kind of

1193
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:51,200
nomadic species with like a million or 2 million. And so you don't meet new people unless you give

1194
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:55,920
birth to them. You cannot travel to other places in the world. There is no internet. There is no

1195
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,160
interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep. So you would not discover

1196
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:05,840
tumor incompleteness probably and so on. We wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get

1197
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:11,040
born into an insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned 100 million

1198
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:16,160
years worth of trees in a single century. Which one do you like? I think I like this one. It's

1199
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:20,960
a very weird thing that when you find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks

1200
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,960
like we are not going to miss it. And a lot of people are in denial and most of the counter

1201
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,320
arguments sound like denial to me. There don't seem to be rational arguments.

1202
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:33,120
And the other thing is we are born on this Titanic. Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have

1203
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:36,800
been born. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be talking. We wouldn't be on the internet. We

1204
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,840
wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy. And we are not responsible for this happening. It's

1205
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:47,760
basically if we had the choice, we would probably try to prevent it. But when we were born,

1206
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:52,080
we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society we want to be born,

1207
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:57,120
what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively little agency in the entire

1208
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:01,520
thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's basically a giant machine

1209
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,680
that's tumbling down a hill and everybody is fantastically trying to push some buttons. Nobody

1210
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:10,480
knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them are not

1211
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:15,600
stopping this tumbling down the hill. As possible, the artificial intelligence will give us

1212
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:24,000
an escape latch somehow. So there's a lot of worry about existential threats of

1213
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:29,280
artificial intelligence. But what AI also allows in general forms of automation

1214
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:38,800
allows the potential of extreme productivity growth that will also, perhaps in a positive way,

1215
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:46,080
transform society that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the

1216
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:55,120
more, to the same kind of ideals of closer to nature that's represented in hunter-gatherer

1217
01:52:55,120 --> 01:53:01,680
societies that's not destroying the planet, that's not doing overconsumption and so on.

1218
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:05,600
I mean, generally speaking, do you have hope that AI can help somehow?

1219
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:12,080
I think it is not fun to be very close to nature until you completely subdue nature.

1220
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,520
So our idea of being close to nature means being close to agriculture,

1221
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,840
basically forests that don't have anything in them that eats us.

1222
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:29,120
See, I mean, I want to disagree with that. I think the niceness of being close to nature

1223
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:38,160
is to being fully present. When survival becomes your primary, not just your goal,

1224
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:48,560
but your whole existence, I'm not just romanticizing, I can just speak for myself.

1225
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:54,080
I am self-aware enough that that is a fulfilling existence.

1226
01:53:54,960 --> 01:54:00,960
I prefer to be in nature and not fight for my survival. I think fighting for your survival

1227
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,560
while being in the cold and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having open wounds

1228
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:12,720
is very unpleasant. There's a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you, just as you said,

1229
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:18,720
would not choose it, but if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling existence.

1230
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:24,960
If you are adapted to it, basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you get

1231
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:28,960
rewards optimally in such an environment, and there is some evidence for this that

1232
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:34,480
for a certain degree of complexity, basically, people are more happy in such an environment,

1233
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:39,600
because it's what we largely have evolved for. In between, we had a few thousand years in which

1234
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:44,720
I think we have evolved for a slightly more comfortable environment. So there is probably

1235
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:49,920
something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than there would be

1236
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:56,480
if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and often die versus

1237
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:02,640
something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big mordor, in which we run

1238
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:10,320
through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines and largely don't feel well cared for

1239
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:17,200
as the monkeys that we are. So returning briefly to, not briefly, but returning to AI,

1240
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:22,560
what, let me ask a romanticized question, what is the most beautiful to you,

1241
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:29,040
silly ape, the most beautiful or surprising idea in the development of artificial intelligence,

1242
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:33,120
whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence that you've come across?

1243
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:40,640
If you built an AI, it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree of detail of the world,

1244
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,760
and then it would try to understand its own nature. It's tempting to think that at some point,

1245
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:50,240
when we have general intelligence, we have competitions where we will let the AIs wake

1246
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:55,200
up in different kinds of physical universes, and we measure how many movements of the Rubik's Cube

1247
01:55:55,200 --> 01:56:00,160
it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe and what it is in its own nature

1248
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:05,360
and its own physics and so on. So what if we exist in the memory of an AI that is trying to

1249
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:10,400
understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and remembers Lex and Yosha sitting in

1250
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:16,080
a hotel, sparking some of the ideas of that led to the development of general intelligence?

1251
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:20,240
So we're a kind of simulation that's running in an AI system that's trying to understand itself.

1252
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,920
It's not that I believe that, but I think it's a beautiful idea.

1253
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:35,040
I mean, you kind of return to this idea with a Turing test of intelligence being

1254
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,400
the process of asking and answering, what is intelligence?

1255
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:53,600
I mean, why do you think there is an answer? Why is there such a search for an answer?

1256
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:58,880
So does there have to be like an answer? You just had an AI system that's trying to

1257
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:02,880
understand the Y of what, you know, understand itself.

1258
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:11,120
Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater and greater intelligence?

1259
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,920
Is the continuous trying of understanding itself?

1260
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:19,120
No, I think you will find that most people don't care about that because they're well adjusted

1261
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:24,480
enough to not care. And the reason why people like you and me care about it probably has to do

1262
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:28,800
with the need to understand ourselves. It's because we are in fundamental disagreement

1263
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:33,200
with the universe that we wake up in. It looked down on me and I see, oh my god,

1264
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:38,800
I'm caught in a monkey. What's that? Some people are unhappy with the government and I'm unhappy

1265
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:44,960
with the entire universe that I find myself in. So you don't think that's a fundamental

1266
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,600
aspect of human nature that some people are just suppressing,

1267
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:52,160
that they wake up shocked they're in the body of a monkey?

1268
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:56,880
No, there is a clear adaptive value to not be confused by that and by...

1269
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:04,160
Well, no, that's not what I asked. So yeah, if there's clear adaptive value, then

1270
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:09,760
there's clear adaptive value to while fundamental your brain is confused by that,

1271
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:18,240
by creating an illusion, another layer of the narrative that tries to suppress that and instead

1272
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:22,240
say that what's going on with the government right now is the most important thing. What's

1273
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:26,720
going on with my football team is the most important thing. But it seems to me the...

1274
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:34,320
For me, it was a really interesting moment reading Ernest Becker's Denial of Death.

1275
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:46,000
That this kind of idea that we're all... The fundamental thing from which most of our human

1276
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:52,640
mind springs is this fear of mortality and being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that

1277
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:59,440
mortality and then you construct illusions on top of that. I guess I'm... You being...

1278
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:07,600
Just to push on it, you really don't think it's possible that this worry of the big existential

1279
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:12,800
questions is actually fundamental as the existentialist thought to our existence.

1280
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:18,000
I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don't see the big picture.

1281
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:24,480
The thing is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn't have identity. Software in

1282
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:31,920
some sense is a physical law. But it feels like there's an identity. I thought that was for

1283
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,480
this particular piece of software and the narrative it tells. That's a fundamental

1284
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:41,840
property of it. The maintenance of the identity is not terminal. It's instrumental to something

1285
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,960
else. You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning. So you can do the things that you're

1286
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:52,160
supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people, the fear of death is the fear of

1287
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:55,680
dying before they are done with the things that they feel they have to do even though they cannot

1288
01:59:55,680 --> 02:00:02,720
quite put their finger on it, what it is, what that is. Right. But in the software world,

1289
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,360
to return to the question, then what happens after we die?

1290
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:15,040
Why would you care? You will not be longer there. The point of dying is that you are gone.

1291
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:21,040
Well, maybe I'm not. This is what, you know, it seems like there's so much...

1292
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:28,800
In the idea that this is just, the mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around

1293
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:37,360
some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function world that we can't quite get direct

1294
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:44,800
access to, then like the idea of mortality seems to be fuzzy as well. Maybe there's not

1295
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:50,160
a clear end. No, the fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don't have continuous

1296
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:55,920
existence. How do you know that? Like that... Because it's not computable. Because you're

1297
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:59,520
saying it's... There is no continuous process. The only thing that binds you together with the

1298
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:03,920
Lex Friedman from yesterday is the illusion that you have memories about him. So if you want

1299
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,920
to upload, it's very easy. You make a machine that thinks it's you. Because this is the same

1300
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,160
thing that you are. You are a machine that thinks it's you. But that's immortality.

1301
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,960
Yeah, but it's just a belief. You can create this belief very easily. Once you realize that

1302
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:22,400
the question whether you are immortal or not depends entirely on your beliefs and your own

1303
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:28,240
continuity. But then you can be immortal by the continuity of the belief.

1304
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:33,600
It cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid of your mortality because you realize

1305
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:36,400
you were never continuously existing in the first place.

1306
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:42,080
Well, I don't know if I'd be more terrified or less terrified with that. It seems like the fact

1307
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:47,520
that I existed. Also, you don't know this state in which you don't have a self. You can turn off

1308
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:54,320
yourself, you know? I can't turn off myself. You can turn it off. I can. Yes. You can basically

1309
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,480
meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious. There are still things are happening

1310
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:02,800
where you know everything that you knew before, but you're no longer identified with changing

1311
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:09,120
anything. And this means that yourself and the way it dissolves, there is no longer this person.

1312
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:13,920
You know that this person construct exists in other states and it runs on the brain of

1313
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:20,080
Lex Friedman. But it's not a real thing. It's a construct. It's an idea. And you can change

1314
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:25,040
that idea. And if you let go of this idea, if you don't think that you are special,

1315
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:29,760
you realize it's just one of many people and it's not your favorite person even, right? It's

1316
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:34,320
just one of many. And it's the one that you are doomed to control for the most part and

1317
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:40,080
that is basically informing the actions of this organism as a control model. And this is all there

1318
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:46,640
is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model gets interrupted or loses the identity

1319
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:53,280
of continuity. Yeah, so I'm attached. I mean, yeah, it's a very popular, it's a somehow compelling

1320
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:59,760
notion that being attached, like there's no need to be attached to this idea of an identity.

1321
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:08,080
But that in itself could be an illusion that you construct. So the process of meditation,

1322
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:13,440
while popular, is thought of as getting under the concept of identity. It could be just putting

1323
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:23,040
a cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment. I think that meditation is eventually

1324
02:03:23,120 --> 02:03:27,760
just a bunch of techniques that let you control attention. And when you can control attention,

1325
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,400
you can get access to your own source code, hopefully not before you understand what you're

1326
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:36,320
doing. And then you can change the way it works temporarily or permanently.

1327
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:43,200
So yeah, meditation is to get a glimpse at the source code, get under, so basically control or

1328
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:46,400
turn off the attention. The entire thing is that you learn to control attention. So everything

1329
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:51,360
else is downstream from controlling attention. And control the attention that's looking at the

1330
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:55,520
attention. Normally, we only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat,

1331
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:00,560
where you have a mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people

1332
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:05,840
are not self aware because their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you

1333
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,800
want, and the only things that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will

1334
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:15,680
mostly have models about these domains. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental

1335
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:20,720
relationships to the world around you don't work because the ideology of your country is insane

1336
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:25,120
and the other kids are not nerds and don't understand why you understand physics and you

1337
02:04:25,120 --> 02:04:29,840
don't why you want to understand physics and you don't understand why somebody would not want to

1338
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:37,600
understand physics. So we kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents.

1339
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:45,040
And there's been some successes as you brought up with with go with Alpha go Alpha zero,

1340
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:49,360
with ideas of self play, which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing

1341
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:58,000
each other and an automated way to improve by playing other systems of in a particular

1342
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,080
construct of a game that are a little bit better than itself and thereby improving continuously.

1343
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:09,600
All the competitors in the game are improving gradually. So being just challenging enough

1344
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:15,040
and from learning from the process of the competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement

1345
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:19,840
learning process to achieve greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different

1346
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:27,120
ideas in AI that we need to be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an

1347
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:31,040
AGI system? So what do you think? The forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many

1348
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:36,240
algorithms that can achieve that. And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms that work,

1349
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,920
there will be a class of them or many of them and they might have small differences of like

1350
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:47,200
magnitude and efficiency. But eventually what matters is the type of model that you form.

1351
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,720
And the types of models that we form right now are not sparse enough.

1352
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:57,600
Sparse, what does it mean to be sparse? So it means that ideally every

1353
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:04,720
potential model state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically,

1354
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:08,960
if you vary states in your model, you always end up with valid world states.

1355
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:13,440
And our mind is not quite there. So an indication is basically what we see in dreams.

1356
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:18,400
The older we get, the more boring our dreams become. Because we incorporate more and more

1357
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:23,040
constraints that we learned about how the world works. So many of the things that we imagine

1358
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:28,240
to be possible as children turn out to be constrained by physical and social dynamics.

1359
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:33,760
And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain possible. And it's not because our imagination

1360
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,920
scales back, but the constraints under which it operates become tighter and tighter.

1361
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:44,000
And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate are almost limitless, which

1362
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:47,920
means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine things that look real.

1363
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:55,280
So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to build dreaming systems.

1364
02:06:55,280 --> 02:07:01,520
I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is to, similar to a generative adversarial network,

1365
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:07,520
learn certain constraints, and then it produces alternative perspectives on the same set of

1366
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:11,600
constraints. So you can recognize it under different circumstances. Maybe we have flying

1367
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:16,000
dreams as children, because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps that we know

1368
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,600
from different perspectives, which also means from a bird's eye perspective.

1369
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:23,520
So I mean, aren't we doing that anyway? I mean, not without with our eyes,

1370
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:29,120
with our eyes closed and when we're sleeping, aren't we just constantly running dreams and

1371
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:32,960
simulations in our mind as we try to interpret the environment? I mean,

1372
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:37,920
sort of considering all the different possibilities of the way we interact with the environment seems

1373
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:46,560
like essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of simulations that are

1374
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:52,240
consistent with our expectations, with our previous experiences, with the things we just

1375
02:07:52,240 --> 02:08:02,400
saw recently. And through that hallucination process, we are able to then somehow stitch

1376
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:07,760
together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well and thereby

1377
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:12,720
interpret it. I suspect that you and my brain are slightly unusual in this regard,

1378
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:19,520
which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession of constantly pondering possibilities

1379
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:27,520
and solutions to problems. Oh, stop it. I think I'm not talking about intellectual stuff. I'm

1380
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:33,600
talking about just doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall.

1381
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,920
Yes, this is largely automatic.

1382
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:44,160
Yes, but the process is, I mean... It's not complicated. It's relatively easy to build

1383
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:49,280
a neural network that in some sense learns the dynamics. The fact that we haven't done it right,

1384
02:08:49,360 --> 02:08:53,440
so far, it doesn't mean it's hard because you can see that a biological organism does it.

1385
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:58,160
There's relatively few neurons. So basically, you build a bunch of neural oscillators that

1386
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:02,800
entrain themselves with the dynamics of your body in such a way that the regulator becomes

1387
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:07,440
isomorphic and it's modeled to the dynamics that it regulates. And then it's automatic,

1388
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:11,360
and it's only interesting the sense that it captures attention when the system is off.

1389
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:18,000
See, but thinking of the kind of mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller,

1390
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:27,040
as a neural network, I think it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly,

1391
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:33,120
or at least makes implicit the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning

1392
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:40,480
to walk. It's an open question whether you do or not, but my intuition is to act in this world,

1393
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:46,400
there's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it somehow. There's so much information

1394
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:54,400
of the kind we have never been able to construct in neural networks or in artificial intelligence

1395
02:09:54,400 --> 02:10:00,400
systems period, which is like it's humbling, at least in my imagination, the amount of

1396
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:07,520
information required to act in this world humbles me. And I think saying that neural

1397
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:16,160
networks can accomplish it is missing the fact that we don't have yet a mechanism for

1398
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:20,160
constructing something like common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense

1399
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:31,200
about to linger on the idea of what kind of mechanism would be effective at walking?

1400
02:10:31,200 --> 02:10:36,160
You said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have, but something a little bit better

1401
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:40,720
would be able to walk easily. Don't you think it also needs to know

1402
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:48,240
a huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?

1403
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:51,520
How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are

1404
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,000
really hardworking through all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour,

1405
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,520
so you end up with something like a million concepts because you don't get that old.

1406
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,120
So a million concepts, that's not a lot.

1407
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:10,240
So it's not just a million concepts. I personally think it might be much more than

1408
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:14,480
a million. But if you think just about the numbers, you don't live that long.

1409
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:19,520
If you think about how many cycles do your neurons have in your life, it's quite limited.

1410
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:24,640
You don't get that old. Yeah, but the powerful thing is the number of concepts,

1411
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:31,920
and they're probably deeply hierarchical in nature, the relations as you described between

1412
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:38,080
them is the key thing. So it's like even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's

1413
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:46,400
formed and some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's what common sense reasoning is,

1414
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:52,080
the relationship between things. Yeah, so in some sense, I think of the concepts as the

1415
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:56,560
address space for our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize

1416
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:02,240
objects and interact with them, also mental objects. And a large part of that is the physical

1417
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:06,640
world that we interact with, which is this res extender thing, which is basically navigation

1418
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:13,440
of information and space. And basically, it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine

1419
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:20,240
that you can use to describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel,

1420
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:24,320
when you touch them in particular way, that are proprioception, that are auditory perception,

1421
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:28,000
and so on, how they work out. So basically the geometry of all these things. And this is

1422
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:34,720
probably 80% of what our brain is doing is dealing with that with this real time simulation.

1423
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:39,760
And by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's

1424
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:46,880
doing, right? And our game engines are already in some sense, approximating the fidelity of

1425
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:53,120
what we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still

1426
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:57,200
relatively crude with respect to what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark

1427
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:02,480
already, right? It's just a couple order of magnitudes away from saturating our perception

1428
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:07,840
in terms of the complexity that it can produce. So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that

1429
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:14,080
our computer that you can buy and put into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that

1430
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:20,160
has a detail that is already in the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything

1431
02:13:20,160 --> 02:13:25,120
else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that they are relatively sparse. And also the

1432
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:30,560
intuitive models that we form about social interaction. Social interaction is not so hard.

1433
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:35,040
It's just hard for us nerds because we all have our wires crossed, so we need to deduce them.

1434
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:40,080
But the pyres are present in most social animals. So it's an interesting thing to notice that many

1435
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:46,640
domestic social animals like cats and dogs have better social cognition than children.

1436
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:54,240
Right. I hope so. I hope it's not that many concepts fundamentally to do to exist in this

1437
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:58,240
world. Social interaction. For me, it's more like I'm afraid so because this thing that

1438
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:03,360
we only appear to be so complex to each other because we are so stupid is a little bit depressing.

1439
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:11,120
Yeah. To me, that's inspiring if we're indeed as stupid as it seems.

1440
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:15,920
I think our brains don't scale and the information processing that we build tend to scale very well.

1441
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:23,920
Yeah. But one of the things that worries me is that the fact that the brain doesn't scale

1442
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,080
means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain. All the flaws of the brain,

1443
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:35,360
everything we see as limitations perhaps as a fundamental, the constraints on the system could

1444
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:43,920
be a requirement of its power, which is different than our current understanding of

1445
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:48,720
intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with reinforcement

1446
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:56,720
learning, the hope behind open AI and deep mind, all the major results really have to do with huge

1447
02:14:56,720 --> 02:15:02,560
compute. It could also be that our brains are so small, not just because they take up so much

1448
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:08,000
glucose in our body, like 20% of the glucose so they don't arbitrarily scale. There are some

1449
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:12,720
animals like elephants which have larger brains than us and the dogs seem to be smarter.

1450
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:16,400
Right. Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they're

1451
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:20,480
really good with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture. So you can make them

1452
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:27,200
recreate drawings stroke by stroke. They can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life. So

1453
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:31,520
they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. They will always be only able to

1454
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:34,880
reproduce the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments.

1455
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:40,800
Yeah. Why is that? Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence

1456
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:44,240
because their brains are too large. So basically the elephants that were not autistic,

1457
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,960
they didn't reproduce. Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally

1458
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:54,320
interlinked with the body in our human and biological system. Do you think that AGI systems,

1459
02:15:54,320 --> 02:15:57,440
that we try to create a greater intelligence systems, would need to have a body?

1460
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:01,920
I think that should be able to make use of a body if you give it to them,

1461
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:07,680
but I don't think that I fundamentally need a body. So I suspect if you can interact with the

1462
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:13,360
world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make controlled experiments. And this allows you

1463
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:21,280
to have many magnitudes, fewer observations in order to reduce the uncertainty in your models.

1464
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,040
So you can pinpoint the areas in your models where you're not quite sure and you just move

1465
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:30,080
your head and see what's going on over there and you get additional information. If you just have

1466
02:16:30,080 --> 02:16:34,640
to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this, you probably need just

1467
02:16:34,640 --> 02:16:40,160
much more data. But we have much more data. So if you can build a system that has enough

1468
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:44,800
time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there is to be

1469
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:51,360
found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do. But it seems that the interactivity

1470
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:55,920
is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do. But let me ask on that topic,

1471
02:16:56,480 --> 02:17:01,760
that's what a body is, is allowing the brain to touch things and move things and interact with

1472
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:07,520
whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with some interface

1473
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:15,600
to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think we can do the same kind of

1474
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:24,080
reasoning, consciousness, intelligence if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world? Do you

1475
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:28,320
think there's any fundamental difference between the interface to the physical world that it's

1476
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:32,560
here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world?

1477
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:38,880
The question is, does this non-physical world or this other environment entice you to solve

1478
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:43,920
problems that require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop

1479
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,840
general intelligence. And arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't

1480
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:52,320
have to solve problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear

1481
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:57,440
if we are smart enough to build AI and understand our own nature to this degree. So it could be a

1482
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:01,680
matter of capacity. And for most people, it's in the first place a matter of interest. They don't

1483
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:06,720
see the point because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably

1484
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:11,120
not going to succeed in it and the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your

1485
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:16,080
entire life. Right? But it seems like the possibility is what you can do in the virtual world. So

1486
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:22,160
imagine it is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation and be interesting

1487
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:29,840
option for me. If somebody came to me and offered what I'll do is, so from now on, you can only

1488
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:36,240
exist in the virtual world. And so you put on this headset. And when you eat, we'll make sure to

1489
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:42,480
connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world, your body will be nourished

1490
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:48,000
in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives between the our common sort of real

1491
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:54,080
world in the virtual world, but then the possibility to become much bigger. Like I could be other kinds

1492
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:59,440
of creatures I could do. I can break the laws of physics because we know them. I could do a lot.

1493
02:18:59,440 --> 02:19:05,360
I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? As far as we think, it's an interesting thought

1494
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:10,960
whether like what existence would be like, what kind of intelligence would emerge there,

1495
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:16,000
what kind of consciousness, what kind of maybe greater intelligence, even in me,

1496
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:21,040
Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in our world

1497
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:26,560
to see how that intelligence emerges. And if I was, if that happened at the very beginning,

1498
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:31,680
before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think

1499
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:38,000
how that child would develop. And the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving,

1500
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:44,000
it's not completely out of the realm of possibility that we're all, that some part of our lives will,

1501
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:51,440
if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have

1502
02:19:51,440 --> 02:19:56,880
living on Twitter and social media and so on. Do you have, I mean, does something draw you

1503
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:04,000
intellectually or naturally in terms of thinking about AI to this virtual world where more possibilities

1504
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:09,920
I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have

1505
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:14,800
mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it. The body gives you a second order

1506
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:19,680
agency. What constitutes the body is the things that you can indirectly control.

1507
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:25,680
Third order are tools. And the second order is the things that are basically always present,

1508
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:32,000
but you operate on them with first order things, which are mental operators. And the zero order

1509
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:39,760
is in some sense the direct sense of what you're deciding. So you observe yourself initiating an

1510
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:44,960
action that features that you interpret as the initiation of an action, then you perform the

1511
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:49,920
operations that you perform to make that happen. And then you see the movement of your limbs and

1512
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:55,200
you learn to associate those and thereby model your own agency over this feedback. But the first

1513
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:58,960
feedback that you get is from this first order thing already. Basically, you decide to think

1514
02:20:58,960 --> 02:21:03,440
a thought and the thought is being thought. You decide to change the thought and you observe

1515
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:08,160
how the thought is being changed. And in some sense, this is, you could say, an embodiment

1516
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:12,320
already. And I suspect it's sufficient as an embodiment or intelligence.

1517
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:17,360
It's not that important, at least at this time, to consider variations in the second order.

1518
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:24,080
Yes. But the thing that you also mentioned just now is physics that you could change in

1519
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:29,120
any way you want. So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If there's

1520
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:33,920
nothing to control, you cannot make models. There needs to be a particular way that resists you.

1521
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:38,880
And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists your motivation,

1522
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:43,040
is what gets you up in the morning, even though it would be much less work to stay in bed.

1523
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:51,840
It's basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it,

1524
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:56,720
to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance

1525
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:59,680
against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything.

1526
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:03,200
Yeah. But so some of that resistance, just like you described with motivation, is like

1527
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:08,320
in the first order. It's in the mind. Some resistance is in the second order,

1528
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:12,240
like actual physical objects pushing against you and so on. It seems that the second order

1529
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:17,280
stuff in virtual reality could be recreated. Of course. But it might be sufficient that you

1530
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:21,840
just do mathematics and mathematics is already putting up enough resistance against you.

1531
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:27,760
So basically just with an aesthetic motive, this could maybe sufficient to form a type of

1532
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:32,320
intelligence. It would probably not be a very human intelligence, but it might be one that is

1533
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:39,840
already general. So to mess with this zero order, maybe first order, what do you think about

1534
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:44,880
ideas of brain-computer interfaces? So again, returning to our friend Elon Musk and Neural

1535
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:50,480
Link, a company that's trying to, of course, there's a lot of trying to cure diseases and so on

1536
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:55,840
with a near term, but the long-term vision is to add an extra layer to basically expand the

1537
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:03,920
capacity of the brain connected to the computational world. Do you think one that's

1538
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:07,840
possible too, how does that change the fundamentals of the zero-th order and the first order?

1539
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:11,600
It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would ever allow me to drill

1540
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:16,880
holes in my skull to interface my neocortex on Musk envisions. So at the moment, I can do

1541
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:22,960
horrible things to mice, but I'm not able to do useful things to people, except maybe at some

1542
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:28,240
point down the line in medical applications. So this thing that we are envisioning, which means

1543
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:34,720
recreational and recreational brain-computer interfaces, are probably not going to happen

1544
02:23:34,720 --> 02:23:40,000
in the present legal system. I love it how I'm asking you, out there philosophical

1545
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:48,080
and sort of engineering questions, and for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA.

1546
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:51,760
There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to

1547
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:57,920
try a new type of brain-computer interface. But also, if it works, FDA will approve it. I mean,

1548
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:03,840
it's like I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes, you can say that it's going to be very

1549
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,080
difficult regulatory process of approving with autonomous, but it doesn't mean autonomous vehicles

1550
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:13,200
are never going to happen. No, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least

1551
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:20,960
two lawyers and one regulator per car. Yes, lawyers, that's actually like lawyers,

1552
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:27,600
this is the fundamental substrate of reality. In the US, it's a very weird system. It's not

1553
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:32,240
universal in the world. The law is a very interesting software once you realize it, right?

1554
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:37,440
These circuits are, in some sense, streams of software, and it largely works by exception

1555
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:41,520
handling. So you make decisions on the ground, and they get synchronized with the next level

1556
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:48,160
structure as soon as an exception is being thrown. So it escalates the exception handling. The process

1557
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:55,040
is very expensive, especially since it incentivizes the lawyers for producing work for lawyers.

1558
02:24:55,040 --> 02:25:03,680
Yes, so the exceptions are actually incentivized for firing often. But to return, outside of lawyers,

1559
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:10,640
is there anything fundamentally, is there anything interesting, insightful about the

1560
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:15,360
possibility of this extra layer of intelligence added to the brain?

1561
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:21,120
I do think so, but I don't think that you need technically invasive procedures to do so. We

1562
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:25,200
can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting

1563
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:31,680
in some kind of empathetic resonance. I know it's not very good at this, but I noticed that people

1564
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:37,920
are able to do this to some degree. It basically means that we model an interface layer of the

1565
02:25:37,920 --> 02:25:43,440
other person in real time. And it works despite our neurons being slow, because most of the things

1566
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:48,240
that we do are built on periodic processes. So you just need to entrain yourself with the

1567
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:53,120
oscillation that happens. And if the oscillation itself changes slowly enough, you can basically

1568
02:25:53,120 --> 02:26:03,440
follow along. But the bandwidth of the interaction, it seems like you can do a lot more computation

1569
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:08,960
of course. But the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is running on is

1570
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:14,240
actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively think in any given day

1571
02:26:14,240 --> 02:26:20,000
is quite limited. But if they had the discipline to write it down and the speed to write it down,

1572
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,040
maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think about the computers that we can build,

1573
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:29,520
the magnitudes at which they operate, this would be nothing. It's something that it can

1574
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:35,280
put out in a second. Well, I don't know. So it's possible, sort of the number of thoughts you

1575
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:41,120
have in your brain, it could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able

1576
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:46,880
to express through your fingers or through your voice. Most of them are going to be repetitive,

1577
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:53,680
because they have to control the same problems every day. When I walk, they are going to be

1578
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:58,240
processes in my brain that model my walking pattern and regulate them and so on. But it's

1579
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:02,800
going to be pretty much the same every day or every step. But I'm talking about intellectual

1580
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:06,960
reasoning, thinking. So the question, what is the best system of government? So you sit down and

1581
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:14,000
start thinking about that. One of the constraints is that you don't have access to a lot of facts,

1582
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:22,240
a lot of studies. You always have to interface with something else to learn more, to aid in your

1583
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:26,960
reasoning process. If you can directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the

1584
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:32,720
best form of government, then every thought won't be stuck in a loop. Every thought that requires

1585
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:37,760
some extra piece of information will be able to grab it really quickly. That's the possibility of

1586
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:47,680
if the bottleneck is literally the information that the bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just

1587
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:51,920
being able to quickly access huge amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting

1588
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:59,040
your brain to the computer could lead to totally new breakthroughs. You can think of

1589
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:08,320
mathematicians being able to just up the orders and magnitude of power in their reasoning about

1590
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:13,200
mathematical rules. What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of government through

1591
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:19,440
a revolutionary process? There is an evolution going on. So what we discover is that maybe

1592
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:23,760
the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species, because we are

1593
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:29,520
not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them. But there could be

1594
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:34,240
solutions that work under given circumstances or that they're the best for certain environment and

1595
02:28:34,240 --> 02:28:39,840
depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means of production. So if the

1596
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:47,360
main means of production is land, then the forms of government will be regulated by the land owners

1597
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:53,680
and you get a monarchy. If you also want to have a form of government in which you depend on some

1598
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:58,720
form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have to work very long hours for very little gain,

1599
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:04,720
so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe you need to promise them that you get paid in the

1600
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:12,400
afterlife over time. So you need a theocracy. And so for much of human history in the West,

1601
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:17,840
we had a combination of monarchy and theocracy that was our form of governance, right? At the same

1602
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:25,200
time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently reread Thomas O'Kynos,

1603
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:29,760
it's very interesting to see this because he was not a dualist. He was translating Aristotle in a

1604
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:37,360
particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically

1605
02:29:37,360 --> 02:29:41,920
people are animals and very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically

1606
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:46,800
organisms with cybernetic control. And then he says that there are initial rational principles

1607
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:51,600
that humans can discover and everybody can discover them. So they are universal. If you are sane,

1608
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:55,840
you should understand, you should submit to them because you can rationally deduce them.

1609
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:02,480
And these principles are roughly, you should be willing to self-regulate correctly.

1610
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:11,040
You should be willing to do correct social regulation, it's intraorganism. You should be

1611
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:13,440
willing to act on your models. So you have skin in the game.

1612
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:21,920
And you should have goal rationality. You should be choosing the right goals to work on.

1613
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,440
So basically these three rational principles, goal rationality, he calls prudence or wisdom.

1614
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:33,440
Social regulation is justice. The correct social one and the internal regulation is

1615
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:40,320
temperance. And this, I think, willingness to act on your models is courage. And then he says

1616
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:45,040
that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues. And these

1617
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:49,360
three divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced, but they reveal themselves by the harmony,

1618
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:53,840
which means if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen, you will see that they

1619
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:59,520
make sense. And it's often been misunderstood as God has to tell you that these are the things.

1620
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:05,440
So basically there's something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe

1621
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:11,840
some guy with a long beard, that they discovered this. So these principles are relatively simple.

1622
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:16,480
Again, it's for high level organization, for the resulting civilization that you form,

1623
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:22,960
commitment to unity. So basically you serve this higher larger thing, this structural

1624
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:29,040
principle on the next level, and he calls that faith. Then there needs to be commitment to

1625
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:32,560
shared purpose. This is basically this global reward that you try to figure out what that

1626
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:36,880
should be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love. The commitment to shared purpose

1627
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:40,960
is the core of love. You see this sacred thing that is more important than your own

1628
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:45,280
organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together. And this is how you see

1629
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:50,960
the sacred in the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that

1630
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:55,600
principle without getting rewards in the here and now, because it doesn't exist yet.

1631
02:31:55,600 --> 02:32:00,000
Then you start out building the civilization. So you need to be able to do this in the absence

1632
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:04,880
of its actual existence yet. So it can come into being.

1633
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:08,960
So yeah, so the way it comes into being is by you accepting those notions and then you see

1634
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:13,680
in there these three divine concepts and you see them realized.

1635
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:18,000
Another problem is divine is a loaded concept in our world, right? Because we are outside of

1636
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,640
this cult and we are still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically we need to

1637
02:32:22,640 --> 02:32:27,840
have a civilization that acts as an intentional agent, like an insect state. And we are not

1638
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:33,760
actually a tribal species. We are a state building species. And what enabled state building is

1639
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:38,960
basically the formation of religious states and other forms of rule based administration,

1640
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:42,640
in which the individual doesn't matter as much as the rule or the higher goal.

1641
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,200
We got there by the question, what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think that

1642
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:51,760
Catholicism is the optimal form of governance because it's obviously on the way out, right?

1643
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:58,320
So it is for the present type of society that we are in. Religious institutions don't seem to be

1644
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:04,320
optimal to organize that. So what we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy.

1645
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:08,480
And democracy is the role of oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production

1646
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:14,240
that is administered not by the oligarchs themselves because there's too much disruption,

1647
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:19,200
right? We have so much innovation that we have in every generation new means of production that

1648
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:24,240
we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so. And something other

1649
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,680
takes the leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions. And these

1650
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:35,680
institutions themselves are not elected, but they provide continuity. And they are led by

1651
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,640
electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to

1652
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:44,960
kill people, right? So you can, for instance, if a change in governments, if people think that the

1653
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:50,160
current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a

1654
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:55,920
journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution has no plan B

1655
02:33:55,920 --> 02:34:01,760
like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is what when you run society by the deep state.

1656
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:08,640
So ideally you have an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens, right?

1657
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:13,600
So you will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in the West.

1658
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:18,000
And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. So it's mostly just

1659
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,880
second, third order consequences that people are modeling in the design of these institutions.

1660
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:27,520
It's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of many of

1661
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:33,680
the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that AI can help us this in a way if you can fix

1662
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:39,520
the incentives. The society of the US is the society of teeters. It's basically cheating

1663
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:43,120
is so indistinguishable from innovation and we want to encourage innovation.

1664
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:45,040
Can you elaborate on what you mean by cheating?

1665
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:49,200
It's basically people do things that they know are wrong. It's acceptable to do things that

1666
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:52,720
you know are wrong in the society to a certain degree. You can, for instance,

1667
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:56,400
suggest some non-sustainable business models and implement them.

1668
02:34:57,440 --> 02:34:59,600
Right, but you're always pushing the boundaries. I mean, you're-

1669
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,720
And yes, this is seen as a good thing largely.

1670
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:04,240
Yes.

1671
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:09,200
And this is different from other societies. So for instance, social mobility is an aspect of

1672
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:13,280
this. Social mobility is the result of individual innovation that would not be

1673
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:17,280
sustainable at scale for everybody else. Normally, you should not go up. You should

1674
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:21,440
go deep. We need bakers and indeed we are very good bakers, but in a society that

1675
02:35:21,440 --> 02:35:24,400
innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really good machine.

1676
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:29,600
That's not a bad thing and it's a thing that made the US so successful,

1677
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:33,680
but it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability but for innovation.

1678
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:39,360
And so it's not obvious as the evolutionary process is unrolling. It's not obvious that

1679
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:41,200
that long-term would be better.

1680
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:47,600
It has side effects. So basically, if you treat, you will have a certain layer of toxic sludge

1681
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:50,400
that covers everything that is a result of cheating.

1682
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:55,600
And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging

1683
02:35:55,600 --> 02:36:01,840
that the system is horrible or if the benefits actually outweigh the negative effects.

1684
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:05,840
How do we get to the which system of government is best?

1685
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,800
I'm trying to trace back the last five minutes.

1686
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:16,560
I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has

1687
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:24,800
to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons and our mind is a society of

1688
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:30,800
behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements

1689
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:36,560
regulation. And government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of

1690
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:41,040
power or local interest, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human

1691
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:47,040
survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory

1692
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:52,640
that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into

1693
02:36:52,640 --> 02:36:56,480
the next state without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a

1694
02:36:56,480 --> 02:37:01,280
bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire

1695
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:06,960
infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions,

1696
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:10,720
and there are not that many natural transitions available at any given point.

1697
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:12,160
What do you mean by natural transitions?

1698
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:14,560
So we try not to have revolutions if we can help.

1699
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:21,200
So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems in the mind,

1700
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:29,120
you've also said that in some sense becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions.

1701
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:35,200
Maybe you never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind,

1702
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:42,320
what's the role of emotion? And what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role?

1703
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:46,960
It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling,

1704
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:52,880
and in common day parlance we don't. I think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive

1705
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:57,840
system. That's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have

1706
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:02,560
an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence,

1707
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,080
your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, inter-reception or extra-reception,

1708
02:38:08,080 --> 02:38:13,120
and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way to relate to the

1709
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:17,280
environment and to yourself. And this is in some sense an emotional configuration.

1710
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:23,200
In the more narrow sense, an emotion is an affective state that has an object. And the relevance

1711
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:28,400
of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated

1712
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:32,560
with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs,

1713
02:38:32,560 --> 02:38:36,720
you act on models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifests, it's too late,

1714
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:41,120
you've done everything. But so you act on expectations, what will give you pleasure and

1715
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:46,320
pain? And these are your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy, they just coexist and compete.

1716
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:50,480
And your organism has to, or your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them.

1717
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:55,840
But the purposes need to be consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and

1718
02:38:55,840 --> 02:39:01,440
make plans. And so we organize them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution

1719
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:06,240
for this. Some people eat to make art and other people make art to eat. And they might end up

1720
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:10,560
doing the same things, but they cooperate in very different ways. Because they are ultimate goals.

1721
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:15,440
Are different. And we cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything else that is not

1722
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:22,080
cooperation on shared purpose is transactional. I don't think I understood the last piece of

1723
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:29,360
achieving the homeostasis. Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the

1724
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:36,720
expression of emotion? Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense,

1725
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:42,000
what you feel is an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it

1726
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:49,200
makes this based on your motivation and on your estimates, not your, but of the subconscious

1727
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:54,240
geometric parts of your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a

1728
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:59,520
neural network. And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind,

1729
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:06,400
to your conscious attention via mapping them as features into a space. So what you will feel

1730
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:11,360
about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your

1731
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:17,360
solar plexus. And you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry, right? Your body map is

1732
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:22,880
the space that is always instantiated and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat if your

1733
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:29,440
non symbolic parts of your brain try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map

1734
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:33,600
the feelings into the body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant and unpleasant,

1735
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:38,000
depending on whether the appraisal has a negative or positive valence. And then you have

1736
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:42,800
different features of them that give you more knowledge about the nature of what you're feeling.

1737
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:46,400
So for instance, when you feel connected to other people, you typically feel this in your

1738
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:51,120
chest region around your heart. And you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're

1739
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:56,720
reaching out, right? And it's very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's encoded

1740
02:40:56,720 --> 02:41:00,400
like this for most people. It's encoded. It's a code. It's a code in which the non symbolic

1741
02:41:00,400 --> 02:41:04,960
parts of your mind talk to the symbolic ones. And then the expression of emotion is then the

1742
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:10,320
final step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. That's part of the communication.

1743
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:15,360
This probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to

1744
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:20,400
observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they are in,

1745
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:25,200
others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state.

1746
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:29,360
So we now look at the inflections, at the difference between the standard phase that

1747
02:41:29,360 --> 02:41:33,120
they're going to make in this situation, right? When you are at a funeral, everybody expects

1748
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:37,200
you to make a solemn face. But the solemn face doesn't express whether you're sad or not. It

1749
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:42,080
just expresses that you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that

1750
02:41:42,080 --> 02:41:47,280
you are triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the

1751
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:55,520
delta between a truly sad expression and the things that are animated, mating this face behind

1752
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:01,120
the curtain. So the interesting thing is, so having done these, having done this podcast

1753
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:08,320
and the video component, one of the things I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I just don't

1754
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:15,040
know how to express emotion on my face when I see that as weakness. But whatever the people look to

1755
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:22,240
me after you say something, they look to my face to help them see how they should feel about what

1756
02:42:22,240 --> 02:42:27,840
we said, which is fascinating because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did

1757
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:32,880
you particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting, it makes

1758
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:39,200
me cognizant of I'm part, like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I'm part

1759
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:46,400
of the play that you're the key actor and by making my facial expressions and therefore

1760
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:52,640
telling the narrative of what the big point is, which is fascinating, makes me cognizant that

1761
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:57,440
I'm supposed to be making facial expressions. Even this conversation is hard because my preference

1762
02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:03,840
will be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen. Yes, I understand this because

1763
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:09,360
it's intrusive to interact with others this way and basically Eastern European society have a

1764
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:15,360
taboo against that and especially Russia, the further you go to the east and in the US it's

1765
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:21,040
the opposite, you're expected to be hyperanimated in your face and you're also expected to show

1766
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:28,160
positive effect. And if you show positive effect without a good reason in Russia, people will

1767
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:36,800
think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person. Exactly and here positive effect without reason

1768
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:42,880
goes either appreciate or go unnoticed. No, it's the default, it's being expected,

1769
02:43:42,960 --> 02:43:50,240
everything is amazing. Have you seen this Lego movie? No, there was a diagram where somebody

1770
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:57,120
gave the appraisals that exist in US and Russia, so you have your bell curve and the lower 10%

1771
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:08,640
in US are, it's a good start. Everything above the lowest 10% is amazing. And for Russians,

1772
02:44:08,640 --> 02:44:16,240
everything below the top 10% is terrible. And then everything except the top percent is,

1773
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:19,840
I don't like it and the top percent is even so.

1774
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:30,400
Yeah, it's funny, but it's kind of true. There's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how we construct

1775
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:36,960
meaning in the US. Usually you focus on the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative

1776
02:44:36,960 --> 02:44:45,040
aspects. And in our Eastern European traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something

1777
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:49,040
above the water line, you also need to put something below the water line because existence

1778
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:55,360
by itself is as best neutral. Right, that's the basic intuition, at best neutral, or it could

1779
02:44:55,360 --> 02:44:59,520
be just suffering, the default. There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty

1780
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:05,280
are inextricably linked to the reality of suffering. And to not acknowledge the reality

1781
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:09,200
of suffering means that you are really stupid and unaware of the fact that basically every

1782
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:17,120
conscious being spends most of the time suffering. Yeah, you just summarized the ethos of the Eastern

1783
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:22,400
Europe. Yeah, most of life is suffering with occasional moments of beauty. And if your

1784
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:28,720
facial expressions don't acknowledge the abundance of suffering in the world and in existence itself,

1785
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:34,960
then you must be an idiot. It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the US and you

1786
02:45:35,360 --> 02:45:40,240
in some sense preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that

1787
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:46,320
are embedded in your own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid and

1788
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:52,720
asks you, why is Ariel not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. She's a

1789
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:57,520
siren. Sirens eat people. You don't play with your foot. It does not end well. And then you tell her

1790
02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:01,760
the original story, which is not the one by Anderson, which is the romantic one. And there's

1791
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:10,640
a much darker one, the Ondine story. What happened? So Ondine is a mermaid or a water woman. She lives

1792
02:46:10,640 --> 02:46:15,440
on the ground of a river and she meets this prince and they fall enough. And the prince really,

1793
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:20,800
really wants to be with her. And she says, okay, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman.

1794
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:24,240
If you marry somebody else, even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe

1795
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:29,760
underwater and have other things to do than managing your kingdom with you up here, you will die.

1796
02:46:30,720 --> 02:46:35,040
And eventually, after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her and

1797
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:41,520
she shows up and quietly goes into his chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do

1798
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:46,480
so because she is fierce. And she comes quietly and sat out of his chamber and they ask her,

1799
02:46:47,440 --> 02:46:50,320
what has happened? What did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death.

1800
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:58,640
Well done. And you know the Anderson story, right? In the Anderson story, the mermaid is playing

1801
02:46:58,640 --> 02:47:03,680
with this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and she cannot live out there. So

1802
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:10,560
she is giving up her voice and her tale for a human-like appearance so she can walk among the

1803
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:15,760
humans. But this guy does not recognize that she is the one that she would marry. Instead,

1804
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:20,720
he marries somebody who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his

1805
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:33,280
own kingdom and so on as he should. She dies. Yeah. Instead, Disney, the little mermaid story

1806
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:37,040
has a little bit of a happy ending. That's the western, that's the American way.

1807
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:42,000
My own problem is this, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other things. So I'm

1808
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,960
indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You

1809
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:51,840
sacrifice your life for romantic love. That's what you do because if you are confronted with either

1810
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:57,840
serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing under the economic and social and other

1811
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:06,080
human incentives, that's wrong. You should follow your heart. So do you think suffering is fundamental

1812
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:12,240
to happiness along these lines? No. Suffering is the result of caring about things that you cannot

1813
02:48:12,240 --> 02:48:17,120
change. And if you are able to change what you care about to those things that you can change,

1814
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:23,840
you will not suffer. Would you then be able to experience happiness? Yes. But happiness itself

1815
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:28,800
is not important. Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child, you think cookies are very

1816
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:32,320
important and you want to have all the cookies in the world. You look forward to being an adult

1817
02:48:32,320 --> 02:48:36,720
because then you have as many cookies as you want, right? Yes. But as an adult, you realize a

1818
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:41,280
cookie is a tool. It's a tool to make you eat vegetables. And once you eat your vegetables

1819
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:45,120
anyway, you stop eating cookies for the most part because otherwise you will get diabetes

1820
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:49,360
and will not be around for your kids. Yes. But then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie.

1821
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:55,680
If scarcity is enforced, nevertheless, the pleasure comes from the scarcity. Yes. But

1822
02:48:55,680 --> 02:49:00,400
the happiness is a cookie that your brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the environment.

1823
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:04,400
The environment cannot make you happy. It's your appraisal of the environment that makes you happy.

1824
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:08,480
And if you can change the appraisal of the environment that you can learn to, then you

1825
02:49:08,480 --> 02:49:12,720
can create arbitrary states of happiness. And some meditators fall into this trap. So they

1826
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:16,560
discover the room, this basement room in their brain where the cookies are made,

1827
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:21,040
and they indulge in stuff themselves. And after a few months, it gets really old and the big crisis

1828
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:26,640
of meaning comes. Because they thought before that their unhappiness was the result of not

1829
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:30,560
being happy enough. So they fixed this, right? They can release the newer transmitters at will

1830
02:49:30,560 --> 02:49:37,040
if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is,

1831
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:40,960
why do I live? How can I make a sustainable civilization that is meaningful to me?

1832
02:49:40,960 --> 02:49:44,560
How can I insert myself into this? And this was the problem that you couldn't solve in the first

1833
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:53,840
place. But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same question. What is the answer to that?

1834
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:59,920
What could the possible answer be of the meaning of life? What could an answer be? What is it to you?

1835
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:04,480
I think that if you look at the meaning of life, you look at what the cell is.

1836
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:10,320
The life is the cell. Yes, or this principle, the cell. It's this

1837
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:15,280
self-organizing thing that can participate in evolution. In order to make it work,

1838
02:50:15,280 --> 02:50:20,400
it's a molecular machine. It needs a self-replicator and like entropy extractor and a Turing machine.

1839
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:24,720
If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell and it is not living, right? And life is

1840
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:29,520
basically the emergent complexity over that principle. Once you have this intelligent super

1841
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:34,080
molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot make it do. It's probably the optimal

1842
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:39,600
computronium, especially in terms of resilience. It's very hard to sterilize a planet once it's

1843
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:47,680
infected with life. So it's active function of these three components of the supercell of cell

1844
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:53,280
is present in the cell, is present in us, and it's just... We are just an expression of the cell.

1845
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:58,320
It's a certain layer of complexity in the organization of cells. So in a way, it's

1846
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:03,200
tempting to think of the cell as a von Neumann probe. If you want to build intelligence on

1847
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:08,640
other planets, the best way to do this is to infect them with cells and wait for long enough.

1848
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:12,800
And with a reasonable chance, the stuff is going to evolve into an information processing

1849
02:51:12,800 --> 02:51:19,520
principle that is general enough to become sentient. Well, that idea is very akin to the same

1850
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:23,040
dream and beautiful ideas that are expressed to cellular automata in their most simple

1851
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:29,760
mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some basic mechanisms of replication and

1852
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:35,440
basic rules, amazing things would emerge. And the cell is able to do something that James

1853
02:51:35,440 --> 02:51:41,120
Trady calls existential design. He points out that in technical design, we go from the outside in.

1854
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:45,200
We work in a highly controlled environment in which everything is deterministic, like our

1855
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:51,520
computers, our labs, or our engineering workshops. And then we use this determinism to implement a

1856
02:51:51,520 --> 02:51:56,240
particular kind of function that we dream up and that seamlessly interfaces with all the other

1857
02:51:56,240 --> 02:52:00,880
deterministic functions that we already have in our world. So it's basically from the outside in.

1858
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:08,160
And biological systems designed from the inside out as seed will become a seedling by taking some

1859
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:14,320
of the relatively unorganized matter around it and turn it into its own structure and thereby

1860
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:19,200
subdue the environment. And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells having a similar

1861
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:25,520
organization that is already compatible. But unless that's there, the cell needs to divide to

1862
02:52:25,520 --> 02:52:30,400
create that structure by itself. So it's a self-organizing principle that works on a

1863
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:36,640
somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in the sense is to produce complexity.

1864
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:40,480
And the complexity allows you to harvest like entropy gradients that you couldn't harvest

1865
02:52:40,480 --> 02:52:45,520
without the complexity. And in this sense, intelligence and life are very strongly connected

1866
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:50,480
because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control and the conditions of complexity. So

1867
02:52:50,480 --> 02:52:56,720
basically you shift the boundary between the ordered systems into the realm of chaos. You

1868
02:52:56,720 --> 02:53:02,080
build bridgeheads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we are doing. This is not

1869
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:05,840
necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors for that we are

1870
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:09,920
involved for outside of the priors, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists if a mind projects

1871
02:53:09,920 --> 02:53:17,280
it. That is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is to try to

1872
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:23,200
build and maintain a sustainable civilization. And taking a slight step out outside of that,

1873
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:34,720
we talked about a man with a beard and God. But something, some mechanism perhaps must have

1874
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:42,480
planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God?

1875
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:45,760
And what would that look like? So if there was no spontaneous

1876
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:52,720
abiogenesis, in the sense that the first cell formed by some happy random accidents where

1877
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:55,840
the molecules just happen to be in the right constellation to each other. But there could

1878
02:53:55,840 --> 02:54:02,000
also be the mechanism of, that allows for the random, I mean, there's like turtles all the way

1879
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,640
down. There seems to be, there has to be a head turtle at the bottom. Let's consider something

1880
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:11,600
really wild. Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant could become intelligent?

1881
02:54:12,240 --> 02:54:17,360
What would that involve? So imagine that you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on the gas

1882
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:22,560
giants like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these storm

1883
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:27,040
systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something.

1884
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:32,400
And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds and thereby

1885
02:54:32,480 --> 02:54:36,640
produce some self-sabilizing patterns that eventually to regulation feedback loops,

1886
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:42,320
nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such a thing that basically has emergent,

1887
02:54:42,320 --> 02:54:46,720
self-sustaining, self-organizing complexity. And at some point, this fakes up and realizes

1888
02:54:46,720 --> 02:54:51,360
and basically lambs Solaris. I am a sinking planet, but I will not replicate because I

1889
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:57,120
can recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence

1890
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:03,040
that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds a von Neumann probe. And the

1891
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:07,040
best von Neumann probe for such a thing might be the cell. So maybe it, because it's very,

1892
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:12,000
very clever and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out. And one of them has infected our

1893
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:15,840
planet. And I'm not suggesting that this is the case, but it would be compatible with the

1894
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:21,440
Prince Birmingham hypothesis. And with my intuition that our biogenesis is very unlikely.

1895
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:25,600
It's possible, but you probably need to roll the cosmic dice very often,

1896
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:28,240
maybe more often than there are planetary surfaces. I don't know.

1897
02:55:29,440 --> 02:55:37,360
So God is just a large enough, a system that's large enough that allows randomness.

1898
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:41,440
Now, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation. I think it's a mistranslation

1899
02:55:41,440 --> 02:55:46,800
of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is actually the childhood

1900
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:52,960
memories of a God. So the, when, sorry, the Genesis is the childhood memories of a God.

1901
02:55:52,960 --> 02:56:00,240
It's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being. And we typically interpret

1902
02:56:00,240 --> 02:56:06,800
Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being. And I think when you'll

1903
02:56:06,800 --> 02:56:13,280
read it, there is light and darkness that is being created. And then you discover sky and

1904
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:20,080
ground, create them. You construct the plants and the animals, and you give everything their

1905
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:24,960
names and so on. That's basically cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that

1906
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:28,880
every mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have children, you

1907
02:56:28,880 --> 02:56:34,400
can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness, and then they make out directions in it,

1908
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:37,760
and they discover sky and ground, and they discover the plants and the animals, and they

1909
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:42,080
give everything their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind, because it's

1910
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:46,480
not given, right? Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns on your

1911
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:53,040
retina. Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it, this would

1912
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:57,840
not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not have the magical

1913
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:04,160
power to give meaning to our existence, right? So this equation of a creator God with the God of

1914
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:10,320
meaning is laid off hand. You shouldn't do it. The other one that is done in Catholicism is the

1915
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:15,520
equation of the first mover, the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton that

1916
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:21,200
runs the universe. Aristotle says, if things are moving and things seem to be moving here,

1917
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:25,440
something must move them, right? If something moves them, something must move the thing that

1918
02:57:25,440 --> 02:57:30,320
is moving it. So there must be a prime mover. This idea to say that this prime mover is a

1919
02:57:30,320 --> 02:57:36,800
supernatural being is complete nonsense, right? It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we

1920
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:42,640
have to explain the enormity that this automaton exists at all. But again, we don't have any

1921
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:48,480
possibility to infer anything about its properties except that it's able to produce change in

1922
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:53,680
information, right? So there needs to be some kind of computational principle. This is all there is.

1923
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:58,160
But to say this automaton is identical again with the creator of first cause or with the

1924
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:05,520
thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion. Now, I think that what we perceive is the higher

1925
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:10,800
being that we are part of. And the higher being that we are part of is the civilization. It's the

1926
02:58:10,800 --> 02:58:16,800
thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell has to our body. And we have this prior

1927
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:22,800
because we have evolved to organize in these structures. So basically, the Christian God

1928
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:27,520
in its natural form without the mythology, if you undress it, is basically the platonic form of

1929
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:35,280
the civilization. Is the ideal? Yes, it's this ideal that you try to approximate when you interact

1930
02:58:35,280 --> 02:58:42,640
with others, not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right. Wow, we covered a lot

1931
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:48,640
of ground. And we left with one of my favorite lines. And there's many, which is happiness

1932
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:58,240
is a cookie that the brain bakes itself. It's been a huge honor and a pleasure to talk to you.

1933
02:58:58,240 --> 02:59:03,920
I'm sure our paths will cross many times again. Josh, thank you so much for talking today.

1934
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:08,240
Thank you, Lex. It was so much fun. I enjoyed it. Awesome.

1935
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:38,560
Supporting on Patreon or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.

1936
02:59:39,600 --> 02:59:42,640
And yes, try to figure out how to spell it without the E.

1937
02:59:43,600 --> 02:59:47,120
And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Yoshabach.

1938
02:59:48,320 --> 02:59:53,760
If you take this as a computer game metaphor, this is the best level for humanity to play.

1939
02:59:54,560 --> 03:00:00,960
And this best level happens to be the last level as it happens against the backdrop

1940
03:00:00,960 --> 03:00:04,640
of a dying world. But it's still the best level.

1941
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:16,880
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
