00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The following is a conversation with Tyler Cohen, an economist at George Mason University

00:04.960 --> 00:11.520
and co-creator of an amazing economics blog called Marginal Revolution. Author of many books,

00:11.520 --> 00:17.200
including The Great Stagnation, Average is Over, and his most recent Big Business,

00:17.200 --> 00:23.360
a love letter to an American anti-hero. He's truly a polymath in his work, including his love

00:23.360 --> 00:29.520
for food, which makes his amazing podcast called Conversations with Tyler really fun to listen

00:29.520 --> 00:37.520
to. Quick mention of our sponsors, Linode, ExpressVPN, SimplySafe, and Public Goods. Check

00:37.520 --> 00:43.920
them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, given Tyler's culinary

00:43.920 --> 00:50.000
explorations, let me say that one of the things that makes me sad about my love-hate relationship

00:50.000 --> 00:56.560
with food is that while I've found a simple diet, plain meat and veggies that makes me happy

00:56.560 --> 01:02.000
in day-to-day life, I sometimes wish I had the mental ability to moderate consumption of food

01:02.000 --> 01:07.520
so that I could truly enjoy meals that go way outside of that diet. I've seen my mom, for example,

01:07.520 --> 01:13.680
enjoy a single piece of chocolate, and yet if I were to eat one piece of chocolate, the odds are high

01:13.680 --> 01:18.160
that I would end up eating the whole box. This is definitely something I would like to fix,

01:18.160 --> 01:23.760
because some of the amazing artistry in this world happens in the kitchen, and some of the

01:23.760 --> 01:30.160
richest human experiences happen over a unique meal. I recently was eating cheeseburgers with Joe

01:30.160 --> 01:36.400
Rogan and John Donahar late at night in Austin talking about jiu-jitsu and life, and I was

01:36.400 --> 01:43.120
distinctly aware of the magic of that experience, magic made possible by the incredibly delicious

01:43.120 --> 01:49.840
cheeseburgers. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Tyler Cohen.

01:50.800 --> 01:57.440
Would you say economics is more art or science or philosophy or even magic? What is it?

01:58.000 --> 02:03.440
Economics is interesting because it's all of the above. To start with magic, the notion that you

02:03.440 --> 02:08.240
can make some change and simply everyone's better off, that is a kind of modern magic

02:08.240 --> 02:13.920
that has replaced old-style magic. It's an art in the sense that the models are not very exact.

02:14.480 --> 02:18.400
It's a science in the sense that occasionally propositions are falsified,

02:18.480 --> 02:23.360
are a few basic things we know, and however trivial they may sound, if you don't know them,

02:23.360 --> 02:29.200
you're out of luck. So all of the above. But from my outsider's perspective, economics

02:29.920 --> 02:37.920
is sometimes able to formulate very simple, almost like E equals MC squared, general models of how

02:37.920 --> 02:46.320
our human society will function when you do a certain thing. But it seems impossible or almost

02:46.320 --> 02:52.320
way too optimistic to think that a single formula or just a set of simple principles can describe

02:53.760 --> 02:58.400
behavior of billions of human beings with all the complexity that we have involved.

02:58.400 --> 03:05.840
So do you have a sense there's a hope for economics to have those kinds of physics level

03:05.840 --> 03:10.480
descriptions and models of the world, or is it just our desperate attempts as humans to make sense

03:10.560 --> 03:17.840
of it even though it's more desperate than rigorous and serious and actually predictable,

03:17.840 --> 03:23.360
like a physics type science? I don't think economics will ever be very predictive.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.200
It's most useful for helping you ask better questions. You look at something like game theory.

03:29.200 --> 03:34.240
Well, game theory never predicted USA and USSR would have a war, would not have a war,

03:34.800 --> 03:39.360
but trying to think through the logic of strategic conflict. If you know game theory,

03:39.360 --> 03:45.280
it's just a much more interesting discussion. Are you surprised that we, speaking of the Soviet

03:45.280 --> 03:49.760
Union and the United States, and speaking of game theory, are you surprised that we haven't

03:49.760 --> 03:55.040
destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons yet, like that simple formulation of mutually assured

03:55.040 --> 04:02.240
destruction? That's a good example of an explanation that perhaps allows us to ask better questions,

04:02.240 --> 04:08.240
but it seems to have actually described the reality of why we haven't destroyed ourselves

04:08.240 --> 04:14.400
with these ultra-powerful weapons. Are you surprised? Do you think the game theory explanation

04:14.400 --> 04:20.480
is at all accurate there? I think we will destroy each other with those weapons. Eventually?

04:20.480 --> 04:26.560
Eventually. Look, it's a very low probability event, so I'm not surprised it hasn't happened yet.

04:26.560 --> 04:31.840
I'm a little surprised it came as close as it did. Your general thinking, realizing it might have

04:31.840 --> 04:36.640
just been a flock of birds or it wasn't a first strike attack from the USA, we got very lucky

04:36.640 --> 04:41.280
on that one. But if you just keep on running the clock on a low probability event,

04:42.080 --> 04:48.400
it will happen. It may not be USA and China, USA and Russia, whatever. It could be the Saudis and

04:48.400 --> 04:52.640
Turkey. It might not be nuclear weapons, it might be some other destruction. Bio weapons,

04:52.640 --> 04:58.640
but it simply will happen, is my view. I've argued at best we have seven or eight hundred years,

04:58.640 --> 05:02.000
and that's being generous. Worst? How long we got?

05:02.960 --> 05:08.800
Well, maybe it's like a person arrival process, right? So, tiny probability could come anytime,

05:09.520 --> 05:16.960
probably not in your lifetime, but the chance presumably increases the cheaper weapons of

05:16.960 --> 05:23.040
mass destruction are. So, the person process description doesn't take in consideration

05:23.040 --> 05:28.880
the game theoretic aspect. So, another way to consider is repeated games, iterative games.

05:29.680 --> 05:35.040
So, is there something about our human nature that allows us to fight against

05:35.920 --> 05:42.560
probability? Reduce, like the closer we get to trouble, the more we're able to figure out how

05:42.560 --> 05:48.560
to avoid trouble. The same thing is for when you take exams or you go and take classes,

05:48.560 --> 05:53.360
the closer or paper deadlines, the closer you get to a deadline, the better you start to perform

05:53.360 --> 05:57.840
and get your shit together. It actually gets stuff done. I'm really not so negative on human

05:57.920 --> 06:03.760
nature. And as an economist, I very much see the gains from cooperation. But if you just ask,

06:03.760 --> 06:08.480
are there outliers in history? Like, was there a Hitler? For instance. Obviously. And again,

06:08.480 --> 06:14.400
you let the clock tick. Another Hitler with nuclear weapons doesn't, per se, care about his own

06:14.400 --> 06:20.560
destruction. It will happen. So, your sense is fundamentally people are good, but-

06:20.560 --> 06:24.720
A trembling hand equilibrium is what we would call it. Trumbling hand equilibrium?

06:25.360 --> 06:30.080
That the basic logic is for cooperation, which is mostly what we've seen,

06:30.080 --> 06:35.280
even between enemies. But every now and then, someone does something crazy and you don't

06:35.280 --> 06:40.880
know how to react to it. And you can't always beat Hitler. Sometimes, Hitler drags you down.

06:41.520 --> 06:48.480
To push back is it possible that the crazier the person, the less likely they are,

06:49.440 --> 06:57.360
and in a way where we're safe. Meaning, this is the kind of proposition- I had the discussion

06:57.360 --> 07:06.080
with my dad as a physicist about this, where he thinks that if you have a graph, evil people

07:06.080 --> 07:12.400
can't also be geniuses. So, this is his defense why evil people will not get control of nuclear

07:12.400 --> 07:20.800
weapons, because to be truly evil. But evil meaning, you can argue that not even the evil of

07:20.800 --> 07:25.120
Hitler we're talking about, because Hitler had a kind of view of Germany and all those kinds of-

07:26.400 --> 07:30.800
He probably deluded himself and the people around him to think that he's actually doing good for

07:30.800 --> 07:35.600
the world, similar with Stalin and so on. By evil, I mean more like almost like terrorists,

07:35.600 --> 07:42.080
to where they want to destroy themselves and the world. Those people will never be able to be

07:42.800 --> 07:48.720
actually skilled enough to do, to deliver that kind of mass scale destruction. So, the hope is

07:49.280 --> 07:56.560
that it's very unlikely that the kind of evil that would lead to extinctions of humans or mass

07:56.560 --> 08:03.120
destruction is so unlikely that we're able to last way longer than some 100, 800 years.

08:04.160 --> 08:09.680
It's very unlikely in that sense. I accept the argument, but that's why you need to let the clock

08:10.320 --> 08:15.680
It's also the best argument for bureaucracy. To negotiate a bureaucracy, it actually selects

08:15.680 --> 08:20.320
against pure evil, because you need to build alliances. So, bureaucracy in that regard is

08:20.320 --> 08:25.840
great, right? It keeps out the worst apples. But look, put it this way, could you imagine 35 years

08:25.840 --> 08:33.120
from now, the Osama bin Laden of the future has nukes or very bad bio-weapons? It seems to me,

08:33.120 --> 08:39.520
you can. And Osama was pretty evil. And actually, even he failed, right? But nonetheless,

08:40.080 --> 08:45.360
that's what the 700 or 800 years is there for. And it might be destructive technology that don't

08:45.360 --> 08:52.560
have such a high cost of production or such a high learning curve, like cyber attacks or

08:52.560 --> 08:57.680
artificial intelligence, all those kinds of things. So, yeah. I mean, let me ask you a question. Let's

08:57.760 --> 09:03.440
say you could as an active will, by spending a million dollars obliterate any city on earth,

09:03.440 --> 09:08.320
and everyone in it dies, and you'll get caught, and you'll be sentenced to death,

09:08.320 --> 09:13.680
but you can make it happen just by willing it. How many months does it take before that happens?

09:15.760 --> 09:19.280
So, the obvious answer is like very soon. There's probably a good answer for that,

09:19.280 --> 09:22.640
because you can consider how many millionaires there are, how many you can look at that, right?

09:23.520 --> 09:28.160
I have a sense that there's just people that have a million dollars.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.960
I mean, there's a certain amount, but have a million dollars,

09:33.600 --> 09:41.200
have other interests that will outweigh the interest of destroying the entire city.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.480
Like, there's a particular, you know, like, I mean, maybe that's a hope.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.560
It's why we should be nice to the wealthy, too, right?

09:51.280 --> 09:57.040
Yeah, all that trash talking is Bill Gates. We should stop that, because that doesn't inspire

09:57.040 --> 10:03.520
the other future Bill Gates is to be nice to the world. It's true. But your sense is that

10:03.520 --> 10:06.560
cheaper guests to destroy the world, the more likely it becomes.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.520
Now, when I say destroy the world, there's a trick in there. I don't think literally every human

10:11.520 --> 10:17.040
will die. But it would set back civilization by an extraordinary degree. It's then just

10:17.040 --> 10:19.120
hard to predict what comes next. Yeah.

10:19.120 --> 10:23.360
But a catastrophe where everyone dies, that probably has to be something more like an

10:23.360 --> 10:29.040
asteroid or supernova. And those are purely exogenous for the time being, at least.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.640
So, I immigrated to this country. I was born in the Soviet Union in Russia.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.520
And which one?

10:37.520 --> 10:41.440
Again, it's an important question. You were born in the Soviet Union, right?

10:41.440 --> 10:46.480
Yes, I was born in the Soviet Union. The rest is details, but I grew up in Moscow, Russia.

10:47.360 --> 10:53.920
But I came to this country and this country even back there, but it's always symbolized to me

10:53.920 --> 11:01.120
a place of opportunity where everybody could build the most incredible things,

11:01.120 --> 11:07.440
especially in the engineering side of things, just invent and build and scale and have a huge

11:07.440 --> 11:13.440
impact on the world. And that's been, to me, that's my version of the American ideal, the American

11:13.440 --> 11:23.760
dream. Do you think the American dream is still there? What do you think of that notion in itself?

11:23.760 --> 11:28.720
From an economics perspective, from a human perspective, is it still alive? And how do you

11:28.720 --> 11:34.560
think about it? The American dream? The American dream is mostly still there. If you look at which

11:34.560 --> 11:41.680
groups are the highest earners, it is individuals from India and individuals from Iran, which is a

11:41.680 --> 11:47.760
fairly new development, great for them, not necessarily easy. Both you could call persons of

11:47.760 --> 11:54.000
color, may have faced discrimination, also on the grounds of religion, yet they've done it. That's

11:54.000 --> 11:59.120
amazing. It says great things about America. Now, if you look at Native-born Americans, the story's

11:59.120 --> 12:06.560
trickier. People think intergenerational mobility has declined a lot recently, but it has not for

12:06.560 --> 12:12.800
Native-born Americans. For about, I think, 40 years it's been fairly constant, which is sort of good.

12:13.760 --> 12:20.640
But compared to much earlier times, it was much higher in the past. I'm not sure we can replicate

12:20.640 --> 12:25.360
that, because look, go to the beginning of the 20th century. Very few Americans finish high school

12:26.640 --> 12:30.800
or even have much wealth. There's not much credentialism. There aren't that many credentials.

12:30.800 --> 12:36.320
So there's more upward mobility across the generations than today. And it's a good thing

12:36.320 --> 12:43.200
that we had it. I'm not sure we should blame the modern world for not being able to reproduce that.

12:43.200 --> 12:49.520
But look, the general issue of who gets into Harvard or Cornell, is there an injustice? Should

12:49.520 --> 12:55.360
we fix that? Is there too little opportunity for the bottoms, say, half of Americans? Absolutely.

12:55.360 --> 13:00.320
It's a disgrace how this country has evolved in that way. And in that sense, the American dream

13:00.320 --> 13:05.920
is clearly ailing. But it has had problems from the beginning for blacks, for women, for many other

13:05.920 --> 13:12.240
groups. I mean, isn't that the whole challenge of opportunity and freedom is that it's hard and

13:12.960 --> 13:19.680
the difficulty of how hard it is to move up in society is unequal often. And that's the injustice

13:19.680 --> 13:25.600
of society. But the whole point of that freedom is that over time, it becomes better and better.

13:25.600 --> 13:35.920
You start to fix the leaks, the issues, and it keeps progressing in that kind of way. But ultimately,

13:35.920 --> 13:40.960
there's always the opportunity, even if it's harder, there's the opportunity to create something

13:40.960 --> 13:47.760
truly special, to move up, to be president, to be a leader in whatever the industry that you're

13:47.760 --> 13:54.400
passionate about. We each have podcasts in English. The value of joining that American English

13:54.400 --> 13:59.520
language network is much higher today than it was 30 years ago, mostly because of the internet.

14:00.240 --> 14:06.480
So that makes immigration returns themselves skewed. So going to the US, Canada, or the UK,

14:07.120 --> 14:11.200
I think has become much more valuable in relative terms than, say, going to France,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.680
would just still a pretty well off, very nice country.

14:16.480 --> 14:21.680
If you had gone to France, your chance of having a globally known podcast would be much smaller.

14:21.680 --> 14:28.480
Yeah, this is the interesting thing about how much intellectual influence the United States has.

14:28.480 --> 14:33.440
I don't know if it's connected to what we're discussing here, the freedom and the opportunity

14:33.520 --> 14:40.480
of the American dream. Or does it make any sense to you that we have so much impact on the rest

14:40.480 --> 14:48.880
of the world in terms of ideas? Is it just simply because the English is the primary language of

14:48.880 --> 14:54.320
the world, or is there something fundamental to the United States that drives the development of

14:54.320 --> 15:04.400
ideas? It's almost like what's cool, what's entertaining, what's meme culture, the internet

15:04.400 --> 15:12.160
culture, the philosophers, the intellectuals, the podcasts, the movies, music, all that stuff,

15:12.160 --> 15:16.560
driving culture. There's something above and beyond language in the United States.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.880
It's a sense of entertainment, really mattering, how to connect with your audience,

15:20.880 --> 15:26.400
being direct and getting to the point, how humor is integrated even with science.

15:27.200 --> 15:32.560
That is pretty strongly represented here, much more so than on the European continent.

15:32.560 --> 15:37.120
Britain has its own version of this, which it does very well. Not surprisingly,

15:37.120 --> 15:42.400
they're hugely influential in music, comedy, most of the other areas you mention. Canada,

15:42.400 --> 15:47.680
yes, but their best talent tends to come here. You could say it's like a broader North American

15:47.680 --> 15:53.120
thing and give them their fair share of credit. What about science? There's a sense,

15:54.640 --> 15:59.120
higher education is really strong, research is really strong in the United States, but it just

15:59.120 --> 16:05.760
feels like culturally speaking, when we zoom out, scientists aren't very cool here.

16:07.440 --> 16:13.200
Most people wouldn't be able to name basically a single scientist. Maybe they would say what,

16:13.440 --> 16:18.880
Einstein and Neil deGrasse Tyson, maybe. Neil deGrasse Tyson isn't exactly a scientist. He's

16:18.880 --> 16:28.800
a science communicator. There's not the same admiration of science and innovators as there is

16:28.800 --> 16:38.080
of athletes or actors, actresses, musicians. You can become a celebrity scientist if you want to.

16:38.160 --> 16:43.680
May or may not be best for science. We have Spock from Star Trek, who is still a big deal,

16:44.240 --> 16:49.760
but look at it this way. Which country is most comfortable with inegalitarian rewards

16:49.760 --> 16:54.160
for scientists, whether it's fame or money? I still think it's here. Some of that's just

16:54.160 --> 16:59.600
the tax rate. Some of it is a lot of America is set up for rich people to live really well.

17:00.320 --> 17:05.440
Again, that's going to attract a lot of top talent. You ask the two best vaccines. I know

17:05.440 --> 17:10.320
the Pfizer vaccine is sorted from Germany, sorted from Turkey, but it's nonetheless

17:11.280 --> 17:17.360
being distributed through the United States, Moderna, an ethnic Armenian immigrant through

17:17.360 --> 17:22.160
Lebanon, first to Canada, then down here to Boston, Cambridge area. Those are incredible

17:22.160 --> 17:29.840
vaccines. US nailed it. Yeah. Well, that's more almost like the, I don't know what you would call

17:30.080 --> 17:36.160
engineering the sort of scaling. That's what US is really good at, not just inventing of ideas,

17:36.160 --> 17:40.960
but taking an idea and actually building the thing and scaling it and being able to distribute it

17:40.960 --> 17:50.000
at scale. I think some people would attribute that to the general word of capitalism. I don't

17:50.000 --> 17:57.760
know if you would. Sure. What in your views are the pros and cons of capitalism as it's

17:57.760 --> 18:02.960
implemented in America? I don't know if you would say capitalism has really existed in America,

18:02.960 --> 18:08.240
but to the extent that it does. People use the word capitalism in so many different ways.

18:08.240 --> 18:13.360
What is capitalism? The literal meaning is private ownership of capital goods,

18:13.360 --> 18:18.880
which I favor in most areas, but no, I don't think the private sector should own our F-16s

18:18.880 --> 18:24.800
or military assets. Government-owned water utilities seem to work as well as privately

18:24.800 --> 18:31.520
owned water utilities, but with all those qualifications put to the side, business,

18:32.720 --> 18:37.920
for the most part, innovates better than government. It is oriented toward consumer services.

18:37.920 --> 18:43.520
The biggest businesses tend to pay the highest wages. Business is great at getting things done.

18:43.520 --> 18:49.040
USA is fundamentally a nation of business, and that makes us a nation of opportunity.

18:49.440 --> 18:53.280
I am indeed mostly a fan, subject to numerous caveats.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.960
What's the con? What are some negative downsides of capitalism

19:00.160 --> 19:05.520
in your view or some things that we should be concerned about maybe for long-term impacts of

19:05.520 --> 19:12.880
capitalism? Capitalism takes a different form in each country. I would say in the United States,

19:12.880 --> 19:19.280
our weird blend of whatever you want to call it has had an enduring racial problem from the beginning,

19:20.000 --> 19:26.240
has been a force of taking away land from Native Americans and oppressing them pretty much from

19:26.240 --> 19:36.880
the beginning. It has done very well by immigrants for the most part. We revel in chimpaterian

19:36.880 --> 19:42.800
creative destruction more, so we don't just prop up national champions forever, and there's a

19:42.960 --> 19:48.160
precariousness to life for some people here that is less so, say, in Germany or the Netherlands.

19:48.960 --> 19:53.760
We have weaker communities in some regards than, say, Northwestern Europe often would.

19:54.320 --> 19:59.040
That has pluses and minuses. I think it makes us more creative. It's a better country in which

19:59.040 --> 20:05.360
to be a weirdo than, say, Germany or Denmark. But there is truly, whether from the government

20:05.360 --> 20:09.920
or from your private community, there is less social security in some fundamental sense.

20:10.000 --> 20:20.400
On the point of weirdo, that's kind of a beautiful little statement. What is that? That seems to

20:20.400 --> 20:26.160
be, you could think of a guy like Elon Musk and say that he's a weirdo. Is that the sense of what

20:26.160 --> 20:32.560
you're using the weirdo? Outside of the norm, breaking conventions. Absolutely. Here, that is

20:32.560 --> 20:38.640
either acceptable or even admired or to be a loner. Since so many people are outsiders,

20:39.280 --> 20:43.040
and that where all immigrants is selecting for people who left something behind,

20:43.040 --> 20:47.360
were willing to leave behind their families, were willing to undergo a certain brutality

20:48.080 --> 20:55.600
of switch in their lives, makes us a nation of weirdos, and weirdos are creative. Denmark

20:56.560 --> 21:02.000
is not a nation of weirdos. It's a wonderful place, great for them. Ideally, you want part

21:02.000 --> 21:06.160
of the world to be fully weirdos and innovating, and the other part of the world to be a little

21:06.400 --> 21:12.800
kind of chicken shit, risk averse, and enjoy the benefit to the innovation, and to give people

21:12.800 --> 21:18.560
these smooth lives in six weeks off and free ride. Everyone's like, oh, American way versus

21:18.560 --> 21:23.520
European way, but basically they're compliments. Yeah, that's fascinating. I used to have this

21:23.520 --> 21:29.360
conversation with my parents when I was growing up, and just others from the immigrant kind of

21:29.440 --> 21:36.400
flow, and they used this term, especially in Russian, is to criticize something I was doing,

21:36.400 --> 21:43.200
that would suggest normal people don't do this. I used to be really offended by that,

21:44.480 --> 21:54.080
but as I got older, I realized that that's a kind of compliment, because in the same kind of,

21:54.640 --> 22:01.520
I would say, way that you're saying that is the American ideal, because if you want to do anything

22:01.520 --> 22:08.000
special or interesting, you don't want to be doing, in one particular avenue, what normal people do,

22:08.480 --> 22:14.640
because that won't be interesting. Russians, I think, fit in very well here,

22:14.640 --> 22:18.960
because the ones who come are weirdos, and there's a very different Russian weirdo tradition,

22:18.960 --> 22:24.240
like Alyosha, right, and Brother Skaramisov, or Perlman, the mathematician. They're weirdos,

22:24.960 --> 22:29.600
and they have their own different kind of status in Soviet Union, Russia, wherever.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.120
And when Russians come to America, they stay pretty Russian, but it seems to me a week later,

22:35.120 --> 22:41.520
they've somehow adjusted, and the ways in which they might want to be grumpier than Americans,

22:41.520 --> 22:46.720
not smile, think that people who smile are idiots. They can do that. No one takes that away from them.

22:47.040 --> 22:53.920
Yeah. Yeah. What are you on the tiny tangent? I'd love to hear a few thoughts about Grisha Perlman

22:54.880 --> 23:00.800
turning down the Fields Medal. Is that something you admire? Does that make sense to you that somebody,

23:01.920 --> 23:06.240
you know, we have the structure of Nobel Prizes, of these huge awards, of the reputations,

23:06.240 --> 23:12.960
the hierarchy of everyone saying, applauding how special you are, and here's a person who was

23:12.960 --> 23:16.720
doing one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of mathematics. It doesn't want

23:16.720 --> 23:21.120
the stupid prize and doesn't want recognition, doesn't want to do interviews, it doesn't want to be

23:21.120 --> 23:27.920
famous. What do you make of that? It's great. Look, prizes are corrupting. After scientists win

23:27.920 --> 23:32.960
Nobel Prizes, they tend to become less productive. Now, statistically, it's hard to sort out the

23:32.960 --> 23:36.800
different effects. There's a Russian toward the mean. Does the prize make you too busy? It's a

23:36.800 --> 23:43.280
little tricky, but there's not enough Nobel Prizes either to gather enough data. Right. But it's,

23:43.280 --> 23:47.680
I've known a lot of Nobel Prize winners, and it is my sense they become less productive.

23:47.680 --> 23:52.640
They repeat more of their older messages, which may be highly socially valuable. But if someone

23:52.640 --> 23:58.160
wants to turn their back on that and keep on working, which I assume is what he's doing,

23:58.160 --> 24:03.680
that's awesome. I mean, we should respect that. It's like he wins a bigger prize, right? Our extreme

24:03.680 --> 24:14.160
respect. Yeah. Well, Grisha, if you're listening, I need to talk to you soon. Okay. I've been trying

24:14.160 --> 24:20.640
to get ahold of them. Okay. Back to capitalism. I got to ask you, just competition in general,

24:20.640 --> 24:29.280
in this world of weirdos, is competition good for the world? This seems to be one of the fundamental

24:29.360 --> 24:33.680
engines of capitalism, right? Do you see it as ultimately constructive or destructive for the

24:33.680 --> 24:39.200
world? What really matters is how good your legal framework is. So competition within nature,

24:40.080 --> 24:44.960
for food, leads to bloody conflict all the time. The animal world is quite unpleasant, to say the

24:44.960 --> 24:52.720
least. If you have something like the rule of law and clearly defined property rights, which are

24:52.720 --> 24:58.240
within reason justly allocated, competition probably is going to work very well.

24:58.880 --> 25:04.000
But it's not an unalloyed good thing at all. It can be highly destructive. Military competition,

25:04.000 --> 25:08.800
right? Which actually is itself sometimes good, but it's not good per se.

25:09.920 --> 25:14.480
What aspects of life do you think we should protect from competition? So is there some,

25:15.200 --> 25:19.600
you said like the rule of law, is there some things we should keep away from competition?

25:19.600 --> 25:24.240
Well, the fight for territory most of all, right? So violence, anything that involves

25:24.240 --> 25:28.000
like actual physical violence. Right. And it's not that I think the current borders are just.

25:28.000 --> 25:34.400
I mean, go talk to Hungarians, Romanians, Serbians, Bosnians, they'll talk your ear off.

25:34.400 --> 25:39.600
And some of them are probably right. But at the end of the day, we have some kind of international

25:39.600 --> 25:46.080
order. And I would rather we more or less stick with it. If Catalonians want to leave, they keep

25:46.080 --> 25:51.200
up with it, you know, let them go. But what about a space of like healthcare? This is where you

25:51.200 --> 25:57.840
get into a tension of like between capitalism and kind of more, I don't want to use socialism,

25:57.840 --> 26:03.360
but those kinds of policies, they're less free market. I think in this country,

26:03.360 --> 26:08.000
healthcare should be much more competitive. So you go to hospitals, doctors, they don't treat

26:08.000 --> 26:13.680
you like a customer. They treat you like an idiot or like a child or someone with third party

26:13.680 --> 26:21.920
payment. And it's a pretty humiliating experience often. Yeah. Do you think free market in general

26:21.920 --> 26:28.160
is possible, like a pure free market? And is that a good goal to strive for?

26:28.160 --> 26:33.040
I don't think the term pure free markets well defined, because you need a legal order. The

26:33.040 --> 26:38.400
legal order has to make decisions on like what is intellectual property more important than ever.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.200
There's no benchmark that like represents the pure free market way of doing things.

26:43.920 --> 26:48.880
What will penalties be? How much do we put into law enforcement? No simple answers,

26:48.880 --> 26:53.840
but just saying free market doesn't pin down what you're going to do on those all important questions.

26:53.840 --> 27:00.160
So free market is an economics, I guess, idea. So there's no, it's not possible for free market

27:00.160 --> 27:04.960
to generate the rules. They're like emergent, like self governing. It generates a lot of them,

27:04.960 --> 27:09.680
right, through private norms, through trade associations. International trade is mostly

27:09.680 --> 27:16.320
done privately and by norms. So it's certainly possible. But at the end of the day, I think

27:16.320 --> 27:23.360
you need governments to draw very clear lines to prevent it from turning into mafia run systems.

27:24.080 --> 27:30.640
You know, I've been hanging out with other group of weirdos lately, Michael Malis,

27:30.640 --> 27:39.600
who espouses to be an anarchist anarchism, which is like, I think intellectually, just

27:40.880 --> 27:47.680
fascinating set of ideas, where, you know, taking free market to the full extreme of

27:47.680 --> 27:55.520
basically saying there should be no, no government. What is it? Oversight, I guess,

27:55.520 --> 28:00.240
and then everything should be fully, like all the agreements, all the collectives you form

28:00.240 --> 28:07.840
should be voluntary, not based on the geographic land you were born on and so on. Do you think

28:08.560 --> 28:14.320
that's just a giant mess? Like, do you think it's possible for an anarchist society to work where

28:14.320 --> 28:21.840
it's, you know, in a fully distributed way, people agree with each other, not just on financial

28:21.920 --> 28:29.680
transactions, but, you know, on their personal security, on sort of military type of stuff,

28:30.800 --> 28:35.600
on healthcare, on education, all those kinds of things. And where does it break down?

28:35.600 --> 28:40.000
Well, I wouldn't press a button to say, get rid of our current constitution, which I view is pretty

28:40.000 --> 28:45.840
good and quite wise. But I think the deeper point is that all societies are, in some regards,

28:45.840 --> 28:50.880
anarchistic. And we should take the anarchists seriously. So globally, there's a kind of anarchy

28:51.840 --> 28:58.400
across borders, even within federalistic systems. They're typically complex. There's not a clear

28:58.400 --> 29:05.120
transitivity necessarily of who has the final say over what. Just the state vis-a-vis its people.

29:05.120 --> 29:12.000
There's not, per se, a final arbitrator in that regard. So you want a good anarchy rather than

29:12.000 --> 29:16.800
a bad anarchy. You want to squish your anarchy into the right corners. And I don't think there's a

29:16.800 --> 29:22.640
theoretical answer how to do it. But you start with a country like, is it working well enough now?

29:23.440 --> 29:28.400
This country, you'd say mostly, you'd certainly want to make a lot of improvements. And that's

29:28.400 --> 29:32.480
why I don't want to press that get rid of the constitution button. But to just dump on the

29:32.480 --> 29:38.000
anarchists is to miss the point. Always try to learn from any opinion, you know, and what in it is

29:38.000 --> 29:45.680
true? I'm just like marveling at the poetry of saying that we should squish our anarchy into

29:45.680 --> 29:54.560
the right corners. I love it. Okay, I gotta ask, I've been talking with, since we're doing a

29:54.560 --> 29:59.520
whirlwind introduction to all of economics, I've been talking to a few objectivists recently.

30:01.680 --> 30:07.600
Ayn Rand comes up as a person, as a philosopher throughout many conversations. A lot of people

30:07.600 --> 30:14.080
really despise her. A lot of people really love her. It's always weird to me when somebody arouses

30:14.080 --> 30:20.640
a philosophy or a human being arouses that much emotion in either direction. Do you understand,

30:20.640 --> 30:25.840
first of all, that level of emotion? And what are your thoughts about Ayn Rand and her philosophy,

30:25.840 --> 30:34.720
objectivism? Is it useful at all to think about this kind of formulation of rational self-interest,

30:34.720 --> 30:43.760
if I could put it in those words, or I guess, more negatively, the selfishness, or she would put,

30:43.840 --> 30:49.600
I guess, the virtue of selfishness? Ayn Rand was the big influence on me growing up. The book that

30:49.600 --> 30:54.880
really mattered for me was capitalism, the unknown ideal, the notion that wealth creates

30:54.880 --> 31:01.120
opportunity and good lives, and wealth is something we ought to valorize and give very high status.

31:01.120 --> 31:06.160
It's one of her key ideas. I think it's completely correct. I think she has the most profound and

31:06.160 --> 31:12.800
articulate statement of that idea. That said, as a philosopher, I disagree with her on most things,

31:12.800 --> 31:18.080
and I did, even as a boy when I was reading her. I read Plato before Ayn Rand, and in a

31:18.080 --> 31:22.720
Socratic dialogue, there's all these different points of view being thrown around. And whomever

31:22.720 --> 31:27.760
it is you agree with, you understand the wisdom isn't coming together at the different points of

31:27.760 --> 31:34.240
view, and she doesn't have that. So altruism can be wonderful in my view. Humans are not actually

31:34.240 --> 31:40.960
that rational. Self-interest is often poorly defined. To pound the table and say existence exists,

31:40.960 --> 31:45.600
I wouldn't say I disagree, but I'm not sure that it's a very meaningful statement.

31:46.320 --> 31:50.800
I think the secret to Ayn Rand is that she was Russian. I'd love to have her on my podcast if

31:50.800 --> 31:56.000
she was still alive. I'd only ask her about Russia, which she mostly never talked about

31:56.000 --> 32:02.320
after writing We the Living. And she is much more Russian than she seems at first, even like purging

32:02.320 --> 32:07.760
people from the Objectivist circles. It's like how Russians, especially female Russians, so often

32:07.760 --> 32:16.240
purge their friends. It's weird, all the parallels. So you're saying, so yes, assuming she's still not

32:16.240 --> 32:21.840
around. But if she is, and she comes into your podcast, can you dig into that a little bit?

32:21.840 --> 32:31.280
Do you mean like her personal demons around the social and economic Russia of the time,

32:31.840 --> 32:36.960
when she escaped? The traumas she suffered there. What she really likes in the music and literature

32:37.440 --> 32:42.720
and getting deeply into that, her view of relations between the sexes and Russia,

32:42.720 --> 32:49.120
how it differs from America, why she still carries through the old Russian vision in her fiction,

32:49.120 --> 32:55.680
this extreme sexual dimorphism, but with also very strong women. To me is a uniquely, at least

32:55.680 --> 33:02.400
Eastern European vision, mostly Russian, I would say. And that's in her. That's her actual real

33:02.400 --> 33:07.600
philosophy, not this table-bounding existence exists. And that's not talked about enough.

33:07.600 --> 33:12.320
She's a Russian philosopher or Soviet, whatever you want to call it.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.720
And if she wasn't so certain, she could have been a Dostoevsky, where it's not,

33:17.440 --> 33:23.840
that certainty is almost the thing that brings over the adoration of millions, but also the

33:23.840 --> 33:29.280
hatred of millions. She became a cult figure in a somewhat Russian-like manner. Yeah.

33:30.240 --> 33:37.120
It is what it is. But I love the idea that, again, you're just dropping bombs that are poetic,

33:37.120 --> 33:42.480
that the wisdom is in the coming together of ideas. It's kind of interesting to think that

33:43.280 --> 33:52.080
no one human possesses wisdom. No one idea is the wisdom, that the coming together is the wisdom.

33:52.080 --> 33:56.800
Like in my view, Boswell's life of Johnson, 18th century British biography,

33:56.800 --> 34:00.960
it's, in essence, a co-authored work, Boswell and Johnson. It's one of the greatest

34:00.960 --> 34:06.320
philosophy books ever, though it is commonly regarded as a biography. John Stuart Mill,

34:06.320 --> 34:12.000
who, in a sense, was co-authoring with Harriet Taylor, a better philosopher than is realized,

34:12.000 --> 34:17.280
though he's rated very, very highly. Plato slash Socrates, a lot of the greatest works

34:18.000 --> 34:24.880
are in a kind of dialogue form, Kurtis Faust, would be another example. It's very much a dialogue.

34:24.960 --> 34:30.160
Yes, it's drama, but it's also philosophy, Shakespeare, maybe the wisest thinker of them all.

34:31.920 --> 34:37.680
In your book, Big Business, speaking of Anne Rand, Big Business, a love letter to an American

34:37.680 --> 34:44.000
antihero, you make the case for the benefit that large businesses bring to society. Can you explain?

34:45.120 --> 34:50.080
If you look at, say, the pandemic, which has been a catastrophic event, right, for many reasons,

34:51.040 --> 34:58.160
but who is it that saved us? So Amazon has done remarkably well. They upped their delivery game

34:58.160 --> 35:02.960
more or less overnight with very few hitches. I've ordered hundreds of Amazon packages,

35:03.600 --> 35:09.360
direct delivery food, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats or using Whole Foods through Amazon

35:09.360 --> 35:15.680
shipping. Again, it's gone remarkably well. Switching over our entire higher educational system,

35:15.760 --> 35:21.120
basically within two weeks to Zoom. Zoom did it. I mean, I've had a Zoom outage,

35:21.120 --> 35:26.400
but their performance rate has been remarkably high. So if you just look at resources,

35:26.400 --> 35:32.720
competence, incentives, who's been the star performers, the NBA even, just canceling the

35:32.720 --> 35:38.160
season as early as they did, sending a message like, hey people, this is real. And then pulling

35:38.160 --> 35:44.000
off the bubble with not a single found case of COVID and having all the testing set up in advance.

35:44.960 --> 35:50.160
Big business has done very well lately. And throughout the broader course of American

35:50.160 --> 35:55.840
history, in my view, has mostly been a hero. Can we engage in a kind of therapy session?

35:58.720 --> 36:06.560
I'm often troubled by the negativity towards big business. And I wonder if you could help

36:06.560 --> 36:12.560
figure out how we've removed that or maybe first psychoanalyze it and then how we remove it.

36:14.000 --> 36:21.520
It feels like once we've gotten Wi-Fi on flights, on airplane flights,

36:23.760 --> 36:28.320
people start complaining about how shady the connection is, right? They take it for granted

36:28.320 --> 36:35.360
immediately and then start complaining about little details. Another example that's closer to,

36:36.320 --> 36:43.040
especially as a aspiring entrepreneur is closer to the things I'm thinking about is Jack Dorsey

36:43.040 --> 36:49.760
with Twitter. To me, Twitter has enabled an incredible platform of communication.

36:50.560 --> 36:56.880
And yet the biggest thing that people talk about is not how incredible this platform is.

36:58.400 --> 37:03.440
They essentially use the platform to complain about the censorship of a few individuals,

37:04.720 --> 37:10.240
as opposed to how amazing it is. Now, you should also talk about how shady the Wi-Fi is and how

37:10.240 --> 37:14.720
censorship or the removal of Donald Trump from the platform is a bad thing. But it feels like

37:14.720 --> 37:22.080
we don't talk about the positive impacts at scale of these technologies. Can you explain why and is

37:22.080 --> 37:28.000
there a way to fix it? I don't know if we can fix it. I think we are beings of high neuroticism,

37:28.000 --> 37:34.240
for the most part, as a personality trait. Not everyone, but most people. And as a compliment

37:34.240 --> 37:39.040
to that, if someone says 10 nice things about you and one insult, you're more bothered by the

37:39.040 --> 37:42.880
insult than you're pleased by the nice things, especially if the insult is somewhat true.

37:43.760 --> 37:47.680
So you have these media, these vehicles, Twitter is one you mentioned,

37:48.240 --> 37:51.600
where there's all kinds of messages going back and forth. And you're really bugged

37:51.600 --> 37:57.360
by the messages you don't like. Most people are neurotic to begin with. It's not only taken out

37:57.360 --> 38:03.600
on big business to be clear. So Congress catches a lot of grief and some of it they deserve, yes.

38:04.560 --> 38:10.800
Religion is not attacked the same way, but religiosity is declining. If you poll people,

38:11.520 --> 38:17.200
the military still polls quite well. But people are very disillusioned with many things. And the

38:17.200 --> 38:22.320
Martin-Gurrey thesis that because of the internet, you just see more of things. And the more you see

38:22.320 --> 38:26.640
of something, whether it's good, bad, or in between, the more you will find to complain about,

38:26.640 --> 38:31.680
I suspect, is the fundamental mechanism here. I mean, look at Clubhouse, right?

38:32.560 --> 38:37.280
To me, it's a great service. May or may not be like my thing, but gives people this opportunity.

38:37.280 --> 38:41.760
No one makes you go on it. And all these media articles like, oh, is Clubhouse going to wreck

38:41.760 --> 38:46.000
things? Are they going to break things? New York Times is complaining. Of course,

38:46.000 --> 38:50.240
it's their competitor as well. I'm like, give these people a chance. Talk it up.

38:50.800 --> 38:55.920
You may or may not like it. Let's praise the people who are getting something done. Very

38:55.920 --> 39:02.720
unrandom point. As an economic thinker, as a writer, as a podcaster, what do you think about

39:02.720 --> 39:10.640
Clubhouse? What do you think about? Okay, let me just throw my feeling about it. I used to use

39:10.640 --> 39:15.920
Discord, which is another service where people use voice. So the only thing you do is just hear

39:15.920 --> 39:23.600
each other. There's no face. You just see a little icon. That's the essential element of Clubhouse.

39:23.680 --> 39:28.960
There's an intimacy to voice-only communication that's hard. That didn't make sense to me,

39:28.960 --> 39:34.000
but it was just what it is, which feels like something that won't last for some reason. Maybe

39:34.000 --> 39:42.080
it's the cynical view. But what's your sense about the intimacy of what's happening right now with

39:42.080 --> 39:47.600
Clubhouse? I've greatly enjoyed what I've done, but I'm not sure it's for me in the long run for two

39:47.600 --> 39:55.120
reasons. First, if you compare it to doing a podcast, podcasting has greater reach than Clubhouse.

39:55.120 --> 40:02.720
So I would rather put time into my podcast, but then also my core asset, so to speak,

40:02.720 --> 40:08.400
is I'm a very fast reader. So audio per se is not necessarily to my advantage. I don't

40:08.400 --> 40:13.520
speak or listen faster than other people. In fact, I'm a slower listener because I like 1.0,

40:13.520 --> 40:18.720
not 1.5x. So I should spend less time on audio and more time reading and writing.

40:18.720 --> 40:27.920
Yeah. It's interesting because you mentioned podcasts and audiobooks. The podcasts are recorded,

40:28.480 --> 40:34.720
and so I can skip things. I can skip commercials or I can skip parts where it's like, this part

40:34.720 --> 40:41.680
is boring. With live conversations, especially when there's a magic to the fact that when you

40:41.680 --> 40:47.200
have a lot of people participating in that conversation, but some people are like, this

40:47.200 --> 40:52.800
topic, they're going into this thing and you can't skip it or you can't fast forward. You can go 1.5x

40:52.800 --> 40:59.680
or 2x. You can't speed it up. Nevertheless, there's a tension between that. So that's the productivity

40:59.680 --> 41:07.520
aspect with the actual magic of live communication where anything can happen where Elon Musk can

41:07.520 --> 41:13.200
ask the CEO of Robin Hood, Vlad, about like, hey, somebody holding a gun to your head,

41:13.200 --> 41:18.160
there's something shady going on, the magic of that. That's also my criticism of like,

41:18.160 --> 41:25.600
there's been a recent conversation with Bill Gates that he won a platform and had a basically

41:25.600 --> 41:31.120
a regular interview on the platform without allowing the possibility of the magic of the chaos.

41:32.080 --> 41:38.240
So I'm not exactly sure. It's probably not the right platform for you and for many other people

41:38.240 --> 41:42.880
who are exceptionally productive in other places, but there's still nevertheless the magic to the

41:42.880 --> 41:49.040
chaos that could be created with live conversation that gives me pause. Maybe what it's perfect for

41:49.040 --> 41:53.920
is the tribute. So they had an episode recently that I didn't hear, but I heard it was wonderful.

41:53.920 --> 41:59.360
It was anecdotes about Steve Jobs. That you can't do one to one, right? And you don't want control.

41:59.360 --> 42:02.880
You want different people appearing and stepping up and saying their bit.

42:03.680 --> 42:09.840
And Clubhouse is 110% perfect for that, the tribute. I love that, the tribute.

42:10.400 --> 42:16.320
But there's also the possibility, I think there was a time when somebody arranged a conversation

42:16.320 --> 42:20.560
with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on stage. I remember that happen a long time ago.

42:22.480 --> 42:29.040
And it was very formal. It could have probably gone better, but it was still magical

42:29.040 --> 42:33.040
to have these people that obviously had a bunch of tension throughout their history.

42:34.400 --> 42:42.480
It's so frictionless to have two major figures in world history just jump on on a Clubhouse stage.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.680
Putin and Elon Musk.

42:43.680 --> 42:44.640
Putin and Elon Musk.

42:45.520 --> 42:50.800
And that's exactly it. So there's a language barrier there. There's also the problem that

42:50.800 --> 42:56.960
in particular, it's like Biden would have a similar problem. It's like they're just not

42:56.960 --> 43:02.480
into a new technology. So it's very hard to catch the Kremlin up to, first of all, Twitter.

43:03.600 --> 43:08.720
But to catch them up to Clubhouse, you have to have the Elon Musk has a sense of the internet,

43:08.720 --> 43:12.240
the humor, the memes and all that kind of stuff that you have to have in order to

43:13.440 --> 43:17.920
use a new app and figure out the timing, the beat. What is this thing about?

43:19.600 --> 43:26.160
That's the challenge there. But that's exactly it. That magic of have two big personalities

43:26.240 --> 43:31.520
just show up. And I wonder if it's just the temporary thing that we're going through with

43:31.520 --> 43:37.520
the pandemic where people are just lonely and they're seeking for that human connection that

43:37.520 --> 43:42.480
we usually get elsewhere through our work. But they'll stay lonely, in my opinion.

43:42.480 --> 43:43.120
You think so?

43:43.120 --> 43:49.360
I do. So it is a pandemic thing, but I think it will persist. And the idea of wanting to be

43:49.360 --> 43:54.960
connected to more of the world, Clubhouse will still offer that. And all the mental health issues

43:54.960 --> 44:00.480
out there, a lot of people have broken ties and they will still be lonely post vaccines.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.440
Yeah, from an artificial intelligence perspective,

44:06.800 --> 44:12.960
have a sense that there is like a deep loneliness in the world that all of us are really lonely.

44:12.960 --> 44:17.440
Like we don't even acknowledge it. Even people in happy relationships. It feels like there's

44:17.440 --> 44:23.120
like an iceberg of loneliness in all of us, like seeking to be understood, like deeply

44:23.120 --> 44:29.200
understood. Like having somebody with whom you can have a deep interaction enough

44:30.240 --> 44:35.760
to where they can help you to understand yourself. And they also understand you.

44:36.320 --> 44:40.560
Like I have a sense that artificial intelligence systems can provide that as well.

44:40.560 --> 44:46.320
But humans, I think, crave that from other humans in ways that we perhaps don't acknowledge.

44:46.320 --> 44:50.720
And I have a hope that technology will enable that more and more. Like Clubhouse is an example

44:50.720 --> 44:56.560
that allows that. Are touring bots going to outcompete Clubhouse? Like why not sort of program

44:56.560 --> 45:02.080
your own session? You'll just talk into your device and say, here's the kind of conversation I want.

45:02.080 --> 45:06.880
And it will create the characters for you. And it may not be as good as Elon and Vladimir Putin,

45:06.880 --> 45:11.520
but it will be better than ordinary Clubhouse. Yeah. And one of the things that's missing,

45:11.520 --> 45:17.600
it's not just conversation. It's memory. So long term memory is what current AI systems don't have

45:17.920 --> 45:24.560
is sharing an experience together. Forget the words. It's like sharing the highs and the lows

45:24.560 --> 45:30.400
of life together and the systems around us remembering that. Remembering we've been through

45:30.400 --> 45:35.360
that. Like that's the thing that creates really close relationships is going through some shit.

45:35.360 --> 45:40.880
Like go and struggle. If you've survived together, there's something really difficult

45:40.880 --> 45:45.200
that bonds you with other humans. And this is related to immigration in the American dream.

45:46.160 --> 45:50.960
In what way? The people who have come to this country, however weird and different they may be,

45:51.680 --> 45:54.960
they or their ancestors at some point probably have shared this thing.

45:58.000 --> 46:02.160
Right. US is not going to split up. It may get more screwed up as a country,

46:02.160 --> 46:06.240
but Texas and California are not going to break off. Yeah. I mean, they're big enough

46:06.240 --> 46:10.240
where they could do it, but it's just never going to happen. We've been through too much together.

46:10.560 --> 46:16.960
Yeah. That's a hopeful message. Do you think, some people have talked to Eric Weinstein,

46:16.960 --> 46:26.160
you've talked to Eric Weinstein. He has a sense that growth, the entirety of the American system

46:26.160 --> 46:30.880
is based on the assumption that we're going to grow forever. The economy is going to grow forever.

46:30.880 --> 46:36.960
Do you think economic growth will continue indefinitely or will we stagnate?

46:37.040 --> 46:44.800
I've long been in agreement with Eric Peter Thiel, Robert Gordon, and others that growth has slowed

46:44.800 --> 46:51.600
down. I argued that in my book, The Great Stagnation, appropriately titled, but the last two years,

46:51.600 --> 46:56.320
I've become much more optimistic. I've seen a lot of breakthroughs in green energy and battery

46:56.320 --> 47:04.240
technology. mRNA vaccines and medicine is a big deal already. It will repair our GDP and save

47:04.240 --> 47:10.160
millions of lives around the world. There's an anti-malaria vaccine that's now in stage three

47:10.160 --> 47:17.920
trial. It probably works. CRISPR to defeat sickle cell anemia. This space area after area after

47:17.920 --> 47:22.880
area, there's suddenly this surge of breakthroughs. I would say many of them rooted in superior

47:22.880 --> 47:29.120
computation and ultimately Moore's law and access to those computational abilities. I'm much more

47:29.120 --> 47:34.800
optimistic than say the last time I spoke to Eric. He moves all the time in his views. I don't

47:34.800 --> 47:42.240
know where he's at now. He hasn't gained. That's really interesting. Your little drop of optimism

47:42.240 --> 47:48.720
comes from, there might be a fundamental shift in the kind of things that computation has unlocked

47:48.720 --> 47:54.960
for us in terms of, it could be a wellspring of innovation that enables growth for a long time

47:54.960 --> 48:02.640
to come. Eric has not quite connected to the computation aspect yet to where it could be

48:02.640 --> 48:07.600
a wellspring of innovation. You're very close to it in your own work. I don't have to tell you that.

48:07.600 --> 48:12.000
The work you're doing would not have been possible not very long ago. The question is,

48:12.000 --> 48:17.600
how much does that work enable continued growth for decades to come? For all their problems,

48:17.600 --> 48:22.240
some version of driverless vehicles will be a thing. I'm not sure when. You know much better

48:22.240 --> 48:28.800
than I do, maybe only partially, but that too will be a big deal. One of the open questions that the

48:28.800 --> 48:38.400
Peter Thiel School area of ideas is how much can be converted to technology? How many parts of our

48:38.400 --> 48:46.000
lives can technology integrate and then innovate? Can it replace healthcare? Can it replace legal

48:46.000 --> 48:55.360
system? Can it replace government? Never replace, but make it digital and thereby enable computation

48:55.360 --> 49:02.480
to improve it. That's the open question because many aspects of our lives are still not really that

49:03.920 --> 49:10.480
digitized. There was a New York Times symposium in April, which is not long ago, and they asked

49:10.560 --> 49:15.840
the so-called experts, when are we going to get vaccines? The most optimistic answer was

49:15.840 --> 49:23.200
in four years. Obviously, we beat that by a long mile. I think people still haven't woken up. You

49:23.200 --> 49:28.800
mentioned my tiny drop of optimism, but it's a big drop of optimism. Is it a waterfall yet?

49:30.800 --> 49:35.680
Here's my pessimism. Whenever there are major new technologies, they also tend to be used for

49:35.680 --> 49:41.040
violence directly or indirectly. Radio, Hitler, not that he hit people over the head with radios,

49:41.040 --> 49:47.760
but it enabled the rise of various dictators. The new technologies now, whatever exactly they may

49:47.760 --> 49:52.960
be, they're going to cause a lot of trouble. That's my pessimism, not that I think they're all going

49:52.960 --> 50:01.520
to slow to a trickle. When was the stagnation book? 2011. It was the first of these stagnation books,

50:01.520 --> 50:08.800
in fact. It's very interesting. Even then, I said, this is temporary. I was predicting it

50:08.800 --> 50:14.720
would be gone in about 20 years' time. I'm not sure that's exactly the right prediction, like

50:14.720 --> 50:20.880
2030, but I think we're actually going to beat that. You think the United States might still be

50:20.880 --> 50:26.880
on top of the world for the rest of the century in terms of its economic growth, impact on the

50:26.880 --> 50:31.600
world, scientific innovation, all those kinds of things. That's too long to predict, but I'm

50:31.600 --> 50:38.800
bullish on America in general. Got it. Speaking of being bullish on America,

50:38.800 --> 50:46.640
the opposite of that is, we talked about capitalism, we talked about Iran and her Russian roots.

50:46.960 --> 50:58.160
What do you think about communism? Why doesn't it work? Is it the implementation?

50:58.160 --> 51:04.240
Is there anything about its ideas that you find compelling, or is it just a fundamentally flawed

51:05.200 --> 51:10.080
system? Communism is like capitalism. The words mean many things to different people.

51:10.720 --> 51:15.600
You could argue, my life as a tenured professor comes closer to communism than anything the human

51:15.600 --> 51:20.880
race has seen, and I would argue it works pretty well. If you mean the Soviet Union,

51:21.600 --> 51:28.880
it devolved pretty quickly to a decentralized set of incentives that were destructive

51:28.880 --> 51:34.640
rather than value-maximizing. It wasn't even central planning, much less communism. Paul

51:34.640 --> 51:38.960
Craig Roberts and Poignet were correct in their descriptions of the Soviet system.

51:39.520 --> 51:43.040
Think of it as weird mixes of barter and malfunctioning incentives,

51:43.920 --> 51:48.720
and being very good at a whole bunch of things, but in terms of progress, innovation,

51:48.720 --> 51:56.240
and consumer goods, it really being quite a failure. Now, I wouldn't call that communism,

51:56.240 --> 52:03.520
but that's what I think of the system the Soviets had, and it required an ever-increasing pile of

52:03.520 --> 52:09.520
lies that both alienated people but created an elite that by the end of the thing no longer

52:10.080 --> 52:15.680
believed in the system itself or even thought they were doing better by being crooks than by

52:15.680 --> 52:19.840
just moving to Switzerland and being an upper-middle-class individual. You would have a higher

52:19.840 --> 52:25.200
standard of living by Gorbachev's time, not Gorbachev, but if you're a number 30 in the hierarchy,

52:25.200 --> 52:29.920
you're better off as a middle-class person in Switzerland, and that, of course, did not prove

52:29.920 --> 52:34.960
sustainable. What is it? A momentum of bureaucracy or something like that? It just builds up where

52:34.960 --> 52:40.080
you lose control of the original vision, and that naturally happens. It's just people.

52:40.080 --> 52:44.320
And you can't use normal profit and loss in price incentives, so you get all prices,

52:44.320 --> 52:50.800
or most prices, set to low. Shortage is everywhere. People trade favors. You have this culture of

52:50.800 --> 52:56.960
bartered bribes, sexual favors, or family friends, and you get more and more of that,

52:56.960 --> 53:01.600
and you over time lose more and more of the information and the prices and quantities

53:02.240 --> 53:07.600
and practices and norms you had, and that slowly decays, and then by the end, no one is believing

53:07.600 --> 53:14.080
in it. That would be my take, but again, you're the expert here, the Russian scholar.

53:15.760 --> 53:23.920
Well, perhaps no more an expert than Ayn Rand. It's more personal than it is scholarly or historic.

53:24.880 --> 53:34.160
So Stalin held power for 30 years. Vladimir Putin has held power for 21 years,

53:34.160 --> 53:39.840
we could argue. He took a little break. But not much. He was still holding power, I think.

53:39.840 --> 53:45.920
And it's still possible now with the new constitution that he could hold power for

53:45.920 --> 53:53.040
longer than Stalin, 30 years. What do you think about the man, the state of affairs in Russia,

53:54.720 --> 54:00.080
in general, the system they have there? Is there something interesting to use in economists as

54:00.080 --> 54:04.640
a human being about Russia today? Everything is interesting. I mean, here would be

54:04.640 --> 54:11.760
part of my take. As you know, the Russian economy starting what, 1999, 2000, has really quite a

54:11.760 --> 54:18.960
few years of super excellent growth. And Putin is still riding on that. It more or less coincides

54:18.960 --> 54:25.280
with his rise as the truly focal figure on the scene. Since then, pretty recently,

54:25.280 --> 54:30.640
they've had a bunch of years of negative 4% to 5% growth in a row, which is terrible.

54:31.440 --> 54:36.720
The economy is way too dependent on fossil fuels. But the structural problem is this.

54:37.520 --> 54:43.520
You need a concordance across economic power, social power, political power. They don't have to

54:43.600 --> 54:50.400
be allocated identically, but they have to be allocated consistently. And the Russian system

54:50.400 --> 54:57.120
under Putin from almost the beginning has never been able to have that, that ultimately his incentives

54:57.120 --> 55:02.960
are to steer the system where the economic power is in a small number of hands in a non-diversified

55:02.960 --> 55:09.840
way. The system won't deliver sustainable gains and living standards anymore, ever the way it's

55:09.840 --> 55:14.560
set up now, that with fossil fuel prices go up, they'll have some good years for sure.

55:15.920 --> 55:21.360
And that is really quite structural what has gone wrong. And then on top of that,

55:21.360 --> 55:25.840
you can have an opinion of Putin. But you've got to start with those structural problems. And that's

55:25.840 --> 55:31.200
why it's just not going to work. But he had all those good years in the beginning. So the number

55:31.200 --> 55:37.280
of Russians, say, who live here or in Russia, who love Putin and it's sincere, they're not just afraid

55:37.280 --> 55:45.200
of being dragged away. That's a real phenomenon. Yeah, I'm really torn on Putin's approval rating,

55:45.200 --> 55:52.080
real approval rating. It seems to be very high. And I'm torn in whether that has to do with

55:53.440 --> 56:01.120
the fact that there is control of the press or if it's, which is the people I talk to who are

56:01.120 --> 56:07.760
in Russia, family and so on, a genuine love of Putin, appreciation of what Putin has done

56:07.760 --> 56:13.040
and is going to do with Russia. But a lot of that would go away if the press were freer, I think.

56:14.240 --> 56:18.480
Well, Singapore realizes this. Anyone discussed by the press, no matter who they are,

56:18.480 --> 56:24.000
people in Singapore have done a great job. But if you're discussed by the press, you don't look

56:24.000 --> 56:30.320
good. Tech company executives are learning this, right? It's just like a rule. So in that sense,

56:30.320 --> 56:35.360
I think their rating is artificially high. But I don't, by any means, think it's all insincere.

56:35.920 --> 56:40.800
But that high popularity, I view as bearish for Russia. I would feel better about the country

56:40.800 --> 56:45.600
if people were more pissed off at him. Yeah, that's right. It's nice to see free speech,

56:45.600 --> 56:54.240
even if it's full of hate. I am also troubled on the scientific side and entrepreneurial side.

56:54.240 --> 57:02.560
It seems difficult to be an entrepreneur in Russia. It's not even in terms of rules.

57:03.120 --> 57:11.520
It's just culturally that people I speak to, it's not easy to build a business. No,

57:11.520 --> 57:17.120
it's not easy to even dream of building a business in Russia. That's just not part of the culture,

57:17.120 --> 57:23.840
part of the conversation. It's almost like the conversation is, if you want to be the next

57:23.840 --> 57:29.120
Bill Gates or Elon Musk or Steve Jobs or whatever, you come to America. That's the

57:29.120 --> 57:36.320
sense they have. History matters. Is history just structural problems of today?

57:37.280 --> 57:41.360
It's all the same thing. So a history of hostility to commerce, which of course,

57:41.920 --> 57:49.280
the old USSR is gone, but a lot of the attitudes remain, a lot of the corruption remains. You have

57:49.280 --> 57:54.320
this legacy distribution of wealth from the auctioning off of the assets, which is not conducive

57:54.320 --> 58:00.560
to some kind of broadly egalitarian democracy. You have these small number of power points

58:00.560 --> 58:06.320
that try to control information and wealth and not really so keen to encourage the others who

58:06.320 --> 58:10.720
ultimately would pull the balance of political power away from the very wealthy and from Putin,

58:11.520 --> 58:16.160
and they support that culture. The return of interest in Orthodox church and all that,

58:16.160 --> 58:22.080
it's all part of the same piece, I think, because the old Orthodox church is not that pro-commerce,

58:22.080 --> 58:26.480
you'd have to say, but it's traditionalist, it's pro-family, those are safer ideas,

58:27.280 --> 58:31.280
and then there's such a great safety valve, the most ambitious, smartest people,

58:31.280 --> 58:36.560
like they probably will learn English. They can look like they belong in all sorts of other

58:36.560 --> 58:40.960
countries that can show up and blend in. Super talented, they've probably had an excellent

58:40.960 --> 58:45.760
education, especially if they're from one of the two major cities, but even if not so,

58:45.760 --> 58:50.480
even from Siberia, and they go off, they leave, they're not a source of opposition,

58:51.120 --> 58:53.680
and that keeps the whole thing up and running for another generation.

58:54.720 --> 59:03.680
Yeah. What do you make of the other big player, China? They seem to have a very different

59:04.560 --> 59:13.120
messed up, but also functioning system. They seem to be much better at encouraging entrepreneurs.

59:13.840 --> 59:18.080
They're choosing winners, but what do you make of the entire Chinese system?

59:20.000 --> 59:25.280
Why does it work as well as it does currently? What are your concerns about it, and what are

59:26.080 --> 59:35.120
its threats to the United States, or possible wisdom when two ideas come together? Is there

59:35.120 --> 59:39.520
some possible benefits of these kinds of ideas coming together?

59:40.320 --> 59:45.840
It's amazing what China has done, but I would say to put it in perspective, if you compare them

59:45.840 --> 59:50.560
to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, they've still done much worse,

59:51.840 --> 59:59.760
not even close. That's both living standards, or I hesitate to cite democracy as an unalloyed good

59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.880
in and of itself, but there's more freedom in all those other places by a lot. China has all

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:10.160
these problems of history, but they've managed, as actually the Soviets did in the middle of the

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:16.240
20th century, one of the two great mass migrations from the countryside to cities, which boosts

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:22.720
productivity enormously, and will sustain totalitarian systems, but they move from a totalitarian

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:30.480
system to an oligarchy, where the CCP is actually, at least for a while, has been really good at

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:36.560
governing, have made a lot of very good decisions. You have to admit that. I don't know how long

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:45.760
that streak will continue, with one person so much now holding authority in a more extreme manner.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:51.600
The selection pressures for the next generation of high-level CCP members probably become much

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:57.040
worse. You have this general problem of the state-owned enterprise is losing relative productivity

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:02.480
compared to the private sector. Well, we're going to kind of hold Jack Ma on this island,

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:09.520
and he can only issue weird hello statements. It kind of smells bad to me. I don't feel that

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:17.200
it's about to crash, but I don't see them supplanting America as the world's number one country.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.720
I think they will muddle through and have very serious problems, but there's enough talent there

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.920
they will muddle through. Is there ideas from China, from anywhere in general, of large-scale

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:34.320
role of government that you find might be useful? Andrew Yang recently ran on a platform, UBI,

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:41.760
my universal basic income. Is there some interesting ideas of large-scale

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:50.080
government welfare programs at scale that you find interesting?

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:57.920
Well, keep in mind, the current version of the Chinese Communist Party post Mao dismantled what

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.760
was called the iron rice ball. It took apart the healthcare protections, a lot of the welfare system,

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:09.120
a lot of the guaranteed jobs. The economic rise of China coincided with the weakening

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:16.720
of welfare. I'm not saying that's causal per se, but people think of China as having a government

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.840
that takes care of everyone. It's very far from the truth. By a lot of metrics, I don't mean control

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.960
over people's lives. I don't mean speech, but by a lot of metrics, economically, we have a lot more

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:33.280
government than they do. What one means here by government, private control, I don't think you

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.880
can just add up the numbers and get a simple answer. They've been fantastic at building

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.800
infrastructure in cities in ways that will attract people from the countryside. Furthermore,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.200
they more or less enforce a meritocracy in this sense. If you're a kid of a rich guy,

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:56.800
you'll get unfair privilege. That's unfair, but systems can afford that. If you are smart and

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.160
from the countryside and your parents have nothing, you will be elevated and sent to a very good

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.040
school, graduate school, because of the exam system. They do that and they mean that very

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:12.320
consistently. It's like the Soviets had a version of that, like the chess and romantic piano,

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.880
not for everything, but where they had it. Again, they were tremendous.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.440
Chinese have it in so many areas, a genuine meritocracy in this one way.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:29.040
That moves people from the rural to the big city and that's a big boost of productivity for

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.920
so amount of time. When they get there, they're taken seriously. Jack Ma was riding a bicycle

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:40.880
teaching English in his late 20s. He was a poor guy. Not a society of credentialism.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.280
In America, it's way too much a credentialist society.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.960
As we were talking about, even with the Nobel Prize. What do you think about

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.760
these large government programs like UBI? The one version of UBI that makes the most sense to me

01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.840
is the Mitt Romney version, UBI for kids. Kids are vulnerable. If their parents screw up, you

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.760
shouldn't blame the kid or make the kids suffer. I believe in something like UBI for kids, maybe

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:15.600
just cash. But if you don't have kids, even with AI, my sense is at least in the world we know,

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:22.480
you should be able to find a way to adjust. You might have to move to North Dakota to work

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:32.960
next to fracking, say. But look, before the pandemic, the two most robot-intensive societies,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:39.520
Japan and the US, at least for manufacturing, were at full employment. Maybe there's some far

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:45.040
off day where there's literally no work. John Lennon and Imagine, it's piped everywhere.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.760
Then we might revisit the question. But for now, we had rising wages in the Trump years and full

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.240
employment. You don't see automation as a threat that fundamentally shakes our society.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.560
It's a threat in the following sense. The new technologies are harder to work with for many

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:11.120
people and that's a social problem. But I'm not sure a universal basic income is the right answer

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:20.160
to that very real problem. I like the UBI for kids. It's also your definition or the line,

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.840
the threshold for what is vulnerable and what is basic human nature. Going back to Russia,

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:34.880
life is suffering. That struggle is a part of life and perhaps changing. Maybe what defines

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.480
the 21st century is having multiple careers and adjusting and learning and evolving.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:54.480
Some of the technology we see like the internet allows us to make those pivots easier.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.120
Allows later life education possible. It makes it possible. I don't know.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.560
And your earlier point about loneliness being this fundamental human problem,

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:10.080
which I would agree with strongly, UBI, if it's at a high level, will make that worse.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.560
I mean, say UBI were higher enough, you could just sit at home.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.360
People are not going to be happy. They don't actually want that. We've relearned that in the

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:27.040
pandemic. Yeah. The flip side, the hope with UBI is you have a little bit more freedom to find the

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:32.560
thing that alleviates your loneliness. That's the idea. So it's kind of an open question.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:40.560
If I give you a million dollars or a billion dollars, will you pursue the thing you love?

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.440
Will you be more motivated to find the thing you love, to do the thing you love? Or will you be

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.160
lazy and lose yourself in the sort of daily activities that don't actually bring you joy,

01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:02.720
but pacify you in some kind of way where you just let the day slip by? That's an open question.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.520
A lot of the great creators did not have huge cushions, whether it was Mozart or James Brown

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:13.840
or the great painters in history. They had to work pretty hard. And if you look at heirs to great

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.840
fortunes, maybe I'm forgetting someone, but it's hard to think of any who have creatively been

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:27.520
important as novelists or they might have continued to run the family business. But Van Gogh was not

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:37.360
heir to a great family fortune. It's sad that cushions get in the way of progress. It's the same

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.760
point about prizes, right? Yeah. Heriting too much money is like winning a prize.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:48.560
We mentioned Eric, Eric Weinstein. I know you agree on a bunch of things. Is there some beautiful,

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.040
fascinating insights for disagreement that you have? Does he have to be resolved with him?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.600
Is there some ideas that you guys battle it out on? Is it the stagnation question that you've

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:06.960
mentioned? That's one of them, but here's at least two others. But I would stress Eric is

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.760
always evolving. So I'm just talking about a time slice, Eric, right? I don't know where he's at

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.400
right now. Like I heard him on Clubhouse three nights ago, but that was three nights ago.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.640
But I think he's far too pessimistic about the impact of immigration on US science.

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:29.200
He thinks it has displaced US scientists, which I think that is partly true. I just think we've

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:35.360
gotten better talent. I'm like, bring it on, double down. And look at Kurt Eco, who basically

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.520
came up with mRNA vaccines. She was from Hungary and was ridiculed and mocked. She couldn't cut

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:48.320
her papers published. She stuck at it. An American might not have been so stubborn because we have

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.520
these cushions. So Eric is all worried, like mathematicians coming in, they're discouraging

01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:00.240
native US citizens from doing math. I'm like, bring in the best people. If we all end up

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:05.920
in other avocations, absolutely fine by me. Does it trouble you that we kick them out

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:12.400
after they get a degree often? I would give anyone with a plausible graduate degree a green card

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:18.880
universally. Yeah. I agree with that. It makes no sense. It makes so strange that the best people

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.760
that come here suffer here, create awesome stuff here. Then when we kick them out, it doesn't make

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.840
any sense. Here's another view I have. I call it open borders for Belarus. Now, Russia is a big

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:38.320
country. I would gladly increase the Russian quota by 3x, 4x, 5x. Not 20%, but a big boost.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:45.760
But Belarus is a small country. They're poor and they have decent education

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.480
and a lot of talent there. Why can't we just open the door and convert a Belarus passport to a green

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.520
card? Open borders for Belarus. It's my new campaign slogan. Are you running for president?

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:04.080
23 or 24? Well, writings are welcome. What's the second thing you disagree with, Eric?

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:14.080
Trade. Again, I'm not sure where he's at now, but he is suspicious of trade in a way that I am not.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:19.760
I do understand what's called the China shock has been a big problem for the US middle class.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:25.920
I fully accept that. I think most of that is behind us. National security issues aside,

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:32.960
I think free trade is very much a good thing. Eric, I'm not sure he'll say it's not a good thing,

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:39.680
but he won't say it is a good thing. I know he's like, Eric, free trade. But look,

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.400
on things like vaccines, I don't believe in free trade. You want vaccine production

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:49.040
in your own country. Look at the EU. They have enough money. No one will send them vaccines.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:54.560
What's different about vaccines? There's some things you want to prioritize the

01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:01.120
citizenry on. You could argue it would be cheaper to produce all US manufactured vaccines in India.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.920
They have the technologies, obviously lower wages. But look, there's talk in India right now of cutting

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.280
off the export of vaccines. If you outsource your vaccine production, you're not sure the other country

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:19.280
will respect the norm of free trade. You need to keep some vaccine production in your country.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.160
It's an exception to free trade, not to the logic.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.120
A bunch of things the Navy uses. You can't buy those components from China. That's insane.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:37.680
But look, it would be cheaper to do so, right? Yeah. Let me completely shift topics on something

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:42.640
that's fascinating. It's all the same topic, but great. Everything is interesting.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:51.200
What do you think about what the hell is money and the recent

01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:03.120
excitement around cryptocurrency that brings to the forefront the philosophical discussion

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.840
of the nature of money? Are you bullish on cryptocurrency? Are you excited about it?

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.760
What does it make you think about how the nature of money is changing?

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.200
No one knows what money is. Probably no one ever knew. Go back to medieval times. Bills of

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:22.880
exchange. Were they money? Maybe it's just a semantic debate. Gold, silver. What about copper

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:27.440
coins? What about metals that were considered legal tender, but not always circulating?

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:35.200
What about credit? Being confused about money is the natural state of affairs for human beings.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.680
If there's more of that, I'd say that's probably a good thing.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:44.480
Now, crypto, per se, I think Bitcoin has taken over a lot of the space held by gold.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:53.360
That to me seems sustainable. I'm not short Bitcoin. I don't have some view that the price

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.560
has to be different than the current price, but I know it changes every moment.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.560
I am deeply uncertain about the less of crypto, which seems connected to ultimate visions of

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:12.000
using it for transactions in ways where I'm not sure whether it be prediction markets or DeFi.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.240
I'm not sure the retail demand really is there once it is regulated like everything else is.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:25.520
I would say I'm 40, 60 optimistic on those forms of crypto. That is, I think it's somewhat more

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.040
likely they fail than succeed, but I take them very seriously.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.800
So we're talking about it becoming one of the main currencies in the world.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.120
That's what we're discussing. That I don't think will happen.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.160
But the reality is that Bitcoin used to be in the single digits of a dollar,

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:48.800
and now has crossed $50,000 for a single Bitcoin. Do you think it's possible it reaches something

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:54.560
like a million dollars? I don't think we have a good theory of the value of Bitcoin. If people

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.800
decide it's worth a million dollars, it's worth a million dollars. But isn't that money, like you

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.120
said, isn't the ultimate state of money confusion, however beautifully you put it?

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.680
It's like valuing an Andy Warhol painting. So when Warhol started off, probably those things

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:13.520
had no value in the sketches, early sketches of shoes. Now a good Warhol could be worth over

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.920
$50 million. That's an incredible rate of price appreciation. Bitcoin is seeing a similar trajectory.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.680
I don't pretend to know where it will stop, but it's about trying to figure out what did people

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.880
think of Andy Warhol. He could be out of fashion in a century, maybe yes, maybe no.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.640
But you don't think about Warhol's as money. They perform some money-like functions. You

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:45.920
can even use them as collateral for deals between gangs. But they're not basically money, nor is

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.640
Bitcoin. And the transactions velocity of Bitcoin, I would think, is likely to fall, if anything.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.480
So you don't think there will be some kind of phase shift? Will it become adopted,

01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:00.080
become mainstream for one of the main mechanisms of transactions?

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.640
Bitcoin, no. Now, Ether has some chance at that. I would bet against it,

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:12.240
but I wouldn't give you a definitive no. Bitcoin is too costly. It may be fine to hold it like gold,

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:19.440
but gold is also costly. You have smart people trying to make, say, Ether, much more effective

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:25.440
as a currency than Bitcoin. And there's certainly a decent chance they will succeed.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:30.960
Yeah, there's a lot of innovation. It was smart contracts with NFTs as well. There's a lot of

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.040
interesting innovations that are plugging into the human psyche somehow, just like money does.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:45.280
Money seems to be this viral thing, our ideas of money. And if the idea is strong enough,

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.760
it seems to be able to take hold. Like there's network effects that just take over.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.720
And I particularly see that with, I'd love to get your comment on the Dogecoin,

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:03.120
which is basically by a single human being Elon Musk has been created. It's like these celebrities

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:10.800
can have a huge ripple effect on the impact of money. Is it possible that in the 21st century,

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.280
people like Elon Musk and celebrities, I don't know, Donald Trump, the Rock,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:24.080
whoever else, can actually define the currencies that we use. Can Dogecoin be

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.120
kind of the primary currency of the world? I think of it as like baseball cards.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.920
So right now, every baseball player has a baseball card. And the players who are stars,

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.720
their cards can end up worth a fair amount of money. And that's stable. We've had it for many

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:45.040
decades. Sort of the player defines the card. They sign a contract with Tops or whatever company.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.080
Now, could you imagine celebrities, baseball players, LeBron James,

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.280
having their own currencies instead of cards? Absolutely. And you're somewhat seeing that

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:58.960
right now, as you mentioned, artists with these unique works on the blockchain.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:05.040
But I'm not sure those are macroeconomically important. If it's just a new class of collectibles

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:12.000
that people have fun with, again, I say bring it on. But whether there are use cases beyond that,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.680
the challenge fiat monies, which actually work very well. Yesterday, I sent money

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:24.160
to a family in Ethiopia that I helped support. In less than 24 hours, they got that money.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:31.760
Digitally. Yes. No, not digitally, through my bank. My primitive dinosaur bank, BB&T,

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.640
Mid-Atlantic Bank, had quartered in North Carolina,

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.720
charted by the Fed, regulated by the FDAC and the OCC. Now, you could say, well, the exchange rate

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:48.880
was not so great. I don't see crypto as close to beating that once you take into account all of

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:54.800
the last mile problems. The fiat currency works really well. People are not sitting around bitching

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.880
about it. And when you talk to crypto people, the number who have to postulate some out of the

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:04.640
blue hyperinflation, there's no evidence for that whatsoever. That's Denise's sign, they're not

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:08.960
thinking clearly about how hard they have to work to outcompete fiat currency.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.120
There's a bunch of different technologies that are really exciting that don't want to address

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.480
how difficult it is to outcompete the current accepted alternative. So, for example, autonomous

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:27.120
vehicles, a lot of people are really excited. Yeah. But it's not trivial to outcompete Uber

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.720
on the cost and the effectiveness and the user experience and all those kinds of...

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.720
Correct. Sorry, Uber driven by humans.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.120
Yes.

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:42.400
And it's not, that's taken for granted, I think, that look, wouldn't it be amazing? How amazing

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.800
would the world look when the cars are driving themselves fully? It's going to drive the cost

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.440
down. You can remove the cost of drivers, all those kinds of things. But when you actually get down

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:55.760
to it and have to build a business around it, it's actually very difficult to do. And I guess

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:02.400
you're saying your sense is a similar competition is facing cryptocurrency. You have to actually

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:12.720
present a killer app reason to switch from fiat currency to Ethereum or whatever.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.040
And the Biden people are going to regulate crypto and they're going to do it soon. So,

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.800
something like DeFi, I fully get why that is cheaper or for some can be cheaper than other

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:27.760
ways of conducting financial intermediation. But some of that is regulatory arbitrage.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.600
It will not be allowed to go on forever for better or worse. I would rather see it given

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.480
greater tolerance. But the point is banking lobby is strong. The government will only let

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.920
it run so far. There'll be capital requirements, reporting requirements imposed. And it will lose

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:49.760
a lot of those advantages. What do you make of Wall Street bets? Another thing that recently

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:57.600
happened that shook the world and at least me from the outside of perspective make me question

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:05.280
what I do and don't understand about economics, which is a large number of individuals getting

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.280
together on the internet and having a large-scale impact on the markets. If you tell a group of

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.200
people and coordinate them through the internet, we're going to play a fun game. It might cost you

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:18.880
money, but you're going to make the headlines. And there's a chance you'll screw over some

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:24.400
billionaires and hedge funds. Enough people will play that game. So that game might continue. But I

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:30.560
don't think it's of macroeconomic importance. And the price of those stocks in the medium term

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.640
will end up wherever it ought to be. So these are little outliers from a macroeconomics perspective.

01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:46.400
These are not signals of shifting power, like from centralized power to distributed power. These

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.840
aren't some fundamental changes in the way our economy works. I think of it as a new brand of

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:58.000
eSports, maybe more fun than the old brand, which is fine. It's like push the anarchy into the

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.480
corners where you want it. It doesn't bother me, but I think people are seeing it as a more fun

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:09.600
amount than it is. It's a new eSport, more fun for many, but more expensive than the old eSports.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:16.800
Like chess is a new eSport. It's super cheap. Not as fun as sending hedge funds to their doom,

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:23.360
but what would you expect? The poetry of that. I love it. But macroeconomically,

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:28.800
it's not fundamental. I was going to say, I hope you're right because I'm uncomfortable with the

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:35.920
chaos of the masses that's creates. I think that chaos is somewhat real, to be clear,

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:45.200
but it will matter through other channels, not through manipulating GameStop or AMC.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.560
You're seeing the real macro phenomenon. When people see a real macro phenomenon,

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:56.080
they tend to make every micro story fit the narrative. This micro story fits the narrative,

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.520
but it doesn't mean its importance fits the narrative. That's how I would

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.720
kind of dissect the mistake I think people are making.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:07.760
The macro phenomenon that are there, do you mean?

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:12.880
Everyone's weird now. The internet either allows us to be weirder or makes us weirder.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.280
I'm not sure what's the right way to put it. Maybe a mix of both.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.960
You're probably right that it allows us to be weirder because, well, this is the other.

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.480
Okay, so this connects to our previous conversation. Does America allow us to be weirder,

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.600
or does it make us weirder? Say we're weirder and somewhat neurotic to begin with,

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.880
but the only messages we get are Dwight D. Eisenhower and I Love Lucy and Network TV.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:43.760
That's going to keep us within certain bounds in good and bad ways. That's obviously totally gone,

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.920
and the internet you can connect to, not just QAnon, but all sorts of things,

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:54.160
many of them just fantastic. But in good and bad ways, it makes us weirder.

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.920
So that maybe is troubling, right? Like if someone's worried about that,

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.800
I would at least say they should give it deep serious thought. And then it has a whole lot of

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.720
ebbs and flows, micro-realizations of the weirdness that don't actually matter.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:13.760
So like chess players today, they play a lot more weird openings than they did 20 years ago.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.960
Like it reflects the same thing because you can research any weird opening on the internet,

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:24.320
but like does that matter? Probably not. So a lot of the things we see are just like the

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.720
weird chess openings. And to figure out which are like the weird chess openings and which are

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:33.440
fundamental to the new and growing weirdness. Like that's what a hedge fund investor type

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.120
should be trying to do. I just think no one knows yet. It's like this itself, this fun weird guessing

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:44.880
game, which we're partly engaging in right now. Exactly. And I mean, as Eric talks about

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:51.280
on the science side of things, I mean, I said, like at MIT, especially in the machine learning

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:57.520
field, there's a natural institutional resistance to the weird. As they talk about,

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:04.000
it's difficult to hire weird faculty, for example. Correct. You want to hire and give

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.600
tenure to people that are safe, not weird. And that's one of the concerns is like,

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.960
it seems like the weird people are the ones that push the science forward usually.

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:19.360
And so how do you balance it too? It's not obvious. It's another area where Eric and I

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:25.360
disagree. As I interpret him, he thinks academia is totally bankrupt. And I think it's only

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:31.920
partially bankrupt. How do we fix it? Because I'm with you. I'm bullish on academia.

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:37.200
You need up and coming schools that end up better than where they started off. And MIT

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:42.240
was once one of them. Now they're not in every area. In some areas, they have become the problem.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.200
You Chicago, you wouldn't call it up and coming, but it's still different. And that's great. Let's

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:55.360
hope they manage to keep it that way. The biggest problem to me is the rank absurd conformism at

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.560
kind of second tier schools, maybe in the top 40, but not in the top dozen, that are just trying to

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:06.720
be like a junior MIT, but it's mediocre and copycat. And they're the most dogmatic enforcers of

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:11.920
weirdness that like Harvard is more open than those second tier schools. And those second

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.800
tier schools are pretty good, typically, right? Yeah. But the mediocrity is enforced there.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.960
Correct. Very strictly. And the homogenization pressure is trying to climb their rankings by

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:27.680
another three places and be a little closer to MIT, though you'll never touch them. That to me is

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.360
very harmful. And you'd rather they be more like Chicago, more like Caltech, or the older Caltech

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.840
all the more like pick some model, be weird in it. You might fail. That's socially better.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:48.240
Yeah. So the problem with MIT, for example, is the mediocrity is really enforced on the

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.840
junior faculty. So the people that are allowed to be weird, or actually they just don't even ask

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.880
for permissions anymore, are more senior faculty. And that's good, of course, but you want the

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:07.120
weird young people. I find this podcast, I like talking to tech people, and I find the young

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.040
faculty to be really boring. They are. They're the most boring of faculty.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:18.800
Their work is interesting technically, technically, but just the passion. They are dredges.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.560
And some of them sneak by. Like you have like the young version of Max Tagmark who

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.160
knows how to play the role of boring and fitting in. And then on the side, he does the weird shit.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:40.800
But they're not, they're far and few in between, which I'd love to figure out a way to shake up

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:46.080
that system because. If you look at MIT's Broad Institute, right, in biomedical, it's been a

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:51.600
huge hit. I'm not privy to their internal doings, but I suspect they support weird

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.560
more than the formal departments do at the junior level. Yes, that's probably true. Yeah,

01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:03.760
I don't know what whatever they're doing is working, but it needs to figure it out because I

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:11.280
think the best ideas still do come from the, so forget my apologies, but for the humanity side

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:16.400
of things, I don't know anything, Bob, but the engineering and the science side, I think there's

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:20.800
so many amazing ideas that are still coming from universities. It's not true that you don't know

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.600
anything about the humanities. You're doing the humanities right now. We're talking about people.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.160
There are no numbers put on a blackboard, right? There's no hypothesis testing per se.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:36.080
You have however many subscribers to your podcast, all listening to you on the humanities.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.800
Whatever your frequency is. But I'm not in the department of the humanities.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.240
That's why it's innovative. They have very different conversations.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:53.840
The number of emails I get about, listen, I really deeply respect diversity and the full

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.880
scope of what diversity means and also the more narrow scope of different races and genders and

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.920
so on. It's a really important topic, but there's a disproportionate number of emails I'm getting

01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:09.840
about meetings and discussions and that just kind of is overwhelming. I don't get enough emails

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:18.720
from people like a meeting about why are all your ideas bad? For example, let me call out MIT.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:25.440
Why don't we do more? Why don't we kick Stanford's ass or Google's ass more importantly in deep

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:31.520
learning and machine learning and AI research. What CCEL, for example, used to be a laboratory,

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:39.680
is a laboratory for artificial intelligence research. Why is that not the beacon of

01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.040
greatness in artificial intelligence? Let's have those meetings as well.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.400
Diversity talk has oddly become this new mechanism for enforcing conformity.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:54.880
Yes, exactly. It's almost like this conformity mechanism finds

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.080
the hot new topic to use to enforce further conformity.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:03.280
Exactly. Oh boy, I still hope I'm an optimistic.

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.880
The humanities have innovated through podcasts, including yours and mine,

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:13.760
and they're alive and well. All the bad talk you hear about the humanities in universities,

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.520
there's been this huge end run of innovation on the internet, and it's amazing.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.080
You're right. I never thought, I mean, this is humanities.

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:25.920
It's like I've been speaking prose all one's life and didn't know it, right?

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.840
Yeah, I am actually part of the humanities department at MIT now.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:36.000
I did not realize this, and I will fully embrace it from this moment on.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.960
Look, you have this thing, the Media Lab, I'm sure you know about it.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.680
Done some excellent things, done a lot of very bogus things,

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.960
but you're out competing them. You're blowing them out of the water.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.800
Yeah. Like you are them.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.360
Yeah, and I'm talking to those folks, and they're trying to figure it out.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:56.320
I mean, they had their issues with Jeff Epstein and so on, but outside of that,

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:01.680
there's actually gone through a shift with this particular podcast, for example,

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:08.880
where at first, it was seen as one, at the very first, it was seen as a distraction.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:13.600
Second, it was a source of almost like a kind of jealousy,

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.080
like the same kind of jealousy you feel when junior faculty outshines the senior faculty.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:18.960
Of course.

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.680
And now it's more like, oh, okay, this is a thing. We should do more of that.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.240
We should embrace this guy. We should embrace this thing.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:31.920
So there's a sense that podcasting and whatever this is, and it doesn't have to be podcasting,

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.440
will drive some innovation within MIT, within different universities.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:41.120
There's a sense that things are changing. It's just that university is lagged behind.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:49.440
And my hope is that they catch up quickly. They innovate in some way that goes along

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.160
with the innovations of the internet. I think the internet will outrace them for a long time,

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:58.480
maybe forever. Well, I mean, but it's okay if they're, as long as they keep them.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:02.640
Yeah, and we're both in universities, so we have multiple hats on here, as we're speaking.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.520
We can complain about the university, but that's like complaining about the podcast.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.280
Yeah, we be them.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:17.520
But speaking on the weird, you've, in the best sense of the word weird, you've written about

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.280
and made the case that we should take you a full sightings more seriously.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:32.960
So that's one of the things that I've been inundated with, sort of the excitement and the

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:40.000
passion that people have for the possibility of extraterrestrial life, of life out there in

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
the universe. I've always felt this excitement. I'm just looking up at the stars and wondering

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:51.520
what the hell's out there. But there's people that have more like, more grounded excitement

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:57.040
and passion of actually interacting with the, with aliens on this here, our planet.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:04.800
What's the case from your perspective for taking these sightings more seriously?

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:13.840
The data from the Navy to me seem quite serious. I don't pretend that I have the technical

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:20.480
abilities to judge it as data, but there are numerous senators at the very highest of levels,

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:25.840
former heads of CIA, Brennan, I talked to him, did an interview with him. I asked him,

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:30.640
what's up with these? What do you think it is? He basically said that was the single most likely

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.240
explanation was of alien origin. Now you don't have to agree with him. But look, if you know how

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:41.520
government works, these senators or Hillary Clinton for that matter or Brennan, they sat down,

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:45.920
they were briefed by their smartest people and they said, hey, what's going on here?

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:53.040
And everyone around the table, I believe is telling them, we don't know. And that is sociological data.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:58.960
I take very seriously. I have not seen a debunking of the technical data.

01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.440
Yes.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:03.760
Which is eyewitness reports and images and radar. Again, at a technical level,

01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:09.200
I feel quite uncertain on that turf. But evaluating the testimony of witnesses,

01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:14.320
it seems to me it's now at a threshold where one ought to take it seriously.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:20.320
Yeah, there's a, one of the problems with UFO sightings is that because of people with good

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:27.280
equipment, don't take it seriously. It's such a taboo topic that you have just like really

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:32.640
shitty equipment collecting data. And so you have the blurry bigfoot kind of situation where you

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:39.760
have just bad video and all those kinds of things. As opposed to, I mean, there's a bunch of people,

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:49.920
Avi Lo from Harvard talking about Amua Amua. It's just like people with the equipment to do

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:59.120
the data collection don't want to help out. And that creates a kind of divide where the scientists

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.440
ignore that this is happening. And there's the masses of people who are curious about it.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And then there's the government that's full of secrets. That's leaking some confusion.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.400
And it creates distrust in the government. It creates distrust in science.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.760
And it prevents the scientists from being able to explore some cool topics,

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.280
some exciting possibilities that they should be, be curious kids like Avi talks about.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.320
Even if it has nothing to do with aliens, whatever the answer is, it has to be something

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.600
fascinating. We already know everything's interesting, but this is fascinating.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.000
But look, that all said, I suspect they're not of alien origin. And let's let me tell you my

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.920
reason. The people who are all gung-ho, they do a kind of reasoning in reverse or argument from

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:51.520
elimination. They figure out a bunch of things that can't be like, is it a Russian advanced vehicle?

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.560
No, probably pretty good arguments there. Is it a Chinese advanced vehicle? No.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:03.520
Is it people like from the Earth's future coming back in time? No. And they go through a few others.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.960
They have some really good, no arguments. And they're like, well, what we've got left is aliens.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.600
This argument from elimination, I don't actually find that persuasive. You can talk yourself into

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:20.400
a lot of mistaken ideas that way. The positive evidence that it's aliens is still quite weak.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.360
The positive evidence that it's a puzzle is quite huge.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.400
And whatever the solutions to the puzzle is, it might be fascinating.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.800
And it's going to be so weird or fascinating or maybe even trivial, but that's weird in its own way

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:38.640
that we can't set up by elimination all the things that might be able to be.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.200
Yeah. And just like you said, the debunking that I've seen of these kinds of things

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:52.160
are less explorations and solutions to the puzzle and more a kind of have-hearted dismissal.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:58.640
And Avi, as you mentioned to him on your podcast with him, he's been attacked an awful lot.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.880
And when I hear the idea carrier attacked, I get very suspicious of the critics.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:11.200
If he's wrong, just tell me why. My ears are open. I don't have a set view on Oumuamua.

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.920
I know I can't judge Avi's arguments. He can't convince me in that sense.

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.760
I'm too stupid to understand how good his argument may or may not be.

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:27.920
And like you said, ultimately, in the argument, in the meeting of that debate

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.560
is where we find the wisdom, like dismissing it. There's one thing that troubles me.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.360
There's a bunch of people like Nietzsche, sometimes dismiss this way,

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:41.200
Ein Miranda, sometimes dismiss this way. Oh, here we go. There's a supposed to

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:47.520
arguing against her ideas, dismissing it outright. And that's not productive at all.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.800
She may be wrong in a lot of things, but like laying out some arguments,

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:58.480
even if they're basic human arguments, that's where we arrive at the wisdom. I love that.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:06.640
Is there something deeper to be said about our trust in institutions and governments and so on

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:13.120
that has to do with UFOs? That there's a kind of suspicion that the US government and governments

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.960
in general are hiding stuff from us when you talk about UFOs.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:22.800
This is my view on that. If we declassified everything, I think we would find a lot more

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:28.160
evidence all pointing toward the same puzzle. There aren't some alien men being held underground.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:31.520
Yes. There's not some secret file that lays out whatever is happening.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:38.080
I think the real lesson about government is government cannot bring itself to any

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:44.640
new belief on this matter of any kind. And it's a funny inertia. Government is deeply puzzled.

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:50.080
They're more puzzled than they want to admit to us, which I'm okay with that, actually.

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:54.560
They shouldn't just be out panicking people in the streets. But at the end of the day,

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:58.960
it's a bit like approving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which does work, and they haven't

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:05.520
approved it. When are they going to do it? When is our government actually, if only internally,

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.240
going to take this more than just seriously, but take it truly seriously?

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:14.320
And I just don't know if we have that capability, kind of mentally,

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.600
to sound like Eric Weinstein for another moment.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.520
To stay on the same topic, although on the surface shifting completely,

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:31.120
because it is all the same topic, you have written and studied art. What do you think we humans

01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:37.120
mean? Long to create art. Human society in general, and just the human mind.

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:42.640
Well, most of us don't really long to create art, right? I would start with that point.

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:49.840
You think so? You think that's the unique weirdness of some particular humans?

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.520
I think, I don't know, 10% of humans, roughly, which is a lot. But it is somewhat weird.

01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:59.280
Yeah. I don't aspire to create art. You could say

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.440
a writing nonfiction, there's something art-like about it, but it's a different urge, I would say.

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:15.200
So why do some people have it? I think human brains are very different. It's a different

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:20.800
notion of working through a problem, like you and I enjoy working through analytic problems.

01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:26.400
For me, economics for you AI in other areas or your humanity's podcast, but that's fun.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:33.520
For that problem to be visual and linked to physical materials and putting those on a canvas,

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:41.440
to me, it's not a huge leap. But I really don't want to do it. It would be pain. If you paid me

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:49.280
like 500 bucks to spend an hour painting, I don't know. Is that worth it? Maybe, but

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:55.920
I'm happy when that hour's over. And would not be proud or happy with the results?

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.040
It would suck. I don't think I would do it, actually.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:06.640
Do you think you're suppressing some deep... Absolutely not. Now, when I was young, I played

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.720
the guitar as you played the guitar, and that I greatly enjoyed, although I was never good.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.240
But it helped me appreciate music much, much more. Well, this is the question. Okay. So from the

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:22.160
perspective of the observer and the appreciator of art, you said good. Is there such a concept as

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:28.160
good in art? There's clearly a concept of bad. My guitar playing fit that concept.

01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:33.520
Okay. But I wasn't trying to be good. I wanted to learn how do chords work?

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:37.040
Okay. Analytical. How does a jazz improvisation work? How is blues different?

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:40.560
Classical guitar, sort of physically, how do you make those sounds?

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.640
Yes. And I did learn those things. And you can't learn everything about them,

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.560
but you can learn a lot about them without ever being good or even trying to be that good.

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:53.680
But I could play all the notes. So from the observer perspective, what do you...

01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:00.240
Apologize to the absurd question, but what do you use the most beautiful or maybe a moving

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.800
piece of art you've encountered in your life? It's not an absurd question at all.

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:13.440
And I think about this quite a bit. I would say the two winners by a clear margin are both by

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:20.720
Michelangelo. It's the Pieta in the Vatican and the David statue in Florence.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.200
Why? Historical context or just purity, the creation itself?

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.960
I don't think you can view it apart from historical context and being in Florence

01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:34.400
or in the Vatican. You're already primed for a lot, right? You can't pull that out.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:42.000
But just technically how they express the emotion of human form, I do honestly intellectually think

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.280
they're the two greatest artworks for doing that. That's not all that art does. Not all art is about

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:54.160
the human form, but they are phenomenal. And I think critical opinion, not that everyone agrees,

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:58.880
but my view is not considered a crazy one within the broader part of critical opinion.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:05.440
Now in painting, I think the most I was ever blown away was to see Vermeer's artwork. It's

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:11.760
called the Art of Painting and it's in Vienna in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. And I saw that,

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:18.880
I think I was 23. It just stunned me because I'd seen reproductions, but live in front of you

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:22.480
in huge, a completely different artwork. And again, Vienna primed.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.560
Yes. And I was living abroad for the first time in Vienna itself, the city and so on.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:32.080
Now, unlike the Michelangeloes, that is not my current favorite painting,

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:35.360
but that would be like historically the one I would pick.

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.600
What do you make in the context of those choices? What do you make of modern art?

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:45.520
And I apologize if I'm not using the correct terminology, but art that maybe

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:53.200
is goes another level of weird outside of the art that you've kind of mentioned and breaks

01:42:53.200 --> 01:43:00.720
all the conventions and rules and so on and becomes something else entirely that doesn't make sense

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:06.880
in the same way that David might. I think a lot of it is phenomenal. And I would say the single

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:13.040
biggest mistake that really smart people make is to think contemporary art or music for that

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:17.840
matter is just a load of junk or rubbish. It's just like a kind of mathematics they haven't

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:23.920
learned yet. It's really hard to learn. Maybe some people can never learn it. But there's

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.600
a very large community of super smart, well-educated people who spend their lives with it, who love it.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.360
Those are genuine pleasures. They understand it. They talk about it with the common language.

01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.640
And to think that somehow they're all frauds, it just isn't true. Like one doesn't have to

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.000
like it oneself, just like love house may or may not be your thing. But it is amazing and for me

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.840
personally highly rewarding. And if someone doesn't get it, I do kind of have the conceited response

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.840
of thinking like in that area, I'm just smarter than you are. Yeah. So the interesting thing is,

01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.040
as with most... We get back to Eric Weinstein again. Yes.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.920
Who is in general smarter than I am. This I get. But when it comes to contemporary

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:08.720
artistic creations, I'm smarter than he is. So he's not a fan of contemporary art?

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:12.000
I don't want to speak for him. I've heard him say... He's evolving always.

01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.400
He's evolving always. I've heard him say derogatory things about some of it. Doesn't

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.840
mean he doesn't love some other parts of it. So I wonder if there's just a higher learning curve,

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:28.080
a steeper learning curve for contemporary art, meaning like it takes more work to appreciate

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:33.360
the stories, the context from which they're like thinking about this work. It feels like

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:37.600
in order to appreciate the art, contemporary, certain pieces of contemporary art,

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:42.800
you have to know the story better behind the art. I think that's true for many people,

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.120
but I think it's a funny shape distribution because there's a whole other set of people,

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:52.880
sometimes just small children, and they get abstract art more easily. You show them Vermeer

01:44:52.880 --> 01:45:00.640
or Rembrandt, they don't get it. But just like a wall of color, they're in love with it. So

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:05.120
I don't think I know the full story. Again, some strange kind of distribution. The entry

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.040
barriers are super high or super low, but not that often in between.

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:16.160
But you would challenge saying that there's a lot to be explored in contemporary art is just

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:24.000
you need to learn. Yeah, it's one of the most profound bodies of human thought out there,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.720
and it's part of the humanities. And yes, there are people who also don't like podcasts, right?

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:37.040
And that's fine. Yeah. He's also been a scholar of food. We're just going through the entirety of

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:44.560
the human experience today on this humanities podcast. Another absurd question, say this

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.720
conversation is the last thing you ever do in your life. We're in the suit,

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.560
would murder you at the end of the conversation. So this is your last day on earth,

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:58.560
but I would offer you a last meal. What would that meal contain? We can also travel to other

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:04.160
parts of the world. Well, we have to travel because my preferred last meal here, I probably had like

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:10.160
two nights ago. Which is what? Can you describe or no? The best restaurant around here is called

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:17.440
Mama Chang's and it's in Fairfax and it's food from Wuhan, actually. And they take pandemic

01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:23.760
safety seriously in addition to the food being very good. But this is what I would do. I would fly

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:30.400
to Hermosillo in northern Mexico, which has some of the best food in Mexico, but I sadly only had

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:38.000
two days there. So somewhere like Oaxaca Puebla, I think they have food just as good or some people

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.920
would say better, but I've spent a lot of time in those places. Wait, is it possible the scarcity

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:48.480
of time contributed to the richness of the experience? Of course, but the point is that scarcity

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:55.520
still holds. So I want one more dose of the food from Hermosillo. Can we describe what the food is?

01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.680
It's the one kind of Mexican food that at least nominally is just like the Mexican food you get

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:05.760
in the US. So there are burritos, there's fajitas. It doesn't taste at all like our stuff. But again,

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:11.040
nominally, it's the part of Mexican food that made it into the US was then transformed.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:16.480
Yes. But it's in a way the most familiar. But for that reason, it's the most radical because you

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:22.080
have to rethink all these things you know, and they're way better in Hermosillo. Hardly any tourists

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:28.000
go there. Like there's nothing to see in Hermosillo. Nothing to do other than eat. It's not ruined by any

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:34.640
outsiders. It's this longstanding tradition, dirt cheap. And the thing to do there is just sweet

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.200
talk a taxi driver into first taking you seriously and then trusting you enough to know that you

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:47.920
trust him to bring you to the very best like food stands. So where's the magic of that

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:56.960
nominally similar entity of the burrito? Where's the magic come from? Is it the taxi ride? Is it

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:01.440
the whole experience? Or is there something actually in the food? Well, you can break the food down

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:07.360
part by part. So if you think of the beef, the beef there will be dry aged just out in the air

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.400
in a way the FDA here would never permit. Like they dry age it till it turns green,

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:17.440
but it is phenomenal. The quality of the chilies. So here, there's only a small

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:22.640
number of kinds of chilies you can get in most parts of Mexico. There's quite a large number

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:27.840
of chilies you can get. They're different. They're fresher, but it's just like a different thing,

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:35.280
the chilies. The wheat used, so this is wheat territory, not corn territory, which is itself

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:41.040
interesting. The wheat is more diverse and more complex. Here, it's more homogenized,

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:48.320
obviously cheaper, more efficient, but there it is better. Non-pasteurized cheeses are legal

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:53.760
in all parts of Mexico, and they can be white and gooey and amazing in a way that here again,

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.600
it's just against the law. You could legalize them. The demand wouldn't be that great.

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.440
There's a black market in these cheeses that Latino groceries around here,

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.120
but you just can't get that much of it. So the cheese, the meat, the wheat, all different

01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.440
in significant ways. The chilies, I don't think the onions really matter much. Garlic,

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:18.560
I don't know. I wouldn't put much stock in that, but that's a lot of the core food,

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:24.160
and then it's cooked much better, and everything's super fresh. The food chain is not relying on

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.920
refrigeration, and this is one thing Russia and US have in common. We were early pioneers

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:34.800
in food refrigeration, and that made a lot of our foods worse quite early, and it took us a

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:42.000
long time to dig out of that because big countries, right? You've had an extensive rail system in

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.720
Russia at USSR a long time, which makes it easier to freeze and then ship. What about the actual

01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:56.400
cooking? The chef, is there an artistry to the simple? I hesitate to call the burrito simple,

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.400
but- And there's no brain drain out of cooking. So if you're in the United States and you're

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.000
very talented, I'm not saying there aren't talented chefs. Of course there are,

01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.680
but there's so many other things to pull people away. But in Mexico, there's so much talent going

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.640
into food, as there is in China, which would be another candidate for last meal questions,

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:24.160
or India. Oh, India. That's not even get started. Unbelievable. There's a

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:27.360
million things we could talk about here, but you've written about Jiro, dreams of sushi.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:36.480
This is just a really clean, good example that people are aware of, of mastery in the art of

01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:44.000
the simple in food. What do you make of that obsessive pursuit of perfection in creating

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.320
simple food? Sushi is about perfection, but it's a bit like the Beatles' white album,

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.160
which people think is simple and not overproduced. It's in a funny way, their most overproduced album,

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.680
but it's produced just perfectly. It sounds simple. It's really hard to produce music to the point

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:04.240
where it's going to sound so simple and not sound like sludge, like let it be album.

01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:10.000
There's some great songs, but a lot of it sounds like sludge. One after 909, that's sludge. I dig

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.640
up on each sludge. Like it's a bit interesting. It's not that good. It doesn't sound that good.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:19.840
White album, like the best half, like Dear Prudence. Sounds perfect. Sounds simple.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:27.440
Cry, baby, cry. It's not simple. Back in the USSR. Super complex. Sushi is like that. It's because

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:33.680
it's so incredibly not simple, starting with the rice. You try to refine it to make it appear super

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:41.120
simple, and that's the most complex thing of all. Do you admire, I mean, we're not talking about

01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:47.840
days, weeks, months. We're talking about years, generations of doing the same thing over and

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:53.280
over and over again. Do you admire that kind of sticking to the, does that, you know, we talked

01:51:53.280 --> 01:52:00.400
about our admiration of the weird. That doesn't feel weird. That seems like discipline and dedication

01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:07.280
to like a stoic minimalism or something like that. I'm happy they do it, but I actually feel bad

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:13.440
about it. I feel they're sacrificial victims to me, which I benefit from. But don't you ever think

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:19.840
like, gee, you're a great master sushi chef. Wouldn't you be happier if you did something else?

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:26.560
Doesn't seem to happen. That might be something that a weird mind would think. Maybe it is weird

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:32.720
people, and maybe they're really enjoying it, but like to learn how to pack rice for 10 years

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.680
before they let you do anything else. It's like these Indian, you know, Sarod players,

01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.240
they just spent five years tapping out rhythms before they're allowed to touch their instruments.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.520
Well, actually, to defend that. It's kind of like graduate school, right?

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:56.960
Well, I think graduate school, perhaps I graduate school is full of like every single day is full

01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:03.920
surprises, I would say. I did martial arts for a long time, I do martial arts. And I've always

01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:10.000
loved kind of the Russian way of drilling is doing the same technique. I don't know if this

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:15.840
applies into intellectual or academic disciplines where you can do the same thing over and over

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:22.560
and over again, thousands and thousands and thousands of times. What I've discovered through

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:28.480
that process is you get to start to appreciate the tiniest of details and find the beauty in them.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:35.520
People who go to like monasteries to meditate, talk about this, is when you just sit in silence

01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:41.920
and don't do anything, you start to appreciate how much complexity and beauty there is in just

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:48.000
the movement of a finger. Like you can spend the whole day joyously thinking about how fun it is

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:56.240
to move a finger. And then you can almost become your full weird self about the tiniest details of

01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:00.480
life. The thing you've got to wonder, like is there a free lunch in there? Are the rest of us

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:06.960
moving around too much? Yeah, exactly. They sure feel like they found a free lunch that people

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.800
meditate. They're onto something. I tend to think it's like artists that some percent of people

01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:17.680
are like that, but most are not. And for most of us, there's no free lunch. Like my free lunch is

01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:23.920
to move around a lot in search of lunch, in fact. Well, with all the food talk, it made me hungry.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:32.720
What books, three or so books, if any come to mind, technical fiction philosophical,

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:39.520
would you recommend? Had a big impact on you? Or you just drew some insights from throughout your

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:45.600
life? Well, two of them we've already discussed. One is Plato's Dialogues, which I started reading

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:52.880
when I was like 13. Another is Inran Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal. But I would say the Friedrich

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:58.880
Hayek essay, The Use of Knowledge in Society, which is about how decentralized mechanisms can work,

01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:05.040
also why they might go wrong. And that's where you start to understand the price system capitalism.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.520
And that was in a book called Individualism and Economic Order. But it was just a few essays in

01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:14.480
that book. Those are maybe the three I would cite. Can you elaborate a little bit on the...

01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.200
Say the price of copper goes up, right? Because there's a problem with the copper mine in Chile

01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:24.080
or Bolivia. So the price of copper goes up all around the world. People are led to economize

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.280
copper, to look for substitutes for copper, to change their production processes, to change

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:35.760
the goods and services they buy, to build homes a different way. And this one event creates this

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:42.480
one tiny change in information. It gets into your AI work very directly. And how much complexity

01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:48.640
that one change engenders in a meaningful, coherent way, how the different pieces of

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:56.240
the price system fit together. Hayek really laid out very clearly. And it's like an AI problem.

01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:00.240
And how well, not for everything, but for many things, we solved that AI problem.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.000
I learned, I was, I think, 13, maybe 14 when I read Hayek.

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:06.640
The distributed nature of things there.

01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.400
And it's like your work on human attention, like how much can we take in?

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:10.800
Yes.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.880
Very often, not that much. And how many of the advances of modern civilization you need to

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:21.200
understand as a response to that constraint? I got that also from Hayek.

01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:22.480
What's the title of the book again?

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.600
It's reprinted in a lot of books at this point. But back then, the book was called

01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:34.400
Individualism and Economic Order. But the essay is online, Hayek, Use of Knowledge in Society.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.400
There are open access versions of it through Google. And you don't need the whole book.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.000
So it's a very good book.

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:47.200
Again, one of those profound looking over the ocean, maybe sitting on a porch,

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:55.520
maybe with a drink of some kind. And a young kid comes by and asks you for advice. What advice

01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:02.800
would you give? A drink. That's my advice. I'm serious. So, okay, after that,

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:10.800
what advice would you give to a young person today as they take on life?

01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:18.240
Whether a career in academia in general or just a life, which is probably more important than career?

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:23.920
Most good advice is context specific. But here are my two generic pieces of advice.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:30.000
First, get a mentor. Both career, but anything you want to learn. Say you want to learn about

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:36.000
contemporary art. People write me this. What book should I read? It's probably not going to work

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.080
that way. You need a mentor. Yes, you should read some books on it. But you want a mentor to help

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:45.120
you frame them, take you around to some art, talk about it with you. So get as many mentors as you

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:53.120
can in the things you want to learn. And then- Caske, a quick tangent on that. Presumably a

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:59.120
good mentor. Of course. Is there- I'm begging the question in there. It's complicated, right?

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.480
Well, it is complicated. Is there a lot of damage to be done from a bad mentor?

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.320
I don't think that much because it's very easy to drop mentors. And in fact,

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.960
it's quite hard to maintain them. Good mentors tend to be busy. Bad mentors tend to be busy.

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.160
And you can try on mentors and maybe they're not good for you, but you still-

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.280
There's a good chance you'll learn something. Like I had a mentor. I was an undergrad. He was a

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.560
Stalinist. He edited the book called The Essential Stalin. Brilliant guy. I learned a tremendous

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:32.800
amount from him. Was he like as a Stalinist, a good mentor for me? Fanofiak? Well, no. But for a

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:40.800
year, it was tremendous. Yeah. He introduced me like to, you know, Soviet and Eastern European

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:45.280
science fiction because he was a Marxist. Like that's what I took from him, among other things.

01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:52.560
Any advice on finding a good mentor? Daniel Kahneman has- somebody just popped us to mind

01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:57.120
as somebody who was able to find exceptionally good collaborators throughout his life. There's

01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:05.840
not many bright minds that find collaborators. They often, which I ultimately see what a mentor is.

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:12.160
Yeah. Be interesting, be direct and try. It's not like a perfect formula, but it's amazing

01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:16.800
how many people don't even do those things. Be interesting, be direct and try.

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:22.160
Like what you want from a better known person, I would just say be very direct with them.

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:30.000
Yeah. Beautiful. What's the second piece of advice? Build small groups of peers. They don't have to be

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:34.400
your age, but very often they'll be your age, especially if you're younger, with broadly

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:39.040
similar interests, but there can be different points of view. People you hang out with, which

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:44.480
can include in a WhatsApp group online. And like every day or almost every day, they're talking

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:49.520
about the thing you care about, trying to solve problems in that thing. And that's your small

01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:53.760
group and you really like them and they like you and you care what you think about each other,

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:58.240
and you have this common interest. That's for human connection or that's for development of

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:03.520
ideas? It's both. They're not that different. Like Beatles, classic small group, right?

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:09.440
But there's so much drama. The Florentine artists, of course there's drama and small groups tend to

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:15.120
split up, which is fine, just like entering relationships often end. But it's remarkable

02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:18.800
how little has been done that was not done in small groups in some way.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:27.600
So speaking of loss of beautiful relationships, what do you make this whole love thing?

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:35.600
Why do humans fall in love? What's the role of love, friendship, family, and life

02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:42.000
in a successful life or just life in general? Why the hell are we so into this thing?

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:46.720
There are multiple layers of understanding that question. So the lowest layer is the

02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:52.560
Darwinian answer. If we weren't this way, we wouldn't have been successful in reproducing and

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:59.120
building alliances. It's important to realize that's far from complete. The highest understanding

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:05.520
would be poetic, like read John Keats or many other love poets. So who do I go to to find out,

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:09.440
to learn about love in terms of poets? I would say start with John Keats,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.680
but given that you're fluent in Russian. Yeah, let's go Russian literature for a

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:25.040
second. You keep mentioning Russia. What's your connection? What's your love in Russia?

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:29.280
Well, first, it's all interesting, but more concretely, my wife was born in Moscow.

02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.200
Sokolniki was her favorite. Oh, wow. Yeah. Wow. And she grew up there. I married her here.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:41.840
My daughter, I adopted her. I'm not her biological father, but I genuinely raised her. She was born

02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:47.440
in Russia, though she came here when she was one. Wow. So you're basically Russian? No,

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:52.960
no, no. I'm a New Jersey boy. That's the same thing. I'm very sorry to report. My father-in-law

02:01:52.960 --> 02:02:00.400
passed away a week ago. He lived with us for six years. He lived in Russia till he was 70,

02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:08.080
saw Stalin, his father was brought to a camp, lived through World War II, much,

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:15.680
much more, had an incredible life, never really learned how to speak English. So I absorbed

02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:21.840
something Russian from him as well. He was part Armenian. So that's my connection to Russia.

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.640
A bit of the Russian soul, too. I don't think I have it. I think I appreciate it,

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:33.280
but there's division of labor, right? Others in the family. Take care of that. I'm more superficial.

02:02:34.400 --> 02:02:38.960
You mentioned Keats and that higher version, that non-Darwinian love. What's that about?

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:45.920
That it's the highest form of human connection, and it's intoxicating, and it's part of building a

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:52.480
life, and most of us are very, very strongly drawn to it. And it's part of the highest realization

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:58.880
of you being what you can be. Yeah. He mentioned you lost. But ask a Russian. I mean, this is

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.200
superficial New Jersey boy who grew up listening to Bruce Springsteen, and that was his romanticism.

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:13.280
What's your favorite Bruce Springsteen song? I think the album Born to Run has actually held up

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.240
the best. That was very fashionable to think the earlier or later works are actually better,

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:23.360
and that's the overproduced Super Pop album. But the quality of the songs to me Born to Run is

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:28.720
far and away the best than Darkness on the Edge of Town, and those are still my favorites.

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:36.720
Born to Run is an incredible song, and perfectly produced in a Phil Specter kind of way. Every

02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:42.960
detail is right. Every lyric. What else is on an album? Thunder Row, Jungle Land, 10th Avenue,

02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:49.600
Freeze Out, She's the Wine, Unbelievable, Meeting Across the River. I really like,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:59.120
I like when he goes into love personally, like I'm on fire. That's a very good song, Dancing in

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:05.120
the Dark. A lot of the later work, I find the percussion becomes too simple and kind of too white

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:12.000
somehow, and a little clunky. And it's still good work. He's super talented, but it doesn't speak

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.160
to me. But when it all bursts open into the open road like it does on Born to Run, that's magic.

02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:22.160
Yeah. Have you ever seen him live?

02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:29.280
Yes, twice. I wonder what he's like live when he was young, right? Those years.

02:04:29.280 --> 02:04:36.080
I saw him live when he was young. I was young. New Jersey. I was a little disappointed actually.

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:42.800
I think what I like best from him is quite studio. He certainly played well. I don't fault

02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:48.800
his performance. But it's like when I saw Plant and Page of Led Zeppelin, tremendous creators,

02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.360
and they showed up. They were not drunk. They were paying attention. But I was underwhelmed

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:58.480
because Led Zeppelin, like the Beatles White album, is much more of a studio band than you

02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:02.560
think at first. And in the case of Bruce Springsteen, I don't know about you, but for me,

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:09.920
he's somebody that I connect with the most when I'm alone and there's like a melancholy feeling.

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:14.320
And actually driving up my folks live in Philly. I went to school in Philly.

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.000
You're almost worthy of New Jersey then?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:27.920
Yeah. Well, you're almost worthy of Russia. So we can connect and then ask. I mean,

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:36.560
I loved your something. I feel like, I don't know. There's this beautiful,

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:43.440
like there's an Olga's diner that closed down. I used to go there. There's a melancholy feeling

02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:49.440
to me. Of course. A thickness to culture in that part of the world, which is oddly similar to some

02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:54.240
elements of the thickness of Russian culture. And when you see Russian characters on the Sopranos,

02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:58.320
it totally makes sense, even though they're these complete outliers.

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:05.760
Exactly. It totally makes sense. You mentioned you lost your father-in-law last week.

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:14.000
Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?

02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:18.800
I don't think about my own mortality that much, which is probably a good thing.

02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:25.360
I think death will be bad. I wouldn't say I'm afraid of it. For me, the worst thing about death

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:29.680
is not knowing how the human story turns out. The full human story.

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:34.480
The full human story. So if I could, right before I die, read like a Wikipedia page

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:39.040
called The Rest of Human History and have enough time, just like a few days to absorb it, think

02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:44.960
about it. And no, like, oh, well, 643 years from now, that's when all the atomic weapons went off.

02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:49.360
And here's what happened between now and then. I would feel much better dying.

02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:54.960
Because that's not how it's going to be, right? That's unlikely.

02:06:54.960 --> 02:07:01.840
It's almost like the Hitchhiker's Guide. They have a one or two sentence description of the human

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:06.960
of what goes on on Earth. It's interesting to think if there's a lot of intelligent civilizations

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:12.560
out there that in the big Encyclopedia that describes the universe, humans will only have one

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:17.440
sentence. Probably true. But it's the only one I can read and understand, right?

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:22.720
And it may be hard to understand the human one past a number of centuries.

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:30.320
Like how many years from now will reading Wikipedia be like trying to read Chaucer?

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:35.680
Which I almost can do, but I actually can't. I need a translation. Probably you can't do

02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:40.960
it at all. Yeah. I mean, maybe reading will be outdated. It might be a very silly notion.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:46.000
Maybe we're fundamentally, like we think language is fundamental to cognition,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.680
but it could be something visual or something totally different that we'll plug in.

02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:55.760
Neural anchor, yeah. But in that story, that Wikipedia article,

02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.920
do you think there'll be a section on the meaning of it?

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:06.480
I hope not. Because that section we could write now and it's just not going to be very good,

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:11.520
what would you put in the section on the meaning of human existence?

02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:17.520
I don't know, links to a lot of other sections. I don't think there are general statements about

02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.640
the meaning of life that have that much meaning. I think if you study different cultures, the arts,

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.120
travel, mathematics, like whatever your thing is, you'll get a lot about the meaning of life.

02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:31.760
So like it's there in Wikipedia in some bigger sense. But I don't want to read the page on

02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:35.920
the meaning. I bet they have such a page. In fact, the fact that I've never visited it,

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.360
none of my friends, oh, here, Tyler, here's the page on the meaning of life. I know you've

02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:43.280
been wondering about this. You got to read this one. No one's ever done that to you, have they?

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:47.920
It probably has. Well, I actually gone to that page. It does in fact have a lot of links to other

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:56.400
pages. Okay. So that's it. The meaning of life is just a bunch of self-referential

02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:04.400
or citation needed type of statements. I think there's no better way to end it, Tyler. It's a

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:10.400
huge honor. I'm a huge fan. Thank you so much for wasting all of this time with me. It was one of

02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:14.560
the greatest conversations I've ever had. Thank you so much. My pleasure and delighted to finally

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:20.160
have met you and that we can do this. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tyler Cohen

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:27.440
and thank you to Linode, ExpressVPN, SimplySafe, and Public Goods. Check them out in the description

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:32.720
to support this podcast. And now let me leave you with some words from Adam Smith.

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:39.200
Little Else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest

02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:44.880
barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice.

02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:57.840
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
