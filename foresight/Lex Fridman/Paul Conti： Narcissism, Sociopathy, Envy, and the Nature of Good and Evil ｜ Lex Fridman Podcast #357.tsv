0	1840	Narcissism is not arrogance.
1840	4240	Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.
4240	8280	There is such a deep sense of inadequacy
8280	10800	and incompetence in the self
10800	14120	that the defensive structure around that
14120	18480	becomes dominated by like rocket-fueled envy.
21840	24600	The following is a conversation with Paul Conti,
24600	28120	a psychiatrist and a brilliant scholar of human nature.
28120	30440	My friend, Andrew Huberman,
30440	33660	told me that Paul and I absolutely must meet and talk,
33660	35600	not just about the topic of trauma,
35600	38320	which Paul wrote an amazing book about,
38320	40080	but broadly about human nature,
40080	42960	about narcissism, sociopathy, psychopathy,
42960	47360	good and evil, hate and love, happiness and envy.
47360	49360	As usual, Andrew was right.
49360	51480	This was a fascinating conversation.
51480	52880	As the old meme goes,
52880	55940	one does not simply doubt the advice of Andrew Huberman.
56860	58820	Allow me to also quickly mention
58820	62260	that I disagree with Paul a bunch in this episode
62260	65260	as I do in other episodes, even with experts.
65260	66900	In part for fun and in part
66900	70100	because I think the tension of ideas and conversation
70100	72440	is what creates insights and wisdom.
72440	74420	My goal is to always empathize, understand
74420	77820	and explore ideas of the person sitting across from me.
77820	79660	Disagreement is just one of the ways
79660	81780	I think it's fun to do just that.
81780	85700	As long as I do so from a place of curiosity
85740	87380	and compassion.
87380	89300	This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
89300	91100	To support it, please check out our sponsors
91100	92420	in the description.
92420	95880	And now, dear friends, here's Paul Conti.
96860	99700	Do you see psychiatry as fundamentally a study
99700	102260	of the human mind and not just the set of tools
102260	103940	for treating psychological maladies?
103940	104780	Absolutely.
104780	106940	I think psychiatry is our best way
106940	109340	to understand who we are as people.
109340	111020	I mean, it looks at our biology.
111020	112340	You know, how does our brain work?
112340	114740	How does it connect the parts with one another?
114740	116460	How does the chemistry in it work?
116460	119340	It's the very foundational aspects of who we are
119340	121500	and then it manifests as psychology.
121500	122340	What do we think?
122340	123180	What do we feel?
123180	124020	What are our strivings?
124020	125260	What are our fears?
125260	128380	So yeah, I think psychiatry provides tools
128380	130740	that we can use to help each other,
130740	132300	but those tools come through it being
132300	134340	a discipline of understanding.
134340	137060	So with every patient you see,
137060	138940	with every mind you explore,
138940	140700	are you picking up a deeper understanding
140700	141540	of the human mind?
142780	143780	I think I'm trying to.
143820	145260	I think we should learn,
145260	147140	we should be able to take something away
147140	148940	from everything we do,
148940	151420	you know, every interaction to some small degree.
151420	152620	Every conversation,
152620	154740	it doesn't have to be a patient just anywhere.
154740	156740	At Starbucks, getting a coffee,
156740	158820	you can learn something from that little experience.
158820	162100	Yeah, even if you just reinforce sort of gentle kindness
162100	165700	and gratitude and decent human interaction,
165700	166940	there's a reinforcement of that
166940	169620	that even if we don't take away memories or lessons,
169620	172420	so to speak, we can reinforce who we choose to be.
173340	175660	So understanding ourselves from those interactions too,
175660	178220	not just the general sort of philosophical human mind,
178220	181420	but understanding our own mind,
182340	185740	and respect on how our own mind works.
185740	186980	Yeah, because everything we understand
186980	189020	about anyone or anything else
189020	190380	is coming through here, right?
190380	192980	So yeah, we're understanding others,
192980	195220	we're also understanding ourselves,
195220	197860	it's all feeding through us.
197860	199780	Yeah, but it's a tricky thing to step away
199780	201100	and look in your own mind,
202100	204540	and understand that it's just a machine.
204540	207340	You can kind of control the way the machine processes
207340	208900	the external environment,
208900	212540	and the way that machine converts the things
212540	214900	it perceives into actual emotions,
214900	217900	like how it interprets the things it perceives.
217900	221060	You just sort of step away and analyze it in that way,
221060	222260	and then you can control it.
222260	224500	You can, you can oil the machine,
224500	227300	you can control how it actually interprets the perceptions
227300	229540	in order to generate positive emotions,
229700	231060	and be like a, what is it?
231060	235740	Like a mechanic for the gears in the machine.
235740	237660	I mean, I think to some degree, to some degree,
237660	241740	but the difference, I think, at least as I understand,
241740	245180	I think of machines as not being inscrutable, right?
245180	247860	That if there's enough study,
247860	250020	there's enough acumen applied
250020	252540	that we can understand whatever it is
252540	253860	we're trying to figure out,
253860	256500	whereas part of understanding ourselves
256540	259700	is understanding that there are things we can't understand.
259700	264460	And I think that's indispensable important
264460	265540	to health and happiness,
265540	268580	and also to having enough humility
268580	271300	to see how people can be different from us,
271300	274260	how we can be different from ourselves at times.
274260	277780	So knowing that we don't know a lot,
277780	280180	and having some idea of what that might be,
280180	283180	I think is an indispensable part of the process,
283180	286060	which I think is different from machines, I think.
286060	288060	Yeah, the machines, you're basically saying,
288060	291260	machines generally, because they're engineered
291260	293700	from a design, they're usually going to be simpler,
293700	295420	therefore understandable.
295420	297620	And you're saying the complexity of the human mind
297620	302020	is, at least from our perspective, nearly infinite.
302020	303380	Is there a meta-phenomenal,
303380	306140	what sometimes gets described as sort of levels of emergence,
306140	309380	where at increasing levels of complexity,
309380	313020	you have novelty evolve that you can't predict
313020	315900	from lower levels of complexity,
316260	320860	for example, atoms to molecules, it's just one example.
320860	325860	I think neurons to consciousness, consciousness to culture,
326140	328500	that there are meta-phenomenal that separate
328500	331740	from the phenomenon underneath of them,
331740	335900	and they're brought by an entire aspect of novelty.
335900	339500	So I think we are, I mean, I really think this is true,
339500	341460	that we are all infinitely fascinating,
341460	344300	because these levels of emergence of novelty
344300	346260	that are inscrutable, because you can't predict
346260	349660	from one level to the next or understand fully
349660	351980	are what make us, and not just us,
351980	355340	but I think sentient creatures, human beings,
355340	359220	but sentient creatures, inestimably more interesting
359220	360980	than creatures that aren't sentient.
360980	364620	And I don't know, I think when we think about machine learning
364620	367060	and artificial intelligence, I think it's that
367060	369500	that we're trying to create, the levels of emergence
369500	373100	that now we don't fully understand anymore,
373100	375700	which I guess is both exciting and maybe scary too.
376860	380140	Yeah, so you start at the physics of atoms,
380140	384420	quantum mechanics, go into chemistry, go into biology,
384420	387540	from the biology, you have the functional phenomena,
387540	390260	especially as manifested in the human brain,
390260	392860	and then multiple brains connecting together
392860	396220	through consciousness and intelligence creates civilizations.
396220	397100	It's pretty interesting.
397100	398740	Where do you think the magic is?
398740	400460	At which layer of the cake?
400460	403220	Every layer, because every time you emerge
403220	406140	from one thing to another, I see it as an analog,
406140	408060	like the concept of the dialectic, right?
408060	409420	Where I think it was Hegel, right?
409420	414420	Who realized, hey, when you have like thing A and thing B
415020	417380	and they're complicated and they come together,
417380	420100	you know, you don't get a hybrid of A and B, right?
420100	423460	You end up getting something that's new, that's novel.
423460	427100	And I think that describes to some degree
427100	432100	that like what emergence is, except there's a whole new,
432580	434980	and it's a universe of novelty, right?
434980	437980	That comes at each layer of emergence
437980	439740	that allows infinite possibilities
439740	441620	that weren't possible before.
441620	443180	And I think that's why we're so complicated,
443180	446060	that we're our functional neuroscience, right?
446060	447260	Which I think is psychology, right?
447260	449020	Our ability to think about ourselves,
449020	452820	about others to be reflective is sitting on top of
452820	455140	so many layers of emergence.
455140	457220	Like the idea of standing on the shoulders of giants
457220	459820	that we're, you know, each of us, our consciousness
459820	462700	is standing on the shoulder of a giant
462700	467540	of many, many, many levels of emergence, of novelty,
467540	469100	so many of which we don't understand.
469100	470540	I mean, about subatomic particles,
470540	473180	everything that quantum physics means, you know,
473180	476180	when does time become important, right?
476180	478860	As opposed to things happening outside of time
478860	482140	and outside of space, when do we slot into one
482140	484220	temporal perspective and then the complexity
484220	486820	just, I think, grows and grows and grows?
486820	490220	Yeah, the interesting word he uses, novelty.
490220	492780	If true, this really blows my mind.
492780	496900	In some, either shallow or deep sense, it is true.
496900	498300	I'm trying to figure that out.
498300	500420	I don't know if you know something about cellular automata
500420	503500	is this very simple mathematical objects
503500	505620	where you have rules that govern each individual
505620	507860	little cell and they interact locally.
507860	509980	And then, you know, you understand the very simple
509980	511340	operation of those individual cells,
511340	513980	but at another layer of abstraction
513980	516780	when you just kind of zoom out with blurry vision,
516780	519820	these meta-objects starts appearing.
519820	522940	That function, you could build a torn machine
522940	524860	whether you can build an arbitrary complexity
524860	529860	of computation on top of this kind of very simple object.
530480	531320	Yes.
531320	533260	It's an interesting question whether
533260	535580	that was always there.
536620	541500	The atoms somehow know about love, right?
541500	543460	Like about consciousness.
544460	547980	About war and violence and evil and hate and all that.
547980	550580	That's already laid in the possibility of that,
550580	552980	the capacity for that, it's already in the atoms.
552980	555880	It's already in the physics, it's already in them.
555880	558860	And all the different chemistry and it builds up.
558860	562540	Like even the origin of life, still a mystery.
562540	567020	That's known, that's in the physics.
567020	568140	That's known to the universe,
568140	571060	the basic background physics in the universe.
572060	574620	Because if that's not the case,
574620	575740	it's like where does that come from?
575740	577460	Where's that magic?
577460	580060	And how many layers can the cake possibly have?
580060	581660	How many are we gonna keep building?
581660	586660	If we're constantly through this process of abstraction
586700	590340	of adding a layer to the cake, adding novel things,
590340	591660	like where's the ceiling?
593180	594980	As we expand on into the cosmos,
594980	596460	if we successfully can do that,
596460	598260	are we gonna keep building like
598260	601220	more miraculous, complex objects?
601220	605580	And then the brain is just like a middle layer thing.
605580	606740	We tend to think of ourselves
606740	609380	as a truly, truly special manifestations
609380	610860	of what's possible in the universe.
610860	612620	But maybe we're just like the basic,
612620	616900	like tiny building block of something much, much, much bigger.
616900	619900	We're in the early days of being a brick
619900	621660	and a very large building.
621660	622660	Sure.
622660	624620	Look, I think that's entirely possible.
624660	629100	I mean, I think the only emergent thing, so to speak,
629100	633060	that we build is culture, the aggregation of us.
633060	635860	So you have individual human minds,
635860	639020	which are entirely unique.
639020	640660	I mean, even the fact that time is different
640660	643860	for you and me, it may be by picoseconds, right?
643860	648860	But we can engage because our perceptions of time
649300	652020	are parallel enough, they're close enough, right?
652020	654060	That we can share a reality, right?
654060	658060	But we're all living in a different dimension of time, right?
658060	659140	I mean, we know that, right?
659140	661740	So we're unique in that way.
661740	664180	And then the unique individuals that we are,
664180	665420	just like the cells, right?
665420	669540	Start to create not just one thing, not just a culture,
669540	673460	but culture on top of our individuality, right?
673460	674860	There are uniqueness,
674860	677980	our even dimensional uniqueness of time
677980	680600	and experience and consciousness.
680600	683060	So we create cultures on top of us,
683060	685580	but what could be beyond culture, right?
685580	690460	And what is different from us either on underlying levels,
690460	693340	like quantum physics or chemistry or biology,
693340	696620	or entirely different and unconceived, I think,
696620	699460	is it's an immense question.
699460	702700	And I think it's one that should create humility in us, right?
702700	704780	That look, look how much we don't know,
704780	707420	and then how reckless we are with ourselves,
707420	710660	with our resources, with human life.
710660	713820	And I think there it's important to say,
713820	716820	I mean, think about how entropy rules
716820	717900	the universe around us.
717900	720820	I mean, how over selected are we?
720820	725020	How many, not just hundreds or thousands of times,
725020	727380	but how many millions of times
727380	729460	does there have to be a selection branch point
729460	733420	before we get into a sort of eddy pool of counter entropy,
733420	737100	right, where you can begin to create, right?
737100	738540	Which I think is why I say,
738540	740980	okay, the atoms know about love, right?
740980	743980	The fact that anything is being created, right,
743980	746900	means there's this over selection for counter entropy,
746900	750740	where there can be a building of greater complexity,
750740	752980	of ultimately of novelty.
752980	755020	And we don't often think about that,
755020	757540	of how far removed we are,
757540	759420	maybe light years, so to speak,
760540	764300	from any other location,
764300	767260	temporally, physically in the universe
767260	768300	where this could happen.
768780	772140	We don't think about, what does that mean?
772140	774100	Everything that you said, love,
774100	777020	everything is a counter entropy,
777020	780500	goes against the way the basic physics of the universe.
780500	782340	So maybe actually the atoms really don't like
782340	785260	what we're doing, they want us to stop.
785260	787140	They've been trying really hard to stop.
787140	790980	And despite that, we somehow started this whole bacteria thing
790980	793420	for like a billion years and now we're here.
793420	795620	I actually think of it kind of the other way.
795660	798980	I don't think there's any purpose to purposelessness, right?
798980	801860	So why would anything be here
801860	806860	if the drive weren't towards creativity, right?
808060	810980	If it drive weren't towards those subatomic particles,
810980	814060	not being nothingness that blips in and out of existence,
814060	816500	like we think is going on an empty space,
816500	818500	for light years upon light years, right?
818500	823500	But is there a design, either natural or intentional,
824500	826660	for a schema, right?
826660	830660	A scenario that allows for the incredibly rare,
830660	834540	but not non-existent, any pull of counter entropy
834540	836460	where good can happen, right?
836460	838220	Where creativity can happen,
838220	840700	where ultimately something can grow,
840700	842660	something novel can happen.
842660	844820	There's no novelty in the vastness of space,
844820	847380	even though there's not nothing there.
847380	849060	There's novelty here,
849060	852980	because I think the layers of emergence
852980	855460	start stacking very, very, very high
855460	858620	when we're in a place of counter entropy,
858620	861500	which then could provide even thoughts
861500	862740	about like good and evil, right?
862740	866780	The idea that creating, that preserving is good, right?
866780	867780	It's what we build upon.
867780	870540	It's how we get to the eddy pool of counter entropy, right?
870540	873580	So then destruction is not good.
873580	878300	What good comes of aggression and destruction, right?
878300	879340	Unless we're protecting,
879340	881660	or even if you think of outlying cases,
881660	883380	let's just think in general concepts, right?
883380	885620	Destruction destroys.
885620	887860	It brings us towards a state of entropy,
887860	889260	towards a state of nothingness,
889260	894180	whereas goodness, commonality, collaboration, right?
895300	896380	Nurturing, right?
896380	898460	Brings novelty.
898460	901060	It brings new existence into the universe.
901060	903140	And I think we don't think about that.
903140	905460	The word is we're in the middle of something so vast
905460	907220	and built on top of so many layers.
907220	910100	And I think it leads us to be cavalier,
910100	914060	you know, with human life, including often our own.
914060	916780	So you think there's an underlying creative force
916780	920620	to the universe that might even have
920620	924180	a kind of built in morality to it,
924180	927900	where creating is better than destroying.
927900	931420	And then that somehow maps on onto our society,
931420	932460	where we kind of try to figure out
932460	935820	what that actually means in terms of good and evil.
935820	938740	So that something is there like that.
939740	942900	But it has to be, it's like so nice.
942900	945260	It's so perfect, cause it's rare.
945260	947380	It's sufficiently rare where we have our own space.
947380	949180	Like you can like close the door and it's like,
949180	950580	I need to be alone right now.
950580	953540	It's our human civilization to work on my thing.
953540	955060	So it's sufficiently rare that there's not
955060	956220	other alien civilizations.
956220	958020	They're just like constantly knocking on our door,
958020	961300	destroying us, but it still exists.
961300	962420	That's weird.
962420	963420	Right, right.
963420	966580	It's so fantastically improbable that I think
966580	969180	we should be very respectful of it.
969180	971340	And I think you said there's a creative force
971340	973340	that values creativity.
973340	976220	This will be, well sure, if it's a creative force,
976220	979860	its existence, its ability to exist and to create
980820	983300	comes from something other than entropy,
983300	985100	something other than so much dispersion
985100	986380	that there's nothingness.
986380	989180	So the creative force will value
990340	992020	the sanctity of things,
992020	994740	keeping things together, not destroying things,
994740	997900	building novelty, including novelty of knowledge,
997900	998940	novelty of sentience.
998940	1003020	I mean, it fits with the idea that we're not nothing,
1003020	1005260	that that's incredibly improbable
1005260	1008180	and that there are these many, many layers of emergence
1008180	1009980	that we're standing upon.
1009980	1011820	And I think it tells us something
1011820	1016220	that we're not doing ourselves a service to ignore, right?
1016220	1018220	It's not just a jump to saying,
1018220	1019900	oh, there's a religious answer to everything.
1019900	1023820	It's just, no, it's saying science isn't a God either, right?
1023820	1027060	So if we think of science as a tool
1027060	1029020	and not as an endpoint in and of itself,
1029020	1030660	what is the science telling us?
1030660	1033220	Like, I remember showing up at medical school
1033220	1034180	and it really is true.
1034180	1037500	I mean, I knew so little about the human body.
1037500	1039420	I'd only been in hospitals to visit people.
1039420	1040660	I'd taken pre-med classes,
1040660	1043660	but sort of intensely at once after I didn't take any
1043660	1044780	and I was working in business.
1044780	1047620	I knew next to nothing and I had this idea
1047620	1050020	that was so naive in retrospect
1050020	1051940	that I was gonna learn so much, right?
1051940	1053180	I was gonna answer these questions
1053340	1054460	and I was gonna learn what's going on in the body.
1054460	1055460	What are these organs doing?
1055460	1056660	What are these cells?
1056660	1061660	And what I learned was there was so much more
1061780	1065660	that was amazing and mysterious and seemingly impossible.
1065660	1068020	Like even how a cell functions, right?
1068020	1069860	Like what is going on inside of a cell?
1069860	1072780	The transport mechanisms and energy functions
1072780	1074100	and diffusion functions.
1074100	1077340	And then you can go down to smaller levels than that.
1077340	1078820	But when you come back out and you say,
1078820	1081020	how all those cells make a kidney?
1081020	1084020	It's not explanatory.
1084020	1086340	I remember asking the OB who had delivered
1086340	1087580	my first child, right?
1087580	1090300	I was so amazed and I asked him like,
1090300	1091260	what do you think?
1091260	1092180	Like, what do you know?
1092180	1093180	You do this, right?
1093180	1095340	You're seeing this life created.
1095340	1099460	And his thought was nothing, I just marvel.
1099460	1102180	I mean, I get to do this, but I just marvel at it.
1102180	1106020	And I think the more we know about us,
1106020	1109060	the more we respectfully marvel.
1109060	1110060	And we should do that.
1110100	1113260	We should proactively marvel at every aspect,
1113260	1118260	at every layer that where the novelty emerges.
1118940	1119780	Yes.
1119780	1121580	We'd be a lot less likely to say,
1121580	1124180	hey, I don't like you because of something, whatever it is.
1124180	1127260	You know, race, religion, culture, sexuality,
1127260	1128900	gender identity, whatever it is, you know?
1128900	1131260	Or I want to say, I want rights that you don't have, right?
1131260	1133340	Or I want what you have, right?
1133340	1134860	I mean, there's so much of this.
1134860	1136900	And I understand it's driven by scarcity
1136900	1139540	and by human insecurity and envy
1139540	1141500	and all of these things that I think drive us
1141500	1145100	towards destruction, but all of that recklessness
1145100	1149820	comes from not having this initial appreciation
1149820	1151580	and respect that you're referring to
1151580	1154460	and just marveling at like, wow, okay, we're here.
1154460	1155300	That's amazing.
1155300	1156980	Let's start with that.
1156980	1160340	But if we marvel at this whole thing,
1160340	1162380	the human project, the human condition,
1162380	1165500	all the different kinds of human beings that are possible,
1165620	1169300	what do you then make of that some humans
1169300	1171580	do evil onto the world?
1171580	1174540	First of all, are all human beings capable of evil?
1174540	1177020	If we're in the process, now we've got a little bit
1177020	1178900	of momentum in terms of marveling.
1178900	1180940	Yeah. The layers of the cake.
1180940	1183180	Should we also marvel at the capacity for evil
1183180	1184060	in all of us?
1184060	1185380	Yes. Is that capacity there?
1185380	1186780	I believe that it is.
1186780	1187620	Yes.
1187620	1189740	So what do we understand about the psychology of evil?
1189740	1192300	Where does that originate in the human mind?
1192300	1194300	Is it there in the neurobiology?
1194300	1196900	Is it there in the environment and the upbringing?
1196900	1197740	Can I clarify first?
1197740	1201100	I think the capacity for evil I do believe is in all of us.
1201100	1204140	There's a difference between enacting evil
1204140	1209140	and a sort of preset, followed, developed plan of evil.
1210540	1213940	I don't believe that all of us are capable of doing
1213940	1217900	what the people who perpetrate the most evil do.
1217900	1222900	But I do believe that we're capable of perpetrating evil.
1223020	1225940	And the thought, one thought would be that
1225940	1227820	there are drives in us.
1227820	1230460	I mean, there certainly seem to be drives in us
1230460	1234820	towards survival, towards gratification,
1234820	1236820	in some ways towards pleasure.
1236820	1238260	And that can get very complicated
1238260	1241300	because pleasure inside can be relief of distress.
1241300	1244600	So if I feel very badly about myself
1244600	1246740	and I can feel a little better about myself
1246740	1249100	by making you feel worse about yourself, right?
1249100	1251660	Which that plays out in a lot of human beings.
1251700	1254300	Is that an indirect way of bringing pleasure, right?
1254300	1258020	So it gets very complicated what's going on inside of us.
1258020	1261020	And sometimes the perpetration of evil things
1261020	1264020	can be through misunderstandings, anger, impulsivity.
1264020	1267220	I mean, there are things that we can have in us.
1267220	1270980	And other times there can be other things going on
1270980	1274340	which are through the lens of unhealthy human psychology.
1274340	1276820	So for example, the psychology of envy,
1276860	1280020	which I think drives the lion's share
1280020	1281900	of the orchestrated evil, right?
1281900	1285380	There's a difference between impulsive, reflexive,
1286500	1289700	evil and highly orchestrated evil,
1289700	1293500	which I think is driven by envy.
1293500	1295580	Highly orchestrated evil.
1295580	1297260	Are we talking about a scale of societies
1297260	1298740	like totalitarianism?
1298740	1303060	So if we're thinking about somebody like Hitler.
1303060	1308060	So at scale orchestration of evil envy driving that.
1308060	1311300	So I mean, that's really interesting to think about.
1311300	1312540	I'd love to hear more about it.
1312540	1315860	So some of it, there might be some psychological forces
1315860	1318660	that are in tension with each other.
1318660	1322440	So one is if you look at something like Hitler,
1324340	1328020	it's difficult to know what was going on in his mind,
1328020	1329940	but it's possible to imagine if you just look
1330140	1332300	at dictator's thought history
1332300	1334860	that he thought he was doing good,
1334860	1338740	not just for himself, but for the people
1338740	1340660	he believed have value.
1340660	1345220	So one way you can achieve what we consider as evil
1346180	1350020	is by devaluing some group of people.
1350020	1352020	And that could be all group of people.
1352020	1355540	So it could have sort of a narcissistic type of idea
1355540	1358700	that you basically don't care about other human beings.
1358740	1361620	That's one, envy is different.
1361620	1364500	I mean, maybe they can collaborate together
1364500	1366220	or even like you mentioned,
1366220	1370020	you can actually enjoy doing bad to others.
1370020	1371180	That's almost like different
1371180	1374900	because if all it is is like narcissism,
1374900	1378420	you disregard, you don't care what how others feel,
1378420	1382180	then you can just have make cold calculated military
1382180	1384260	almost economic decisions.
1384260	1387740	And you don't care if a million people die here or there.
1387780	1390580	But if you actually enjoy some aspect of that
1390580	1393020	or there is like a resentment that fuels it,
1393020	1395260	it's not just cold calculation.
1395260	1397740	It's like fueled by some kind of personal
1397740	1400180	or cultural resentment as different.
1400180	1401740	I think it's all fueled by that.
1401740	1402580	You think so?
1402580	1403420	I think it's all fueled by that.
1403420	1406300	I think the idea that the Hitler thought he was doing good.
1407300	1412300	It is like that is such a thin facade
1412300	1415500	that it flies away like a handkerchief in a hurricane.
1415780	1416620	Right?
1418380	1419220	Okay, yeah.
1419220	1420060	Thank you.
1420060	1420900	That's wow.
1420900	1421740	That's beautiful.
1421740	1422580	Yeah.
1422580	1425540	It's built upon like it says,
1425540	1427300	I'll explain logical lies, right?
1427300	1432140	Because people can build lies upon specious logic, right?
1432140	1434660	So the idea that, okay, I am doing good
1434660	1439740	because I believe that this ethnicity of people is good
1439740	1440900	and this is bad.
1440900	1442180	And now I'm going to do this
1442180	1443460	and I'm gonna make the world different
1443460	1445340	and it's gonna bring better to the world
1445340	1446900	and now I'm raising armies
1446900	1448380	and I'm building concentration camps.
1448380	1450140	And I think like this is all in the service of good
1450140	1454060	is I don't think anyone ever thinks that, right?
1454060	1455940	Or they think that but with,
1455940	1459020	because they're living in the surface patina, right?
1459020	1460860	Like they're not allowing the hurricane
1460860	1462420	and that blows away the handkerchief
1462420	1465700	and says like this is all evil, right?
1465700	1469260	I mean, how do you decide that some group of people is good
1469260	1471060	and some is bad and like what is it
1471060	1475300	that you take upon yourself to play God
1475300	1476620	or make decisions about the world?
1476620	1478220	And I think what really is going on
1478220	1480100	is that people are not doing that, right?
1480100	1482540	There's something cobbled together to say like,
1482540	1484540	why this is right and this is okay, right?
1484540	1486060	And this is even good, right?
1486060	1489660	But it is all a lie, right?
1489660	1493300	It's a lie that's adorning that what I believe
1493300	1496420	is the fact I believe that what's going on
1496420	1500100	is the gratification of envy inside of the person.
1500100	1501220	And whether someone says,
1501220	1502460	oh, I think this is good and it's okay
1502460	1505260	if a million people die or I'm gonna enjoy
1505260	1507500	that a million people die, I think is the same.
1507500	1510300	I think the enjoyment, the gratification
1510300	1513060	of the orchestrated evil is there
1513060	1517140	and that it all comes from vulnerability and insecurity.
1517140	1521900	It all comes from deficits in the sense of self, right?
1521900	1523780	I'm gonna have to process that.
1525420	1528780	My slow penny and PC is processing that.
1528780	1530900	So envy underlies all of it.
1530900	1535180	The psychological concept of envy, what is that?
1535180	1537900	I keep putting myself in the mind of Hitler, I guess.
1537900	1539620	That has nothing to do.
1539620	1543620	It doesn't have to do with Jews or Slavic people.
1543620	1548140	Does it have to do with specific amorphous other
1549140	1551700	in his mind that he's envious of?
1551700	1555900	I think it has all to do with him, all to do with him.
1555900	1558780	There's not a love of the people with whom he allied
1558780	1560460	or even a sense of the people
1560460	1562660	who he persecuted were worse than him.
1562660	1566340	It's all projections out of what was going on inside of him,
1566340	1570220	which was an intense sense of inadequacy,
1570220	1575220	a rage at being someone he perceived as lesser than.
1576220	1577060	That's the difference.
1577060	1578820	So we can define words in different ways
1578820	1581780	even within psychology, but let's say we take the definition
1581780	1584820	here of sort of jealousy as being sort of benign, right?
1584820	1586380	The idea that, oh, I might see something
1586380	1587580	that you have that I don't.
1587580	1588980	And I might think, I'd like that.
1588980	1590940	Maybe I'll work harder to get it, right?
1590940	1592140	Or maybe I can't get it.
1592140	1593820	Maybe it's that you're younger than I am.
1593820	1596780	They say, okay, you have that and I don't.
1596780	1599300	I mean, I have other things too, I'm okay anyway.
1599300	1601100	But I might want those things,
1601100	1602660	but it's very benign, the jealousy.
1602660	1603500	I'd like to be younger.
1603500	1605620	I'd like to be richer, whatever it is that we people think,
1605620	1606460	right?
1607460	1608580	But it's just a thought.
1608580	1611580	And it's a thought that can result in strivings
1611580	1613260	or acceptance, right?
1613260	1614540	It's very, very different.
1614580	1618940	It's completely different than envy, which is destructive.
1618940	1622060	It's a thought of I see something that you have
1622060	1623180	that I don't have, right?
1623180	1625540	And instead of me working for it
1625540	1627340	or accepting that I don't have it,
1627340	1630420	what I like to do then is bring you down,
1630420	1633060	take you down to where I am, and then I'll feel better,
1633060	1633900	right?
1633900	1636180	Because from the perspective of envy,
1636180	1638780	it is all relative.
1638780	1640500	So is jealousy a kind of,
1640500	1643060	is it because he said completely different,
1643060	1646460	but is jealousy potentially like a gateway drug to envy?
1646460	1649020	Like, is it a slippery slope?
1649020	1651820	I think no, I think that jealousy is a natural,
1651820	1653340	just part of the human phenomenon
1653340	1654860	that we go through life and we see like,
1654860	1655700	oh, I'd like to have that.
1655700	1657700	I think it's probably part of our incentives, right?
1657700	1662700	If I'm farming and I have one row of crops
1662700	1664500	and I look over and I see that you're working harder
1664500	1666620	and you have two, and I'd like to have two,
1666620	1668420	that can make me work harder to have two.
1668420	1669660	You don't think it's a slippery slope
1669660	1671300	from one to the other to,
1671300	1672980	at first you're like, I'd like to work harder,
1672980	1674780	but then you keep failing and the weather sucks
1674780	1676180	and you keep failing and the other person
1676180	1677460	becomes more successful.
1677460	1679700	Plus he's got a new hot wife now,
1679700	1681860	there's a nice tractor,
1681860	1683020	there's a field that's all working,
1683020	1684420	and then you get this idea that,
1684420	1687380	you know what, I'm gonna steal all this stuff,
1687380	1688980	I'm gonna murder him,
1688980	1692140	and that, do you think that's just like a leap
1692140	1693540	of the same phenomenon?
1693540	1694380	No.
1694380	1695980	No, because I think there are things
1695980	1697780	that are in us as humans, right?
1697780	1700540	So the things are just by being human,
1700540	1703620	like we can, for example, feel compassion, right?
1703620	1705340	We can feel interest, right?
1705340	1707660	We can feel jealousy in that benign sense,
1707660	1710060	like it's all part of just being human.
1710060	1713860	If we start going from, hey, you have more crops
1713860	1715980	than I have, and that seems like actually
1715980	1717780	I have a better life in a lot of ways than I have,
1717780	1720260	I'm gonna kill you, that's not,
1720260	1723100	that is not a progression of something benign, right?
1723100	1724100	That is-
1724100	1724940	But wait, wait a minute,
1724940	1727620	but that is a human leap of the same thing, isn't it?
1728220	1731220	Is you're drawing a line, stuff,
1731220	1732460	you're saying like this is the,
1732460	1735980	this human stuff, it's regular life, it's benign,
1735980	1737420	but it feels like this benign thing
1737420	1740020	is just a low magnitude thing,
1740020	1742660	version of the thing that's not benign.
1742660	1745540	Like there's probably a gray area where it stops being,
1745540	1748540	but like jealousy, you can have like healthy jealousy,
1748540	1750700	you can have a little bit slightly unhealthy,
1750700	1752940	there's like, I think Jealous Guy,
1752940	1755220	there's John Lennon song that I love, it's just beautiful.
1755260	1758500	I mean, there's like, this jealousy inside relationships
1758500	1761900	can make you feel like, take your minds
1761900	1765580	in all kinds of silly directions, and it's crazy,
1765580	1768340	but like it feels like that's an extra neighbor
1768340	1770940	to like being really crazy and toxic
1770940	1772660	and all that kind of stuff inside relationships,
1772660	1774460	and then that feels like an extra neighbor,
1774460	1775540	it's like an apartment building,
1775540	1777860	that feels like an extra neighbor
1777860	1779340	that eventually gets the Hitler
1779340	1783260	with envy and resentment of an entire population of people.
1783260	1785300	You're right, that there's a causal,
1785300	1787100	there can be a causal chain,
1787100	1788900	like if I'm not feeling jealous,
1788900	1791180	maybe I won't ever feel envious, right?
1791180	1793620	So you can see, okay, so it can kind of lead
1793620	1795500	to it can open gates to, huh,
1795500	1797140	how much do I dislike that you have things
1797140	1798420	that I don't have, right?
1798420	1801420	So yes, in that sense, but, and I think,
1801420	1803100	this is the part that I think is so important,
1803100	1806380	that I think there is a disjunction, right?
1806380	1808620	There's an asymptotic shift, right,
1808620	1810820	from one thing to another, because it is there.
1810860	1812660	I'm just speaking my language, mathematically.
1812660	1813500	Yeah.
1813500	1814340	Statotically, yep.
1814340	1816620	Yes, that's, it's a way to convey, right?
1816620	1818260	Something that's entirely different,
1818260	1821500	because if I start thinking, you know,
1821500	1823700	I'm not gonna try and make things better, right?
1823700	1825300	I'd like instead to harm you,
1825300	1827900	that's qualitatively different.
1827900	1829780	Oh, it's almost like, you know what it is?
1829780	1831860	It could be, I don't know what you think about this,
1831860	1836860	but it's in which direction your motivation is pointing.
1837700	1841420	So if in the response to the feeling of jealousy,
1841420	1845980	your sort of, the motivation says,
1845980	1849460	okay, I understand this feeling, I wanna do less of it.
1849460	1851700	I think there must be a threshold
1851700	1853140	to which you actually wanna do more,
1853140	1855460	like it becomes a vicious downward cycle.
1855460	1857100	So that's what envy becomes.
1857100	1859260	Like the first feeling, this idea
1860220	1862660	that I'm gonna kill the farmer,
1862660	1864620	turns into like more and more and more,
1864620	1865460	and you can't sleep,
1865460	1866820	and you're visualizing the farmer,
1866820	1868100	and he becomes the devil,
1868100	1870620	and like you have this very, you know,
1870620	1872660	it's basically a thing that builds
1872660	1873660	into the negative direction,
1873660	1876620	versus returns to the stable center.
1876620	1879020	And now a person is cultivating evil, right?
1879020	1880940	They're saying, hey, there can be seeds of evil
1880940	1883260	in all of us, let me take that seed out,
1883260	1886300	dust it off, plant it, nurture it, right?
1886300	1887980	And then grow that seed of evil,
1887980	1891140	which will affect all other parts of the person's life, right?
1891140	1894500	They won't behave the same towards others in their life.
1895500	1896980	They'll become different
1896980	1899300	as they nurture fantasies of evil,
1899300	1903780	as they begin to create with inside of themselves
1903780	1908100	the motivation and the will to enact evil, right?
1908100	1909660	The Hitler analogy would say,
1909660	1911980	look, you take someone who had a bad childhood, right?
1911980	1915740	Who was not loved, who was taught
1915740	1917460	and told that he was less than.
1917460	1919660	Okay, like that, we know that happens.
1919660	1922500	I mean, that's why child abuse is so evil, right?
1922500	1926820	It's telling children the worst possible wrong lessons, right?
1926820	1927660	They're not good enough.
1927660	1928940	They'll always be hurt, you know,
1928940	1930180	they can't keep themselves safe.
1930180	1931940	They don't deserve safety, right?
1931940	1936860	So then you take someone who then nurtures that seed of evil,
1936860	1938100	which is a choice.
1938100	1939660	And it says, well, I can't paint well enough
1939660	1941540	and no one appreciates me and I don't like how I look
1941540	1944020	and I don't fit in with the people I wanna fit in with
1944020	1947180	and then and on and on and on and on and on.
1947180	1951900	And there's a hatred of self through that lens
1951900	1955620	of misery, of just being repulsed by the self,
1955620	1958460	but that's unacceptable to the self.
1958460	1962100	So, oh, it has to be someone else's fault, right?
1962100	1964420	It's not my fault, who's fault is it, right?
1964420	1967580	And then you see en masse, the enaction of evil
1967580	1971180	towards groups of people who somehow
1971180	1972740	in this person's mind, right,
1972740	1975300	are responsible for his misery.
1975300	1977460	And there's the justification of evil
1977460	1980100	and then all the, you know, whether it's,
1980100	1981420	this will be better for the economy,
1981420	1982540	this will be good, this will be that.
1982540	1986140	Like that's all lies built to justify the evil.
1986140	1987740	Those are surface level narratives.
1987740	1988980	Yes.
1988980	1993700	And the envy is the deep down mechanism that enables.
1993700	1995420	And that's the endpoint that's being served.
1995420	1997820	What's being served is destruction, right?
1997820	2001180	Which is why it always brings more destruction, right?
2001180	2004420	I mean, how many times do wars that were started
2004420	2006060	for purposes that we would look and say,
2006060	2007540	like those were evil purposes?
2007540	2010460	Like how many times does good come of that?
2010460	2012020	Even if we look at the modern world,
2012020	2016020	what comes of it is more evil, is more destruction.
2016020	2018180	You know, Hitler's outward destruction
2018180	2020260	eventually came inward and, you know,
2020260	2022020	you see pictures of what Berlin
2022020	2023860	looked like after the Second World War, right?
2023860	2026660	It wasn't just destruction perpetrated outward
2026660	2030820	as awful as that is, it's catchy, right?
2030820	2032420	Like people used to worry if you, you know,
2032420	2034620	before the, during the time of the Manhattan Project, right?
2034620	2036500	If you start this chain reaction, you know,
2036500	2038540	will you blow the whole world up, right?
2038540	2040900	Or will it stop within this bomb or not?
2040900	2044060	And we see, okay, the chain reaction of evil
2044060	2046140	hasn't yet blown the whole world up,
2046140	2050100	but look at the, look at how the catastrophe spreads.
2050100	2052220	You think 50 to 60 million people dead
2052220	2055980	in the Second World War, which truly was a world war.
2055980	2059500	What destruction was spread around the globe?
2059500	2062220	And this is something that can't be stopped
2062220	2064220	once the chain reaction starts.
2064220	2066700	Like if Hitler was successful,
2066700	2067900	like he would just keep going.
2067900	2069460	If he had been-
2069460	2071380	On his personal psychological level, I mean.
2071380	2072780	Right, because if we think from the perspective
2072780	2075460	of destruction, success would have needed,
2075460	2077020	led to the need to conquer more,
2077020	2078660	then there's factions and infighting,
2078660	2081340	and then eventually you get the same mass destruction, right?
2081340	2084660	And never does the inaction of evil
2084660	2086980	satisfy what the person is initially seeking.
2086980	2089060	Like people want to feel better about themselves, right?
2089060	2094060	We, you know, Winnecott, who was a British pediatrician
2094980	2097580	who wrote about children and adults
2097580	2099020	from very deep perspectives,
2099020	2101220	he wrote about the idea of good enough, right?
2101220	2103420	And then you can sort of extrapolate that to like,
2103420	2105020	we all want to feel good enough,
2105020	2107100	like not just limp over the line, good enough,
2107100	2108620	but I want to feel good enough
2108620	2110180	that I'm a decent person in the world
2110180	2111480	and like what I do matters.
2111480	2113980	And, you know, I can have an impact on people
2113980	2116740	and, you know, people can like me and care about me.
2116740	2120180	It's, there's a simplicity there that people want
2120180	2121860	that when people don't have,
2121860	2123300	and there's certain other factors,
2123300	2126140	maybe their temperamental factors or historical factors
2126140	2130980	can lead to trying to soothe that deficit, right?
2130980	2132700	Through envy.
2132700	2135700	And I think it starts with that.
2135700	2138620	And it often starts in childhood, not always,
2138620	2140180	but it often starts in childhood
2140180	2144420	when the child's brain and psychology are so vulnerable.
2144420	2147340	And, you know, you see salient child abuse.
2147340	2149260	If you look at what was Hitler's background
2149260	2150660	and what was Stalin's background,
2151020	2153420	I mean, you could look at almost anyone
2153420	2156100	who's perpetrated evil or they're serial killers
2156100	2157740	or whatever it may be.
2157740	2159780	The majority, not everyone,
2159780	2162940	but the majority had these lessons in childhood
2162940	2164540	that said, you're not good enough,
2164540	2166860	you can't keep yourself safe, no one cares about you.
2166860	2171060	And in a subset of people, that's gonna generate envy.
2171060	2172780	And that, you know, that seed of evil
2172780	2174380	then gets planted and nurtured.
2176980	2178140	As a fighter jet.
2178140	2178980	Roars above us.
2178980	2181340	The sound of a fighter jet above us.
2181340	2183260	You've been good by an orchestra jet.
2183260	2185700	If you get, you quickly forget
2185700	2187500	the comfort of being in a peaceful place.
2187500	2189340	That's one thing I saw in Ukraine.
2190780	2194260	Is, hey, you quickly get comfortable here.
2194260	2198580	The whole trip back, I was thinking,
2198580	2201700	it's so damn good to be in America.
2201700	2203100	The whole, just the whole like,
2203100	2205580	it's like a three day trip back.
2205580	2207100	It's so good to be American.
2209620	2212540	We might take that for granted as a population,
2212540	2213500	but I do agree.
2214660	2217300	So the destruction never alleviates the envy.
2220020	2223180	Are all humans capable of envy?
2225140	2226420	I believe the answer is yes.
2226420	2229460	If you think, do we all have the possibility of evil in us?
2229460	2231900	I think the answer to that is yes,
2231900	2235020	but we have free will, we have choice.
2235020	2237940	We can choose what we do with that,
2237940	2242020	which is why just because someone is a sociopath,
2242020	2244660	for example, it doesn't mean that they're not responsible.
2244660	2248700	I mean, our medical legal jurisprudence,
2248700	2253220	has absolutely borne that out, that legally, medically,
2253220	2256740	we think, okay, we're responsible,
2256740	2257780	presuming we're healthy.
2257780	2259300	We're not unhealthy in other ways
2259300	2262700	that eliminates our ability to be circumspect,
2262700	2265340	but that we're responsible for what we do
2265340	2267780	and don't nurture inside of us.
2267780	2269340	I mean, there are plenty of things we could decide
2269340	2272060	to nurture anger and hatred about.
2272060	2274100	I could think of slights, difficulties,
2274100	2275820	whether it's something someone else has done to me,
2275820	2277820	or I could blame fate, or I could be mad at God,
2277820	2281180	or the world, we can all make those choices,
2281180	2283140	and we're responsible for them,
2283140	2284620	or if we're recognizing things in us,
2284620	2287220	they're like, oh, I too have that in me,
2287220	2290780	but I don't wanna nurture that, I don't wanna foster that,
2290780	2293180	or do I choose to nurture and foster that?
2293180	2296940	And I think ultimately, in our subject of Hitler as evil,
2297060	2299540	if Hitler had kept winning and winning,
2299540	2301060	I think ultimately, he would have been
2301060	2303860	the only person on earth, and I really do believe it.
2303860	2307060	Ultimately, everyone, everything else would be killed
2307060	2310140	because it's such destruction, destroy everything.
2310140	2312540	And probably when that didn't work,
2312540	2314460	then there's the destruction of the self
2314460	2319460	because nothing soothes envy
2320900	2324540	that is stoked by the sort of flames of evil,
2324540	2326660	and what you see is more and more anger
2326660	2327820	and more and more frustration,
2327820	2330540	which is why I really do believe someone like that,
2330540	2332940	who nurtured evil in themselves that way,
2332940	2334420	ultimately would destroy.
2334420	2336020	They'd be like him and one other person,
2336020	2337380	then he'd kill the other person.
2337380	2339940	I think that's really powerfully said,
2339940	2343420	but even just to return to the jealousy versus envy,
2343420	2347160	I still think that it's the same flame,
2348700	2351060	and envy is just the bigger version of it.
2351060	2355200	So I think, I just, in my own personal life,
2356200	2359240	I've felt jealousy towards others, like you said,
2359240	2364000	like, oh, this person has, I don't know, a cooler thing,
2364000	2366240	trinket, whatever trinket I cared about,
2366240	2368280	and usually it's when somebody's really close
2368280	2370200	to the trinket you're building.
2373080	2376760	And early on, like in my teens,
2377940	2382320	I realized that just empirically speaking,
2382320	2384720	that jealousy over a period of a week
2384720	2388880	just doesn't feel good, and it's not productive.
2388880	2390880	It doesn't help me build a better trinket,
2392720	2397720	or it does if I turn it not into jealousy
2397760	2399360	towards another person,
2399360	2402880	but into a love for building a better trinket.
2402880	2405160	It's like, oh, cool, almost, you know what?
2405160	2408440	Like proactively speaking, and later in life,
2408440	2411160	people like Joe Rogan actually have been really powerful
2411160	2413680	in this for me, just as a fan of his,
2413720	2415320	to celebrate other people.
2415320	2418800	So it's almost as opposed to ignoring that other person
2418800	2421800	with a cool trinket, it's like celebrating their awesomeness
2421800	2425000	in my mind, like just saying how awesome
2425000	2426520	the humans are able to do that,
2426520	2429880	and actually just how awesome is that exact person
2429880	2431160	at being able to do that,
2431160	2433280	and that somehow made me more capable
2433280	2436800	to build my own trinket better, and it feels good also.
2436800	2438280	Like it makes me feel happy.
2438280	2439840	And now you're not jealous anymore.
2439840	2441120	You're not jealous anymore, right?
2441120	2443040	So that's why I think jealousy is different, right?
2443400	2444760	You're saying there's a week of jealousy,
2444760	2445920	like, I don't like this, right?
2445920	2448520	I don't like, but if you take that in a way that says,
2448520	2450080	wait a second, actually, this is awesome.
2450080	2452040	This is fabulous, and this person did this.
2452040	2453720	That person's awesome, right?
2453720	2458320	Then you're not reigning on anyone's parade, right?
2458320	2461080	And in not doing that, even inside your own mind,
2461080	2464680	you gain a greater cognizance of your own capability, right?
2464680	2467960	Well, if he can do that, or she can do that, why can't I too?
2467960	2470560	Like I want to make the better trinket too, right?
2470560	2472440	Now you're thinking creatively,
2472440	2477440	nowhere in there was the emergence of evil.
2477920	2479280	I just disagree with that.
2479280	2481480	I think there was a choice made,
2481480	2486480	where I looked at my, if my life was darker, more difficult,
2486720	2490480	I think it has nothing to do with the actual little flame
2490480	2492080	of jealousy I felt.
2492080	2494640	I think it has to do a lot more with the other context.
2494640	2499640	If my life were more difficult,
2499640	2503120	there was more abuse, there was more challenges.
2503120	2504640	I think that decision,
2504640	2506600	I could have made that decision in a different direction.
2506600	2507440	Yes.
2507440	2511800	Maybe, I don't know, you've written brilliantly about trauma.
2511800	2513840	If there's a bit more trauma,
2513840	2516780	as the background noise of my decision-making,
2516780	2520920	I'll be more likely to not be able to pull away
2520920	2523040	from the gravitational field of that jealousy,
2523040	2524840	and it would build and build and build and build.
2524840	2528880	So I think, not to disagree with the brilliant,
2529640	2532040	the person, but I feel like that flame,
2532040	2535720	that flame has the capacity to engulf the whole world.
2535720	2539000	I guess the initial flame of jealousy, the little bit,
2539000	2541600	like especially the younger you are,
2541600	2545320	it's almost like a habit that you get to build
2545320	2546480	in either direction,
2546480	2549920	because I've early on built a habit of saying,
2549920	2554920	I'm going to channel that jealousy into productivity,
2555320	2556800	and into celebrating other people,
2556800	2558360	and that jealousy disappears.
2558400	2560960	That was like a little discovery for me.
2560960	2561920	I discovered that.
2561920	2564720	I get it, that doesn't come, nobody tells that to you.
2564720	2566200	You kind of discover that little thing.
2566200	2568000	I could have easily not discovered it.
2568000	2570120	I could have easily discovered
2570120	2575000	that it kind of feels good to mess with that other person,
2575000	2580000	to think shitty thoughts, think negative thoughts,
2580320	2582440	do negative things to that other person,
2582440	2583280	because that could also,
2583280	2587120	I just think the capacity in that initial feeling is there,
2587200	2588640	and I think it's a decision we make,
2588640	2593640	because otherwise, I think it dissolves responsibility,
2594840	2597280	like, well, surely I'm not Hitler,
2597280	2599840	therefore, this jealousy is normal.
2599840	2601440	No, I just feel like every jealousy
2601440	2603920	is the capacity to turn into, maybe not Hitler,
2603920	2607640	but a toxicity that destroys in a small way,
2607640	2610440	in your own little private life, but it could destroy.
2610440	2613920	I agree that jealousy brings us,
2614920	2617760	can bring us dangerously close to envy.
2617760	2622560	I mean, maybe, let's see if heuristic we could agree on.
2622560	2624680	Let's see, so let's say,
2624680	2628160	okay, if we look at the terrain of the mind as geography,
2628160	2631000	so if I'm feeling happy, satisfied,
2631000	2633880	probably like I'm pretty far from envy land,
2633880	2637120	right, but if I'm feeling jealousy now,
2637120	2641520	I'm coming kind of closer to that border, right?
2641520	2644880	And I still, I think there's,
2644880	2646840	it's a big thing to go over the border, right?
2646840	2649040	That the border isn't a gray area, right?
2649040	2650840	There's a border to go over,
2650840	2653680	and I think that you, I agree completely once,
2653680	2656760	certainly about trauma, that the more trauma there is,
2656760	2659240	because then the more misunderstandings there are about self,
2659240	2660520	and feelings that I'm not good enough,
2660520	2662360	and then that can be anger about why,
2662360	2663600	and who might be oppressing me,
2663600	2665400	and you know, I mean, I hate myself,
2665400	2666800	and everyone else who seems to be better,
2666800	2670680	like so trauma can drive us in these negative directions,
2670680	2673320	but we're still crossing over something, right?
2673320	2676360	So if you have the trinket, and I think that's awesome,
2676360	2678920	I want that, I want to work harder,
2678920	2679760	you know what I could do though,
2679760	2682360	is I could sneak in tonight when no one's around,
2682360	2683920	and I could move something, right?
2683920	2685400	No, no way, I don't want to do that, right?
2685400	2687320	But it's like I came over the border a little bit,
2687320	2689360	and I thought maybe that's a better way,
2689360	2691080	but then I came back, right?
2691080	2694240	And we're responsible for that, right?
2694240	2696640	Because it is a choice to say, I don't want to work hard,
2696640	2698000	I'm already working hard,
2698000	2699240	I don't want to make my trinket better,
2699240	2701080	I want to think mine's the best one,
2701080	2702680	I could destroy yours, right?
2702680	2705400	Then, you know, we're letting our mind go over that border,
2705400	2708160	and do we say, right, run that forward, right?
2708160	2709080	Let's run that forward,
2709080	2710760	and put people around us who feel the same way,
2710760	2712960	and start doing it so we think less of ourselves,
2712960	2716120	and we debase ourselves, do we run headlong in,
2716120	2718360	or do we come over that boundary,
2718360	2720360	and that's maybe the capacity for evil in us,
2720360	2724160	that we come over that boundary, all of us, right, at times,
2724160	2725840	but do we come over it, and then say,
2725840	2727720	you know, that's not my choice,
2727720	2730400	that's not my self-definition, and I'm coming back.
2730400	2731760	But I'm trying to justify,
2731760	2734360	maybe there's certain other sociological forces
2734360	2736120	that help us cross the border too.
2736120	2739520	So in Nazi Germany, we've been talking about Hitler,
2739520	2743320	but then there's also the German people,
2743320	2745800	and so maybe when there's a bit of a mass hysteria,
2745800	2749120	so all these effects of like,
2749120	2753000	combination of propaganda with the small jealousies
2753000	2755800	and resentments of the people that don't cross the border,
2756600	2760160	together they can, with great charismatic leaders
2760160	2763160	that sort of really fuel that fire
2763160	2765120	that we feel when we're a part of the crowd.
2765120	2767880	So maybe those individual kind of psychological barriers
2767880	2771280	we have to take that leap from jealousy to envy,
2771280	2773280	those can be made easier.
2773280	2775440	The leap can be catalyzed through this mass hysteria.
2775440	2780440	100%, 100%, I think that to me is a massive point,
2780600	2782120	we're talking about layers of emergence, right?
2782120	2784400	So if there's individual consciousness,
2784400	2785920	then there's culture, right?
2785920	2788400	And we're products of the soup we swim in, so to speak.
2788400	2790240	People would say that when I was growing up, right?
2790240	2792200	We're products of the soup we swim in.
2792200	2794160	So if the soup that we're swimming in
2794160	2796680	is the soup of hatred, right?
2796680	2798800	Then it's gonna foster all of those things.
2798800	2800080	So then you think about,
2800080	2802400	just in a painting with a very broad brush,
2802400	2804160	the culture created in Germany
2804160	2805960	prior to the Second World War,
2805960	2808720	and like, what was the impact of the reparations
2808720	2810080	after the First World War, right?
2810080	2812840	Of the punishing reparations, impoverishment,
2813680	2815080	and basically humiliation, right?
2815080	2816840	That people were feeling okay,
2816840	2819200	like there were a whole bunch of decisions
2819200	2821920	that impacted that cultural perspective, right?
2821920	2824560	Then there must have been aspects just like I see
2824560	2828000	in many ways parallels in America now
2828000	2829520	of what are our standards
2829520	2832720	for what we're communicating to others, right?
2832720	2834680	How is the media deciding like what's real
2834680	2837280	and what's not real, what's true, what's not true,
2837280	2841320	what's hatred that is only gonna do evil
2841360	2842860	versus what's hatred that's okay
2842860	2846320	because I might sell something by putting it out there.
2846320	2849200	I mean, that was, we know that was going on
2849200	2851960	in Germany during the rise of the Nazis.
2851960	2854360	And I think there's a parallel to,
2854360	2856000	do we value truth?
2856000	2857240	Can we stand together and say,
2857240	2859560	no matter how much I might disagree with you politically,
2859560	2861480	right, we can still understand
2861480	2863480	like that there's right and there's wrong, right?
2863480	2865360	There's truth and there's lies, right?
2865360	2868100	So I think those are just two examples
2868100	2869760	of determinants of culture.
2869760	2873080	And then the culture is a determinant of,
2873080	2876240	is someone like Hitler marginalizes,
2876240	2878560	like that's a crazy evil person.
2878560	2880720	Oh my goodness, like whoa, right?
2880720	2883320	Or is that someone who gains a greater following
2883320	2886460	and more adherence and then there starts to be a momentum
2886460	2889240	because why, because what the demagogues do?
2889240	2890960	I think they have a giant lasso
2890960	2895280	and they harness the envy of thousands upon thousands
2895280	2896540	upon thousands of people.
2896540	2898440	That's right, you feel worse about yourself too.
2898440	2899840	Doesn't matter what the reasons are.
2899840	2901720	Maybe it's your childhood, maybe it's not,
2901720	2903720	maybe it's job failings, maybe it's professional,
2903720	2905160	maybe it's personal, doesn't matter.
2905160	2908200	Like you have envy too, let's put it together
2908200	2909400	and do some destruction
2909400	2912360	because that'll make us feel better, which is a lie.
2913320	2915120	So we've talked about envy,
2915120	2918120	where does from the leader perspective,
2918120	2920840	things like narcissism or sociopathy,
2920840	2922900	psychopathy come into play?
2922900	2926680	What can you make of the world we live in,
2926680	2929360	maybe the leaders that run the world
2929360	2932440	from the perspective, from the lens of narcissism?
2932440	2937440	So I am struck 20 years of doing what I do now.
2937480	2939080	I've been a psychiatrist for 20 years
2939080	2941000	and I practice in so many different settings
2941000	2942440	and I consult in different settings.
2942440	2945080	I've been fortunate to have a very wide purview
2945080	2946560	of like what's going on in people
2946560	2948320	and in the world around us.
2948320	2951160	And I am struck with amazement
2951160	2954960	that of all the things I see that are say abnormal,
2954960	2956880	let's say from the mental health perspective,
2956880	2959360	this could be depression, panic attacks,
2960360	2962280	hearing voices, addiction,
2962280	2964920	but there's so many things that cover everything
2966000	2970560	that narcissism is not frequent
2970560	2972200	compared to a lot of other things.
2972200	2976480	So it's small in terms of say narcissistic diagnosis, right?
2976480	2978640	It's much less than many other things,
2978640	2981440	but it causes the lion's share.
2981440	2983760	I don't just mean the most compared to anything else,
2983760	2985680	but I think more than 50%,
2985680	2989800	the majority of bad things,
2989800	2991640	evil things, destructive things
2991640	2993600	that I see in the world around us.
2993600	2997080	I think narcissists are wildly destructive
2997080	2999600	because they are driven completely,
2999600	3004600	they are lodged completely in the lane of envy.
3006000	3008960	Can you try to sneak up,
3008960	3010960	and we don't wanna be lost in definitions,
3010960	3013520	but can you try to sneak up to a definition,
3013520	3015520	non-clinical definition of narcissism
3015520	3017240	that we're talking about?
3017240	3022240	So narcissism is a deep, pervasive,
3022800	3027800	and unquestioned sense of inadequacy in the self
3028800	3032600	that comes along with anger and fear and vulnerability,
3033600	3036080	fear of destruction, fear of annihilation
3036080	3041000	that is compensated for by aggression,
3041960	3044280	by the mechanics of envy,
3044280	3049200	by trying to make the self seem better
3049200	3053560	at the expense of others, by taking from others,
3053560	3055840	by being completely cavalier
3055840	3058240	to the thoughts and feelings of others,
3058240	3060160	that narcissism is not arrogance.
3060160	3062560	Narcissism is the opposite of arrogance.
3062560	3066600	There is such a deep sense of inadequacy
3066600	3069120	and incompetence in the self
3069120	3072400	that the defensive structure around that
3072400	3076760	becomes dominated by like rocket-fueled envy.
3078000	3081480	So the machinery of narcissism is envy,
3081480	3085960	but what do you make of the kind of more popularly discussed
3085960	3088840	kind of symptom of narcissism,
3088840	3093400	which is a seeming not caring about other people,
3094480	3098200	sort of a very inward-facing focus
3098200	3100120	in terms of the calculation you make
3100120	3102400	when making decisions about the world?
3102400	3106360	Narcissistic people definitely care about other people.
3106360	3108480	It's the people who are schizoid and say
3108480	3111800	that don't necessarily register other people.
3111800	3114240	But narcissism, people care about other people,
3114240	3117280	but it's entirely vis-a-vis the self.
3117280	3118760	If I'm schizoid, I don't really notice
3118760	3120400	or care much who you are.
3120400	3123320	But if I'm narcissistic, I absolutely care
3123320	3125280	because I'm watching every last detail of you,
3125280	3128320	what might you have that's better than me, right?
3128320	3133240	It's an incredibly intense focus upon individuals
3133240	3135400	and demographics of people,
3135400	3140400	but the priority, the goal is entirely about the self,
3140760	3142640	which is why they can become easy to say,
3142640	3144680	I don't care if a million people die, right?
3144680	3147000	That's how different is that from going out
3147000	3150440	and destroying one person or a million people, right?
3150440	3153840	It's in the same category of those people only,
3153840	3155480	their existence is only meaningful
3155480	3157240	in how it relates to me.
3158840	3160840	But it's still meaningful.
3160840	3164320	It just seems like a very difficult leap to take
3164320	3166700	that I don't care that a million people die.
3167840	3172840	That seems to be, even with envy,
3173080	3178080	that seems to be a big feeling and thought to have
3178360	3180800	if you at all care about them.
3180800	3185800	Are other people, I guess, tools for alleviation
3186680	3188800	of your sense of inadequacy?
3188800	3190320	Right, I mean, I don't even care about
3190320	3192320	in that like being caring at all.
3192320	3196680	I mean, care about in that noticing that a person exists,
3196680	3197520	right?
3197520	3198920	I mean, someone who wants money
3198920	3201520	and notices that there's a $100 bill out,
3201520	3202360	cares about that.
3202360	3204280	I mean, they don't care about the $100 bill
3204280	3205560	and that doesn't mean anything to them.
3205560	3207240	It's just have thoughts and feelings,
3207240	3208700	but it's gonna attract attention.
3208700	3209540	They care about it
3209540	3212300	because it's something that they want, right?
3212300	3214180	The same way people will care about others,
3214180	3215660	but only from the perspective of,
3215660	3217340	do you have things that I want?
3217340	3219620	Or can I feel better about myself
3219620	3220860	by taking something from you
3220860	3223100	by making things worse for you?
3223100	3224660	People often talk about narcissism
3224660	3226360	as like the opposite of empathy.
3228180	3231860	But sort of empathy, again, depends how you define it,
3231860	3236860	but is a careful consideration
3237380	3240020	of the mental space of another person,
3240020	3242420	of how the other person sees the world.
3242420	3245980	And so you're kind of saying that narcissism,
3245980	3249420	narcissistic people would also be very good at that
3249420	3252780	in order to understand how maybe the other person
3252780	3254340	can be manipulated or something
3254340	3256700	to alleviate your sense of inadequacy.
3256700	3257660	Right, so there's a difference
3257660	3259580	between the mechanics of empathy.
3259580	3261940	So let's say, again, we can define things different ways.
3261940	3265260	Let's say empathic attunement is the ability to be attuned
3265380	3267300	to think, okay, what's going on in you?
3267300	3268420	What might you be thinking?
3268420	3270020	What might you be feeling?
3270020	3272460	Some people have a lot of empathic attunement,
3272460	3276020	but we could look at that as mechanistic, right?
3276020	3279020	It doesn't equate to care, right?
3279020	3283580	An empathic attunement can come along with empathy or not.
3283580	3286300	Right, so yes, people who are narcissistic,
3286300	3287540	they can mentalize well.
3287540	3289580	So you mentalize meaning the ability
3289580	3294020	to understand or to consider thoughts, feelings,
3294060	3296460	motivations, and other people, right?
3296460	3299980	So people who are narcissistic
3299980	3302220	can have empathic attunement or mentalization
3302220	3304420	depending upon how we wanna describe those things,
3304420	3308420	but that has nothing to do with care,
3308420	3312580	with actual empathy or kindness or consideration.
3312580	3316380	So in that sense, empathy usually popularly used
3316380	3319780	means that you care, like your happiness is aligned.
3319780	3322260	This is, I need to read this book.
3322260	3323820	I've read so little science fiction
3323820	3325780	that's been one of my goals for this year
3325780	3327580	to catch up on some science fiction.
3327580	3331100	So Robert Highland from Stranger in a Strange Land
3331100	3332620	has this quote about love,
3332620	3334540	which is love is that condition
3334540	3338300	where another person's happiness is essential to your own.
3338300	3340140	So that's a good definition, I guess, of empathy,
3340140	3342340	where you're very sensitive,
3342340	3344060	so mechanistically very sensitive
3344060	3346460	to the state of another person's mind,
3346460	3350380	and your goal is to maximize their happiness.
3350380	3352500	It's like essential to your own happiness.
3352540	3354940	So the happinesses are aligned,
3354940	3357020	and when that's elevated to its highest form,
3357020	3360740	you can call that love, romantic love, friendship, and so on.
3360740	3361580	Okay.
3361580	3363580	There's one more thing about the narcissist.
3363580	3365980	Some people can be sort of benign narcissists
3365980	3370100	where they want great things for themselves, right?
3370100	3372540	But if they have enough great things,
3372540	3375580	they can sort of tolerate others being happy too.
3375580	3378020	And these are people who sometimes
3378020	3379780	are actually quite highly liked, right?
3379780	3381860	Because they have to have the most money,
3381860	3383740	the most power, the most of anything,
3383740	3386020	anything more than anyone else could challenge.
3386020	3387020	But as long as I have that,
3387020	3389020	it's okay that you have some too, right?
3389020	3390500	And then that can make you happy,
3390500	3392180	and can make you like me, right?
3392180	3395580	So benign narcissists can be well liked
3395580	3397100	from that perspective,
3397100	3400500	but it's still all about them,
3400500	3402340	and that can change if, for example,
3402340	3404780	there's a scarcity of resources now, right?
3404780	3405940	But they're generally,
3405940	3408100	they're not people who are being overtly destructive,
3408100	3410420	although that they're over the border
3410420	3413820	into the envy territory, right?
3413820	3415780	Malignant narcissists are very different
3415780	3418140	where they then want to have everything.
3418140	3420900	So even if I have 1,000 times more than you,
3420900	3422580	do I still envy you what you have?
3422580	3425420	Because I don't think I can feel good enough
3425420	3427580	about myself unless I have everything.
3427580	3428420	And once I have everything,
3428420	3429780	I won't feel good enough about myself either,
3429780	3430980	and I don't have to have more, right?
3430980	3433700	It's like, that's malignant narcissism,
3433700	3436220	which we think of as sociopathy, right?
3436220	3438060	And again, we can define these words in different ways,
3438100	3440820	but they're very, very negative concepts.
3440820	3444260	That's profound sociopathy, malignant narcissism,
3445420	3446500	envy writ large.
3446500	3449380	So sociopathy is malignant narcissism.
3449380	3451340	That's a convenient way to think about it.
3452460	3455340	No, because we can do sort of sociopathic things,
3455340	3457740	but not be sociopathic, like, well,
3457740	3459140	you know, the tele-white lie,
3459140	3461420	it's like sort of sociopathy on steroids, right?
3461420	3465420	Is then envy writ large is malignant narcissism.
3465420	3466260	Just like you're saying,
3466260	3469420	like there's empathic attunement, as you said.
3469420	3472860	So there's the mechanistic aspect of empathy
3472860	3475420	and sociopathy, and then there's the big label
3475420	3478100	you get attached if you're just doing that thing regularly,
3478100	3479420	I guess.
3479420	3481580	Living your life through that lens, right?
3481580	3482460	Yeah.
3482460	3484540	And is there a nice spectrum
3484540	3488620	that's like narcissism, sociopathy, and psychopathy?
3488620	3491340	Is it all the same kind of nice stroll
3491340	3493900	through the woods, off the cliff?
3493900	3495220	Not really, because the words
3495220	3496620	don't have clear definitions,
3496620	3498340	like psychopathy and sociopathy.
3498340	3503340	There's no real definition of psychopath or psychopathy.
3503340	3505980	Does that mean someone's sociopathic, but psychotic?
3505980	3507140	Like there's really not a,
3507140	3509780	we end up using those words colloquially, right?
3509780	3512580	Which is why, you know, concepts that we can define,
3512580	3516540	like envy, empathic attunement, narcissism,
3516540	3518780	even though there might be nuances and definitions,
3518780	3522620	like we can define them in ways that are widely accepted,
3522660	3525420	including within psychology and psychiatry.
3525420	3526980	So it's nice to just think about this
3526980	3528420	a broad umbrella of narcissism
3528420	3532060	and the levels to which it's benign or malignant,
3532060	3535580	and then also separating into the different mechanisms,
3535580	3537380	like interaction by interaction,
3537380	3538940	which sometimes can be narcissistic,
3538940	3540460	but broadly speaking,
3540460	3543300	do you do everything through the lens of malignant narcissism
3543300	3548300	that makes you a sociopath or a malignant narcissist?
3549300	3550860	Yes, and the thing I would add to that
3550860	3552420	is the thought about culture, right?
3552540	3554340	Like how does the cultures we're in,
3554340	3556500	whether it's the culture of a household, right?
3556500	3557660	The culture of a community,
3557660	3559780	the culture of a nation or the world, right?
3559780	3563900	How does that impact what unfolds in that person?
3563900	3566260	And then how does what unfolds in that person
3566260	3567380	impact that culture?
3567380	3570580	Well, that's the question is what unfolds in that person?
3571660	3573220	Yeah, how does culture affect it?
3573220	3577820	But how does your own psychological development unfold that?
3577820	3582060	Because narcissism in leaders is the most impactful thing,
3582900	3585220	who are the most impactful individuals?
3585220	3587780	What is the most impact of individual psychology we have?
3587780	3589940	It's usually leaders of countries
3589940	3592580	or leaders of major organizations and so on.
3592580	3596220	And one of the things you mentioned with benign narcissism,
3596220	3599540	that seems to be aligned with success, right?
3599540	3601780	If you care about your own success,
3601780	3603700	that's going to be,
3603700	3606660	you're more likely to have narcissistic tendencies,
3606660	3607500	I suppose.
3607900	3610700	And so my question is,
3610700	3614140	when you follow that thread of narcissism
3614140	3616780	to become the leader of a country,
3616780	3620620	now you have a lot of new interesting
3620620	3624060	psychological complexities to deal with, like power.
3624060	3626100	I don't cliche that power corrupts.
3627100	3631820	Does that, is it possible for power to corrupt a human mind?
3631820	3635180	To where it pushes you farther and farther
3635180	3638260	into malignant narcissism,
3638260	3640500	into this destructive envy.
3640500	3642180	What are your thoughts on power?
3642180	3644540	Like the effect of power in the human mind?
3644540	3649540	Yeah, I think power is an accentuator, right?
3650700	3652460	An intensifier, right?
3652460	3657460	So I think it is true that there are people who can be
3657500	3659340	sort of in a gray area where there are
3659340	3664060	malignant narcissistic tendencies and behaviors,
3664060	3666340	but there are also ways in which that person
3666340	3667700	can think outside of themselves
3667700	3668940	and think in a broader way
3668940	3671260	and think sort of kindly about others.
3671260	3674900	And they're sort of trying to navigate,
3674900	3675980	whether they're aware or not,
3675980	3677100	that they're trying to navigate
3677100	3678140	between one and the other.
3678140	3680020	And then the allure of power is,
3680020	3681700	well, just look, just exercise that power
3681700	3683020	and you'll feel better, right?
3683020	3684780	It'll show you, right, that you're good enough.
3684780	3685820	Look at the power you have.
3685820	3688460	And whatever may be going on in the person's mind,
3688460	3692340	that then power, yes, can corrupt, yes.
3692340	3695060	I think that's why we have to have checks and balances, right?
3695060	3698620	Because we are all inscrutable to ourselves,
3698620	3699580	let alone to others.
3699580	3701900	So we must have checks and balances
3701900	3704060	and we should always have them on ourselves
3704060	3705180	as well as on others.
3705180	3707460	We should want that for the health of ourselves
3707460	3709480	and the world around us.
3709480	3711820	So I think all of that is true,
3711820	3714500	but there are also people who don't necessarily
3714500	3717460	become corrupted by power, right?
3717460	3720100	That there can be an understanding and a grounding
3720100	3722820	that they're a steward of power, right?
3722820	3726100	A shepherd, I mean, there are ways people describe
3726100	3730180	utilizing power and utilizing it in a benign way
3730180	3734980	that then fosters the healthy aspects of self, right?
3734980	3737340	So like gratitude and humility, right?
3737340	3741460	If we could add a healthy dose of gratitude and humility
3741460	3743380	to everyone or to our society,
3743380	3744940	there would be a sea change, right?
3744940	3746560	But how do you feel gratitude?
3746560	3748060	How do you feel humility?
3748100	3752340	Those things are incompatible with narcissism, envy, right?
3752340	3755260	With really the bad pole of things that we're talking about.
3755260	3758620	And part of the reason I'm so focused in my work
3758620	3761820	and in really what runs through all of my thoughts about life
3761820	3763540	is the impact of trauma, right?
3763540	3766300	Because trauma creates these false lessons
3766300	3767940	and it walls us off from truth.
3767940	3772940	Then it starts to point towards the unhealthy ways
3772940	3777060	of trying to feel better about ourselves.
3777060	3780180	But we have the health in us too.
3780180	3781860	We have those seeds of health too
3781860	3784140	that can grow into being a steward of power
3784140	3786540	and sharing power, being considerate and kind.
3786540	3789420	And we see a lot of that in the world too, right?
3789420	3791420	It's not all just the evil.
3791420	3793620	We see plenty of people who do good
3793620	3794980	and who are generous of spirit.
3794980	3797340	And we have both in us and it is,
3797340	3799540	as I think you're talking about our culture
3799540	3800860	and what the seeds that we sow
3800860	3803420	and the climate that we set,
3803420	3805620	including putting governors and boundaries around like,
3806180	3809300	how do we reign in or say that the more aggressive,
3809300	3812300	the more envious or destructive is unacceptable, right?
3812300	3815380	How do we foster the part that's kind
3815380	3818620	and considerate and reflective and slow to judge of like,
3818620	3819740	hey, let's learn a little bit more.
3819740	3820980	Like, how do we foster that?
3820980	3823100	And I think a lot of that comes back
3823100	3824540	to early childhood education.
3824540	3826100	I mean, I think we don't do nearly enough
3826100	3828020	to protect children.
3828020	3830140	And as a corollary to that,
3830140	3832460	we don't do nearly enough to educate children.
3832460	3834020	I mean, I said, I wanna write a book.
3834020	3836100	Second book I write is gonna be everything
3836100	3838260	I needed to know about life.
3838260	3842060	I learned as a second year postgraduate psychiatry resident.
3842060	3843700	I was like, why?
3843700	3848220	Why then did I learn so much about unconscious motivation,
3848220	3849900	about the impact of trauma,
3849900	3853180	about how we can be envious and how we can act out,
3853180	3855900	even about how our emotions trump logic in us.
3855900	3859660	Like, why don't we teach these things
3859660	3861340	when we're young enough to understand?
3861340	3863820	Like, why is that other kid bullying me, right?
3863820	3866460	Or why, just because I'm a little bit bigger,
3866460	3868820	do I wanna go thump that other kid on the head?
3868820	3871140	Like, what's going on?
3871140	3873380	That we don't do those things, you know?
3873380	3875540	We're just tripping ahead of ourselves
3875540	3878820	and we don't stop and think, how are we using our resources?
3878820	3882180	How are we shepherding forward the next generation,
3882180	3883260	which by the way is a generation
3883260	3884980	that's gonna determine our fates too, right?
3884980	3888620	As we get older, but we don't, you know, do that.
3888620	3890020	I often think of like in the Olympics,
3890020	3892620	you know, you see like the great sprinters, right?
3892620	3894580	They've gotta come out of the blocks perfectly, right?
3894580	3896460	So if they come out of the blocks a little bit too fast,
3896460	3897460	they're gonna fall over, right?
3897460	3898540	They're gonna just fall forward.
3898540	3903420	And I often see that in my head about us as humans
3903420	3906220	and as a culture that we're rushing so far forward.
3906220	3909340	We don't stop and say, wait, let's keep the basics here.
3909340	3910660	The basic techniques of like,
3910660	3913660	how are we navigating forward in life?
3913660	3914940	Or do we just throw all those away?
3914940	3918820	Because I can get some benefit by saying that you're bad,
3918820	3921620	even though what's being leveled against you is wrong, right?
3921620	3923780	Like why do I take that?
3923780	3926540	Or do I say, no, there's something more important here
3926540	3929020	that we wanna shepherd forward in ourselves as a culture.
3929020	3931640	And I think preventing childhood trauma
3931640	3934300	and changing the ways that we educate children and adults
3934300	3937020	would could again, make a sea change
3937020	3940900	and maybe set us on a course towards a greater likelihood
3940900	3942540	of survival as a species.
3942540	3947540	Yeah, so talking to like people in elementary school
3948420	3951860	about human nature and teaching them
3951860	3955500	is so how people can be resentful and envious
3955500	3960500	and how to deal with your emotions, how to, yeah.
3960500	3963460	So these basic interaction things about human relationships,
3963460	3967220	about friendships, about betrayal, about love,
3967220	3968580	about all those things.
3968580	3972660	Like it just, it's actually strange that we don't,
3972660	3976660	we kind of hope the parents talk about that kind of stuff,
3976660	3981660	but then the parents often need therapy themselves.
3982780	3984580	The parents didn't learn it, right?
3984580	3985420	Yeah, the parents didn't learn it.
3985420	3988100	I mean, I'm not joking that I was mad,
3988100	3990140	second year after medical school, like how is it?
3990140	3993980	Like I think of things in my own life and how I,
3993980	3996340	how much shame I felt after my brother's suicide.
3996340	3998180	Like I was already an adult, right?
3998180	4001140	I was a young adult, but I felt so much shame.
4001140	4003820	I didn't, like I had no understanding that,
4004060	4007660	oh, like it's a reflex to trauma, right?
4007660	4009100	To feel guilt and shame.
4009100	4011260	And that of course I was feeling that.
4011260	4014340	It didn't mean it was true because I felt it,
4014340	4016460	but I mapped the fact that I felt ashamed
4016460	4019020	to the fact that I should have felt guilty and ashamed.
4019020	4022020	And I like led to some very negative things in my life
4022020	4023820	that I had to sort of pull myself back from
4023820	4024660	and recover from.
4024660	4027780	And like, I didn't know that, right?
4027780	4030660	I didn't know the automaticity of the reflex
4030660	4031820	and how pervasive it can be
4031820	4033220	and how it can put blinders on us.
4033220	4035420	And I mean, it's just one example,
4035420	4036820	but you know, it's an example of something big
4036820	4039860	that happens to people that we don't learn about.
4039860	4042740	And I find myself sometimes having conversations
4042740	4043580	with a person.
4043580	4046120	I still do a lot of clinical care of having conversations
4046120	4048380	with a person after a tragedy.
4048380	4050060	And I'm saying, I can't believe, right?
4050060	4052300	Again, I'm saying the things that this person
4052300	4054220	didn't learn in elementary school
4054220	4055800	because like none of us did, right?
4055800	4057740	And then look at the misery and the suffering.
4057740	4059020	And then I think this is one person
4059020	4061180	among how many millions among us
4061180	4064060	who try and go about their way
4064060	4066620	without knowing things that are easily knowable
4066620	4067940	because they don't even know that they're knowable
4067940	4070540	because we don't teach them to ourselves.
4070540	4072660	So how to deal with trauma.
4072660	4074580	That trauma happens, first of all,
4075620	4078420	that suffering can happen.
4078420	4082700	And small trauma and big trauma, all of it can happen.
4082700	4085100	And there's natural ways to deal with it.
4085100	4088580	So in the case of trauma, as you write about,
4088580	4090940	and we can also just talk about
4090940	4092260	some more of the details of that,
4092260	4094980	but it's good to bring it to the surface,
4094980	4099300	to talk about it, to not be ashamed to hide it inside,
4099300	4102220	to be some kind of secret that it's actually,
4104180	4106220	I mean, there's a lot of positive things to say here,
4106220	4107340	at least from my perspective.
4107340	4110340	One is it's discussing trauma and dealing with trauma
4110340	4112860	together with other human beings by talking about it.
4112860	4115220	There's a path to deep friendship and intimacy
4115220	4116240	with those people.
4117240	4121440	There's a dark aspect to trauma, to war,
4121440	4126440	that communicating it or sharing it bonds you.
4127440	4130840	So like the other side of trauma is like love,
4130840	4134040	is you need that hardship, not you don't need it,
4134040	4136560	but hardship and trauma can often be a catalyst
4136560	4138000	for a deep human connection.
4138000	4139160	If you bring it to the surface,
4139160	4142200	it's supposed to kind of hide it on the inside.
4142200	4143800	I mean, if we can just linger on it
4143840	4148160	because you've been through a few very traumatic events
4148160	4150840	in your life, when you were 25 years old,
4150840	4153620	as you mentioned, your brother committed suicide,
4155280	4157720	what did that event teach you about life,
4157720	4161760	about death and about the human mind?
4163400	4165240	What certainly brought me face to face
4165240	4168800	with the truths of life and death,
4168800	4173440	because I had not had a major trauma before then,
4173440	4175560	so there wasn't a major trauma sort of in my
4175560	4179160	developmental years, that what can carry forward
4179160	4180960	is a sort of omnipotence defense, right?
4180960	4183040	I mean, the thought is that when we're toddlers,
4183040	4185120	we all have like an omnipotence defense,
4185120	4187680	which is like, I can just try and get up and run and move,
4187680	4189960	and if I run into something, I'll get up and do it again,
4189960	4192560	right, that we kind of have to,
4192560	4194520	and it's partly the protection of the parent, et cetera,
4194520	4196400	but we think we can get out there in the world
4196400	4197600	and do things and we just do.
4197600	4200200	And if we don't have major traumas,
4200200	4201800	we can sort of carry through that,
4201800	4204320	oh, like bad things aren't gonna happen to me, you know?
4204320	4205880	Like, I know that they're there
4205880	4206840	and I know they happen to people,
4206840	4209000	but they don't happen to me, right?
4209000	4212000	And sometimes what will happen is being confronted
4212000	4215440	with such a tragedy wipes that away very, very quickly,
4215440	4218280	and then that person feels extremely exposed,
4218280	4222640	like, oh, I thought that I was gonna be okay,
4222640	4224560	and now I know that I'm not,
4224560	4226360	and then, and that can start to lead to,
4226360	4227200	and what does that mean?
4227200	4230480	And now, is this all coming for me now, you know?
4231320	4233640	Did I get so lucky for 25 years?
4233640	4234480	Nothing bad happened,
4234480	4235880	nothing but bad things are gonna be happening.
4235880	4236840	Am I cursed?
4236840	4238680	Is my family cursed, right?
4238680	4240760	And I think that leads to, you say,
4240760	4244640	what the learning about the human mind, in retrospect,
4244640	4247860	I think I understood at the time to some degree,
4247860	4250600	but not like I do now, I can put words to it now, right?
4250600	4255600	Like, how incredibly important, powerful,
4255600	4258680	powerfully important negative emotion is, right?
4258680	4262920	That how a sense of guilt and shame and vulnerability
4262920	4267840	can just pervade our entire life perspective.
4267840	4270760	So all of a sudden we're swimming in a very different soup,
4270760	4274160	and it's a frightening soup, and it's a toxic soup,
4274160	4277120	and I'm most struck by that.
4277120	4280320	And that goes along with the idea that we're not taught
4280320	4283400	that emotion always beats logic.
4283400	4285320	You know, like, I think the idea of Descartes,
4285320	4287520	Daniel, the idea that we're rational creatures,
4287520	4288960	you know, that kind of comes down to us
4288960	4292480	through Western thought is like completely not true.
4292480	4294720	Like we're rational creatures,
4294720	4298560	only if there is an emotion grabbing for our attention,
4298560	4299400	right?
4299400	4300440	Like, you know, we're attending to one another,
4300440	4301640	we're being very logical, right?
4301640	4304880	What we're doing now, if we heard a frightening noise
4304880	4307400	right outside the door, like we'd be entirely different,
4307400	4308240	right?
4308240	4309080	The emotion would trump everything,
4309080	4310720	is they stop paying attention to this, right?
4310720	4313080	Now safety is at stake, and we think differently,
4313080	4315240	feel differently, behave differently, right?
4315240	4318920	And this is what happens to us, not just in situations
4318920	4321200	where something drags us from,
4321200	4323360	yanks us from one emotional state to another,
4323360	4325160	but it can be very, very pervasive.
4325160	4329160	So my sense of anger, frustration, inadequacy,
4329160	4330800	and then soothing in unhealthy ways,
4330800	4333120	you know, soothing by drinking too much,
4333120	4335160	and then kind of hating myself in the first place,
4335160	4336840	and then hating the world around me,
4336840	4338200	and then, you know, starting to think,
4338200	4339920	well, who cares, you know, what happens?
4339920	4342640	Like, you know, there's some very dark thoughts
4342640	4347440	and choices that came from a changed perspective
4347440	4349400	of self in the world.
4349400	4353280	So what do you do in that, because of trauma,
4353280	4355840	again, small or large,
4355840	4360160	you find yourself swimming or drowning
4360160	4363240	in a soup of negative emotion.
4363240	4364080	What do you do?
4365480	4366760	What do you do with that emotion?
4366760	4369040	I mean, we don't have to even talk about trauma,
4369480	4374160	I think the interesting thing is, you know,
4375160	4378880	any one of us throughout the day can find ourselves
4378880	4382520	taking a bit of a dip in the pool of negative emotion.
4382520	4383960	What do we do with that?
4383960	4387000	The first thing is to separate how we feel
4387000	4388920	from what's true.
4388920	4391280	Because we don't do a good job of that as humans.
4391280	4395400	If I feel bad about myself, it's very easy to,
4395400	4397920	then I conclude like, I'm bad, right?
4397920	4399120	If I feel ashamed of myself,
4399120	4402360	I conclude I'm a terrible person who's shameful, right?
4402360	4405480	This is that, you know, there's an old psychodynamic concept
4405480	4407640	of what they used to call it, an observing ego.
4407640	4408800	It still gets called that.
4408800	4411200	It's not ego in the sense of arrogance, right?
4411200	4414880	It's the ability to step outside and to see ourselves, right?
4414880	4417080	So that's what lets us keep the difference
4417080	4419480	between our feelings, right?
4419480	4420600	And what we know to be true.
4420600	4421960	Like we could be very angry at someone.
4421960	4423240	And so I think that person's terrible.
4423240	4424640	I think the person's stupid.
4424640	4425560	I think that right now,
4425560	4427960	because like something negative just passed between us,
4427960	4430320	this inside of me, it's just because of how I feel.
4430320	4431760	Like when I can separate that,
4431760	4434160	how do I actually think about that person, right?
4434160	4439320	And, you know, we get driven so, so frequently
4439320	4442640	by how we feel, because how we think,
4442640	4444800	therefore what we believe, right?
4444800	4446320	Just kind of comes on its heels
4446320	4448760	as if the feeling is dragging it along.
4448760	4450440	And I've been struck by that.
4450440	4454320	It's one of the things that has struck me so the most, right?
4454440	4458080	Among the very most in 20 years of working as a psychiatrist
4458080	4462320	is how we are led by our feelings, our emotions,
4462320	4463600	as if they are truth.
4463600	4465400	And then they create truth
4465400	4468960	because we embrace what they're telling us as true.
4470040	4472080	And that is, I think, incredibly,
4472080	4473720	I think it's how people learn prejudice.
4473720	4476200	I think it's how people learn self-hatred.
4476200	4479200	I think it's how we learn so many destructive behaviors.
4479200	4482680	And then the blinders on us come in more and more
4482680	4484120	and more and more.
4484120	4486400	So separate, you know, we're driven by what we feel
4486400	4488960	unless we understand that what we feel
4488960	4491320	is different from what we know to be true
4491320	4493480	or what we can decide on one way or another.
4493480	4496840	And that requires realizing and catching
4496840	4499840	the emotions themselves, realizing that it's an emotion.
4499840	4501840	A feeling comes into your mind, overtakes you,
4501840	4506560	a feeling of anger, dislike, hatred, all of that.
4506560	4508000	It just comes in.
4508000	4511080	It's like, why did that person just cut me off
4511080	4513560	in traffic or something like that, that feeling?
4513560	4516120	So wait, you just kind of take it as a feeling
4516120	4519120	and realize it's a feeling that doesn't represent
4519120	4521480	some deep reality about the world that's fundamental.
4521480	4526480	Or you, they just kind of watch it and let it pass,
4527600	4529800	which is the natural way of things.
4529800	4532440	Yeah, we'll decide if it means anything, you know?
4532440	4534280	If I'm mad, right, someone cut me off
4534280	4537240	and I feel hatred and I want to destroy them, right?
4537240	4539480	Just stop and think, look, I've got that in me.
4539480	4542240	I can, you know, are the stressors running too high
4542280	4543720	in my life, like is it really good?
4543720	4547760	Should I be on this road, 10 minutes behind schedule?
4547760	4549120	Like is it, what am I really doing?
4549120	4552920	So we can learn, but yes, it's an observation skill, right?
4552920	4556200	And it's an observation skill that we can develop, you know?
4556200	4558480	I often think about, you know, there was something called
4558480	4561840	the tapestry theory, which I think initially was a theodicy
4561840	4564280	of explaining, I believe this is true.
4564280	4566520	I'm not sure of this, that the idea was that,
4566520	4571160	oh, we don't see God's plan because we're up too close
4571160	4572000	to it, right?
4572000	4574200	Like as if there was a beautiful tapestry on the wall
4574200	4575480	and we're standing right up it,
4575480	4577640	we're only gonna see one part of it,
4577640	4579040	we need to stand back from it.
4579040	4581760	And, you know, I remember learning that religion studies
4581760	4584680	class made me really fascinated with that at the time.
4584680	4588440	And I think that there are a lot of things we do that about,
4588440	4589280	right?
4589280	4592280	And in training ourselves to have an observing ego,
4592280	4596200	what we're saying is, hey, like just the busyness of life
4596200	4599360	or my own impulses or the pool of emotions are trying
4599400	4601640	to pull me up right close to whatever tapestry
4601640	4602480	there is there.
4602480	4603320	And I want to sort of resist that.
4603320	4607600	I mean, I'm better off if I really stay further behind it.
4607600	4610400	And then I make a choice if I want to come close to it.
4610400	4612200	If there's some really positive emotion,
4612200	4614600	it's friendship, it's love, it's nurturing,
4614600	4617160	you know what, let me come right up to this, right?
4617160	4619600	But I want to choose when I'm doing that.
4619600	4621920	I don't want some drive.
4621920	4624320	I didn't decide to like take me by the back of the head
4624320	4627320	and put me up against that tapestry.
4627360	4631360	So the interesting exercise for me,
4631360	4633640	and I think for a lot of people in modern civilization
4633640	4636280	is the internet with social media,
4636280	4640040	that it's almost like going to the gym or something like that.
4640040	4641640	At least that's the way I see it.
4641640	4646040	Because there's a bunch of forces on social media
4646040	4648920	that are trying to make you feel things.
4648920	4653560	Most of it is kind of in the negative space of feelings.
4653560	4656920	Because there is actually a strong gravity pull
4656920	4659080	to negative feelings for some reason.
4659080	4662640	And so the, and the brain notices them more.
4662640	4665080	I don't know what that pull is, but it's there.
4665080	4666720	And you get to observe it on social media.
4666720	4669520	Like if you actually just scroll through social media,
4670760	4674680	you feel the gravitational pull of negative emotions.
4674680	4678480	And I just see it as a kind of exercise of like,
4678480	4680400	you feel the pull just like when you go to the gym,
4680400	4681640	there's a resistance.
4681640	4685160	And I practice like a stepping way to look at the tapestry,
4686040	4687280	and there's different mechanisms
4687280	4689120	I think all of us have to learn.
4689120	4691480	For me, there's a kind of,
4691480	4694720	you mentioned gratitude and humility.
4695760	4700040	So like if somebody, if it's me personally,
4700040	4703160	I've recently gotten attacked, if you place it here and there.
4704920	4707320	If they're saying that they're much smarter than me,
4707320	4710040	I practice kind of humility, like you mentioned.
4710040	4713040	And I kind of imagine that they are smarter than me.
4713040	4714880	Those things like helped me to kind of like,
4714880	4718200	pull away and then maybe they have a lesson to teach me.
4718200	4722280	Like I don't take their sort of negative comments to heart,
4722280	4723600	but I imagine the human being
4723600	4726360	and like that they might have a lesson to teach me.
4726360	4728480	And in general, when it's more amorphous,
4728480	4729680	kind of negative feeling,
4729680	4732160	I'll think the other thing is that gratitude.
4732160	4734760	Just like different versions,
4734760	4737560	almost memifiable versions of like,
4737560	4739000	oh, this is pretty cool.
4739000	4740560	Like we got a thing going here.
4740560	4741800	There's like human civilization,
4742640	4746920	bickering and having a little fun like lunch, food fight.
4746920	4748080	And it's kind of cool.
4748080	4749920	Like we get to interact in this way
4749920	4752680	and there's a bit of humor.
4752680	4753920	There's like Thanksgiving dinner.
4753920	4756160	Like if you, like Thanksgiving dinner,
4756160	4757600	if you're arguing about politics,
4757600	4759000	you can feel like really intense.
4759000	4760280	Like I can't believe you said this,
4760280	4762640	but if you zoom out, it's like family.
4762640	4764520	This is like, this is amazing.
4764520	4767440	So that kind of feeling really helps.
4767440	4769880	But it's like, it really is like going to the gym.
4769880	4772000	It's like building up a muscle
4772000	4776120	to be able to pull away from those emotions.
4776120	4778720	I don't think I get to practice
4778720	4781080	that kind of emotion in regular day-to-day life.
4781080	4783520	Cause like, it's hard to get those reps.
4783520	4785560	On social media, you can really get the reps in.
4785560	4786400	It's kind of cool.
4786400	4788600	Like that's the way I see social media
4788600	4791680	is a chance to sort of practice that stoicism
4791680	4794240	of like, of gratitude, of humility,
4794240	4796160	of loving other people in the face
4796160	4798160	of this negative emotion, all that.
4798160	4801920	Yes, and, you know, there's a certain kind of psychotherapy
4801920	4804200	that talks a lot about this idea that like,
4804200	4806200	oh, everything is as it should be, right?
4806200	4809600	Which doesn't mean from some moral or justice point.
4809600	4812160	It's just that often if you look at things,
4813240	4816040	one thing leads to another to another to another
4816040	4819040	in a way that's actually very, very predictable,
4819040	4821600	even though we might be surprised about it, right?
4821600	4826600	And so an example, so I would say that gratitude often does
4827440	4830200	come along with a healthy pride, right?
4830200	4833400	So you could say in the example you gave,
4833400	4836360	I'm being assailed on social media, okay?
4836360	4839200	So you could say, well, you know, there was a time I sat at,
4839200	4842560	I set forth to impact people, right?
4842560	4846200	To be able to reach people and to impact them, right?
4846200	4849400	And look, I feel a sense of both gratitude and pride
4849400	4850640	that I've done that, right?
4850640	4853680	Because look, you did it because of your effort, right?
4853680	4855400	Your work, your intelligence, your thoughts,
4855400	4857480	like you're responsible for it, right?
4857480	4861400	But also you feel gratitude because any one of us
4861400	4863040	who's here and has any opportunity
4863040	4865240	has reason to feel immense gratitude, right?
4865240	4868080	So then you can say, okay, what's actually gone on here
4868080	4869600	is something successful.
4869600	4873600	I set out to do something and I'm doing it, right?
4874640	4879200	And what it brings with it absolutely includes being assailed.
4879200	4880600	There's no surprise there, right?
4880600	4885000	That because of, you know, people who have anything good
4885000	4887160	to serve as lightning rods for envy.
4887160	4890880	So then, yes, there will be people who want to make up lies
4890880	4892040	or whatever they want to do
4892040	4894520	because you become a lightning rod for envy
4894520	4897520	by having succeeded at the thing you set out to do
4897520	4900880	about which you can feel a healthy pride and gratitude, right?
4900880	4903560	And then I think that kind of puts it in its place.
4903560	4905280	I mean, you're still gonna make decisions about it,
4905280	4907120	but it makes sense then,
4907120	4909920	like you have a mechanism of understanding it
4909920	4912360	that not only makes sense to you,
4912360	4916480	but reflects the truth of what you actually have done
4916480	4918920	and achieved and what's going on in the world around you.
4918920	4921840	Well, I wonder if we're all kind of a little bit unique
4921840	4923120	in this because for me,
4924520	4926400	I mean, maybe it's useful to kind of talk
4926400	4930800	through my own experience of it is for me,
4930800	4933160	I try to avoid, especially in those situations,
4933160	4938160	to feel pride because I'm just looking empirically.
4939160	4943120	I feel way happier if I focus on humility.
4943120	4945920	If I ever think of like,
4945920	4948280	oh yeah, when you do something meaningful
4948280	4949920	or you become more popular,
4949920	4951520	you're going to experience these kinds of,
4951520	4953320	I feel the attacks more
4953320	4956080	and it's like me versus the world.
4956080	4957720	That's the feeling that you start getting
4957720	4960000	and that does not create a pleasant feeling.
4960000	4963880	So to me, the pleasant feeling is like stepping away,
4963880	4967120	like kind of laughing at it at all with a smile
4967160	4969200	and not like in a negative, like laughing at people
4969200	4972080	but just like laughing at the theater of it,
4972080	4972920	the circus of it,
4972920	4975320	like this whole absurd existence we've got going on
4975320	4977720	and then just having a humility in like,
4977720	4979200	everybody has a lesson to teach me.
4979200	4980520	It just makes me feel good.
4980520	4983760	The pride thing I do like feeling
4985800	4987800	in a positive pool of emotion.
4987800	4991200	So if I'm building a trinket and I finish it,
4991200	4992640	I'm like really happy with myself.
4992640	4993760	Like I finished this thing
4993760	4996880	and I usually actually like to do that alone.
4996880	4998600	Like I don't need an audience for pride.
4998600	5000440	I like to sit there and just like,
5000440	5001320	ooh, this is cool.
5001320	5003000	I did that, you know?
5003000	5005920	But I just, I find that in social interactions,
5007360	5008440	pride is just a dangerous,
5008440	5011320	I guess it's a dangerous drug for me
5011320	5014160	because like it's such a small,
5016560	5018040	it's a small step away
5018040	5019920	from then losing all the humility
5019920	5022440	and then you started getting very defensive
5022440	5023640	and that's not going to,
5023640	5027560	that just starts you on a spiral of negative emotion.
5027560	5030560	But I also, I mean, with everybody,
5030560	5031400	you mentioned this,
5031400	5034040	it will probably sneak up to it in different directions.
5035120	5038360	I do think there's different brains that we all have.
5038360	5042080	Like my brain is exceptionally self-critical,
5042080	5043720	like non-stop.
5043720	5046240	It's like an engine that's always there.
5049320	5051400	But at the same time,
5051400	5053240	I'm able to zoom out and have gratitude
5054200	5056080	as if there's like two brains
5056080	5059360	and they're like cohabitating happily.
5059360	5061480	And I can, the better I get at this,
5061480	5063920	the more I can use the one that's self-critical
5063920	5065440	when I'm trying to be productive
5065440	5067080	because naturally I'm super lazy.
5067080	5070360	So I'm trying not to be less lazy, I'll be self-critical.
5070360	5073720	And then when I'm not being lazy,
5073720	5075320	when I just, there's a special moment,
5075320	5076320	I want to enjoy that moment,
5076320	5078680	I'll turn on the gratitude engine.
5078680	5080760	I feel like generic advice that people would give
5080760	5083200	if your brain is self-critical, that's not a good thing.
5083520	5085440	Like you should probably get rid of that.
5085440	5088160	I don't know about that because it seems to be working.
5088160	5091000	Yeah, like I kind of like it.
5091000	5094640	I kind of like this grumpy old man that's in there
5094640	5098800	that's like, that thing you did, that really sucked.
5100360	5101920	I was like, and I kind of,
5101920	5103160	there's a movie grumpy old man.
5103160	5107080	Like I like that grumpy boy, the grumpy cat is in there.
5107080	5108320	And it's nice, but yeah,
5108320	5111440	it can have bad effects on relationships
5111440	5114360	and on maybe my wellbeing,
5114360	5116080	maybe as you get older and all that kind of stuff.
5116080	5117960	So you have to monitor all this kind of stuff,
5117960	5119000	but I don't know.
5119000	5120720	I don't know which one is like,
5120720	5122240	cause you've kind of highlighted,
5122240	5124040	it's good to have gratitude and humility,
5124040	5125680	but it's also good to have a little bit of pride.
5125680	5128800	I wonder what that like set of ingredients
5128800	5132840	for a healthy life looks like for each of us.
5132840	5137040	Whether we have to customize and figure out what that is.
5137040	5140240	Cause some of the cake is already baked is the problem.
5140240	5141760	And because of the trauma,
5141760	5143560	like if I was like eight years old,
5143560	5145200	maybe I could be a little more flexible.
5145200	5148000	But at this point, like you got the thing you got
5148000	5149840	and it's hard to like fix it.
5149840	5151000	You can do a lot with it.
5151000	5151840	You could.
5151840	5154360	It may not be easy, but there's a lot of plasticity
5154360	5156360	and a lot of pliability there.
5156360	5157880	Across all ages.
5158960	5161320	People are different and there may be idiosyncrasies
5161320	5163160	of why one person is in a different place.
5163160	5165960	But as a general rule, I think the answer is absolutely yes.
5165960	5168600	I mean, people have evolved and I've worked with people
5168600	5170600	who've really changed themselves
5170600	5172520	and brought in their conception and understanding,
5172520	5174600	you know, they're in their 80s or, you know,
5174600	5176520	I think we can do it at any stage of life.
5176520	5181360	And I would make a case for, for intracyclic.
5181360	5183960	So not between people necessarily, right?
5183960	5186480	But inside of oneself or the feeling of pride.
5186480	5188200	And maybe if we call it self-esteem, right?
5188200	5190320	Like let's say we call it self-esteem, right?
5190320	5191840	Or we could call it healthy pride.
5191840	5193320	We could put either word to it.
5193320	5196160	But if you think about what we're trying to avoid
5196160	5198720	is say a sense of inadequacy,
5198720	5202040	then it is good to sort of own what's ours.
5202040	5204720	We can put ourselves a little bit out of balance
5205800	5207680	either in terms of building up resentments
5207680	5210640	or in terms of decreasing self-confidence, right?
5210640	5214120	If we're not owning everything, that's ours, right?
5214120	5216880	So a thought, thought I would have about,
5217880	5220720	let's say about some pride or some self-esteem, right?
5220720	5223800	Is it can work against vulnerability, right?
5223800	5226160	Which we know can also in some situations
5226160	5229280	push us towards jumping the boundary into envy
5229280	5230120	and all of that.
5230120	5232280	So think about vulnerability.
5232280	5236720	If you conceive, okay, people are assailing me
5236720	5240160	and you just go to a place of gratitude,
5240160	5244120	you know, it can send a message that,
5244120	5246800	okay, I'm just lucky and I hope I continue to get lucky
5246800	5249000	as opposed to like, that's not true, right?
5249000	5251640	Like there's ability inside of me
5251640	5254080	and discernment inside of me that tells me
5254080	5256240	I can have a greater sense of confidence
5256240	5258880	that I'll navigate what comes my way, right?
5258880	5262100	So because the pride or the self-esteem part
5262100	5264040	is owning what we've contributed
5264040	5266200	to the goodness we've created, right?
5266200	5269760	Which does in a sense helps us feel better about ourselves.
5269760	5272600	And it also helps us feel armed against say
5272600	5274800	the slings and arrows of, you know,
5274800	5277040	whatever outrageous fortune may come next.
5277040	5278880	I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.
5278880	5280760	Again, disagreeing with an expert here.
5280760	5282920	Yes, I think that's generally good advice,
5282920	5285480	but I think you mentioned vulnerability.
5287280	5290600	I think it's like, I've just been doing a lot of research
5290600	5292840	on rocket engines and fuel.
5292840	5296800	And speaking of fuel, I just think I get a lot
5296800	5299120	from being vulnerable because vulnerable leads
5299120	5302080	to intimacy in friendships and relationships.
5302080	5304640	I get a lot from being intimately close with human beings,
5304640	5309200	just on a friendship, on like a ideal level
5309200	5311080	in conversations and so on.
5311080	5316080	And so I would rather err on the side of vulnerability.
5316360	5318600	Like to me, pride is destructive.
5318600	5319540	I think I already,
5323160	5326120	yeah, I already have a pretty good engine that says like,
5327880	5329240	life is awesome.
5329240	5330960	I don't need help for that.
5330960	5331800	That's fine.
5331800	5332800	That one is working.
5332800	5337800	It's the, I just feel like the way to face the world
5338600	5341160	that's full of uncertainty that could be full of cruelty
5341160	5343920	is with humility and gratitude.
5343920	5347920	I don't know, this pride thing, it feels like,
5347920	5349760	I know that for a lot of people,
5349760	5354760	it's really important to really work on pride
5355040	5357920	to make sure they don't crumble under the pressure
5357920	5361120	of like, they don't give into the sense of security
5361120	5362200	that destroys them.
5362200	5365160	But I just, for me, empirically speaking,
5365160	5369080	I seem to be happier facing the world with humility
5369080	5370120	and just being grateful.
5370120	5372360	The pride I'm really worried about.
5372360	5375960	Like, it just, it feels more destructive than anything.
5375960	5378080	See, what I think, as you're telling me that,
5378080	5379120	and I wanna be presumptuous,
5379120	5382200	but I make some thoughts or some conclusions that tell me,
5382200	5384440	hey, you're in a pretty healthy place, right?
5384440	5386560	And the reason I say that is because
5386560	5388720	I agree completely about vulnerability.
5388720	5391040	I mean, think about humility and gratitude
5391040	5392200	make us vulnerable, right?
5392200	5393200	If you're like, wow, I'm grateful.
5393200	5394480	Thank you, I'm grateful for you.
5394480	5396440	You know, we could get shot down or something,
5396440	5397480	you know, something bad could happen
5397480	5399120	and something could make us feel bad.
5399120	5401880	So yes, we need vulnerability.
5401880	5403880	If we try and eliminate vulnerability,
5403880	5408200	we're living miles into the envy, you know, land, right?
5408200	5411420	So you're describing a healthy vulnerability,
5411420	5414280	but then my brain says that's because on the other side
5414280	5416280	of the seesaw, so to speak,
5416280	5418920	has to be a healthy sense of self,
5418920	5421280	whether we call it self-esteem or healthy pride.
5421280	5424320	And then I'll say what I think is the evidence for that
5424320	5427240	is you describe the negative voice, right?
5427240	5429280	As like the grumpy cat, right?
5429280	5433240	But that's a good negative voice to have, right?
5433240	5435640	Because it's telling you like, hey, that wasn't your best.
5435640	5437440	Like, come on, do better or, right?
5437440	5438280	Like you can do better.
5438280	5441080	Like this, you know, there's a negative voice in some ways,
5441080	5442920	but it believes in you, right?
5442920	5445680	It's where that voice could be.
5445680	5448120	It could be a negative voice that says,
5448120	5450280	you didn't do that well because you suck.
5450280	5451760	You don't deserve anything.
5451760	5452880	Good, right?
5452880	5454240	Well, I should even be alive, right?
5454240	5456440	I mean, that's the negative voice
5456440	5459040	that can gain so much force
5459040	5461280	if there isn't a balance of healthy self-esteem.
5461280	5463560	So I think because you're well-balanced,
5463560	5465680	you know, you have what you need,
5465680	5467240	and then having more of it seems like,
5467240	5468500	oh, that's not so good,
5468500	5470080	but there are people whose negative voice
5470080	5474480	isn't the grumpy cat, it's hateful, right?
5474480	5477760	And then that's a person who needs to bring
5477760	5480120	that into greater balance.
5480120	5484240	Yeah, I think my negative voice is like a grumpy cat.
5484240	5486800	That's like a French existentialist,
5486800	5488760	maybe a little bit of a nihilist,
5488760	5490200	but just kind of is-
5490200	5491200	Sartre's cat.
5491200	5493720	Yeah, Sartre's cat, so it doesn't get hateful.
5493720	5497480	It's not like a Hitler cat, so it's a little more,
5498520	5500680	yeah, I guess there is kind of like this line
5500680	5502760	that we've come across a couple of times
5502760	5505360	between the benign and the malignant.
5505360	5506280	Right.
5506280	5507880	But of course, you have to monitor that line.
5508000	5510600	I just, I think you have to be careful
5511800	5514140	when you face really difficult situations of,
5515440	5517960	as you go on through life, more and more difficult,
5517960	5519960	you face a lot of loss and suffering,
5519960	5521160	especially later in life.
5522240	5525160	Oh, you have to be careful with that voice.
5525160	5527680	That grumpy cat can get awfully confident,
5527680	5531480	and then if you don't have any source of positive emotions
5531480	5534440	in your life, you can become too heavy of a burden.
5534440	5536840	Yeah, which I think this leads us to,
5536840	5539600	well, I think it's a really important fact, right?
5539600	5540920	That there are some people,
5540920	5543160	like a significant subset of people
5543160	5545960	who get happier as they get older.
5545960	5548600	They have more contentment, a stronger sense of self.
5548600	5550760	You might think, how could that ever happen, right?
5550760	5552560	Like we're getting closer to death,
5552560	5554360	we're accumulating insults, right?
5554360	5555680	Like everything hurts a little bit more
5555680	5558560	and we have less energy and we accumulate losses and traumas.
5558560	5561960	Why would anyone be healthier across time,
5561960	5563720	if you're happier across time?
5563720	5566160	And what we see is it's linked to the things
5566160	5567360	that we're talking about, right?
5567360	5570200	It's linked to say, let's say vulnerability versus pride.
5570200	5571520	Like there's a good balance there, right?
5571520	5574400	There's a lot of humility, there's a lot of self-esteem.
5574400	5577560	The person is spending a lot of time standing back
5577560	5579960	from the tapestry and looking at it, right?
5579960	5582800	And what can come into people
5582800	5584560	is in sort of a sense of equanimity.
5584560	5586560	Like I sort of understand, you know,
5586560	5588680	I'm being the best person I can be, you know,
5588680	5590520	and that's not always even great.
5590520	5592280	And there are things that I don't feel great about
5592280	5593600	even while I'm trying to do that.
5593600	5597880	But look, I'm being who I'm choosing to be, right?
5597880	5599640	And that doesn't have to be in some big way.
5599640	5602280	I'm not saying that means any one specific thing.
5602280	5603280	You know, that can mean the person
5603280	5605680	who's taking care of their cat and tending their garden.
5605680	5606840	Like that's enough.
5606840	5609520	We have to have, you know, love the ability
5609520	5611440	to put good things out in the world, right?
5611440	5614480	And to put our ability to work and be,
5614480	5616360	to make things different out into the world
5616360	5617580	and make things better.
5617580	5621000	And if we're doing that, we get happier across time
5621520	5624480	because we come to a sense of peace with ourselves.
5624480	5625720	I'm not supposed to be everything.
5625720	5626880	I'm not supposed to do everything.
5626880	5628920	I'm not supposed to fix everything, right?
5628920	5630600	I'm also not supposed to suffer all the time
5630600	5632480	for the things I haven't gotten, right?
5632480	5633480	You know what?
5633480	5636320	I guess I'm kind of, and it leads back to Winnicott, right?
5636320	5640960	The British physician, you know, I'm good enough.
5640960	5645360	And that seems to help people feel happy, you know,
5645360	5647480	contentment and be generative and productive
5647480	5648400	into later life.
5648400	5651000	It's like, that's what we all should be wanting.
5651000	5652720	But it's even, it's kind of an afterthought though.
5652720	5654520	Some people are like that as opposed to,
5654520	5655600	wait a second, right?
5655600	5657840	Like, what's going on with them?
5657840	5660160	And let's do all of that.
5661120	5664600	Albert Camus writes in Mythocisophus, quote,
5664600	5667200	there's only one real serious philosophical problem
5667200	5669240	and that is suicide.
5669240	5671920	Deciding whether or not life is worth living
5671920	5674640	is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy.
5675600	5677640	All other questions follow from that.
5678440	5680320	So basically, to be or not to be.
5682160	5686120	Do you think there's a truth to that statement?
5686120	5688920	This question of why live at all?
5691120	5692920	Do you think there's truth to that statement
5692920	5695480	being a really, really important question for us to answer?
5695480	5696520	Yes.
5696520	5697360	Yes.
5697360	5698840	And what's the answer?
5698840	5700760	I think the answer is yes.
5700760	5702760	And I think Camus answered it.
5702760	5703840	Yes, too.
5703840	5707040	You know, I love his writing and,
5708040	5712040	you know, I think there was a streak of nihilism
5712040	5715400	that I think grew in his writing over the years
5715400	5718320	and the thought is, I think that Camus died by suicide.
5718320	5721560	I think we're not sure of that because it was a car accident.
5721560	5725400	But I've always read that as the primary scholarly opinion.
5725400	5727960	And I think it's interesting that after his death,
5727960	5730760	a book called The First Man was published,
5730760	5732760	which I don't know if he had intended to publish.
5732760	5734280	I don't remember the specifics about it,
5734280	5736560	but it's about him as a child, right?
5736560	5738000	And it's interesting, The First Man,
5738000	5741320	even he was the first man in his existence, right?
5741320	5744240	The most, you know, the one that felt and experienced
5744240	5747640	everything and there's sadness and distress
5747640	5750840	and all in that book, but there's a beauty of life
5750840	5752320	and living and experience.
5752320	5756800	And I think to compare that beauty, like that's life,
5756800	5758880	even if something's difficult and scary and sad,
5758880	5760480	like there's something beautiful around the corner
5760480	5762840	and he's a kind person in the new discovery.
5762840	5765240	You know, more what was in him as a child.
5765280	5767960	And I think that we can get jaded as we get.
5767960	5769520	As you and I were just talking about a few minutes ago,
5769520	5772200	we can accentuate the negative and foster the negative
5772200	5775960	and come to a place where we're looking for
5775960	5778520	some in-depth philosophical answer, you know,
5778520	5781360	some thick book, you know, that's gonna explain all that
5781360	5783920	to us instead of the simplicity
5783920	5785640	that we've been talking about.
5785640	5790640	I think humility, gratitude helps us have just simple,
5791280	5793480	positive experiences, feelings of contentment,
5793480	5795320	feelings of connection with another person,
5795320	5796680	learning, discovery.
5796680	5799280	And I think the answer to Keimu's question is yes.
5799280	5803320	And I think it lies in his writing about when he was a child,
5803320	5805960	which I think he saw as less important
5805960	5808800	than his later writings and the intellectual heaviness
5808800	5812360	when I think maybe he had lost his way a little bit
5812360	5814880	from the things he understood when he was younger.
5814880	5816880	So another way to talk about it,
5816880	5819760	and I'd love to hear what you think is
5819760	5822480	about these broad categories.
5823320	5825360	Let me be started with Kierkegaard
5825360	5829000	of existentialism, absurdism, and nihilism.
5829000	5832200	And I think Keimu considered himself an absurdist,
5832200	5833800	not actually an existentialist.
5833800	5836880	It's kind of a middle ground where I think existentialist,
5839320	5841120	I don't wanna characterize it in the wrong way
5841120	5842520	and there's a lot of different definitions,
5842520	5847160	but I think existentialists ultimately do think
5847160	5851320	that there is meaning in sort of pursuing
5851320	5853360	the passion of life, like pursuing the mode,
5853360	5857240	like in living life, that's where you discover the meaning
5857240	5861680	at that individual level of fully embracing life.
5862920	5867080	And I think sort of nihilism is again,
5867080	5868080	it's kind of like a spectrum,
5868080	5872040	but nihilism basically says there's no meaning
5873160	5876600	and it doesn't matter, nothing matters.
5877560	5880920	I don't even know, but somehow that lands you in a place
5880920	5882920	that's totally uninspired.
5882920	5885560	Maybe nihilists would disagree with that.
5885560	5888320	Maybe there's a way to live a creative life
5888320	5890280	in a nihilistic mindset.
5890280	5894560	And I think absurdism is somewhere in the middle
5894560	5899560	where pursuing meaning at all is not a good idea.
5902400	5903960	So kind of, I think existentialists say
5903960	5905600	you should be looking for meaning
5905600	5908120	and it's to be discovered in your own actions,
5908120	5910200	in your own life in the moment.
5910200	5914480	And absurdism says life is absurd, nothing makes sense.
5914480	5917640	Don't look for the meaning, just live, just be.
5917640	5922640	I think that's kind of the later Camus kind of philosophy.
5923080	5924360	I don't know if you can sort of comment
5924360	5927400	on these kind of nuanced ideas here
5927400	5932400	if there is no religious guide to your life.
5934240	5936860	What do you think about this kind of search for meaning?
5936860	5938520	Do you see that there's some wisdom
5938520	5941680	in the existentialist perspective of discovering it
5941680	5943760	in your own life and this passion
5943760	5946280	and this kind of day-to-day existence
5946280	5948200	in the moments of your life that bring you joy,
5948200	5949040	that kind of thing.
5949040	5950800	Bringing different sort of perspectives
5950800	5952240	and trying to tease apart like, well, wait,
5952240	5954520	what are the differences in those perspectives?
5954520	5957120	And I think what it points out is that,
5957120	5959800	okay, we tend to conflate things as human beings
5959800	5961160	and to take two different things
5961160	5962760	and try and make them into one.
5962760	5964880	But we also, I think on the other end of the spectrum
5964880	5967040	get very overly reductionist.
5967040	5970400	And I think that when we get to overly reductionist,
5970400	5972440	we lose the ability to learn from anything
5972440	5973480	or to generate meaning, right?
5973480	5975080	I mean, the thing about Sartre,
5975080	5977200	who is the thought of existentialism
5977200	5978680	is so consistent with him, right?
5978680	5983200	Who on the one hand, wrote about very clear terms,
5983200	5984680	like this is what it is and this is what it isn't.
5984680	5986040	And here's how you're gonna make your meaning
5986040	5988840	in a very like academically proscribed way.
5988840	5992400	But he also wrote short stories like The Wall, right?
5992400	5994960	Where there's something totally absurd happens, right?
5994960	5996440	As part of the story, right?
5996480	5998800	So I think what ends up happening
5998800	6000320	is people either reduce themselves
6000320	6002240	or get associated with something
6002240	6004240	that by being overly reductionist
6004240	6006000	takes us away from meaning, right?
6006000	6008720	The idea that, look, we don't know
6008720	6012320	if there is an overarching religious meaning
6012320	6014720	or what we call a religious meaning or purpose.
6014720	6016920	Like we don't know that, right?
6016920	6018800	So, okay, if we take that as a given
6018800	6021560	that people who say that they know are having faith,
6021560	6023160	like Al Spinoza described faith, right?
6023160	6027200	Faith is that you don't know, but you believe anyway, right?
6027200	6030840	It's not because you have faith now you know something, right?
6030840	6032920	Because I think that's a slippery slope
6032920	6035280	to the persecution of others, right?
6035280	6038600	So if we say, okay, we don't know,
6038600	6041440	then, you know, we're left either deciding,
6041440	6043760	okay, well then the hell with everything, you know?
6043760	6046320	Like there's that movie, a strange brew, right?
6046320	6047920	That Bob and Doug McKenzie were like,
6047920	6049600	the brakes don't work on the car.
6049600	6052160	And one of them says, oh, why bother steering, right?
6052160	6053680	So if we don't know that there's meaning,
6053680	6054520	like why bother steering?
6054520	6056000	Let's just give up the ghost, right?
6056000	6058240	And I don't think that's even what the nihilist said.
6058240	6059880	I mean, I think the Coonan said,
6059880	6062800	we should get rid of everything that we've ever created
6062800	6064600	except Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
6064600	6066240	and start over from there.
6066240	6068360	But so even people who are very nihilistic
6068360	6070120	or associated with that,
6070120	6072600	a lot of them were just not liking what we had built, right?
6072600	6075760	So if we accept that a lot of what we have built
6075760	6077800	as humans inside of us and outside of us
6077800	6080080	is really counterproductive and doesn't help us.
6080120	6083160	And that absurd things happen in the world, right?
6083160	6086200	And that often the way social structures and systems build up,
6086200	6088080	you build themselves up is absurd.
6088080	6090160	I think our healthcare system operates
6090160	6092160	in a way that's absurd, right?
6092160	6094560	So if we accept that there are absurdities
6094560	6096640	that we don't know if there's truth,
6096640	6097840	then what are we left with?
6097840	6100840	But like, well, let's try and make meaning, right?
6100840	6102760	Or Tega Igasset said,
6102760	6104840	yoso yo e mi circunstancia, right?
6104840	6106920	I'm myself in my circumstances, right?
6106920	6109240	He was like, look, we can't control everything.
6109240	6112000	We live in circumstances around us,
6112000	6114120	but within those circumstances,
6114120	6118080	we can make decisions and define ourselves.
6118080	6119760	And I think the brilliance of that,
6119760	6121920	and I think tying it all together, right?
6121920	6124160	In a way that's not trying to be,
6124160	6125360	in a sense it ties it all together
6125360	6128280	by not trying to answer everything concisely,
6128280	6129960	that yes, we can make meaning.
6129960	6132600	Like we see that if someone trips in front of me,
6132600	6134440	I could walk around them or I could help them up.
6134440	6137840	I mean, no one can tell me that it doesn't matter what I do.
6137960	6139960	I absolutely reject the idea that,
6139960	6142280	oh, I could step over them or on them,
6142280	6144120	or I could help them up and it doesn't matter.
6144120	6147360	Oh yeah, try being the person on the ground, right?
6147360	6151600	So we create meaning, but we live in our circumstances
6151600	6154200	and there are absurdities both within us
6154200	6156480	and outside of us in our social structures.
6156480	6157400	And there are a lot of things
6157400	6160080	that pretend to have meaning that don't.
6160080	6162120	And there's the shades of nihilism,
6162120	6164360	but ultimately there's something going on here
6164360	6165640	that's doing the best we can
6165680	6167440	in the context of just not knowing.
6168600	6170600	Yeah, I tend to see, I don't know if it's genetic,
6170600	6173880	I tend to think just observing the internet,
6173880	6175400	the number of memes there are.
6176920	6178960	I think many other people are like me.
6178960	6182000	I tend to see the humor in the absurdity.
6182000	6184000	I tend to enjoy it from that kind of angle.
6184000	6186400	I see the Kafkaesque nature of society,
6186400	6187960	different aspects of society,
6187960	6191400	and just kind of notice the magic with a smile.
6192400	6195880	And just laugh at the circus of it all.
6195880	6199000	Cause it is magical that the circus all comes together.
6199000	6200160	It's like a little bit out of sync
6200160	6202440	and then just a guy playing trombone,
6202440	6204360	but like overall it's pretty good.
6204360	6205400	It's pretty good.
6205400	6208400	And we can look at that and just kind of marvel go, huh.
6208400	6212560	Which I think is a relation to at least a lot of what we
6212560	6214680	in the Western world think of as Eastern,
6214680	6216400	is like as non-attachment, right?
6216400	6218640	Because then if there's something absurd,
6218640	6221320	and it's like not good for me,
6221320	6222640	then I accept that too,
6222640	6224000	instead of getting angry about it,
6224000	6224840	and railing about it,
6224840	6227160	or seeing some cosmic meaning in it, right?
6227160	6229120	I think there's also a healthy non-attachment
6229120	6230640	in what you're saying too.
6230640	6233440	So there's a, I mean, you mentioned Eastern thought.
6233440	6235760	There's, just to ask in each year,
6235760	6240480	but also Buddha have kind of spoke of life as suffering.
6240480	6242020	Do you think there's truth to that?
6242020	6246120	That suffering is a fundamental part of life.
6246120	6248680	I think it is a fundamental part of life.
6248680	6251840	I don't think that means that life is suffering, right?
6251840	6254800	If we say, well, life is suffering, then what am I doing?
6254800	6256760	That I'm trying to erase from my mind
6256760	6258480	like the birth of my children, right?
6258480	6260760	Things that were filled with joy, right?
6260760	6263520	Like life is not entirely suffering,
6263520	6266080	but life brings a lot of suffering.
6266080	6267000	And for some people,
6267000	6269720	it brings such disproportionate suffering
6269720	6271520	and the people don't survive the suffering.
6271520	6274680	And I think when people are conscientious and empathic,
6274680	6276800	that really bothers us, right?
6276800	6278080	The suffering in our own lives
6278080	6280240	and the fact that others at times could,
6280240	6282480	could it seem to be so overwhelmed by suffering
6282480	6285120	that they don't even get a chance to see good.
6285120	6286600	And I think that there's,
6286600	6288120	I do think there's truth to that
6288120	6290360	and there's sadness and distress to that,
6290360	6292960	but to say therefore life is suffering,
6292960	6294880	I think is completely untrue.
6294880	6297000	And, you know, it ignores the fact
6297000	6298600	that someone even made a trombone, right?
6298600	6300240	Let alone that there's a little bit out of sync
6300240	6302520	and someone's playing the trombone, like that's cool.
6302520	6305400	There's, you know, there's elements of the absurd
6305400	6307040	that you said are neat and interesting.
6307040	6310680	And if we start accepting that we can't understand
6310680	6312120	or control everything,
6312120	6315200	then we can accept and I think really love
6315200	6318520	and foster the beauty in our lives.
6318520	6321560	Yeah, I think the word suffering
6321560	6324120	is doing a little bit too much work.
6324120	6325320	Because I think it's probably referring
6325320	6328000	to the philosophical concept of that,
6329160	6331880	yeah, there's the absurd, the absurdity.
6331880	6332720	Right.
6332720	6334880	That stuff just happens randomly.
6334880	6337920	Evil people succeed, good people fail.
6337920	6341560	There's a seeming random injustice on occasion.
6341560	6342400	Right.
6342400	6344680	And on occasion there's justice in,
6345720	6348280	yeah, all of it that feels like,
6349400	6352960	and maybe because often there's a lot of loss
6352960	6357960	and then there's a kind of matching complimentary aspect
6359200	6362640	to any good feeling that all comes crashing down,
6362640	6364200	like every hello.
6365000	6368080	From a physics perspective, ends in a goodbye.
6373200	6374800	That's a really sad thing,
6374800	6379800	like of all the amazing people I get to meet in my life,
6380280	6383560	all the amazing experiences eventually they have to end.
6383560	6386200	And that's part of what makes them amazing.
6386200	6387840	But why is that sad?
6387840	6390360	Is it because we're taught to think that it's like,
6390360	6392360	look, at some point you and I are gonna say goodbye today.
6392360	6393840	Like I hope we're richer for it.
6393880	6395760	And then we take that goodness off with us.
6395760	6398200	Like I wanna celebrate that
6398200	6399880	because it's all part of the goodness.
6399880	6401680	I think we're taught to think, oh, that's so bad.
6401680	6403720	And it equates to death and misery.
6403720	6407480	And I think it's often not that way.
6407480	6408680	I think there is a sadness too,
6408680	6413440	but I also don't think that sadness is a negative thing.
6413440	6416320	It's a different way to celebrate a beautiful thing.
6416320	6418320	So there's a melancholic nature to it,
6418320	6421200	there's something passing of it leaving.
6421200	6423640	I think it's that old Louis C.K. thing
6423640	6427080	that I go back to over and over from his show, Louis,
6427080	6431200	where he was all heartbroken,
6431200	6436200	that he just broke up with somebody he loved.
6436480	6439000	And he told about that to an old man.
6439000	6441720	And the old man said, you're a fool.
6441720	6442920	That's the best part.
6442920	6446560	I miss that part where you sort of are lingering
6446560	6449000	in that loss, you're feeling the pain of that loss.
6449000	6452240	Because that lasts the longer, it's the most intense,
6452240	6453760	it's the most reliable.
6453760	6457040	And it's the kind of celebration of the love you had.
6457040	6461760	Like losing the love is still a celebration of the love.
6463240	6465960	I think you don't wanna over romanticize that,
6465960	6468280	but there's some aspect of truth to that.
6468280	6471920	Like that melancholic feeling of remembering
6471920	6474720	a beautiful time that's no longer there
6474720	6477360	is a kind of celebration of it.
6477360	6479360	And is a kind of joyful experience,
6479360	6484360	even though it's very easy to experience it
6484760	6486280	as a negative emotion.
6486280	6487560	I think it's just like you said,
6487560	6489440	I mean, it's up to our mind to determine
6489440	6491320	how that emotions really felt.
6491320	6492440	But it's a tricky one,
6492440	6494280	because it's like heartbreak to experience that
6494280	6495400	as a positive thing.
6495400	6497120	People can reminisce at funerals, right?
6497120	6499800	And laugh, because people can be very, very, very sad
6499800	6503240	and perceive that this person has died
6503240	6505040	and perceive the sadness of it.
6505040	6508000	But in perceiving that and really living in it,
6508000	6510840	then you can have people who wanna remember that person
6510840	6512680	by like telling a funny story.
6512680	6513520	Why?
6513520	6515320	Because each of those people carries that with them.
6515320	6518080	So I think what you're saying is consistent
6518080	6520320	with healthy function as human beings,
6520320	6522440	because we're gonna encounter sadness and loss.
6522440	6524400	Like what do we do with that, right?
6524400	6527280	And do we do things that ultimately create some redemption
6527280	6529560	or even reparation inside of us?
6529560	6532400	And like reparation is a big word in psychology, right?
6532400	6534200	It's how we repair damage and loss.
6534200	6536320	So if we lose someone and we're sad,
6536320	6538800	can we by telling funny stories
6538800	6540440	about that person remind ourselves
6540440	6541760	that, hey, they're still inside of us,
6541760	6543360	whether they're out there looking at me, I don't know,
6543360	6545760	but I can call that person to mind inside of us.
6545760	6548280	And then we have something that's good and beautiful
6548280	6549440	that comes of that too.
6551040	6555280	In the introduction to your book on trauma,
6555280	6558120	Lady Gaga wrote it, she wrote the forward the intro.
6559360	6561520	She said this about you, quote,
6561520	6563520	I can now say with certainty
6563520	6566280	that this man saved my life.
6566280	6569160	He made life worth living.
6569160	6571160	This goes to our discussion about
6572160	6576400	the the myth of Sisyphus Kamu question about why I live.
6577600	6579600	So I think at least to me,
6579600	6583160	she's one of the most brilliant and unique artists ever.
6583160	6587400	So it's a difficult question, but a question of creativity.
6587400	6589560	What role does trauma play
6590560	6594720	in somebody like that, in this artist
6594720	6597840	that has created some incredible things?
6597840	6602840	What positive, constructive role does trauma serve
6604920	6608160	and what limiting role does it serve
6608160	6610960	in preventing that person from flourishing more?
6610960	6615720	Trauma can certainly drive us to creativity, right?
6615720	6618960	To even to push against or to protest against
6619040	6621080	what the trauma tells us.
6621080	6623280	Trauma tells us lessons like nothing matters
6623280	6625720	and you don't matter and nothing will ever be good
6625720	6627400	and then nothing is beautiful
6627400	6630000	and we can push against trauma.
6630000	6631240	They know there is life in me.
6631240	6632600	There's something, there's goodness for me
6632600	6635520	to spread in the world, to express and spread.
6635520	6639760	So I think trauma fuels creativity in many, many, many ways.
6639760	6642320	Trauma also shuts down creativity, right?
6642320	6645400	To people who are, for one example,
6645400	6647440	trauma that escalates to the point
6647440	6649960	where now the person is soothing it with alcohol,
6649960	6652560	one example, and now the impact of the alcohol
6652560	6654040	shuts down any creativity.
6654040	6658680	So can people be creative and outward thinking without trauma?
6658680	6660640	I think sometimes, if I remember correctly,
6660640	6662720	people will use Immanuel Kant as an example,
6662720	6664360	someone I think hadn't traveled much,
6664360	6666040	didn't have trauma and like look at what he knew.
6666040	6667960	So okay, there are gonna be exceptions, right?
6667960	6671840	But a lot of our creativity is in some ways
6671840	6673400	fueled by our suffering,
6673400	6674840	although it's complicated
6674840	6677120	because it comes from generative places in us, right?
6677120	6678280	So those places are there,
6678280	6680080	they're not created by suffering,
6680080	6682800	but maybe suffering makes an incentive
6682800	6684960	or a passion inside of us.
6684960	6688440	And a person, Stephanie, who you referred to
6688440	6693180	is just such an incredible astounding creative force.
6693180	6695200	And sure, some of that comes from trauma,
6695200	6697940	some of it comes from trauma fueling
6697940	6700640	the generative creative places in her.
6700640	6702040	But what I helped her to do,
6702040	6703640	she's very generous with her words,
6703640	6708640	but what I helped her to do was to see all that she is
6708840	6711160	and all that the creativity in her is
6711160	6716160	and all that there is to create through love and caring
6716320	6720720	and compassion and to again see that.
6720720	6723320	I mean, a lot of time that's what I'm doing clinically.
6723320	6724720	I think it's what good psychiatrists
6724720	6726680	or mental health professionals do is
6726680	6729680	we help people see the beauty that is there, right?
6729680	6733120	Because oftentimes we're way too close up to that tapestry.
6733120	6735760	And what brings us close is often the sad thing.
6735760	6738360	So we're up close and all we see is the negative.
6738360	6741200	I mean, it's easy then to get classically nihilistic,
6741200	6743760	but by helping someone take a step back
6743760	6746680	and to see who they are and what's in them,
6746680	6748320	that's how people get better
6748320	6751360	and it's how people re-engage in life.
6751360	6753360	It's such a difficult thing
6753360	6758160	because if you were to, from studying human beings,
6758160	6760600	it seems like the optimal trajectory
6761600	6764840	is having some trauma that doesn't destroy you
6766400	6770480	that forces you early in life to really struggle
6770480	6773920	with the intricacies of the human condition.
6773920	6776480	And then later in life, as you form
6776480	6779880	and like you build an expertise around in mastery,
6779880	6782200	start to do exactly what you said,
6782200	6784560	which is step back and look at the tapestry.
6784560	6788560	So if you don't have the trauma,
6788680	6790680	it seems like just empirically speaking,
6790680	6792600	there's of course just a huge amount of data
6792600	6795360	and all kinds of anecdotal evidence,
6795360	6797880	but I'm gonna be careful here
6797880	6802600	because maybe I'm romanticizing hardship,
6802600	6805880	but it does seem that hardship in childhood,
6805880	6808480	if it doesn't break you, can be constructive.
6808480	6811440	It's like you said, having that trauma,
6811440	6813880	one of the ways to fight it is to say,
6813880	6816360	I am worth something, I am,
6816360	6820920	and this is, David Gages talks about this,
6820920	6825920	it's like, I am somebody, I can't be somebody special
6826520	6828640	and I'm gonna prove it to you, I'm gonna do this,
6828640	6829920	I'm gonna do this big thing,
6829920	6832240	it's this engine that drives you forward.
6832240	6836440	Yeah, comment on that because from a parent's perspective,
6836440	6841440	you want a child to have an easy life, right?
6842640	6845280	You want them to not have hardship,
6845320	6849400	certainly not have trauma, but that's such a difficult dance
6849400	6853440	because in some ways, a little bit of hardship
6854440	6857320	and a gradually increasing amount of hardship
6857320	6859760	that doesn't break you can really develop you
6859760	6863800	into a really interesting, complicated person
6863800	6866680	and it helps you flourish as a creative being.
6866680	6869120	I don't know if there's a question there,
6869120	6871080	I just keep saying random things.
6871080	6874680	No, it makes, look, I think it makes good sense to me,
6874680	6876080	I think you're trying to get at,
6876080	6879840	look, we need trauma and how are we defining it, right?
6879840	6882880	Because we say trauma, hardship, difficulties,
6882880	6885840	I mean, we could set aside, we could set apart,
6885840	6889040	say, and differentiate things that are difficult
6889040	6891160	but that are overcomeable, right?
6891160	6893800	Versus things that we could use trauma,
6893800	6896200	the word trauma this way, if we chose to,
6896200	6898000	that are just entirely negative,
6898000	6902240	like someone saying, oh, you can't do that
6902240	6903840	and you'll never succeed because,
6903840	6905720	well, and then they tell you something about yourself,
6905720	6906560	because you're from here
6906560	6908680	or you're this race, religion, whatever it is, right?
6908680	6911480	We say, well, you know, that could make someone say,
6911480	6913800	hey, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna overcome, right?
6913800	6916920	But then they're overcoming something bad, right?
6916920	6918320	Like it's just like, there's nothing good
6918320	6919560	or helpful about that, right?
6919560	6920400	If someone's saying that,
6920400	6922160	so the person has to overcome it.
6922160	6924120	That's different than something
6924120	6926200	that is placed in front of a person
6926200	6931200	where the whole conception of it is something positive
6931560	6934320	that you can make through effort, right?
6934320	6936520	So, you know, I remember, I don't know,
6936520	6938600	I think I was 15 years old, there was some rule
6938600	6940240	like where you could then go,
6940240	6942440	I don't think it was picking raspberries or blueberries, right?
6942440	6944400	And I think, and my parents wanted me to see, like,
6944400	6945960	okay, go see how that works as you.
6945960	6947920	And now you got 50 cents at the end of it, right?
6947920	6949760	And then you think about that when, you know,
6949760	6952600	you wanna buy baseball cars or you think about it
6952600	6955560	and you work hard and I could remember like it was hard
6955560	6958040	and I was sweating and I was tired and,
6958040	6959280	but I learned from it.
6959280	6960880	I mean, it's the reason I remember it today.
6961440	6963720	So, yes, parents might want their kids to have like
6963720	6964560	a good life, right?
6964560	6966640	But not necessarily an easy life, you know?
6966640	6969000	And I think that was done,
6969000	6970440	they took me to do that to,
6970440	6972160	so I had a greater sense of responsibility
6972160	6974080	in a sense of like hard work is meaningful
6974080	6974920	and it's important.
6974920	6978320	And I think that that kind of thing is good,
6978320	6980400	but if we separate that from something
6980400	6982560	that's just denigrating, prejudicial,
6982560	6984400	like I think those things aren't good,
6984400	6985760	but they're unavoidable.
6985760	6988400	So it's not necessarily that, oh, is some trauma good?
6988400	6990680	I would look at it more that some trauma is unavoidable.
6990680	6993400	I mean, it's hard to go, how do you go through life
6993400	6996400	and not have any losses or anything negative
6996400	6998080	or anything sad.
6998080	6999080	And then people are people,
6999080	7001080	there may be people who have not a lot of that
7001080	7002840	and then there's a sort of complacency
7002840	7004840	and they don't do it as much as they could
7004840	7006200	or feel as good as they could.
7006200	7007360	You know, then there's other people
7007360	7009080	who have a highly attuned emotional,
7009080	7012400	is there people with very highly attuned emotional compasses
7012400	7016000	for which a little bit of trauma becomes so intrusive.
7016000	7018360	So it's so much of it is person driven,
7018360	7020200	but I do want to distinguish between things
7020200	7023160	that are just purely bad that we might overcome
7023160	7024840	or find some fire in our belly about
7024840	7026320	or whatever the case may be.
7026320	7028760	And things that may be boundaries or barriers
7028760	7031880	either directly purposely placed or not,
7031880	7035280	that in a sense, invite us or inform us
7035280	7037560	of the possibility of striving and overcoming.
7038520	7040640	Finally, in tuned emotional compasses,
7040640	7044960	it's so true that there is, that's a component of it too.
7044960	7047960	It's, there's almost genetic,
7048040	7050400	how sensitive you are to particular trauma.
7050400	7052680	So little things can have a huge impact
7052680	7057320	or gigantic things, serious abuse in childhood
7057320	7060960	can be by some people overcome more easily.
7060960	7062480	It's not just what's the trauma.
7062480	7064800	It's what's the trauma that makes certain problems.
7064800	7066760	You have to match the trauma to the person.
7066760	7069680	And a big part of what you're matching to is that,
7069680	7071480	you know, genetically based characteristic
7071480	7074880	of how finely attuned is that empathic attunement
7074880	7075720	to that compass.
7075760	7078840	So when you think about, just return to childhood,
7078840	7080840	when you think about trauma and childhood,
7084840	7089840	what can we say about the impact of child abuse
7090880	7093280	on the development of a human being?
7093280	7098280	I think the impact of it is so disproportionately bad
7098960	7103960	and hurtful compared to things that happen
7106400	7107560	when we're not children.
7107560	7109960	And I wanna be very careful about how I'm saying that
7109960	7113320	because people can, through their strength
7113320	7116800	and resilience and human interconnectedness
7116800	7118200	can overcome that.
7118200	7122200	I don't mean to say that anyone who's experienced
7122200	7125960	those things is can't make it through it or over it.
7125960	7128120	That part is not true.
7128200	7131880	But it is true that the impact is so disproportionate
7131880	7133560	to anything else that can happen
7133560	7135920	because the brain is formulating, right?
7135920	7140760	So if we say psychology is like applied neurobiology, right?
7140760	7145760	And we look at both of those as different ends, right?
7145880	7147840	Even though there's a lot of gray in the middle,
7147840	7150480	you know, the neurobiology is changed.
7150480	7155160	So just one example of a much greater salience
7155160	7160160	of vigilance mechanisms, of mechanisms of self-protection,
7160680	7164720	mechanisms that can make a person feel more fear
7164720	7167600	and more insecurity and hide themselves away from the world
7167600	7168960	and not trust the world.
7168960	7171600	And I mean, I mean, not trust the world even enough
7171600	7173600	that, oh, I'd like to have a better job
7173600	7176560	and another one is here that I could take,
7176560	7178280	but maybe it could be worse.
7178280	7179920	You know, and then being afraid of that, right?
7179920	7181520	Like there are all sorts of ways
7181520	7186000	in which the changes to those pathways impact someone.
7186000	7187960	And that's just one of, you know,
7187960	7189760	we could bring trauma experts together
7189760	7191440	that could talk about that for days, right?
7191440	7194080	Like what is the impact upon the brain biology?
7194080	7197680	So that then gets changed inside the person.
7197680	7200080	And from the perspective of those changes,
7200080	7201920	the psychology on top of it changes.
7201920	7203320	Like what do I think about myself?
7203320	7205000	Do I think that I'm worthwhile?
7205000	7206680	You know, even in my mid-20s,
7206680	7210040	after, you know, without formative traumas
7210240	7213080	and a pretty strong sense of self and some achievements,
7213080	7216160	there's a big trauma then with the death of my brother
7216160	7218240	and I start questioning, am I cursed?
7218240	7219520	Am I worth anything?
7219520	7220960	I mean, I was 20-something years old
7220960	7223800	and doing reasonably well at the time.
7223800	7228800	You know, how does this impact a child of six, seven,
7229360	7231840	10, 12 years old, right?
7231840	7234360	We're sending such powerful messages
7234360	7237440	that then change conception of self
7237440	7239880	and that negatively change conception
7239880	7242440	sits upon the negatively changed neurobiology.
7242440	7244400	And I think if we really thought,
7244400	7246880	hey, let's do the best we can just for humans in general,
7246880	7248800	for the human race, for our species in general,
7248800	7251080	is we would handle children
7251080	7254240	and caring for children so much differently
7254240	7257600	in terms of protection mechanisms, intervention mechanisms.
7257600	7259120	How many times do you see where,
7259120	7261400	where like there's now there's been some tragedy
7261400	7263560	and the child gets a little bit of support
7263560	7266120	and you know, they had some therapy, you know,
7266120	7268920	that was provided by some insurance carrier,
7268960	7272720	you know, that they got once a week for 16 weeks or whatever.
7272720	7276600	I mean, we should be wrapping our societal resources
7276600	7280440	around children, but we don't use our resources well.
7280440	7281280	You know, I was just reading,
7281280	7282200	it's a little bit of an aside,
7282200	7286040	but about 300 and something billion dollars a year
7286040	7290480	in cost to the U.S. economy, just from schizophrenia.
7290480	7293720	And you think, and it cost a fraction,
7293720	7296120	what do we actually put into caring for people
7296120	7297400	who have schizophrenia?
7297400	7299760	So first there's a moral imperative,
7299760	7301200	but let's say we put that aside
7301200	7303920	and we only care about the economy, right?
7303920	7306080	Because there are mechanisms of thinking
7306080	7306920	that look at it that way.
7306920	7309600	How could we not amend that, right?
7309600	7312600	But we are so reckless with our resources
7312600	7314400	and we're tripping ahead of ourselves
7314400	7316320	that we don't think, oh my goodness,
7316320	7319560	there is no better place on God's earth for prevention
7319560	7322960	than here, prevention in terms of human suffering
7322960	7325280	and also where do people like that go?
7325280	7327320	I mean, more often people like that
7327320	7329000	go to a place of increased suffering,
7329000	7330680	inability to take care of themselves
7330680	7333400	or to be in supportive relationships.
7333400	7335680	Okay, we know there's a higher prevalence of that,
7335680	7338160	but we're also creating the pool of people
7338160	7341680	through which the envy, the narcissism,
7341680	7344880	the sociopathy, the destruction arises.
7344880	7347000	So again, if we care about people,
7347000	7349440	we would be so focused on that.
7349440	7351240	If we don't care about other people
7351240	7353200	and just ourselves or just economic costs,
7353200	7354880	we would still be so focused,
7354880	7358560	but we're not and we tend to just kind of call it good
7358560	7361440	because we don't see anything disastrous happening
7361440	7362280	at the moment.
7363280	7365760	And I think there's a societal negligence there
7365760	7367360	to the shame really of all of us
7368840	7372480	when child abuse and the impact neurobiologically
7372480	7376040	and psychologically is potentially the greatest cause
7376040	7377880	of suffering directly and indirectly
7377880	7379160	on the face of the planet.
7380160	7384840	How much this trauma of that kind
7384840	7386840	and later in life affect your ability
7386840	7388960	to love another human being,
7388960	7390840	say inside a relationship,
7390840	7393400	connect with another human being?
7393400	7394880	It can impact it a lot.
7394880	7397160	And I wanna say, can people overcome
7397160	7400800	and be as loving to a partner or a child or anyone else?
7400800	7403800	Yes, but we're talking across society,
7403800	7405720	how are we setting the odds, right?
7405760	7409160	We're setting the odds towards a higher sense of vigilance,
7409160	7411680	a decreased sense of self-confidence,
7411680	7414280	an increased sense of vulnerability, right?
7414280	7416680	Decrease comfort interacting with others, right?
7416680	7419320	What we're doing is we're pushing towards isolation
7419320	7421840	and misery and depression and resentment.
7421840	7424440	I mean, those factors push towards that.
7424440	7426560	We know that the research is so strong
7426560	7429200	that adverse childhood experiences
7429200	7430840	of these things that happen,
7430840	7433600	the more the worse, the more prolonged,
7433600	7436040	the more that person is up against
7436040	7439440	as they try and navigate life.
7439440	7443280	And I suppose one of the elements of intimacy
7443280	7446480	like what we're talking about is vulnerability.
7446480	7451480	And maybe there's a, is there a fear of being vulnerable,
7451920	7454280	of being hurt again?
7454280	7457360	Is that ultimately the barrier to intimacy?
7457360	7459280	Yeah, if you're taught a lesson that says
7459280	7461480	the world is not safe
7461480	7464320	and you're not good enough for someone to keep safe
7464320	7467320	and you're not strong enough to keep yourself safe,
7467320	7468920	that's a final common pathway
7468920	7471920	of the vast majority of child abuse
7471920	7474160	or as it's telling those lessons to people,
7474160	7478720	then how can that not change the lay of the land
7478720	7481840	against openness, against the ability
7481840	7485440	to rationally consider trust and mutuality
7485440	7487600	and to protect oneself, but also take chances
7487600	7489920	and do the things that we have to do
7490160	7492800	to create the greatest happiness in our lives.
7492800	7496160	We set the odds so much against them.
7496160	7500360	There's another pathway which I think is really interesting
7500360	7504240	because I've seen it in people is this kind of ability
7504240	7508840	to detach yourself from feeling any emotions
7509800	7511640	to like protect yourself.
7511640	7514280	It's almost like you're not quite there.
7514280	7516440	Yeah, there's a word for this, isolation of affect.
7516440	7517880	This is a defense mechanism.
7517880	7519160	Yeah. Isolation of affect.
7519800	7521400	Is that a common way,
7521400	7525040	another common way to deal with trauma?
7525040	7528480	Well, isolation of affect can cut both ways.
7528480	7531040	So if there's been a major trauma,
7531040	7533120	let's say someone has seen something terrible
7533120	7535920	and they're isolated from their affect
7535920	7537160	and at one time it was thought,
7537160	7538400	well, maybe that's good, right?
7538400	7540600	They're not hysterical, they're not distraught,
7540600	7542480	but we see that is not good, right?
7542480	7546960	Because what needs to be beheld, processed,
7546960	7549080	we need to get our arms around in some way, shape, or form
7549080	7551520	has just been separated off, right?
7551520	7553800	So we know that is not good, right?
7553800	7557840	But isolation of affect can also serve us very well.
7557840	7561080	And when I think back to being an intern,
7561080	7562400	medical intern in the hospital,
7562400	7566920	and you might have to go and pronounce someone dead
7566920	7571200	with hysterical family members.
7571200	7574920	And then 10 minutes later, five minutes later,
7574920	7577120	maybe two minutes later, really,
7577160	7579280	you have to go to another room
7579280	7582800	and you've got to maybe do some procedure that involves
7582800	7585320	having your focus on a certain thing
7585320	7587320	and making sure your hand movements are the right way
7587320	7591040	or talking to a person in a way that's very different
7591040	7593120	than where you just came from, that's very hopeful.
7593120	7595560	And so then you have to isolate the affect
7595560	7596960	of what's going on around you.
7596960	7600000	And it happens not just in, it's just one example,
7600000	7601960	but we have to do it in life
7601960	7605840	so that we can put affect aside to process later
7605880	7608280	or not feel the full weight of affect
7608280	7609480	where we know the meaning,
7609480	7611040	like I know the meaning of the tragedy
7611040	7613040	of the person I just pronounced dead,
7613040	7614760	but I wanna separate that for myself
7614760	7616760	because I'm also aware that it's not my tragedy
7616760	7619320	so that I can then, okay, put that affect aside
7619320	7621040	and go do the next thing that I have to do.
7621040	7623580	So that I think can cut both ways.
7624800	7628440	Right, but then you have to reattach it,
7628440	7631360	understand that it's good to be close with emotion,
7631360	7634520	even painful emotion, right?
7634560	7636480	Because that's the human experience.
7636480	7640320	It's, I feel like if you build up a skill
7640320	7642760	that you can detach yourself from emotion,
7644000	7647280	I think that can become its own kind of addictive quality.
7647280	7649280	It can become too easy to do it, right?
7649280	7653360	And to reinforce, that's when people are suffering too much
7653360	7655800	over too long a period of time,
7655800	7658400	then we're creatures of habit, right?
7658400	7660200	And even though our brains are,
7660200	7662120	you can talk about our brains are sitting on the shoulders
7662120	7666080	of the giant of the maybe 1,000 levels of emergence
7666080	7667720	that come underneath of them.
7667720	7672000	Our brains are also working very simple habit-based ways.
7672000	7674240	Like if you and I chose a word right now
7674240	7676880	and said it 500 times, we would know.
7676880	7678380	It's just a silly experiment,
7678380	7681120	but we'd both be saying it tonight, right?
7681120	7683600	Because our brains are also creatures of habit.
7683600	7687580	So if you over and over and over have to isolate yourself
7687580	7689720	from affect and you develop those mechanisms,
7689720	7691560	well, you develop those mechanisms
7692160	7693720	then they don't go away any easier
7693720	7697240	than if we said the word 500 times and decided to forget.
7697240	7699240	We won't forget no matter what we decided.
7700440	7703080	So how do we find our way back?
7704160	7707280	How do we overcome trauma?
7707280	7708520	What are the different pathways?
7708520	7710640	The first thing, the very first thing
7710640	7715640	is to acknowledge to ourselves and often to others,
7715640	7717760	which might be one other person, it might be in words,
7717760	7722400	spoken, it might be written, what the trauma has been, right?
7722400	7727400	Because the lessons of trauma, the evil lessons of trauma.
7728040	7729640	I'll use the example of my own life,
7729640	7734360	the lesson that told me that I was shameful,
7734360	7737760	cursed and hopeless, right?
7737760	7740760	It's a very evil lesson, right?
7740760	7743360	But my brain will say it over and did say it
7743360	7745200	over and over and over to me.
7745200	7747520	And if that just sits inside,
7747520	7749000	that's how trauma festers,
7749000	7752360	that's how trauma hijacks our thoughts, our emotions.
7752360	7756080	So being able to say to ourselves and to another,
7756080	7758560	like this is what's happened, right?
7758560	7759640	Okay, this is what's happened.
7759640	7762600	We're built to massage words
7762600	7764400	and to create meaning through words, right?
7764400	7766040	Like we don't massage pictures, right?
7766040	7769160	Images, we talk and massage meaning with words.
7769160	7771960	So when I finally went to see a therapist
7771960	7774880	and I could say, you know,
7775880	7778240	my brother, whatever words I would have said,
7778240	7783240	like he killed himself and I can't accept it
7783240	7785600	or I can't imagine it and like I let it happen.
7785600	7787440	Like, so I had to say those things, right?
7787440	7791720	So then I could begin to bring some sense of truth to it,
7791720	7793560	you know, and I think it was a long time ago
7793560	7795200	but the therapist probably said something like,
7795200	7797440	okay, probably sees on you, you let it happen.
7797440	7798280	It's your fault, right?
7798280	7800000	Because you got to get at those things
7800000	7803760	so that one can begin to bring into focus
7803760	7807000	what does the trauma mean and what does it not mean?
7807000	7809160	I mean, a classic example is that,
7809160	7811000	what would you say to someone else example?
7811000	7812560	You know, you'll say, well, I,
7812560	7814160	how many times have I,
7814160	7816440	it's just, I could cry if I stop and think about it enough.
7816440	7818000	You have to stop and talk to someone
7818000	7821320	who is sexually assaulted through no fault of their own
7821320	7822880	who comes in and tells the story,
7822880	7825080	they've been telling themselves about how it's their fault.
7825080	7826240	They should have walked home a different way,
7826240	7827120	they should have addressed differently,
7827120	7828680	they should have left it earlier, right?
7828680	7831520	I wrote about it in the book over and over and over.
7831520	7834160	And they have a person who,
7834160	7836280	let's say you take a person who's intelligent,
7836280	7837960	engage in the world who's like capable
7837960	7839760	of understanding lots and lots and lots of things,
7839760	7842280	but doesn't understand that, right?
7842280	7843120	If it were someone else,
7843120	7844360	that person would understand in a moment,
7844360	7845600	that's not that person's fault, right?
7845600	7848760	So, what you want to do is overcome the fact
7848760	7850160	that the negative emotions,
7850160	7852840	that the hijacked emotion systems of trauma
7852840	7854720	are telling that person a lie
7854720	7859480	and they're telling them so strongly and so awfully,
7859480	7862440	so meanly that the person just takes it inside
7862440	7865600	and starts to see it as true, right?
7865600	7867720	So, you begin to hold that up to the light of day.
7867720	7869560	And again, one example could be, okay,
7869560	7871960	so someone, the person who's coming in next
7871960	7873640	has actually been through something similar, right?
7873640	7877920	And can you stay and just tell her how it's her fault, right?
7877920	7880280	And like, oh my God, no, I could never,
7880280	7882000	like then they see, right?
7882000	7883800	I mean, again, this is not always how you do it,
7883800	7886040	but sometimes you can get a person to see like,
7886040	7888400	well, that would be the most horrible.
7888440	7889640	How could you do that?
7889640	7891040	Right, and the person can maybe commit,
7891040	7892040	they're doing it to themselves.
7892040	7896480	So, you begin to put words in a structure and say,
7896480	7898440	okay, let's look at what's going on inside of you.
7898440	7899640	You don't have to be scared of anything
7899640	7900680	you're thinking and feeling.
7900680	7903920	In fact, the fear is in not exposing it
7903920	7904920	to the light of day.
7904920	7906680	That's where it gets the best of us.
7906680	7908880	And now, like everything is different.
7908880	7911720	And whether that involves use of medications
7911720	7913960	for intrusive thoughts and depression,
7913960	7916160	or there's no medicines needed, but it's all reframing,
7916280	7918840	whatever it may be that comes next,
7918840	7920800	the whole world has changed
7920800	7924160	when the person has acknowledged what's happened,
7924160	7928000	exposed it to themselves and to trust it,
7928000	7931520	others around them and begun to look at it in some way,
7931520	7936160	other than the stuff in an evil box place
7936160	7938680	that the trauma initially puts us through our,
7938680	7940520	the reflexes it creates in us.
7940520	7942080	It's interesting that there's powers
7942080	7943640	that you're saying it out loud.
7943640	7944600	Right.
7944600	7948520	So first saying your perception of it out loud,
7948520	7951120	other than in that case, that might be your fault.
7951120	7953920	And then working through out loud,
7953920	7957600	working through that it may not be.
7958400	7960640	Any experienced therapist will tell you this,
7960640	7963040	that every now and then it will happen
7963040	7966680	that someone will come and they'll say something.
7966680	7968760	Usually it's very early on in the process,
7968760	7970640	they'll say something they've never said before,
7970680	7975000	and they immediately are in an entirely different place
7975000	7977160	and they may have been for decades, right?
7977160	7979000	And I can remember a person saying
7979000	7982920	that the coach had raped him and just saying it.
7982920	7986920	This was decades before and everything was different.
7986920	7988800	I'm not saying everything is now as perfect,
7988800	7990000	but his life was in a different way.
7990000	7992760	As soon as he said it, he could see how daily he thought
7992760	7995240	that person did that to this child.
7995240	7996480	The child was me.
7996480	7998560	He'd never thought it until he said it out loud
7998560	8000040	because his mind was going over and over
8000440	8002720	with why it was his fault, what he did to deserve it,
8002720	8005920	how he kept going back, so it must be his fault.
8005920	8008080	It was as soon as he put words to it,
8008080	8009640	he saw the truth of it
8009640	8012920	and it was a bifurcation in the path of life then.
8012920	8015360	And any therapist has stories like that,
8015360	8016880	which just shows the immense power
8016880	8020320	that it can even be that just uttering the words
8020320	8024160	makes just a cascade of change all at once.
8024160	8026560	Just saying those words to another human being.
8027560	8031600	It makes you wonder what that compulsive loop
8031600	8033160	that happens in our heads
8035000	8037600	until it's brought to the surface.
8037600	8038840	It's so interesting.
8038840	8040640	Entirely non-productive the loops.
8040640	8043080	And sometimes even if we put, what would I say to another?
8043080	8044360	Let me write it down.
8044360	8046880	It can get rid of those loops in our brains.
8046880	8049560	Is it any even thought of outward expression
8049560	8051840	is the enemy of those internal
8051840	8054280	persecutory negative thought loops?
8054280	8055980	How do you find a good therapist?
8057560	8062360	I tend to think of, listen, I'm a fan of podcasts.
8062360	8063920	I'm a fan of conversations.
8063920	8065960	It feels like a, you know,
8065960	8069160	it's like finding a good friend or something.
8069160	8070760	It feels like a difficult journey.
8071760	8072760	Maybe I'm wrong in that,
8072760	8074600	but it just feels like such a,
8075920	8078560	it feels like a partnership, a journey together
8078560	8083560	versus like some very simple clinical procedure.
8084000	8085440	Well, the first thing I would say
8085440	8087720	is to change the entire paradigm.
8087720	8090000	Like most people like, okay, I need a therapist.
8090000	8092800	So people feel often like they're in a weakened position
8092800	8096040	because they need, you know, quote unquote, a therapist.
8096040	8098920	Then therapists are rationed, right?
8098920	8102120	I mean, how many insurance panels have lists
8102120	8104720	a mile long of qualified therapists
8104720	8107680	who could be on that insurance panel,
8107680	8109520	but there's a certification process.
8109520	8110600	Like these is making no sense, right?
8110600	8112760	The state's already certified the person, right?
8112760	8114440	But there's so many barriers to entry
8114440	8116920	that now we're rationing this resource,
8116920	8119080	which we should all stop and pause for a second
8119080	8121400	and think like we're okay with that as a society.
8121400	8123360	And by the way, everything else is like that too,
8123360	8125520	when we're trying to get help for our health.
8125520	8127880	So let's step back from that for a second.
8127880	8130920	Now it's a resource that's not in great supply.
8130920	8133400	And then a person begins to think, you know,
8133400	8134840	essentially I'll take what I can get.
8134840	8135760	Like I just gotta get somebody
8135760	8137960	and I don't know enough to know anyway, right?
8137960	8140600	And those are very disempowering thoughts
8140600	8142040	as opposed to saying, look,
8142040	8143680	I'm gonna be an empowered consumer
8143680	8147560	and I'm gonna need to choose someone who gets over
8147560	8148960	just some basic hurdles
8148960	8152040	of what I think are reasonable human interaction, right?
8152040	8153720	So like as a person making eye contact,
8153720	8155120	do they seem interested, right?
8155120	8157640	Like these are basic points about any human interaction,
8157640	8159440	including a therapist, right?
8159440	8161200	Then you can say, okay, is there a word of mouth?
8161200	8162360	Anyone else who has something good?
8162360	8164240	Nothing better than a word of mouth recommendation
8164240	8166000	from someone you trust, right?
8166000	8167880	Or anybody can have a good website,
8167880	8169200	but you say, let me look at the website.
8169200	8171200	What is it saying if there is one, right?
8171880	8175520	Does it resonate with me or not, right?
8175520	8176840	But after all of that,
8176840	8179040	then you go to see the person
8179040	8181760	with the idea that you're interviewing them, right?
8181760	8184000	The idea that, yeah, I hope this person can help me
8184000	8185840	and if so, great, I'm with the program,
8185840	8187160	but I'm thinking about it.
8187160	8188680	Do I want this person?
8188680	8189800	Do I feel heard?
8189800	8191560	Do I feel cared for?
8191560	8193440	Which doesn't mean, is it easy, right?
8193440	8194680	It might mean, is it hard?
8194680	8198720	And I leave and I feel like emotional for a couple of days
8198720	8201720	but I see that I'm facing new things.
8201720	8203800	No, this process of assessment
8203800	8206840	so that one isn't settling for something
8206840	8208960	that is formulaic over-packaged
8208960	8211240	and I'm not trying to be overly critical of therapists.
8211240	8213160	I mean, there are people everywhere who do their jobs well
8213160	8215280	and people who don't do their jobs well,
8215280	8218680	but most therapists are working in systems
8218680	8221800	that push against doing the job well, right?
8221800	8223040	Because they're rationing care
8223040	8224600	and there's a lot of number of sessions
8224600	8227120	and there's enough in such time before a person can return.
8227640	8229200	So often it's an uphill battle
8229200	8230960	because we're trying to be helped
8230960	8234320	within systems we've created and tolerate
8234320	8237640	that are pushing against helping us.
8239040	8243040	Yeah, but that interview process is tricky.
8243040	8245400	I mean, if you're in a rough place mentally,
8247160	8249280	just like with any kind of interview,
8249280	8253000	it's hard not to think that a failed interaction,
8253000	8257440	failed interview, there's something wrong with you.
8257440	8258800	Sure, right.
8258800	8261000	There is an authority to a therapist, I think,
8261000	8264720	where you think like they've got it all figured out.
8264720	8269400	And I'm a mess and therefore if there's something off,
8269400	8271680	it's all my fault, right?
8271680	8274360	So it's a very tricky and then it's easy to then give up
8274360	8276480	and then, because it's like that step
8276480	8280160	to try to get a therapist, the first step to get help,
8280160	8281920	if I get a therapist, like any kind of help,
8281960	8284080	that's a big leap to take.
8284080	8285720	Especially when you're in a rough place.
8285720	8286920	I agree completely.
8286920	8291560	We should not make people swim against such a strong current
8291560	8292920	to get their needs met.
8292920	8295240	I mean, we see this in such obvious places
8295240	8298320	where you have an elderly, homebound person
8298320	8300160	who can't get their medicine
8300160	8301520	because oh, there's been some change
8301520	8304200	and they didn't put the new number into the form
8304200	8305040	or Lord knows what.
8305040	8308760	I mean, it's incredible how we force people
8308760	8310840	to swim against strong currents
8310880	8313040	to get things that are just basic
8313040	8315000	at times for their survival.
8315000	8318320	And with that in mind, I don't have a lot of respect
8318320	8322000	for where healthcare is at or where mental health is at.
8322000	8326000	The field that I work in has accepted all sorts of aspects
8327520	8330400	of how things go, someone else controlling
8330400	8333560	how long the interaction can go on,
8333560	8335080	how the interaction is bounded,
8335080	8336160	what can be said and done,
8336160	8338160	what medicines can be prescribed.
8338160	8340840	There's so many external controls
8340840	8344000	in the systems we work in that we,
8344000	8347920	and I say me included, like all of us in the field
8347920	8349840	have let it get to a place
8349840	8353280	where it's obscenely difficult to get help.
8353280	8355040	Obscenely difficult.
8355040	8358920	And we should say that's not okay.
8358920	8361840	I think psychiatrists and therapists
8361840	8364760	and masters level social workers, psychologists
8364760	8367440	and you name it, I think we should all say
8367560	8369520	this is not okay.
8369520	8371400	And then we as a society should be saying
8371400	8373320	this is not okay, otherwise what you're saying
8373320	8375440	which is I think completely true
8375440	8378680	will only become worse as there's more and more barriers
8378680	8380120	to getting the help a person needs.
8380120	8382280	And each time a person isn't helped,
8382280	8384640	it sets the odds against them getting more help.
8384640	8387760	I should say here that when I started working
8387760	8389360	there were times I would send people
8389360	8390360	to an emergency room, right?
8390360	8392960	If there was some emergency in their mental health
8392960	8394240	and they were at risk.
8394240	8395680	And there were times I'd send somebody
8395680	8398240	to an emergency room where if you stopped and looked
8398240	8401400	it would have been malpractice not to do that, right?
8401400	8406400	Now it's not just me who has an incredibly high threshold
8408480	8409960	for sending someone to an emergency room
8409960	8412600	because you just send someone who's in a lot of distress
8412600	8415480	and oftentimes they're sitting on a gurney in a hallway
8415480	8417520	or they're locked in a small white room
8417520	8419280	and all they had was depression.
8419280	8422280	They're scared when they go in and 36 hours later,
8422280	8423400	oh, they're feeling a little better.
8423400	8424920	Wags are desperate to get out of there.
8425040	8426280	And someone sends them home.
8426280	8429840	I mean, so our systems have shifted so much
8429840	8433200	that we tolerate now en masse.
8433200	8435360	What is egregious to the individual?
8437320	8442320	So you are a psychiatrist in terms of doing therapy,
8442760	8446240	psychotherapy, what does the successful interaction
8446240	8447240	look like?
8447240	8450680	Perhaps a fun question, perhaps not.
8450680	8452280	What do you think of the psychiatrist Sean
8452280	8455400	in Goodwill Hunting played by Robin Williams?
8455400	8458160	So what is the full range of interesting interactions?
8458160	8459840	Can there be an intimacy, a friendship,
8459840	8464600	a kind of varied interaction that kind of blends the lines
8464600	8469360	of 30 minutes session once a week or whatever
8469360	8474360	versus like a really kind of deliberate long-term project
8475280	8477760	that cares about the well-being of a person
8477760	8480240	across the months and years?
8480280	8484120	Or is the, what can you say about a successful
8484120	8487000	interaction between therapist and patient?
8487000	8490240	I think we're much better served by the latter, right?
8490240	8492360	And again, it doesn't have to be over years.
8492360	8495000	We may be, a person might need that over weeks.
8495000	8496080	They might need it over months.
8496080	8497760	They might need it over years.
8497760	8499800	But if I'm understanding correctly,
8499800	8502000	you're describing something that is
8502000	8504600	like a real human engagement, right?
8504600	8509160	And I work in a field that for years and years and years,
8509200	8512560	the patient didn't get to see the therapist was sitting
8512560	8515000	in a place that was sitting behind the person, right?
8515000	8517480	So that's not, of course, the only tradition
8517480	8519480	and there are aspects of that tradition
8519480	8521080	that can be very humanized,
8521080	8524640	but the idea that we're supposed to not be human.
8524640	8526600	I mean, this medicine is shot through with this, right?
8526600	8527840	That the doctor's supposed to be God
8527840	8529280	and it protects the doctor.
8529280	8531200	And that makes its way into therapy
8531200	8535100	and the idea of the superiority the therapist knows more.
8536440	8538440	I mean, in some ways, yes,
8538440	8541320	but the idea is like to know more about mechanical things,
8541320	8545080	like to know more about like facts and knowledge,
8545080	8546720	not as a human being, right?
8546720	8550720	If we approach therapy as a collaborative human endeavor,
8550720	8551560	right?
8551560	8553160	Where if we're gonna do it together,
8553160	8555360	of course I'm gonna learn from you too, right?
8555360	8556680	I mean, we're two human beings
8556680	8558280	and we're talking about things that are deep
8558280	8561720	and personal and intimate and I'm not gonna participate
8561720	8564680	in a way that makes it like about me as much as it's
8564680	8566440	about you, but we're two humans
8566440	8568800	and what's gone on in me may have relevance
8568800	8570480	and sharing it may have relevance.
8570480	8573280	And at times you doing something back
8573280	8574720	for me may have relevance.
8574720	8576040	I'll give you an example of a person
8576040	8578600	who would not let me help him.
8578600	8579680	It was a young man.
8579680	8582360	So when I was in training, who was very, very sick
8582360	8585760	and needed to change certain choices and habits
8585760	8587560	or he was not gonna survive.
8587560	8591640	And I had no ability to help him whatsoever.
8591640	8593320	And I went and I saw a supervisor
8593320	8594800	who was existentially trained.
8594800	8596880	We're here, it's different from existentialism
8596880	8597920	in the classic sense,
8597920	8600440	but it's about really human connection, right?
8600440	8603560	And the guy was always wanting to teach me something, right?
8603560	8605160	Cause I can get by in Spanish,
8605160	8606400	but he was fluent in Spanish.
8606400	8608880	And he wanted to, he'd, oh, you traveled here
8608880	8611560	and he'd say, you know, a word to see if I knew.
8611560	8614080	And I was always directing back to what I was supposed to do,
8614080	8614920	right?
8614920	8615760	And the supervisor, I'll never forget,
8615760	8617880	he said, let him teach you Spanish.
8617880	8619320	Like, okay, come on.
8619320	8621200	So we had a couple of sessions where if you looked
8621200	8623040	from the outside, he said, what is going on there?
8623040	8625840	Like, right, like this, it was their Spanish lessons
8625840	8626920	to me, right?
8626920	8629400	And then at some point he had, he brought in his mother
8629400	8631440	and it was, he hadn't brought her in yet.
8631440	8634920	And he was in part showing off that he taught me something,
8634920	8635760	right?
8635760	8638160	And I said a couple of things and he felt more powerful.
8638160	8640120	Like he was younger than me and he felt sick
8640120	8642760	and disempowered, but he didn't feel that way
8642760	8643960	once he taught me something
8643960	8646200	and we showed it off to his mother, right?
8646200	8647880	And his behavior started to change.
8647880	8650000	He started taking better care of himself.
8650000	8651960	He could see a little more what I was saying.
8652000	8653360	He was like, you're a wonderful person.
8653360	8655880	Look, you love your mother and your aunt and they love you.
8655880	8658400	And like, look, he could start seeing that about himself.
8658400	8660160	But that came from humanness.
8660160	8663760	And I think that's the way we help people.
8663760	8665800	I don't understand why we don't do everything that way.
8665800	8667680	It's like, we're two humans,
8667680	8669160	but if you're doing something for me,
8669160	8671400	then there's something you have an expertise and I don't.
8671400	8672840	That's why you're doing it for me.
8672840	8675120	The reverse could be true, but it doesn't mean we're not.
8675120	8677720	Just two humans doing something together.
8677720	8679840	And the healthcare system and the legal system
8679840	8680920	should not get in the way of that.
8680920	8683520	I mean, there's liability and all these kinds of things
8683520	8688440	that can get in the way of the humanness.
8689360	8690760	I mean, some of that is justified.
8690760	8691640	You have to be careful.
8691640	8694720	You have to make sure there's a force for irresponsible,
8694720	8697960	but a little too much can destroy the humanness.
8697960	8698840	I'll use it where I don't.
8698840	8700840	You usually say something is insane.
8700840	8702720	Like it's not consistent with sanity.
8702720	8707480	And the presence of the legal system, look, I'm all four.
8707480	8709360	Of course, physicians have to be held,
8709360	8712120	but to be responsible and everybody makes mistakes
8712120	8715120	and people have to be accountable for their mistakes,
8715120	8717320	I understand all of that.
8717320	8721760	But what we see now, it's so absurd that,
8721760	8724720	oh, like everyone is frightened, right?
8724720	8725800	Everyone is frightened.
8725800	8726920	And then just looking to like,
8726920	8728280	how do I slot into the box,
8728280	8731040	check the boxes of what I'm supposed to do
8731040	8732880	and not get in trouble?
8732880	8737000	People get sued because someone was at that hospital
8737000	8738640	and that doctor touched their care.
8738640	8739800	This happens in the VA system.
8739800	8741560	It happens in other systems too.
8741560	8742880	So you might have touched their care
8742880	8744560	and no one's even saying you did anything wrong,
8744560	8746000	but they say the next person did.
8746000	8747680	Oh, someone settled on your behalf
8747680	8749360	and now you have a malpractice.
8749360	8751880	Dang, and maybe you can't get a license somewhere else.
8751880	8756000	Like doctors are terrified and they're terrified for good,
8756000	8757320	they're terrified for good reason
8757320	8760080	because the same society that has given doctors
8760080	8762000	in many ways too much power over time
8762000	8765400	and treated doctors maybe too much like gods now
8765440	8769000	is I think enacting some of society's anger and envy
8769000	8770680	out on the physicians.
8770680	8773840	Even the idea that like a person would know what medicine,
8773840	8776520	like I saw a couple of TV commercials give me this.
8776520	8778680	It's like, it's interesting, right?
8778680	8781640	Because even if, let's say I take myself out of it,
8781640	8782680	it doesn't feel good obviously,
8782680	8784600	but it takes about, it's like, wow,
8784600	8786640	like I went to school for like eight years for this
8786640	8788600	and you don't even want to hear my opinion, right?
8788600	8790480	You're not taking good care of yourself, right?
8790480	8792520	It doesn't mean you should think my opinion is gospel
8792520	8796280	as I said it, but people then don't have an understanding
8796280	8797640	of like, what is expertise?
8797640	8799120	What do people learn?
8799120	8802760	How can people help us understand and make better decisions?
8802760	8804480	It kind of goes out with the wash
8804480	8807520	and then the position of the expert.
8807520	8808920	I mean, a lot has been written about this, right?
8808920	8812840	It gets diminished over time very much to our own peril.
8812840	8816080	And then often with aggression in the medical world
8816080	8819880	coming back towards the alleged expert.
8819880	8823920	Yeah, expertise is a tricky one, such a tricky thing
8823920	8828920	because couple with expertise,
8830720	8833000	the attention is this arrogance
8833000	8834920	that can come with expertise.
8834920	8838040	The arrogance can make the expert feel
8838040	8842080	like they're more of an expert and there's a vicious cycle
8842080	8845080	and then the arrogance in the current in the 21st century,
8845080	8846000	especially with the internet,
8846000	8849680	the arrogance can completely force the public
8849680	8850960	to distrust the expert
8850960	8854000	because all they see is the arrogance versus the expertise.
8854000	8856960	So ultimately you have to have,
8856960	8861160	I think the greatest experts and masters I know
8861160	8864360	are the ones that have complete humility.
8864360	8865880	Right, humility and gratitude.
8865880	8866720	And gratitude.
8866720	8867560	Be this back.
8867560	8869480	Which is usually a really good sign
8869480	8873280	that somebody is at the top of their field.
8873280	8874120	Right.
8874120	8875640	And they'll acknowledge that they don't know everything.
8875640	8876480	Right.
8876480	8877400	Which is hilarious, right?
8877400	8881520	So like the best experts I know are the ones
8881520	8885640	that will say that they don't know.
8885640	8886480	Right.
8886480	8888160	They would not call themselves an expert.
8888160	8889000	Right.
8889000	8889840	Right.
8889840	8890680	It's very confusing.
8890680	8891520	Right.
8891520	8892360	Or know that they know a lot
8892360	8893480	but don't know the answer to this.
8893480	8894640	You see that a lot in medicine.
8894640	8896680	That person knows they're an expert surgeon
8896680	8898520	but they also acknowledge they don't know
8898520	8900280	if this is the right time to operate.
8900280	8901760	That's how you get to the best answer
8901760	8903240	instead of someone who is an expert
8903240	8904560	and always knows the answer.
8904560	8905680	Yeah.
8905680	8908200	If we actually rewind to the beginning
8908200	8909920	of our conversation, we talked about,
8910880	8913400	you mentioned something I wanted to return to.
8913400	8916560	So there's layers that are,
8916560	8918760	there's an emergent novelty.
8918760	8920720	And you mentioned that we as human beings
8920720	8923960	and we introspect on our own mind,
8923960	8926220	we really can't know most of it.
8927200	8930160	Which of course makes me think of this,
8930160	8932520	the unconscious mind, the subconscious mind
8932520	8933520	and Carl Jung.
8933520	8935560	How much is hiding there in the shadows?
8935560	8938960	You've investigated a lot of trauma.
8938960	8940880	How much is there in our mind
8940880	8943520	that's not directly accessible to us?
8943520	8946520	Like what can you say maybe philosophically
8946520	8951520	about how much is there lurking in the Jungian shadow?
8953440	8955880	I think there's a tremendous amount there.
8955880	8959640	But I wouldn't, I don't immediately go to
8960560	8961960	an ominous perspective, right?
8961960	8963440	Because if it's lurking there, right,
8963440	8964720	it can come get us, right?
8964720	8966760	And to some extent, that's true, right?
8966760	8968320	Because the seeds of evil are there
8968320	8970000	if we want to plant and nurture them.
8970000	8972200	You think good things can't lurk?
8972200	8974880	I guess so, I was being poetic.
8974880	8975960	But you're right, you're absolutely right.
8975960	8978160	And the Jungian shadow is supposed to not just be
8978160	8979840	dark things, it's supposed to be everything.
8979840	8982100	It's supposed to be a lot of positive things as well, yeah.
8982100	8986080	Right, which I think brings us to self-knowledge to truth
8986080	8989320	where I think the opposite of envy,
8989320	8993560	narcissism, sociopathy, I do think is all rooted in truth.
8993560	8995960	It's both the truth of the good things about us
8995960	8998760	or the ways we're not, we're not blameable
8998760	9000960	for the, blame worthy for the things we're blaming ourselves
9000960	9002240	for, et cetera.
9002240	9004760	But the self-knowledge and the truth
9004760	9009100	and getting away from the reflex of anger, frustration,
9009100	9013280	envy, shame, what I think happens then is all of that
9013280	9014320	underneath the surface.
9014320	9016160	If we look at like the consciousness is the top
9016160	9018240	of the iceberg, you know, outside the top.
9018240	9019720	So well, outside the water.
9019720	9022320	So is what's underneath like shifting
9022320	9024200	and it can pull the top under, right?
9024200	9026080	Or is it supporting the top?
9026080	9030240	And really, I believe is honesty, truth,
9030240	9032120	self-knowledge, humility, gratitude,
9032120	9034760	all this simple stuff, good mental health
9034760	9036600	is always consistent with simplicity.
9036600	9039600	You know, humility, gratitude or easy things to say.
9039600	9041280	Like we know what that is, right?
9041280	9042680	We understand what that is.
9042680	9046400	Soothing envy by having immense power
9046400	9049040	and subjugating others is getting very, very complicated,
9049040	9051560	right, what that is and how that plays out.
9051560	9054200	So if we are in touch with ourselves,
9054200	9057280	if we're honest with ourselves, if we own what's ours,
9057280	9059680	we don't try and own what's not ours, right?
9059680	9062360	What happens then is something isn't waiting inside of us
9062360	9066760	to sort of jump us with some new fact of self
9066760	9068400	or challenge of self, right?
9068400	9070800	Then I think what happens are phenomena
9070800	9073480	like intrinsic learning, like the way that so much happens
9073480	9075560	inside of us automatically, right?
9075560	9078880	How people who have high levels of expertise
9078880	9083800	know the answer to complex questions more rapidly, right?
9083800	9085760	It doesn't take them longer to think through it,
9085760	9087480	but they have more knowledge to think through.
9087480	9090600	It's that more happens rapidly and unconsciously
9090600	9093360	so they know the more complex answer
9093360	9095240	more quickly and readily, right?
9095240	9097080	And we can build that in ourselves,
9097080	9099480	not just in terms of factual knowledge,
9099480	9102280	but in terms of how we respond to things, right?
9102280	9106040	If I make a mistake, do I respond with reflexive shame, right?
9106040	9107640	If I see someone has something I'd like,
9107640	9109160	how do I respond?
9109160	9111800	We're more in accord with ourselves
9111800	9116480	and then the automaticity in us is serving us better.
9116480	9117520	So that's in the positive.
9117520	9119360	Do you think, do you draw some wisdom
9119360	9123800	from the early pioneers of psychotherapy
9123800	9125840	like Freud and Jung?
9125840	9126680	Yes.
9126680	9127680	That there's some repressed,
9129920	9132440	there's some stuff to work through
9132440	9135760	that is in the unconscious mind.
9135760	9140400	Yes, I think there's always like 100% of the time.
9140400	9141440	If you have a living human,
9141440	9144680	you have things to work through in the unconscious mind, right?
9144680	9146560	There's too much that goes on around us
9146560	9150200	that we might find unacceptable and suppressed, right?
9150200	9153800	There can be smaller but important examples, right?
9153800	9158520	Someone who feels that they're not a good enough parent
9158520	9163520	and they, I don't know, they dropped the child's plate, right?
9163760	9168760	And there's a feeling about that of badness in them
9170160	9173520	that the person that can't tolerate and pushes away, right?
9173520	9175520	And maybe they become a little bit less confident,
9175520	9176640	a little bit less assertive.
9176640	9179720	Like those small examples are important
9179720	9181240	because they may be low valence,
9181240	9184240	but there can be many, many, many, many, many of them, right?
9184240	9186240	Then you can look at the opposite end of the spectrum
9186240	9189880	where someone, for example, feels or they're repressing
9189880	9192440	their sexuality unconsciously.
9192440	9195480	Something that is so important, say,
9195480	9196920	to how a person feels about themselves,
9196920	9198400	to whether they can seek fulfillment,
9198400	9200840	to how they feel about their ability to interact
9200840	9203040	and engage with others in ways that are loving
9203040	9204800	and generative over time.
9204800	9208000	So from smaller things that accumulate
9208000	9210880	often at a rapid pace to really big things,
9210880	9213200	we are pushing things into the unconscious
9213200	9216520	because they're not acceptable and we need to explore.
9216520	9218000	Like why is that not acceptable?
9218000	9219440	Maybe there's a non-acceptable urge
9219440	9221440	because it's really not acceptable to me, right?
9221440	9222720	Like a violent urge.
9222720	9224760	Maybe there's an unacceptable urge
9224760	9227720	because I'm actually listening to the lie society
9227720	9230520	is telling me about what's okay and what's not okay, right?
9230520	9232680	So in exploring those things,
9232680	9234960	yes, we become happier and healthier
9234960	9238000	and that could mean if we're already happy and healthy,
9238000	9241240	it gets better, we get more insulated against the negative
9241240	9243680	or it can mean the person who's really nurturing
9243680	9247360	some of those seeds of evil and envy does that less
9247360	9248840	or steps away from it.
9248840	9250440	So whether it's good or it's bad,
9250440	9253760	it's in there inside of us and we benefit
9253760	9256880	from understanding that idea of the observing ego, right?
9256880	9258680	Like I said, the part that can stop and say,
9258680	9262240	hey, this is what's, I see what's going on in me.
9262240	9265360	What have you learned about exploring the human mind
9265360	9267480	about the art of conversation?
9267480	9269560	Is ultimately therapy is conversation.
9269560	9270600	Yeah.
9270600	9273280	Is there something you can put into words?
9273280	9274120	Yeah.
9274120	9277400	Like what makes a good conversation?
9277400	9281680	I think language is among the most amazing gifts we have.
9281680	9285360	And it's also one of the most like clunky routes
9285360	9287040	to misunderstanding, right?
9287040	9289120	I think of like, there's a concept of facticity,
9289120	9290600	you know, things that are like, I guess,
9290600	9292960	a necessary evils and from the religious perspective,
9292960	9294520	I think is where the word started,
9294520	9297400	but of language being like a facticity, right?
9297400	9299560	That we need to communicate with one another,
9299560	9301600	we want to communicate so we develop words
9301600	9303720	and we have these amazing brains that can have language
9303720	9305640	and that's all well and good,
9305640	9308600	but our fantasy would be more like Mr. Spock, right?
9308600	9310000	You know, the Vulcan mind meld.
9310000	9311520	It was like, I communicate with you
9311520	9312840	because we put our hands on one another
9312840	9315040	and we know, you know, by doing this,
9315040	9317340	what we're thinking and what we're feeling
9317340	9319540	and we won't have misunderstanding.
9319540	9322480	So because I think we can approximate that,
9322480	9325360	we can come kind of close with language, right?
9325360	9328120	Or we can be so far away from it
9328120	9331280	that we can say the same word and have opposite meanings
9331280	9334000	and have it generate immediate animosity, right?
9334000	9337360	That we need to be very, very careful
9337360	9340320	with language, with communication, with conversations.
9340320	9343280	And I've come to understand that much, much more
9343280	9346480	as I've gotten older, both in terms of how hurtful,
9347840	9349880	you know, reckless speeches,
9349880	9352440	which is why I'm horrified by so much of what we see
9352440	9353920	in our political discourse, right?
9353920	9357240	The slurs, the negativity that's attached to something,
9357240	9360200	to some word, you know, how one can utter something
9360200	9362920	and it can go into another person just into the ear,
9362920	9365040	but then goes through so many parts of the meaning
9365040	9367400	of the brain that that person feels a pervasive sense
9367400	9370440	of shame or beleagueredness, right?
9370440	9375000	So yes, reckless language absolutely hurts people
9375000	9376820	and we see that all the time in ways
9376820	9378560	that I think are just atrocious.
9378560	9382520	And also how bad miscommunication harms us.
9382520	9384440	I mean, I really learned that through a lot
9384440	9386480	of different ways, but in the work as a therapist
9386480	9388520	of like really wanting to make sure
9388520	9390560	that I'm really understanding you
9390560	9392480	and you're really understanding me.
9392480	9394840	And a lot of work goes into that communication.
9394840	9396440	I think people, we can get into a rhythm of it
9396440	9398120	and then it happens more easily,
9398120	9401560	but I think it's like, it's a life and death difference
9401560	9404120	at times, you know, lots of times, right?
9404120	9406080	In the world around us between clear
9406080	9407280	and accurate communication.
9407280	9408440	And just so I said a word because like,
9408440	9411000	I think you know what I mean or something like that.
9411000	9414640	Yeah, so to that, I mean, there's the Camus quote
9414640	9418320	that I like as much unhappiness as coming to the world
9418320	9420320	because of things left unsaid.
9421080	9425120	So that has to do with clear communication.
9426560	9431560	But there's also a dance to a conversation,
9432680	9437680	a poetry to it, there is ambiguity to language.
9437760	9440640	And if you have a kind of awareness of that ambiguity
9440640	9443520	and you play with it, that's where wit and humor come in.
9443520	9447680	That allows you to sneak up to difficult topics
9447680	9450480	without sort of trampling on them.
9450480	9454200	I don't know, there's an art to it as well.
9454200	9456520	There's an art to the silence, you know?
9457520	9460320	Just allowing both human beings,
9460320	9461920	one of the most intimate things you can share
9461920	9463480	with a human being is silence.
9463480	9465040	Yeah, that's communication.
9465040	9466800	It's a different communication,
9466800	9468880	but it ties in more powerful.
9468880	9473320	Yeah, giving a person space to accumulate,
9473320	9476040	to integrate, to make sense of their thoughts,
9476040	9478840	enough to say a word, maybe a memory is sparked
9478840	9480960	so they can think about that memory
9480960	9483240	and process that memory.
9483240	9484560	So it's not just words, sorry to do quick,
9484560	9485480	it's not just words, right?
9485480	9486760	Because now you're talking about communication
9486760	9491080	as it's body language, it's expressions of empathy,
9491080	9493440	it's movements, it's pauses, right?
9493440	9497240	The communication process is very, very complicated
9497240	9498720	and deep.
9498720	9500800	Yeah, and some of that is building trust
9500800	9502960	but also challenging a person.
9502960	9504600	I wonder about that whole process
9505040	9506600	with strangers, for example,
9508080	9509560	of how you do that successfully.
9509560	9511680	Like you and I just met today.
9512880	9517280	But I think a lot of our interaction is very free.
9517280	9519800	We can get to know each other in any way we want.
9519800	9522920	There's a few conversations I have coming up
9522920	9524920	in general where there's a lot of other pressures
9524920	9526680	and constraints on those conversations.
9526680	9529800	There's a danger to it, there's risks.
9529800	9531560	There's the political forces involved,
9531560	9534360	like not from my perspective,
9534360	9538200	but probably from my as well of how do you say this thing?
9538200	9540560	What are the words that are going to offend?
9540560	9542840	And you're learning that about a stranger
9542840	9544920	at the same time, and you don't.
9546760	9550880	It's an interesting dance because you have to walk
9550880	9552760	carefully but deliberately, right?
9552760	9557200	Carefully because I've learned this about myself,
9557200	9558400	about others.
9558400	9561560	There's certain words that can trigger a person
9562440	9565600	that can make a person feel poorly,
9565600	9568160	like shitty about themselves.
9569600	9572040	So you can push, you can challenge a person
9572040	9574800	about something and they're totally okay with it,
9574800	9576880	but if you use a certain word to do it,
9576880	9580280	it's gonna, it's maybe it maps it to some childhood thing
9580280	9583080	that their father or mother used to say or something like this.
9583080	9586360	And I mean, part of the art of conversation
9586360	9589160	is actually being a little bit free
9589160	9592000	and using those words, but being extremely sensitive
9592000	9595560	in detecting when a person reacts to a particular word
9595560	9597600	and like storing that away.
9597600	9601560	It's like, okay, then we might wanna return to that later
9601560	9603240	because there might be an interesting,
9603240	9604480	that could be a tip of an iceberg
9604480	9606640	that's actually representing something beautiful,
9606640	9609800	or you might wanna just, it's a nothing word
9609800	9612720	that you just wanna avoid because it's a distraction.
9612720	9615120	And so all of that kind of has to be integrated
9615120	9617600	into the dance of language, which is really interesting,
9617600	9619120	especially when the stakes are really high.
9619120	9620800	When you get one conversation,
9620800	9624360	when you sit down, you have one conversation
9624360	9626960	and it makes the difference between,
9626960	9629240	like say you had one conversation with a patient,
9629240	9631440	this is the only conversation you get to help them.
9631440	9632640	Sometimes it is the case.
9632640	9635680	Yeah, this is pretty high stakes.
9635680	9637500	Yeah. Oh man.
9638880	9639720	Yeah, it's tough.
9639720	9643360	I guess you get over, and like over time,
9643360	9647520	I guess you get used to the high stakes nature
9648360	9649840	when you develop an ability
9649840	9652680	and all that unconscious processing, right?
9652680	9654160	All that part of the iceberg
9654160	9656320	that's underneath the surface is doing all of that, right?
9656320	9659360	It's reading, behavioral cues, verbal cues,
9659360	9663800	and recognizing the primacy of emotion over logic, right?
9663800	9665840	If we're all logic, it'd be different.
9665840	9666920	Okay, we're gonna talk about this thing.
9666920	9668420	I'll say things, you say things back,
9668420	9670600	even if it's politically contentious, say.
9670600	9672120	It's okay, we're just gonna talk logically,
9672120	9673920	but that's not the case, right?
9673920	9677420	There could be a word that raises a certain emotion
9677420	9678860	and you don't wanna tread there
9678860	9680340	because the emotion will color
9680340	9682060	the person's ability to engage,
9682060	9684660	and so you're aware of all of this.
9684660	9687300	And then I think from the perspective of all of that,
9687300	9689500	I mean, it's like standing on the shoulders
9689500	9691660	of your own internal giant, right?
9691660	9695020	That understands language and emotions
9695020	9698300	and body language and attunement and history
9698300	9700100	and triggering and all of that.
9700100	9701900	And then on top of that,
9701900	9703340	as you're standing up on those shoulders,
9703340	9705540	you're trying to be effective, right?
9705540	9708340	And then I think that's where effectiveness
9708340	9711180	can be unilateral or it can be together.
9711180	9713700	I mean, I think some of what emerged
9713700	9714940	from Victor Frankl's writing
9714940	9718300	after the Second World War was how much
9718300	9720340	a shared humanness means to us,
9720340	9722860	how much of that can be an incentive
9722860	9725480	for survival beyond all others, right?
9725480	9727980	So the idea of are we doing something
9727980	9729580	if we're communicating unilateral,
9729580	9732580	like I want information from you
9732580	9734620	or I want you to do a certain thing
9734660	9736860	when we're done talking, right?
9736860	9737940	Done communicating.
9737940	9740820	That's a very unilateral type of effectiveness
9740820	9741860	which can make sense.
9741860	9743500	Sometimes I want information out of a patient
9743500	9745100	because I want to know what to do next, right?
9745100	9746980	So it doesn't have to always be negative
9746980	9749420	but it can also be a tool of manipulation, right?
9749420	9751900	If someone would say coming from envy or narcissism,
9751900	9753460	I want to communicate with you
9753460	9756060	in a way that makes you do what I want you to do, right?
9756060	9759620	Different from that is where it's a shared communication
9759620	9762780	where there's like an umbrella, so to speak over us
9762780	9766100	and we're doing something that can only happen together
9766100	9768420	because we're us, we're each person, right?
9768420	9770380	And we come together to do something
9770380	9771900	that's a shared effectiveness.
9771900	9774540	Like I think we're doing now of like elucidating
9774540	9777420	and pursuing thoughts and getting ideas out.
9777420	9779180	And I think the best situations
9779180	9781260	are shared effectiveness situations
9781260	9783220	because you call upon the resourcefulness
9783220	9785980	and the internal resources of both people.
9785980	9789340	But you, especially with strangers,
9789340	9792100	especially when it's not labeled a therapy session,
9793420	9798420	you kind of actually stumble into that cooperative state.
9798740	9803740	Like you have to organically develop a trust together
9808180	9810420	and almost lose yourself.
9810420	9812420	Ultimately, I do, I think you put it really nice.
9812420	9814100	I think successful conversations,
9814100	9818980	even when it's with like, even if it's like with world leaders
9818980	9822740	or logicians, people that operate in the space of reason,
9822740	9826260	the most successful conversation will ultimately be
9826260	9829980	in the layer and the landscape of emotion.
9829980	9832260	Like that's where the interesting stuff will happen.
9832260	9833780	That's where you discover anything.
9833780	9835540	And that's where you get to actually meet,
9835540	9838060	to start getting an understanding of each other.
9838060	9841460	Or what you actually mean even by the statements
9841460	9844260	that are supposed to be kind of rationally based.
9845460	9846940	It's like you lose yourself.
9846940	9848380	You lose yourself in the way you do
9848380	9852180	when you're children and you're just not shooting the shit
9852180	9854780	about whatever topic and you just forget yourself.
9854780	9855620	Forget the things you're supposed to say.
9855620	9857140	You lose yourself in the context, right?
9857140	9860940	Yeah, where you kind of plug into the unconscious mind
9860940	9864740	a little bit and you get to speak maybe indirectly,
9864740	9867980	but to the things that really drive you,
9867980	9871940	to the things, to the emotions, I suppose,
9871940	9875180	that underlie your worldview.
9875180	9878340	I feel like that's where productive conversations
9878900	9881660	can happen, whether it's a patient or just a stranger
9881660	9885220	you're talking to at a bar about geopolitics.
9886300	9887740	You mentioned Victor Frankel.
9887740	9890460	What do you make of his work, Man's Search for Meaning?
9890460	9893540	What are the lessons you draw from his work?
9893540	9896820	Of him as a psychologist, but also from that
9896820	9899540	very powerful work that reflects on his experience
9899540	9902060	in a Nazi concentration camp.
9902060	9903020	Yeah.
9903020	9908020	I think that it was almost a profound
9908780	9911940	reinvention of humanness, right?
9911940	9916940	After something so awful, so bleak and so despairing
9917740	9922740	to speak anew about shared humanness, human connection,
9925660	9930660	meaning, compassion, that I think it was an intellectual
9931980	9936860	direction that was adorned with all of the emotions
9936900	9939660	that we need to adorn the logic with
9939660	9942340	in order to make real change in the world.
9942340	9947340	And I think that his work has fueled so many branches
9947580	9951740	have come from his work, the existential psychotherapy
9951740	9956060	and its place in helping human activities today, right?
9957220	9962220	A trend away from the idea that we're all quite isolated
9962660	9964300	and that what's going on between us
9964300	9965860	is all very transactional, right?
9966020	9967300	Putting something out and you take it in,
9967300	9969020	you put something out, I take it in, right?
9969020	9970540	The idea that, no, there's a difference there.
9970540	9973860	There's a shared humanness that creates a meaning
9973860	9975340	beyond the transactional.
9975340	9976340	Kind of like you were just saying,
9976340	9978740	the logical stuff isn't really that interesting
9978740	9981500	because the logic is there's an answer
9981500	9982420	to whatever logic is.
9982420	9983780	We can do math, right?
9983780	9987380	It's where does the surprises come in, right?
9987380	9990700	Either in terms of wonderful behavior
9990700	9992220	or destructive behavior, right?
9992220	9994020	They're coming from people's emotions.
9994060	9996580	So that's what we want to understand.
9996580	9999180	And that occurs in the context of a person
9999180	10000380	and other humans, you know,
10000380	10002180	even if it's the conception of someone
10002180	10004900	and all and other humans as enemy, you know,
10004900	10009220	or it's the conception of two people sitting together,
10009220	10011060	the idea that there's a shared humanness
10011060	10012900	and it's not all transactional
10012900	10017900	and that he could take that out of the pinnacle
10017980	10021380	of human tragedy and utilize it in a way
10021380	10025820	that informs us being better as a species going forward,
10025820	10028060	I think is really monumental.
10028060	10030740	What do you think is the role of emotion
10030740	10035060	in the human mind, in the human condition?
10035060	10038140	Because you've, we've talked several times
10038140	10041860	in different ways that emotion matters
10041860	10043860	and it's a big part of who we are.
10045420	10048340	But why is it there?
10048340	10049620	Why is it useful?
10049620	10050900	What's good about it?
10051740	10055460	We've almost said it's almost like a negative thing
10055460	10057380	that we just have to live with.
10057380	10059660	But why is it also maybe a beautiful thing?
10059660	10060500	Yeah.
10060500	10062020	Well, I think you said, what's the role of emotion?
10062020	10063340	I think emotion is the king
10063340	10064500	if we want to use that analogy.
10064500	10067060	It's the CEO if you want to use that analogy, right?
10067060	10069940	Emotion rules all.
10069940	10071740	We're taught that we're logical creatures,
10071740	10074100	but we have innumerable pieces of data
10074100	10075940	even over the course of just a day,
10075940	10077780	let alone a human experience
10077780	10079500	to tell us that is not the truth.
10079500	10082500	Is it ever logical to run into a burning building?
10083380	10084340	No, right?
10084340	10086140	I mean, logic is never gonna tell one to do that.
10086140	10087500	Okay, so many love is in the building.
10087500	10090620	The person's already sprinted halfway to the building, right?
10090620	10095420	Emotion rules us and so the thought,
10095420	10098820	a thought is some of that is evolutionary, right?
10098820	10101980	That strong negative emotion stays with us
10101980	10104220	very, very profoundly, right?
10104220	10106780	So example I'll give is if we're hunter-gatherers
10106780	10109140	and like I find a new berry and it tastes good
10109140	10112300	and it seems nutritious and then, and it is, right?
10112300	10114780	Everything's fine, it'd be good to remember that, right?
10114780	10116660	But if I find a new berry and it tastes good
10116660	10119060	and it seems nutritious and we both eat it
10119060	10123260	and almost die of sickness, we better remember that, right?
10123260	10128260	So the primacy of emotion is in us for reasons
10128660	10129900	that are about survival,
10129900	10132460	that the emotion of it's my child in that building
10132460	10135180	or my loved one is why I don't give a damn about logic
10135180	10136860	and run into the building, right?
10136860	10138900	The emotion of I thought that was good
10138900	10141460	and I got really sick and I better never forget
10141460	10142980	is also about survival.
10142980	10144380	And the same applies to humans.
10144380	10146660	If we're from different tribes back then
10146660	10149260	and in my tribe, when you put your hand out,
10149260	10151420	it's a greeting in your tribe,
10151420	10153580	if someone puts their hand out, it means,
10153580	10156100	hey, I'm gonna attack you and take your stuff, right?
10156100	10159660	Then I put my hand out and you slug me, right?
10159660	10162460	Then I was like, I better remember that, right?
10162460	10166020	But you see how that can lead into our,
10166020	10167380	are the constructs around that?
10167380	10170140	So I say, oh, people in your tribe are violent, right?
10170140	10173100	We start then to make stories around that.
10173100	10175540	But the primacy of emotion, whether it's berries
10175540	10177500	or it's humans who might threaten us
10177500	10179060	or it's humans we love,
10179060	10182020	I think it's hard to even look at that
10182020	10184100	anthropological psychological literature
10184100	10186100	to look at what's out there
10186100	10187580	and I think the face validity,
10187580	10189900	and that's part of survival, right?
10189900	10190740	It's part of survival.
10190740	10193860	But it's so cool that you get also things like love,
10193860	10197140	which are not often rational or grounded in logic
10197700	10201020	and so on, if you look from a transactional perspective,
10201900	10203460	a lot of times falling in love
10203460	10208060	or whether it's with friends or friendship
10208060	10210740	or romantic love, it doesn't really make sense.
10210740	10214980	I'm still not sure what the hell it is.
10214980	10219980	Because I mean, it's the thing that is one of the things
10220220	10222820	or love for your kids when they're born.
10222820	10226040	Like that love, the parental love,
10227940	10229420	what is that?
10229420	10231420	That's so cool that we get to have that.
10231420	10232980	Like if you're looking for the,
10232980	10236060	in the menu of items that give life meaning,
10236060	10237780	that seems like a pretty good one.
10237780	10240460	Yeah, so my response,
10240460	10242180	you just said that gives life meaning,
10242180	10243700	my response initially was gonna be,
10243700	10245860	it's the meaning of life, right?
10245860	10248260	Because saying, okay, emotion is about survival,
10248260	10249820	that's one part, right?
10249820	10251060	And it's a very important part, right?
10251060	10252860	If we don't survive,
10252860	10255100	then we're not there to have emotions, right?
10255100	10257100	So yes, it's about survival,
10257100	10258860	but as important as that is,
10258860	10260500	that's the small part of it, right?
10260500	10262860	I think it is about the meaning of life
10262860	10264980	because it's about the beyond self.
10264980	10267700	And I think it relates back to what we talked,
10267700	10268860	we're talking about the very beginning
10268860	10271540	and the sort of levels of emergence, right?
10271540	10274620	And when we feel love, we feel happiness
10274620	10277380	because that person feels happiness, right?
10277380	10279180	There's something that's so generative,
10279180	10280540	so creative about that.
10280540	10282300	Like we wanna bring order to things
10282300	10285900	and we, you know, happiness is consistent with simplicity,
10285900	10286740	right?
10286740	10287620	If we're healthy, there's nothing negative
10287620	10288780	to say about our health, right?
10288780	10290940	If we have health problems, there's a lot to say, right?
10290940	10295340	And it's emotion that pushes us towards the goodness
10295340	10298060	that I think makes all the meaning for us.
10298060	10299140	I mean, it's interesting,
10299140	10301300	I actually was wondering your thoughts about this
10301300	10302540	as a scientist, right?
10302540	10306180	Because we accept it by and large that we have free will, right?
10306180	10307220	We think we have free will,
10307220	10309660	but then we get upset that there's not justice, right?
10309660	10312460	So, but how is it like if we have free will,
10312460	10314140	I could act in an unjust way
10314140	10315300	and then you're surprised
10315660	10317100	or vice versa, like why, right?
10317100	10319860	We have these thoughts because I think
10319860	10323220	because we're rooted, we want logic to rule.
10323220	10324860	Like there's a way in which I can understand logic,
10324860	10326780	I can manage it, I can manipulate it.
10326780	10328960	We sort of want it to be that way.
10328960	10333960	So then we glorify logic and then we misapply it.
10334140	10336500	Like ideas, like, oh, I know we have free will,
10336500	10339260	but I'm now, you know, shaking my fist at the heavens
10339260	10341260	because there's no justice, right?
10341260	10343420	And I think maybe what we're looking for
10343980	10345540	is we should go back and look at the givens.
10345540	10348020	Like why is there, there's only goodness if there's justice?
10348020	10350900	I mean, that doesn't make, I think the goodness,
10350900	10352820	why is the goodness have to be tied to that, right?
10352820	10355180	Maybe it goes back to the counter entropy
10355180	10357140	and the fact that when there is something,
10357140	10358620	there is not nothing, right?
10358620	10360860	And where there is something, there can be awareness,
10360860	10364300	there can be goodness, there can be compassion, right?
10364300	10368860	Is it that what's really going on is not about justice?
10368860	10370400	Yes, we have free will,
10370400	10375400	but it's that goodness, creating, shoring up, making better.
10376440	10381440	That is the meaning, that is the good, right?
10381560	10384360	And that the evil is the destruction
10384360	10387280	as evidenced by the fact that it's over determined
10387280	10388520	probably a million times
10388520	10391080	that we're in this eddy current of counter entropy
10391080	10393640	and we could destroy that quite readily, right?
10393640	10395440	And then we're nothingness,
10395440	10399120	like everything else that we know of that's not us,
10399160	10401240	that doesn't have the ability to do something
10401240	10404000	that's creative or constructive.
10404000	10407280	I mean, I think that that's the answer
10407280	10409880	and I think that our science really tells us
10409880	10410880	that that's the answer.
10410880	10413200	And I think it beckons us with ideas,
10413200	10416680	like we know that things happen outside of space and time,
10416680	10417520	right?
10417520	10418360	I mean, they're physics experiments, right?
10418360	10420800	Like we know this from the science of it,
10420800	10424400	yet we don't stop and look and say, wait, is that the magic
10424400	10425240	of the idea?
10425240	10427720	Einstein said, God doesn't play dice with the universe.
10428560	10432000	Okay, maybe God doesn't play dice with the universe,
10432000	10434160	that quantum indeterminacy and all of that
10434160	10436640	is not just a flip of the coin, so to speak.
10436640	10440000	But maybe it's in that indeterminacy
10440000	10443960	that we're given the opportunity to assert ourselves, right?
10443960	10446440	To make something one way or another, you know,
10446440	10448840	maybe it's not God playing dice with the universe,
10448840	10451560	but it's God loading the dice in our favor.
10451560	10454280	If we'll only listen to truth,
10454280	10455880	the truth that being destructive
10455880	10457320	doesn't help or soothe anything,
10457320	10459800	even in the person who thinks it will for themselves
10459800	10462160	and that creativity and generativeness
10462160	10463840	and kindness and compassion.
10463840	10466280	Like this is, doesn't that seem so analogous
10466280	10468000	to the eddy current of counter entropy
10468000	10470000	that has us here in the first place?
10470000	10472600	And I think that's where I pin meaning
10472600	10475160	and that meaning then going back to the initial question,
10475160	10478960	right, is generated in us through emotion,
10478960	10480880	through what we feel that leads us to feel something
10480880	10483720	that is mysterious, I don't know why I feel it.
10483720	10486560	Yeah, in some sense, the motion is kind of the fuel
10486560	10489000	of that creative imperative we have.
10489000	10492920	But if you step back and look at the tapestry a little bit,
10492920	10494760	it does seem that the destruction,
10494760	10496040	the creation of the destruction
10496040	10498760	are the ying ying yang of life.
10498760	10503480	That it all works only if the main engine
10503480	10505120	is towards creativity,
10505120	10510120	but destruction also makes way for new things.
10510520	10513840	So that's the, this kind of struggle.
10513840	10515800	It seems like life is struggled
10515800	10517320	between the different forces that make up
10517320	10519520	the individual human, they make up society,
10519520	10524240	all this tensions are necessary for growth, for development.
10524240	10528320	This kind of inner conflict and outer conflict
10528320	10530040	are necessary for growth.
10530040	10533200	It's not just, I mean, in some sense,
10533200	10534520	it's from the logic aspect,
10534520	10537960	you kind of want everything to be perfect and just,
10537960	10540560	for nobody to suffer for everything to be perfect.
10540560	10542080	But just like we talked about with trauma,
10542080	10545480	it just seems like it's such a big giant mess.
10545520	10546360	What is it?
10546360	10549800	Bukowski said, fine, would you love and let it kill you?
10549800	10553440	There's some aspect of the negative aspect
10553440	10555360	of passion and pursuit and obsession
10555360	10560360	and the turmoil of the pursuit of happiness,
10563440	10565320	of the creative pursuits and all of that.
10565320	10567960	I mean, that's part of life as well.
10567960	10570560	That's, and I don't know what to do with that
10571760	10573800	from an individual perspective
10573800	10576640	in terms of figuring out how do you live a good life?
10576640	10578320	How do you live a healthy life?
10578320	10581280	Cause it does seem that a bit of hardship
10581280	10582680	or sometimes a lot of hardship
10583600	10585960	can make a pretty interesting life.
10585960	10588400	I think it brings us back to the discussion
10588400	10590560	that we were having sort of before about
10590560	10592720	like what does mean like the challenges of trauma, right?
10592720	10594160	And of overcoming.
10594160	10596880	And I think here we gotta be careful with the language, right?
10596880	10600800	Because I would then say, let's take destruction, right?
10600800	10603320	And separate it into two things, right?
10603560	10607120	One is to say destruction is like the breaking down,
10607120	10608960	the tearing down of something, right?
10608960	10613720	Versus a process that has malice in it, right?
10613720	10617040	So just like when we were talking about trauma
10617040	10619960	and setbacks, things to overcome.
10619960	10621280	And we'd say, okay, if you say, hey,
10621280	10623080	you have it harder than the next person
10623080	10625000	and you have more to overcome,
10625000	10627080	or someone put a barrier in front of you
10627080	10628680	for you to overcome,
10628680	10630400	that there can be a lot of growth in that,
10630400	10631920	including the times when you don't know,
10631920	10633280	if you gosh, can I do this, right?
10633280	10634960	Can I get over it, right?
10634960	10637960	We're saying like that's challenge
10637960	10640000	and something to overcome that's very positive.
10640000	10641720	But we're saying, but there's no benefit
10641720	10644240	of like throwing a racial slur in there, right?
10644240	10646000	We're saying, because that's all bad.
10646000	10647200	Like that's not, even the prince says,
10647200	10649240	I'm angry about that and I'm gonna overcome that.
10649240	10650240	It's like that didn't need to be,
10650240	10651760	that didn't make anything better.
10651760	10653280	If the person sees that and says,
10653280	10658080	I'm gonna overcome that, it makes things less worse, right?
10658080	10660560	But there's no good to something
10660560	10662280	that's created as destructive.
10662280	10663680	When we look at forest fires,
10663680	10665280	like look, controlled burns,
10665280	10666880	you say there's a forest burning down,
10666880	10670320	but that's, okay, there's some weak destruction there.
10670320	10671760	There's a tearing down there,
10671760	10673760	but it's in the service of the next fire
10673760	10675400	not running through the community,
10675400	10677160	the town that's on the other side of it,
10677160	10679400	that's very different than a forest fire,
10679400	10681360	say started by arson, right?
10681360	10683040	So you might say they're both a tearing down,
10683040	10684800	they're a tearing down of the forest,
10684800	10686880	but one is in the service of goodness,
10686880	10688840	even though it's hurting the animals
10688840	10690560	and the plants is not all good, right?
10690560	10692720	But it's in the service of something
10692720	10695440	as opposed to something else that's wantonly destructive.
10695440	10697600	I think there's no good to the racial slur,
10697600	10699680	there's no good to the arson, right?
10699680	10702040	That's destruction in a way that's incorporating,
10702040	10704560	I think, the malice of envy,
10704560	10706520	something that's really purely,
10706520	10710040	if there's a yin and yang, that's the destructive,
10710040	10711320	that's the badness end.
10711320	10716320	So racial slurs is a surface wave of a deeper thing.
10716320	10719880	And so, I mean, the reason I bring that up is like,
10719880	10722440	all right, well, you have these discussions of censorship,
10722440	10726320	like what good does allowing racial slurs
10726320	10729360	in public communication do, right?
10729360	10732160	And it's like, our communication would surely be better
10732160	10734160	if we don't say bad things to each other.
10734160	10738520	But it's like, it seems like the truth is,
10738520	10740000	our communication will be better
10740000	10742080	if the amount of bad things
10742080	10745000	is a small fraction of communication.
10745000	10746800	That seems to be more true,
10746800	10749840	because another aspect of human nature with power,
10749840	10753600	the moment you start censoring and removing bad words
10753600	10755960	that everyone agrees are bad words,
10755960	10758280	then the people at the top,
10758280	10760680	they're doing the censoring, start getting greedy.
10760680	10762320	They start, it starts expanding.
10762320	10765360	And this is the giant mess of human civilization
10765360	10768440	where we can't, the nice piles you created
10768440	10771160	are kind of overlapping piles.
10771160	10772560	That's a gray area.
10772560	10773760	That's the problem with it.
10773800	10776600	No, I agree completely, the control of language,
10776600	10777760	there are slippery slopes there.
10777760	10780840	I think there's a very big problem there.
10780840	10784840	So I agree, I think, again, parsing out the language,
10784840	10787480	I'm not saying, hey, we shouldn't have racial slurs
10787480	10789080	as if like, let's stop saying the words.
10789080	10792600	I mean, the idea is the premise behind it, right?
10792600	10794400	Like, you know, the prejudices,
10794400	10796880	if we could eliminate the prejudice behind it,
10796880	10798560	you know, I was struck, I said,
10798560	10800880	I do almost nothing about medicine.
10800880	10804080	I get to medical school and start with anatomy, right?
10804080	10806320	And it's remarkable as, you know,
10806320	10809640	to see what, as the bodies are being dissected,
10809640	10811320	that like we're all humans.
10811320	10813880	Like, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
10813880	10815880	and any of these things on the outside, like,
10815880	10818960	and that's true, not just like in our bodies,
10818960	10821200	but in our minds and the part of the person
10821200	10822160	that's not there, right?
10822160	10824040	Because now we're trying to learn from the body.
10824040	10827680	And, you know, it shows how ridiculous it is.
10827680	10829360	If you think that we're 99.
10829360	10832120	How many nines, you know, percent all alike genetically.
10832120	10833240	And by the way, it's only like,
10833240	10836200	take another 10th off and we're all orangutans, right?
10836200	10839840	So, but somehow we have to see these differences
10839840	10841080	between us, right?
10841080	10842800	And where does that come from?
10842800	10846160	And I think that, I believe that all comes from envy
10846160	10847360	in that classical sense,
10847360	10849360	that if I don't feel good enough,
10849360	10852040	I'm gonna want someone to feel better about.
10852040	10854160	And so there can be visual things
10854160	10856760	that that person looks different, right?
10856760	10859120	Or you think about the, you know,
10859120	10861280	I spent some time in Great Britain
10861280	10863000	and when there's a lot of conflict
10863000	10865560	in between Northern Ireland and Ireland, right?
10865560	10866960	And you thought, wow, there's not,
10866960	10868560	there's not even a look difference, right?
10868560	10871640	It's the same general religious umbrella,
10871640	10872680	same ethnicity, right?
10872680	10874560	But now there's some religious difference.
10874560	10877160	And I thought, it's not me trying to be denigrating,
10877160	10878640	you know, around the Irish conflicts,
10878640	10880240	like that's human of,
10880240	10882320	oh, there's no actual difference between us.
10882320	10883920	If I don't feel good about myself,
10883920	10885680	I'm gonna find one, right?
10885680	10890240	It's that, that I believe could go away.
10890240	10892320	It's driven by maybe the trauma
10892320	10893600	of just being alive in the world
10893600	10894800	and things can happen to us,
10894800	10898720	but we certainly promote in the human created trauma,
10898720	10901400	people feeling not good enough, finding differences.
10901400	10903280	There's a place for the envy to attach
10903280	10906520	and we're off to the races of, you know, wars.
10906520	10908080	I mean, we're talking about the Second World War
10908080	10910320	and we think, well, what have we learned since then?
10910320	10911160	It would take us a day
10911160	10913960	to map out all the wars since then, right?
10913960	10915360	Let alone for goodness sakes,
10915360	10917320	everything that's salient right now.
10917320	10919840	So we're not pretty, we're not good at learning
10919840	10923320	from what seemed to be some very salient lessons.
10925320	10928440	I should mention one thing is that I also know
10928440	10931680	that you're interested in Russian culture a little bit.
10931680	10932520	Yes.
10933680	10935840	Churchill said, I cannot forecast to you
10935840	10937840	the action of Russia.
10937840	10940680	It is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
10940680	10943840	So what do you or some interesting differences
10944320	10947960	between, so this Eastern part of the world
10947960	10950560	of Russia, Ukraine, the Slavic countries,
10950560	10952720	the former Soviet Union, all of that
10952720	10955080	versus sort of the U.S. culture?
10955080	10957120	What stands out to you from the literature,
10957120	10960960	from the music, from the science, all that kind of stuff?
10960960	10965960	I think there's so much intensity and I guess
10967840	10971600	I would say fearlessness of expression
10971640	10975600	that I see in the Slavic culture.
10975600	10978480	Maybe it's across cultures
10978480	10980480	because there's a different way that expression occurs.
10980480	10983080	We say like, oh, it's different in the French
10983080	10985720	than the Spanish or it's different than in parts of Africa.
10985720	10988360	And I think when you take that part of the world
10988360	10990960	for whatever reason, and maybe it's just totally random
10990960	10993480	or maybe it's aspects of geography
10993480	10997040	and experience and migration, but there's such an intensity.
10997040	11001440	And I remember listening to Tchaikovsky very early on,
11002280	11003640	for the very first time, early on in my life,
11003640	11006920	or reading Dostoevsky and feeling like,
11006920	11011920	oh, Dostoevsky's willingness, his ability and his willingness
11012320	11017120	to express and create such powerful,
11017120	11020080	aberrant states of human experience.
11020080	11023360	Tchaikovsky in his music, the depths of suffering
11023360	11027120	that it expresses has always stood out to me
11028120	11032040	as a way that like if that's like the brightest light,
11032040	11034040	so to speak, communicating information,
11034040	11036160	that that's a place to look.
11036160	11039800	And it's also a place that resonated with me so strongly
11039800	11043440	because I think for some people who are informative years
11043440	11045800	and having very difficult feelings, right?
11045800	11047880	Of like a depth of feeling of like fear
11047880	11049520	and how's the world gonna be?
11049520	11050600	Am I gonna be annihilated?
11050600	11051920	Am I, what do I even want?
11051920	11055080	What do I feel inside of me to encounter
11055120	11058280	that being expressed so intensely?
11058280	11061240	I found to be very, very moving.
11061240	11062880	So I don't know if that's a good answer or not,
11062880	11064960	but I think there's an intensity of expression
11064960	11066240	and a fearlessness.
11066240	11068840	Dostoevsky wrote about terrible things.
11068840	11071000	What happens in the person?
11071000	11074360	Is there a person who is brilliant intellectually
11074360	11079240	and very persuasive and very capable of being effective
11079240	11082880	who also just chooses to be a child rapist, right?
11082880	11084360	I mean, he wrote about that.
11084480	11088960	He wrote about the truths of this is what we can be as humans.
11088960	11092440	And I think there's so many lessons, including the truth.
11092440	11093400	Like people will tend to think,
11093400	11096320	oh, evil is not very bright or not very intelligent.
11096320	11098720	That's a way to let evil propagate, right?
11098720	11101600	Evil can be effective and attractive
11101600	11105480	and very compelling, but evil nonetheless.
11105480	11108240	And I just think there's a fearless willingness
11108240	11110200	to look at that and to describe it.
11110200	11114200	That I see primarily I've studied in Russian culture.
11114200	11116080	Yeah, the fearless exploration
11116080	11118840	of this whole human drama.
11118840	11120640	Definitely Dostoevsky and others since
11120640	11123240	in the 20th century and the 19th century have done
11123240	11124360	an incredible job of that.
11124360	11125560	Some of that, just like you said,
11125560	11127320	is the language, the culture.
11127320	11130440	I think that intense romanticism is there.
11130440	11135440	That is almost an overdramatic exploration of human nature.
11137920	11141480	It can err on the side or falter
11141480	11145680	when it goes into a kind of cynical view of life.
11145680	11147400	Life is suffering.
11147400	11149840	I think that also has to do with the way you deal
11149840	11152840	with the trauma of the world wars and so on.
11152840	11154480	This is something the different nations
11154480	11157160	throughout Europe had to do with that in different ways.
11157160	11159400	Some of them have channeled into envy and resentment.
11159400	11164400	Some of them channeled into a kind of nihilism or cynicism.
11165360	11169680	And ultimately the intensity of feeling is there,
11169720	11172520	which is sort of interesting to see
11172520	11174160	and interesting how that manifests itself
11174160	11179000	in the kind of governments it builds up.
11179000	11184000	There's more authoritarianism in that part of the world
11184840	11187160	versus the Western world that's more focused
11187160	11189240	on the individual versus the collective.
11189240	11191160	And when more focused on the individual,
11191160	11194240	you have a propensity to value individual rights
11194240	11195720	with democracy and so on.
11195720	11197280	It's interesting to watch and yeah,
11197280	11200080	to reconstruct how that all came to be.
11200080	11202880	Is it in the blood?
11202880	11204520	Is it in the mind?
11204520	11208000	Is it in some kind of thing that more ethereal,
11208000	11209720	a collective set of ideas that we pass
11209720	11212720	from generation to generation between each other,
11212720	11214920	sort of the collective of it?
11214920	11217680	Yeah, it's fascinating to see.
11217680	11220640	But now reinvigorated because there's conflict
11220640	11221840	in that part of the world.
11222880	11226040	You've also thought about the Cold War.
11226160	11229040	What lessons about the human mind
11229040	11230800	about psychiatry, psychology,
11231840	11234280	and about looking at the Cold War?
11235440	11238120	Can we take forward in the 21st century
11238120	11241520	so that we can avoid World War III?
11241520	11242360	Right.
11242360	11246800	A major cold or hot war in the 21st century?
11246800	11247760	Yeah.
11247760	11250920	Well, I think unspoken animosities are very,
11250920	11252360	very, very dangerous.
11252360	11254520	I mean, right, it was a Cold War.
11254520	11258280	There was fighting through proxies, right?
11258280	11261840	The superpowers were fighting surrogate wars
11261840	11263480	through proxies, which of course,
11263480	11266080	in and of itself causes immense suffering.
11266080	11271080	But it becomes the opposite of an exchange of ideas
11271360	11273040	or an exchange of thought.
11273040	11275080	You know, I remember the Khrushchev, right?
11275080	11277720	Not believing that the kitchen could look like it did
11277720	11279000	at the World's Fair, right?
11279000	11282080	And some of the misconceptions here
11282080	11284480	of like what things were like in Russia, right?
11285480	11288160	It was a thought that those other people
11288160	11289680	are not actually people, right?
11289680	11292400	There's an enemy society of evil,
11292400	11294680	which then paints with a broad brush
11294680	11296560	in a way that makes it easy,
11296560	11298040	too easy for the Cold War,
11298040	11300320	for it to go from being cold, right?
11300320	11303680	To have it boiling over into utter destruction.
11303680	11307240	And I wrote, it was really a true story
11307240	11311520	that when I was in, it was still the Soviet Union,
11311520	11312600	but it was right around the time
11312600	11314360	the Soviet Union was coming to an end.
11314880	11319880	And it had gone on a trip for students from England.
11319920	11322480	And we got to go places that people like, I hadn't gone.
11322480	11325720	You know, foreigners hadn't gone in many, many years.
11325720	11328800	It was just kind of the right timing to experience that.
11328800	11332760	And like it really is true that someone said on short notice
11332760	11336480	to these poor kids that like these group of Americans
11336480	11338480	were coming and I have a picture somewhere
11338480	11340640	of the kid in a gas mask.
11340640	11343520	Like as they went under their desks and put on a gas mask
11343520	11347400	and they thought, right, that's what, I mean, that's what,
11348440	11349640	they're taught to think about us
11349640	11351520	and we're taught to think about them.
11351520	11355600	And like now we're back in an us them, right?
11355600	11358400	When, you know, we're all trying to survive
11358400	11363400	and we're all such, you know, human life is so delicate,
11364520	11365360	right?
11365360	11367280	You know, let alone human happiness
11367280	11370560	and we make these divisions and we create this aggression
11370560	11371600	and latent aggression.
11371600	11373240	I mean, during the Cold War, we developed, right,
11373240	11375400	the ability to destroy the earth, right?
11375400	11377720	And then just sat looking at one another, you know,
11377720	11380360	with further growing misunderstanding
11380360	11382760	and the opportunity for the proxy fights.
11382760	11384880	Like I said, the Cuban Missile Crisis,
11384880	11387240	which I know wasn't a war, but it's an aspect of that, right?
11387240	11390640	Where we just have ourselves wildly, you know,
11390640	11394680	at risk of destruction without any mutual understanding.
11394680	11397640	And again, I would argue that that is the opposite
11397640	11399480	of the counter entropy, right?
11399480	11401080	Like we are setting everything up
11401080	11403160	for less lack of communication, lack of understanding.
11403160	11405080	How do those feelings of love
11405080	11407960	and shared humanness happen?
11407960	11408800	They don't, right?
11408800	11411680	If you separate people and then we push ourselves
11411680	11415080	more and more and more towards reinstating
11415080	11416600	the state of entropy that's present
11416600	11417960	in the rest of the universe.
11419160	11421280	What advice would you give to young people
11423360	11425760	that are fighting entropy with all their might?
11426760	11430560	So young people and people that are wondering
11430560	11432560	how to find their way in life.
11432560	11434800	What advice would you give?
11434800	11435840	How to have a career?
11435840	11438200	How to have a life they can be proud of?
11439240	11443760	I think starting off with sort of first principles,
11443760	11446160	I'm like, okay, what are my values, right?
11446160	11447440	How do I wanna live life?
11447440	11449720	Because, you know, I'm in my early fifties
11449720	11452240	and when I was a kid, you know, we waited for the,
11452240	11453840	the newspaper came in the afternoon
11453840	11455760	and then, you know, and then we'd see some,
11455760	11456960	okay, what's going on in the world?
11456960	11457800	We'd learn something.
11457800	11460360	I'd get the West Coast baseball scores, right?
11460360	11462520	And learn about, oh, here's what happened
11462520	11464160	in different parts of the world.
11464160	11466840	And by and large, I and everyone else there,
11466840	11470880	adult or child, we're like living in a reality
11470880	11472920	that was largely, our conception was largely
11472920	11474880	what was around us, right?
11474880	11477280	And now, in many ways, it is,
11477280	11479040	I'm not saying it's entirely negative, of course,
11479040	11480040	that we have more information,
11480040	11482640	we can sort of think globally, so to speak, right?
11482720	11485440	But the other side of that is so much
11485440	11489560	of the world's problems are on us all the time, right?
11489560	11491400	Like, here's this awful thing that happened,
11491400	11493040	how many awful things happen each day
11493040	11494720	and they're right in front of us
11494720	11497720	and there's such an immediacy to it all
11497720	11501640	that I think it can be like, paralyze us with terror, right?
11501640	11505040	And for someone who's young and trying to make their ways,
11505040	11506840	like, how do you figure your way out in this world
11506840	11509160	that your word isn't even gonna exist, right?
11509160	11511320	And then you see how profligate
11511320	11514360	the generations before you are, right?
11514360	11517400	In so many ways, and there can become,
11517400	11520280	I think, a push towards extremes, either nihilism
11520280	11523400	or I'm gonna change everything, right?
11523400	11525720	And it's like, how about let's start from,
11525720	11528600	how do I wanna behave in my own community, right?
11528600	11529800	Which starts with like, how do I wanna behave
11529800	11531160	in my household, right?
11531160	11532400	What kind of neighbor do I wanna be?
11532400	11534000	I mean, it might seem like things like that
11534000	11537400	are silly or small in comparison to the big things,
11537400	11538600	but I don't think they are.
11538600	11542120	I think that's how we start building foundations
11542120	11544640	that lets us tackle the big things.
11544640	11547320	And then I do find myself saying what I'm working with,
11547320	11549600	sometimes doing therapy with younger people
11549600	11553880	of helping them kind of bring back their thoughts,
11553880	11557240	their strivings, their decisions more to themselves
11557240	11560440	and living with and around themselves more
11560440	11564560	instead of in something that becomes very theoretical
11564600	11568600	and therefore very threatening and unnerving.
11568600	11570200	So focusing on the people around them,
11570200	11572440	taking one small step at a time
11572440	11576200	to form deeper connections to build something locally.
11577080	11578000	How do I wanna be today?
11578000	11579600	If I go into the grocery store
11579600	11582000	and the person in front of me drops something,
11582000	11583600	I can, I can, I can scow like,
11583600	11584640	I'm in a rush, right?
11584640	11586520	And I could be like that, right?
11586520	11587360	I can be like that.
11587360	11589240	I've been that way many, many times in my life, right?
11589240	11591400	And it's never done anyone a damn bit of good,
11591400	11592640	including me, right?
11592640	11595120	Or I can realize like the 10 seconds aren't gonna matter.
11595120	11597440	Can I help pick that thing up or just smile?
11597440	11599480	These are the seemingly small things
11599480	11602600	that I think make the tenor of our lives.
11602600	11605760	Yeah, I moved, I think I mentioned to you offline,
11605760	11610760	one of the really the main reason I moved to Austin, Texas,
11611080	11612480	I just remembered deciding it.
11612480	11615520	When I went to Walmart and a lady said,
11617320	11619640	you look handsome in that tie
11619640	11622040	or in that suit and tie, whatever.
11622040	11624600	Like, I don't think anyone's ever said older lady,
11624600	11626280	she was very sweet, there's kindness in her eyes.
11626280	11628280	She said that, I don't think anyone ever said anything
11628280	11631240	like that to me in my entire life.
11631240	11634360	And it was just, I don't know.
11634360	11636480	It was like, wow, there's kindness in this world.
11636480	11638280	I know it sounds ridiculous, but like.
11638280	11639440	Does not sound ridiculous.
11639440	11642280	It's like those, you could be that for somebody.
11642280	11644360	You go, go walk around in Walmart.
11644360	11646200	Right, think that you remember that?
11646200	11647040	Yeah.
11647040	11649240	And it's pivotal, you're citing it as,
11649240	11651320	hey, that was a big part of me moving here.
11651320	11653480	So think about the branch point in your life
11653480	11655920	that comes from the simple kindness, right?
11655920	11658600	Of a person who had goodness to give, right?
11658600	11662160	And wasn't scared that you're going to be upset by it.
11662160	11663000	Right?
11663000	11663840	Right, right.
11663840	11666560	She probably didn't have the thought
11666560	11668360	that you could be a sailing, right?
11668360	11670400	Probably she looks at you, she's got goodness to give,
11670400	11671360	it's simple to give it.
11671360	11674600	It's that simple and it's beautiful
11674600	11675640	and it's worth more to you
11675640	11677200	than like how many studies would be on,
11677200	11679080	where's it right to live or this and that?
11679080	11679920	None of that matters.
11680520	11681360	It was just that.
11681360	11682360	The freedom to be kind.
11682360	11683560	And that's emotion.
11683560	11684840	That's not logic at all.
11684840	11685680	Right?
11685680	11688160	That's purely just human emotion
11688160	11689800	and a little bit of humaneness,
11689800	11691960	that little bit of connection.
11691960	11694880	And then that's what makes life great.
11694880	11696680	Which is why it's not a bad idea, right?
11696680	11698760	That you moved here that way,
11698760	11701320	instead of, one could say, well,
11701320	11702240	I can't believe you did that,
11702240	11703520	instead of looking at all the data
11703520	11705760	and hiring consultants of what's the best place to live.
11705760	11707160	But that would be wrong, right?
11707160	11709520	Like you made a good decision, right?
11709520	11711080	Like that was good data.
11711080	11712600	It was impactful data,
11712600	11715320	even in your thoughts about how you're happy living here,
11715320	11716160	right?
11716160	11717280	It's not that, oh, you discount,
11717280	11718600	you short change yourself
11718600	11721040	by not relying on all the logic, right?
11721040	11722600	You felt something about the place
11722600	11724920	and you felt it as symbolized in a person
11724920	11726760	and that made the choice for you.
11726760	11728160	It's a balance, of course,
11728160	11730760	but you also have to know yourself a little bit.
11730760	11733400	Sometimes you can find stability and comfort
11733400	11736880	and kind of reasoning things out a little bit.
11736880	11741400	Maybe as people close to me have sometimes criticized
11741400	11744200	in that I'm a little bit too romantic,
11744200	11746640	where I'll just follow the feeling.
11746640	11750360	And life, there's physics,
11750360	11753000	there's a reality to this world.
11753000	11758000	Sometimes reality doesn't allow you to flourish
11758840	11760200	if you just follow your feelings,
11760200	11762120	but there's a dance there.
11762120	11765760	And happiness is ultimately found in that landscape
11766360	11771360	feeling and emotion versus facts and reason and logic.
11771360	11772960	As you said, have their place, right?
11772960	11773800	Everything.
11773800	11775240	They have their place,
11775240	11777240	but they're not the be all and end all.
11778560	11780480	You're an incredible person.
11780480	11782600	Andrew Huberman is a friend of yours.
11782600	11784560	He said, you absolutely must talk,
11786080	11787920	called Dicerot.
11787920	11789080	The number of people you know,
11789080	11790400	they're just incredible people.
11790400	11792840	There's just this group of folks
11792840	11796040	that somehow helped each other flourish and grew together.
11796040	11798480	And I'm just, I'm so happy you exist.
11798480	11800480	I'm so happy you're doing the work you're doing.
11800480	11802120	I can't wait for your second book.
11802120	11802960	Thank you.
11802960	11804160	And thank you for talking today.
11804160	11805280	This was really cool.
11805280	11806120	Thank you so much.
11806120	11810400	I'm proud to be among the group of people that you cited.
11810400	11811280	Proud to be their friend
11811280	11812920	and proud that you've had me on today.
11812920	11813760	Thank you so much.

11825960	11828360	Everything can be taken from a man,
11828360	11830840	but the last of the human freedoms,
11830840	11834520	to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.
11835520	11838600	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
