1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you have a democratic style of governance, you are entrusting people with one of the most

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
awesome and radical of responsibilities. And that's saying that you're going to pick the people

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history. If you're

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,520
going to trust people to vote correctly, you have to be able to trust them to have open

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,920
and honest dialogue with each other. Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,880
you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,200
determinations when they hear these types of speeches. And if you're so worried that somebody's

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,120
going to hear a certain political figure and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly,

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,960
then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy to be a

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
viable institution, which is fine. You can be anti-democratic, but I don't think you can be

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,560
pro-democracy and anti-free speech. The following is a conversation with Stephen Bonnell,

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,560
also known online as Destiny. He's a video game streamer and political commentator,

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,440
one of the early pioneers of both live streaming in general and live streamed political debate and

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,320
discourse. Politically, he is a progressive, identifying as either left or far left, depending

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,600
on your perspective. There are many reasons I wanted to talk to Stephen. First, I just talked

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,240
to Ben Shapiro and many people have told me that Stephen is the Ben Shapiro of the left

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,000
in terms of political perspective and exceptional debate skills. Second reason

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,280
is he skillfully defends some nuanced, non-standard views, at the same time being pro-establishment,

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,400
pro-institutions, and pro-Biden, while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,000
Third reason is he has been there at the beginning and throughout the meteoric rise of the video

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,640
game live streaming community. In some mainstream circles, this community is not taken seriously,

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,120
perhaps because of its demographic distribution skewing young or perhaps because of the sometimes

23
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,680
harsh style of communication. But I think this community should be taken seriously and shown

24
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,920
respect. Millions of young minds tune into live streams like Destiny's to question and to try

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,880
to understand what is going on with the world, often exploring challenging, even controversial

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,160
ideas. The language is sometimes harsher and the humor is sometimes meaner than I would prefer,

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,040
but I, grandpa Lex, put on my rain boots and went into the beautiful chaotic muck of online discourse

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,680
and have so far survived to tell the tale with a smile and even more love in my heart than before.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,560
On top of all this, we were lucky to have Malina Goranson, a popular streamer and world traveler,

30
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,640
join us at the end of the conversation. You can check out her channel on twitch.tv

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,520
now, dear friends, here's destiny. I don't know if you watched me watching your

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,200
yay interview. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm so curious. When you're navigating a conversation

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,440
like that, are you, how intentional is the thought process between like building rapport and pushing

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,560
and giving a little and letting like zero, zero intention? I was watching and thank you so much.

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,880
I was very kind for you to review that conversation. It meant a lot that you were

38
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,080
complimentary in parts on the technical aspects of the conversation, but no, zero. And I'm actually

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,840
deliberately trying to avoid, I think you've called it debate brain, which is just another

40
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:50,400
flavor of thinking about like the meta conversation, trying to optimize how should this conversation go.

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,040
Because I feel like the more you do that, the better you get at that, the less human connection

42
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,040
you have. Like the less genuinely you're actually sitting there in the moment and listening to the

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,520
person, you're more like calculating what's the right thing to say versus like feeling. What is

44
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,640
that person feeling right now? What are they thinking? That's what I'm trying to do is like

45
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,240
putting myself in their mind and thinking, what does the world look like to them? What does the world

46
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,280
feel like to them? And so from that, I truly try to listen. Now I'm also learning, especially because

47
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,240
Rogan and others have been giving me shit for not pushing back. It's good sometimes to say

48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,800
from a place of care for the other human being to say, stop. What did you just say? I don't think

49
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,840
that represents who you are and what you really mean. Or maybe if it does at that time represents

50
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,560
who they are, I can see a better world if they grow into a different direction and try to point

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,040
that direction out to them. There's a really complicated dance between letting somebody

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,560
share their full story versus letting somebody like essentially proselytize your audience and

53
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,160
it's like, okay, hold on, let's take a minute here. But yeah, I used to be four or five years ago,

54
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
it was attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, whatever you said. And now I'm leaning way more

55
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
towards the like, okay, well, tell me how you feel about everything and then we'll go from there.

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,640
So a lot of people like my new approach, some older fans will watch and they're like,

57
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,000
why are you letting this guy just ramble on? You know, he said like five or six wrong things and

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,040
you're only going to call them out on two of them and it's like, it's different styles of

59
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,720
conversation, but yeah. Do you do a lot of research beforehand too? Depending on the

60
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,000
conversation, yeah. So if we're going to talk like vaccines and stuff, yeah, that's a ton of

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,040
reading and stuff that I never thought I'd know going into it. If it's a more personal, like political

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,560
philosophy conversation, there's not as much you can prepare for just, it truly depends on the

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,960
conversation. How much are you actually listening to the other person? Always listening, you have

64
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,640
to listen because as soon as you stop listening, the quality of everything falls apart, the connection

65
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,320
disappears, the quality of the conversation disappears, but my natural inclination is to

66
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
just be way more aggressive than normal. So I have to constantly remind myself, I guess you would

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
call it a meta conversation when you're like, okay, he's probably saying this because of that or

68
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
we'll let him go here and then we'll stop later. But yeah, because my preferred style of conversation

69
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,640
is like, I'm going to talk and the second I say something you disagree with, then let's

70
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,760
iron it out, right? I got like, I think in like syllogisms, like, okay, here's premise A,

71
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,880
good, okay, premise B, okay, and then conclusion. And then as long as we're both deductively

72
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,880
sound, we're not crazy, no psychosis, then we're going to agree on everything. Whereas other people

73
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
like to, most people think in stories like narratives, like a whole, there's a whole like

74
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
narrative and the individual facts don't matter as much because they'll pick and choose what they

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
want. And it's really hard because everybody thinks narratives have to function in that world,

76
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,600
but it's frustrating for me sometimes. Well, I've seen, you've had a lot of excellent debates.

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,320
One of them I just recently last night watched is on systemic racism. And it's the first time

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,640
I've seen you completely lose your shit. Oh, shoot, who was that against? I'm not sure exactly,

79
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,880
but you were just very frustrated and sorry, not lose your shit, but you're frustrated constantly

80
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,200
because of the thing, let's lay out 123. And every time you try to lay it out, it would falter.

81
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,320
I think it had to do with sort of, can you use data to make an argument? Or do you need to use

82
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,120
a study that does an interpretation of that data? And then there's like this tension between,

83
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,520
I think this is a behavioral economist that you were talking to. And the point is, you do this

84
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,000
kind of nice layout that the whole point of behavioral economics, it says there's more

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,600
to it than just the data you have to give a context and like do the rich, rigorous interpretation

86
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,080
in the context of the full human story. And then there was like a dance back and forth. Sometimes

87
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,960
you use data, sometimes not, and you're getting really frustrated and shutting down. And so that

88
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
felt like a failure mode. I've seen Sam Harris have similar sticking points. Like if we can't

89
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,520
agree on the terminology, we can't go on. To me, I feel like the Wittgenstein perspective is like,

90
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,880
I think if you get stuck on any one thing, you're just not going to make progress. You have to,

91
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:02,080
part of the conversation has to be about doing a good dance together versus being

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,480
dogmatically stuck on the path to truth. I think the true challenge is identifying

93
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:15,040
what of those sticking points are important versus what is not important. It's like if I'm

94
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,240
having an argument with somebody about Jewish representation and media, it might be like a

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
big conversation and they might say a couple things. I think Jewish people, they tend to help

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,120
their own or whatever and saying, okay. But for the purpose of the conversation, we can keep moving.

97
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,040
But if they casually drop like, yeah, and I think that's why the Holocaust numbers were

98
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,320
blown up from like 100,000 to 6 million. And I was like, okay, hold on, wait,

99
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,720
if you think this, we have to stop here because this is going to be, it's not just a language

100
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,480
game in this part. If you really believe this fact, then the whole rest of the conversation is

101
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,480
going to be informed by that belief. And it has to be something that doesn't bother you personally.

102
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,840
You have to step outside your own ego. So Holocaust denial is somebody that would bother a lot of

103
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,200
people and there's some things just observing you. I feel like when you get really good at

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,000
conversation, you can become a stickler to, you might have your favorite terms that really

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,640
bothers you. People don't agree on those terms. Beggs the question. You mean racing the question.

106
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,280
Yeah, I usually just want, people say stuff, I just let it slide, yeah. Because if you fight,

107
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,000
when you're having a conversation with somebody and you're talking to their audience at the

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
same time, because that's really what's happening, you never want to come off as over combative or

109
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
over aggressive because it puts people in like, there's like a trigger in your brain and this

110
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
is true of relationships or friendships of persuasive rhetoric or whatever. There's a

111
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
trigger in the brain and as soon as that defensive trigger gets like flipped on,

112
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
everything is over. You've lost the ability to persuade because everything becomes a fight at

113
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,000
that point. Yeah. Well, I wanted to talk to you because I heard somewhere that you were referred

114
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,120
to as the Ben Shapiro of the left and since I'm talking with Ben as well, I wanted to sort of

115
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,960
complete spiritually this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head. You are a progressive

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,840
but a progressive with many nonstandard progressive views and you had a heck of a fascinating

117
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,280
journey through all of that. And like I said, I think you argue with passion sometimes with

118
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,200
excessive amounts of passion. That's a really polite way of saying that. Almost always with

119
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,320
good faith and with rigor, with seriousness. I asked on your subreddit, which is an excellent

120
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,040
subreddit. Shout out to the Destiny subreddit so much, at least for that particular post.

121
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,640
What I really loved is when I asked for questions for you, there were like, holy

122
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,880
shit, there's adults and there's all behave. Like nobody say incest. I was like, what was going on

123
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,920
here? But actually the questions that rose to the top were really good. So somebody said that

124
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,560
Destiny was speaking of your journey was a conservative in his early teens. Then he became

125
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,880
libertarian. Then he became a left-wing social justice warrior. Then he flirted with socialism.

126
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
And now he is a social democrat liberal. I've also heard you refer to yourself

127
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,960
as a far left person. So to the degree there's truth to that journey. Can you take me through

128
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,560
your evolution through the landscape of political ideologies that you went through?

129
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:16,400
So my dad comes from Kentucky and my mom is a Cuban immigrant. Cubans are notorious for being

130
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,200
very conservative in the United States for historical reasons and for other reasons.

131
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,080
But my upbringing was a very Republican one. I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck,

132
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,680
Michael Savage on the radio, Billy Cunningham. I think Sean Hannity a little bit later on,

133
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,200
like that was like my whole upbringing politically. I remember I was writing,

134
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,720
I'd written like articles for the school journal, like in favor of

135
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,840
defending the war in Iraq and defending Bush from all the criticism, etc. So that was my

136
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,480
upbringing. I think once I hit high school college, I had my edgy, like libertarian-esque

137
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,160
high school phase of like reading Ayn Rand, of figuring out that like, oh my god, nothing in life

138
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,960
matters except for class and money. That's actually the answer to everything. And I got to college,

139
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,800
I became a Ron Paul fan, very big Ron Paul fan. And then from there, I kind of work, do life, life

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,880
happens at the kind of the lowest point in my life in terms of where I'm working financially.

141
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,920
Everything is like kind of in ruin in my life. There's a whole bunch of dumb stuff that's happened

142
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,480
probably my most conservative point. I don't know what it is about like being poor and thinking like

143
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
you can work your way out of it, you can do whatever. It's just my upbringing is always just

144
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
like, if you're not, if you're not, if you're not having financial success, just work, work, work,

145
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,280
work, work. And then I got into streaming, very, very lucky break. Everything just lined up at

146
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,560
the right time. And then as I've progressed through streaming, I would say through the years,

147
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,520
I've gradually fallen more and more to the left, especially once my kid turned four, five, six years

148
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,320
old. And I started to see like how much different his life was, just because of the financial

149
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,160
opportunities that I was able to provide for him through no merit of his own. And that started

150
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,400
to radically change how I viewed the world in a lot of ways. So actually, let's like linger on that.

151
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,680
Yeah. Low point. You worked at McDonald's, you worked at a casino, you did carpet cleaning.

152
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,960
What was the lowest point? Definitely the carpet cleaning.

153
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,160
Really? Absolutely. Why? Why was it the lowest point? That's when you were just flirting with

154
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,920
starting streaming. My whole life has been a series of lucky breaks, really, truly. I grew up

155
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,920
playing a lot of video games. But back in my day, our day, you had to read, there was a lot of text

156
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,320
on the screen. Back in my day, we used to play... They didn't all talk to you. Yeah, because nowadays,

157
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
everything's voice acting. But back then, you'd have to read a lot. I was a really good reader

158
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,200
and a really good vocabulary. Yeah, I've heard you actually say that. What games are we talking

159
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,960
about? What do you mean just reading? You're talking about like RPGs or what? Yeah, JRPGs. So

160
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,040
like Final Fantasy games, Fantasy Stars, all of these, like any RPG that would have been on the

161
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,920
SNES, Sega, PlayStation, these are the things that I'm... Let's pause on that. Okay. I just talked

162
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:54,880
to Howard, who's of the Elder Scrolls fame and the Fallout fame and beyond. What's your thoughts

163
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:02,080
on Elder Scrolls? Why Skyrim the greatest RPG of all time? Man, I really don't like Skyrim or Fallout.

164
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,600
You don't love it. Oh, really? No, not at all. Why do you hate Skyrim?

165
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,920
Yeah, so I really like characters and like compelling stories and narratives around those

166
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,920
characters. And I like to see them kind of like grow and change kind of like a movie or a story.

167
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,160
So in your like Final Fantasy games, you've got characters. There are a lot of like,

168
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,840
like classical tropes of like a character starts off kind of like edgy angsty all on their own.

169
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,760
They develop relationships, friendships, they realize that the life is more about themselves

170
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,520
and they do that. And I like that growth. That's kind of what you see in all of those old role

171
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,120
playing games. I didn't like the open world ones as much because your main character is just like

172
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,240
a blank slate, never talks. It's for you to like project onto. But there's not the same like linear

173
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,480
narrative of like growth for the character. Oh, that's fascinating. There's an actual story arc

174
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,960
to the character that's more crafted in a beautiful way by the designers of the game. Yeah.

175
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,240
I don't think one is better or worse. I tend towards like, I want to hear a compelling story

176
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
around like a set of characters that like grow and change just again. Oh, that's beautifully

177
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,440
put then. Yeah, I just really loved being able to leave the town, you go outside the town and you

178
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,160
look outside its nature and the world of possibilities is before you. You can do whatever the fuck you

179
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,680
want. I mean, that immensity of just being lost in the world is really immersive for me. But yeah,

180
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,400
you're right. Whatever attracts you about a world. So you were just starting to play video games.

181
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,360
You go out play to video games. That's one of your lucky breaks.

182
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
There's just like a lot of random skills you pick up depending on the type of game you play.

183
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
I played a lot of tech space games on the computer. So I was a very fast type or I'm still a very

184
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,520
fast type or read a lot, you know, learn weird kind of math stuff for some of the calculations,

185
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,880
some of the games. I think I'm pretty good at getting information, figuring stuff out, learning

186
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,280
patterns, all of that. And then that plus the reading and everything in the games meant that I

187
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,520
I don't want to say I excelled in school because my grades were pretty bad, but I was on like all

188
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,000
honors, all AP classes or whatever. A lot of dual enrollment, a lot of AP credit going into college.

189
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,520
So I did pretty well in school, probably better than I should have, but it was because I had the

190
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,040
game stuff that was like really powering a lot of my brain there while I was trying to sleep

191
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,560
through class. So you're able to soak in information, integrate it, quickly take notes.

192
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,120
Generally, I think I'm pretty good at that. You do this a lot when you stream your typing stuff.

193
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,320
Is there a system in that note taking? And what note what do you use for note taking?

194
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Does it matter? I use a notepad. Like notepad.exe notepad.exe not the plus plus not.

195
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
Is there genius to the madness behind that? Or you just don't give a shit?

196
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,080
No, I mean, it's going to depend on the style of conversation. If I'm with somebody that is

197
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,800
very meticulously organized their thoughts and they're a fine and better word here for Rambler,

198
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,240
you can edit that in, better word for Rambler. Somebody that talks a lot and a lot, I'll start

199
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,800
like taking notes, bullet points like this, this, this, this, this, this, this, because there's a

200
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,960
style of conversation where I say seven or eight different things. And then when you go to respond

201
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,480
to everything I said, I cut you off immediately and we argue that point. But if somebody's going

202
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
to do that, he's just like, hold on, you just said these eight things, I'm going to respond to

203
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,800
every single one. I've written them all down and then you can go, if you want to go point by

204
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
point, we can, but you just said all this and I wrote it down, so we're going to go.

205
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,560
So what are you actually writing down like a couple of words per point they left?

206
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,040
Honestly, like there are very few unique conversations in politics. Like a lot of them

207
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,520
are kind of retreading old ground. So if we're having a debate on abortion, somebody might say,

208
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,800
like, oh, well, I believe this thing about viability. And I believe this thing about, you

209
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,080
know, when they're a fetus versus a human and I'll just write down like those points so that when

210
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,600
I go to respond, I kind of have like a like note cards, like a guiding thing there to

211
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,120
keep me centered on my response. Political discourse is a kind of tree you're walking

212
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,840
down and I got it and you're like taking just to keep my focus guided. So I'm not like

213
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,320
running off in a weird tangent or responding to something I didn't say or something.

214
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,120
What about like doing research? It's just, is there a system to your note taking? Because

215
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,320
mentally, you seem to be one of the most organized people I've listened to. So is there,

216
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,960
is it in your mind or is there a system that's on paper?

217
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,960
A little of both. I feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing if you have interest in an area.

218
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,520
So like what I'll tell people is, let's say there's like a totally new topic that I'm

219
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,480
researching. I don't know anything. And I'll do a couple of these on stream. I think they're boring

220
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,720
about it. People watch it. I might open a Wikipedia article and I'll read and I hit something I don't

221
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
know. And then I open the next Wikipedia article and I'll read into and then I might have like seven

222
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,240
tabs open and I'll read and I'll read and I'll read. And I'll read a ton of stuff maybe for

223
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
hour two, three, four hours of stuff. And then by the end, you know, someone in chat will ask me

224
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,880
like, do you even remember like this particular thing? And I'll say, not really. No, not too much.

225
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
But what happens is as long as you've seen it once, what'll happen is like the next day of the

226
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,720
day after we'll read something else. And we're like, oh, I remember that thing from this thing.

227
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
I remember like vaguely that. And then if you see it like a third time, you're like, oh, this

228
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,280
makes sense because especially when it comes to, oh, here's like a little trick on stuff. If you're

229
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,240
ever reading any news and there's a place that pops up, always look at it on a map because so

230
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,480
much of history is like on a map. It's so important to like know the geography. It makes things make

231
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,360
so much more sense. But yeah, once I once I start to see stuff over and over again, just because

232
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,800
I've like read it a few times, stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind and like, oh, yeah,

233
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,240
well, this makes sense. Of course, these people believe this because of this or of course, like

234
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
this happened here, it's because you know, that happened there. So yeah, it's a lot of that if

235
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,440
there's like a topic that I'm doing specific research for. So like vaccine related stuff is a

236
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,240
big one. The Ukrainian Russian conflict is a big one. That I'll break out a note. I'll probably

237
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
get like a Google doc and I'll just start like writing like an outline of kind of the rough

238
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,880
points of everything just to organize my thoughts around different topics. Yeah.

239
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,240
We're just going to go on tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent. We'll return to the

240
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,400
low point of your life at some point, always returning from the philosophy to the psychology.

241
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:37,760
So you did the Ukraine topic. One question is, what role does US play in this war? Could they

242
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,320
have done something to avoid the war? Did they have a role to play in forcing Vladimir Putin's

243
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:52,880
hand? Do they have a role to play in deescalating the war towards a peace agreement and the opposite?

244
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,400
If it does escalate towards something like the use of a tactical nuclear weapon,

245
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,600
are they to blame? Are we to blame? Oh man, somebody sent me an email a while ago with great

246
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,520
words. There's a specific way to navigate a conversation where you can kind of like contribute

247
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,800
to a negative event, but you're not really the one responsible for it. Like the classic example

248
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,480
is a woman goes out late at night, gets a little bit too drunk, and then something happens. And

249
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,160
it's like, while there might have been steps you could have taken to mitigate the risk,

250
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,680
it's not her fault of what happened because the responsibility rests on the agent making

251
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,920
the choice, right? There's a chooser at some point that is choosing to do wrong or evil.

252
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,760
I don't believe in any of the arguments that say the United States has contributed to Russia's

253
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,480
position on Ukraine or the actions that they've taken on Ukraine. There are several arguments

254
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,000
that some people, some even political scholars are putting out there to say that the United

255
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,680
States is to blame, but I find them completely unconvincing. I think that when you ask the

256
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,000
question of like, what is the United States role or what has our role been? I think it's

257
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,960
really important for us. I don't think we even agree as a country on what our role should be,

258
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,800
which I think is a hard one because you've got this kind of, there's this growing populist

259
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,560
movement in the United States. It might be the far left and the far right. And I think populists

260
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,120
tend to have this kind of isolationist view of the world where the United States should just be

261
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
our own thing. We shouldn't be telling anybody what to do. We shouldn't be the world police.

262
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
And then kind of more in these like center left, center right positions. And then across a lot of

263
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Europe, you've got, well, okay, the United States is kind of like the big kid on the block.

264
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,480
Like we're looking to them for guidance and leadership on situations like what's going on

265
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,760
in Ukraine. So in so far as the original question is like, what is like the United

266
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,000
States responsibility? I think we have a responsibility to ensure the relative like

267
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,280
freedom, prosperity and stability across Europe. I think that defending Ukraine's sovereignty

268
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,920
and right to their borders is a part of that. And I don't believe that prior to the invasion

269
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,280
in 2022, I don't think the United States was contributing to Russia invading that country.

270
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,400
I know there are arguments given that like the expansion of NATO has something that's been

271
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,720
threatening to Russia, but the Baltics joined and Russia didn't do anything about it. The

272
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,600
invasion to Crimea was very clearly a response to the revolution in 2014. The invasion on the

273
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,600
borders is clearly a response to Ukraine winning that civil war in the Southeast and the Donbass

274
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,120
and Russia becoming more aggressive. I don't think that you can blame any of that on NATO

275
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,160
expansion. There's no NATO countries that are threatening Russia or debating Russia.

276
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,160
Do you think there is a nuclear threat? Do you think about this? Do you worry about this that

277
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,560
there is a threat of a tactical nuclear weapon being dropped? I think that possibility exists

278
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,520
either way. I think the responsibility for that is on Russia because it just can't be the case

279
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,120
that if you have nukes, you're allowed to invade countries and take their land. Because of anything,

280
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,320
I think that that down the road also increases the potential for nuclear problems in the future,

281
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
because at that point, either every single country has to acquire their own nuclear weapons,

282
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
because if you don't, Russia's going to mess with you, or every single country has to join NATO,

283
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440
and now what? We're back at square zero, ground zero, square one, where people are like,

284
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,240
oh, well look, all these countries joining NATO is aggressive towards Russia. What are you going

285
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,120
to do? Yeah, you've mentioned that there's a complicated calculus going on with the countries

286
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,520
that have nuclear weapons, and what's our responsibility? Are you allowed to do anything

287
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,280
you want to countries that don't have nuclear weapons? That's a really tricky discussion,

288
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,520
for sure, because what is U.S. supposed to do if Russia drops a tactical nuclear weapon?

289
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:29,280
There's a set of options, none of which are good, and it's such a tricky moment right now,

290
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,960
because the things that Biden and other public figures say, I feel like has a significant impact

291
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,040
on the way this game turns out, because I think mutually assured destruction is partially a game

292
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:50,400
of words. I mean, I believe in the power of conversation of leaders talking to each other.

293
00:23:50,400 --> 00:24:01,040
I feel like you have to have a balance between threat and compromise, and empathy for the needs,

294
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:09,920
the geopolitical, the economic needs of a nation, but also respect and represent your own interests.

295
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,720
It's a tricky one. How do you play the hand? It reminds me of, I don't know if you've ever

296
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,160
heard of evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology. There are things called tit for tat

297
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,120
strategies. It reminds me of that, where there are a whole bunch of these little biological

298
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,560
mechanisms where creatures will develop, like socializing, like tit for tat. If you do something

299
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,720
bad to me, I'm going to do something bad for you, and then more complicated schemes will come out,

300
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
where it'll be like tit, tit for tat, where it's like you can make one mistake, and then I'm going

301
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,640
to get you to do a second one, or it could be tit, tit, tit for tat, or there could be tit for tat,

302
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,800
tat for tat. There's all these back and forths where creatures optimize themselves. I think

303
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,400
something the United States did really well in terms of that kind of conversational strategy,

304
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,280
and I approved of this in the beginning, was Biden was very clear about setting out the exact

305
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,520
level of US involvement for the war. We're not going to do a no-fly zone. There's not going to be

306
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,800
US troops on the ground in Ukraine, but we are going to send a whole bunch of money and a whole

307
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,560
bunch of arms and a whole bunch of intel to them. I thought he did a good job at laying out the

308
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,480
limitation of the US involvement while opening as much as we could in the ways that we could help,

309
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:16,080
but that looming threat of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon, I think on the table right now

310
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,520
is like it's going to be the annihilation of Russian seaforces and everything, but

311
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
what happens if it continues to escalate? That's like a world that nobody wants to

312
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,000
be in. Yeah. So we talked about difficult conversations, and again, thank you so much

313
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,760
for reviewing the Yale conversation. Let me ask you about Putin. Speaking of difficult conversations,

314
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,880
so if you sit down, if I sit down with somebody like Vladimir Putin or Vladimir Zelensky,

315
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,440
what's the right way to have that conversation? Oh man. We can talk about that one or we could talk

316
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:57,520
about somebody more well understood through history like Stalin or Hitler, something like that.

317
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,080
Maybe that's an easier example to illustrate how to handle extremely difficult conversations.

318
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,960
Yeah. I mean, I can handle really difficult conversations between like two people,

319
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,560
leaders of countries though. There's so much that you are representing in that conversation.

320
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,560
I guess the thing that would be interesting to me would be like, what is Vladimir Putin's

321
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,400
interest? What is the genuine interest that he has in the conflict? Because I think finding out

322
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,400
like what is your buy-in or what is the driving force keeping you here is probably the most

323
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,480
important thing. I think for Zelensky, I think it's quite a bit more simpler because he's

324
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,080
on the defense, so it's defending his country and his people. For Putin, I've heard all sorts of

325
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,600
things. Dugan has his writings on like the East versus the West, the collapse of the West in the

326
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,280
face of all of the liberalism and the weird LGBT stuff that they criticize. You've got the desire

327
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,840
to return to this former Soviet Union-esque thing. You've got Putin's quotes that collapse of the

328
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,680
Soviet Union was the biggest geopolitical disaster of 20th century. I guess figuring out what is

329
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,080
Putin after. I'm not actually sure. I don't know the answer to that question. I know a lot of people

330
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
write about it, but yeah. Well, there's a lot of answers to that question. There's a lot of answers

331
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,520
that he can give to that question, so say I sit down with him for three hours and talk about it.

332
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,040
I think this is a really interesting distinction because you do do difficult conversations

333
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,720
in the space of ideas, but also in your stream, there's a bunch of drama going on. There's the

334
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:31,200
human psychology is laid out in its full richness before you. To me with leaders, I think a part of

335
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,800
the conversation has to be about the human psychology, not like a meta-conversation, but

336
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,120
really understand what they feel, what they fear, who they are as a human being. As a family man,

337
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,760
as a person proud of their country, as a person with an ego, as a person who's been

338
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,520
affected, if not corrupted by powers, all of us can be and likely are. All of that,

339
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,840
that gives context to then the answers about what do you want in this war, because the answers

340
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,400
about what you want in this war will be political answers. It's a game that's being played again

341
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,280
with words, and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game. I think the deeper truth

342
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,000
comes from understanding the human being from which those words come, and I think that's what

343
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,760
you do. I don't know if you do those kinds of conversations where- Never talked to any country

344
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,040
leader, so- No, not a country leader, but say a controversial figure or somebody that represents

345
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,880
a certain idea. Don't just talk in a space of ideas or challenge the ideas, but understand who

346
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,360
is this person, how did you come to those ideas? Oh yeah, when I've had, there have been a couple

347
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,960
of very controversial right-leaning figures. So the two, obviously the mainstream is made by

348
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,200
Lauren Southern and Nick Fuentes. Those types of conversations initially aren't very political at

349
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,240
all. Yeah, it's more like, obviously we believe in very, very, very different things that beliefs

350
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,680
don't happen accidentally, so how did you get to where you are? Those are way more personal

351
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,440
conversations, that's true. Is there things you regret about those conversations where you failed?

352
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,960
Is there things you're proud of or you succeeded? For things that I'm proud of, I feel like I'm

353
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,080
really good at attempting to understand people without judgment, that I think a lot of people

354
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,440
feel like they can have conversations with me where they can share a lot, and I'm not going to jump

355
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,880
down their throat for them having a politically incorrect observation, or for them being judgmental

356
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,480
to somebody else or having a feeling that's maybe not something they should have something they're

357
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,400
embarrassed about. So I think I do a really good job at that, and then by extension of that,

358
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,840
I've gotten the ability to hear perspectives from so many different people that I think I can

359
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,360
understand a lot of different perspectives. For failures of mine, I mean it's always going to be

360
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,400
on stream, it'll be like I didn't push back hard enough or I didn't know a certain fact for a

361
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,800
conversation. These are usually the they're going to be on these like very technical grounds

362
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,160
generally. I'm pretty happy with like the direction my conversations have gone

363
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,760
recently, especially over like the past six months. So your goal is to

364
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:10,800
de-radicalize the audience of those folks. So that used to be my goal. My goal was de-radicalization.

365
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,640
Now I'm kind of hoping that that's just the byproduct. So the goal I think is to talk to

366
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,200
somebody and to show they believe this because of these reasons, and if you want to change

367
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
people's beliefs, we have to talk about the underlying reasons for why they think the things

368
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,400
they think. It's not enough to just say like that belief is bad because it's like, well,

369
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
they believe it for a whole bunch of things that are true and real to them at least. So you have

370
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,320
to address all of the underlying things that they believe before you can change the overlying

371
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,560
belief. So if I'm having a conversation with somebody, it'll be like, okay, why do you feel

372
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,960
this about that, that, and that? Okay, I understand that. Maybe like a better way to solve that would

373
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,320
be like this or that instead of this thing. So to what degree do you have to empathize with the

374
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:55,840
person's worldview versus pushback? That's always the hard one. When I'm talking to other people,

375
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,560
it's almost always me stepping as much inside their bubble as I can. I have to like live and

376
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,360
breathe their worldview and be able to speak their worldview in order to like navigate their thoughts.

377
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,720
Because my worldview is, and I'm not even used as an insult. I don't know if I am a little bit

378
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,320
autistic or something, but when I break apart things, I just want to see like study, study,

379
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,000
study, fact, fact, fact. That's how my mind works for everything. That's what I like to see.

380
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,760
Personal stories don't do much for me. Narratives don't do much for me. Just show me like the

381
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,680
data and the studies or whatever. But for other people, I think most brains are more human than

382
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,240
that and they tend to see things in more kind of like surreal pictures that are kind of painted

383
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
and the brush strokes are way broader and they don't care about the itty-bitty tiny fact.

384
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,400
So if I'm talking to somebody else and I'm trying to get into their head and I'm trying

385
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,040
to change their mind on things, I'm going to be stepping into their world and I'm going to try

386
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,400
to be working through that framework. Really good example might be, we'll say like when it comes

387
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,360
to trans issues for minors, okay, 16 or 17-year-old needs to go on puberty blockers. The way that I

388
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,720
want that debate to play out is let's look at all the data, let's see what are the outcomes,

389
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,840
let's see what are the processes for getting a medication, and then we'll evaluate all of that

390
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,920
and then we'll go in whatever like points more favorably. But that's wholly unconvincing to

391
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,600
most people, right? So as a parent, if I'm having that conversation with another parent,

392
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,280
the easiest way for me to have that conversation is like, hey, we both have kids.

393
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,800
Imagine how horrible it would be if we felt like our kids needed help and the government

394
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,120
was trying to get between us and their doctor in that conversation. That might be how that

395
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,160
talk plays out, which I mean, I think that's a really good argument because I think there

396
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,640
probably are times when the government should get in between it, but I'll have that conversation

397
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,880
because now I'm in a world where they understand what I'm saying, I'm resonating with the way

398
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,800
that they feel about things and then I can make progress with the way that they're kind of viewing

399
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,120
the world because I'm talking in a language they understand. So on this particular topic of

400
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,120
trans issues, is that the reason you were banned from Twitch? I'm not sure. I don't know. They just

401
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,520
said hate speech, but I don't use like slurs or anything. So it's hard to know exactly. So I think

402
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,480
you made the claim that trans women shouldn't compete with cis women in the women's athletics.

403
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Can you make this case and can you still man the case against it? I think in your community,

404
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,920
there's a lot of trans folks who love you and there's a lot who hate you. Yeah. And so if you

405
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,000
can walk the tightrope of this conversation to try to steal men both sides. One of the argumentative

406
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,200
strategies I say is that like anytime you have a conversation, you should be able to argue both

407
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,640
sides better than anybody else. So for the my side, the genuine belief side, it feels like

408
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:32,960
overwhelmingly all of the data is showing that trans women, even after I think three years on

409
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:39,680
some sort of like HRT or estrogen stuff, they're still maintaining these advantages from their

410
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,680
male puberty over cisgender women. And if that is the case, if we are going to draw these distinctions

411
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,040
around our sports between women and men, it feels unfair to have a category inside the women's

412
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,320
sports that are maintaining advantages that are coming from a male puberty, regardless of the

413
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,160
amount of time they've spent on hormone replacement therapy. So that would be my argument on that side.

414
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,560
So it's unfair from a performance enhancement aspect. So the same way we ban performance

415
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,680
enhancing drugs that involve increasing of testosterone in that same way would be unfair.

416
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:22,800
Essentially, yeah. So what's the case against? So the case in favor of them competing together is

417
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,360
that realistically, there's not going to be a trans sports category. Realistically, trans women

418
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,240
aren't going to be competitive with cis men because they've gone through these huge,

419
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,000
you know, like hormone changes by the medication they're taking. And that when we look at how

420
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,440
sports are kind of done anyway, there's a whole bunch of biological differences between people

421
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,920
within sports categories that are determining their placement in the professional world.

422
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,320
So for instance, somebody like me is probably never going to go far in the NBA because I'm not

423
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,320
tall enough. I think the average height in the NBA. Don't doubt yourself. Don't doubt myself yet.

424
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,240
I want to say like six or something. They're huge people. Or, you know, you look at like Michael

425
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,360
Phelps is a classic example of a guy whose torso is like so long his body is built for swimming.

426
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,800
And I think there are some trans people that will look at that or somebody advocating for

427
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,040
this position. They'll look at that and go, okay, realistically, the way that Michael Phelps body

428
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,520
processes lactic acid, the shape physiologically of his body is going to put him in a level of

429
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,240
competition that so many men are never going to reach just because of biology. How is it fair

430
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,160
that you can have these biological outliers competing in these categories? But then when we

431
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,840
come to like sports categories with trans and cis women, you're going to take trans women and say

432
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,440
that they can't compete against cis women. Can't you also just say that they have some level of

433
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,040
biological difference there? Like, is it really going to be that great of a difference than what

434
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,360
Michael Phelps has versus the average swimmer or an NBA player has versus like the average height

435
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:50,480
male? Yeah, do you think we're going to get into some tricky ethical territory as we start to be

436
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,120
able to, through biology and genetics, modify the human body? Absolutely. I feel like those

437
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:03,680
things are coming sooner than we wanted them to. Oh, man, dude, have you seen the AI art?

438
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,840
Yes, of course. I'm an AI person. Oh, okay, then yeah, yeah. That's always been like,

439
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,240
what's going to happen when robots can do art better than humans, lol? Like, well,

440
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,800
we'll see you in 20 years and 20 years and 20 years. And now you have AI art winning competitions.

441
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,280
And it's funny because robots are essentially... There's a robot behind you, by the way.

442
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,880
A robot behind me. Oh, nice. Robots are really good at... Careful what you say. Yeah. Oh,

443
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,800
god, I'll be careful. That's not like the one of the Chinese ones with a gun on it, right? Oh, okay.

444
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:41,760
Hopefully not. We'll see, depending on what you say, yeah. Robots are really good at showing

445
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,480
the limitations of the human mind in categories that we didn't believe we were limited before.

446
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,400
I think that humans have this idea, intrinsically, that we have some type of innovative creative

447
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,400
drive that is just outside of the bounds of physical understanding. And with a sophisticated

448
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,880
enough program, we see that maybe that's not actually true. And that's a really scary thing

449
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,440
philosophically to deal with because we feel like we're very special, right? We own the planet,

450
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,280
we make computers, and the idea that you can start to get these robots that can do things that's

451
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,160
like, okay, you can do math, fine. Okay, you can do calculations, fine. But you can't do art.

452
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,840
That's the human stuff. And then when they start to do that, it's like, oh, shoot.

453
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,520
And that terrifies you a little bit, like the human species losing control of our dominance?

454
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,160
I don't think it's necessarily losing control of our dominance. I mean, I guess a Skynet thing

455
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,320
could come in at some point. But I think it brings us to this really fundamental level of like,

456
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,400
what does it mean to be human? What is it that we're good at? What should we be doing with

457
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,960
technology? We never really asked that question in the Western world. It's always the technology is

458
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,600
like normative in that technology equals good, and more technology equals better. That's been

459
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,440
like the default assumption. In fact, if you ask a lot of people, how do you know if civilization

460
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,680
has progressed over the past 100 or 200 years, they don't say we have better relationships,

461
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,600
we, you know, have longer marriages, we blah, blah, blah, they'll say technology has improved.

462
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,320
We've got crazy phones, we've got crazy computers. And the idea that more technology might be bad

463
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,840
has never even crossed somebody's mind, unless it's used for like a really bad thing. So,

464
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
well, it's interesting. We kind of think as more and more automation is happening,

465
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,880
we're going to get more and more meaning from things like being artists and doing creative

466
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,360
pursuits. And here's like, oh, shit, if the art, if the creative pursuits are also being automated,

467
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,800
then what are we going to gain meaning from? What are the activities from which we'll gain

468
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,120
meaning? You know, my whole life I've been working on artificial intelligence systems. There's been

469
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,360
different revolutions. One of them is the machine learning revolution. And it's interesting to build

470
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,120
up intuition and destroy that intuition about what is and isn't solvable by machines. I think

471
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,800
for the longest time, I grew up thinking go is not, the game of go is not solvable.

472
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,160
Because my understanding of AI systems is ultimately that it's

473
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,360
fundamentally a search mechanism that is fundamentally going to be brute force. There's

474
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,920
no shortcuts. Sure. Like if it can't solve the traveling salesman problem, it's not even

475
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,240
going to be able to give you an approximation. So most interesting problems are giant travel

476
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,920
salesman problem. And then, so of course, it's not going to be able to solve that. And then you,

477
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,680
then the deep learning revolution made you realize, holy shit, these large neural networks with a

478
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:38,080
giant number of knobs is able to actually somehow estimate functions that can do a pretty good job

479
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:44,080
of understanding deep representation of a thing, whether that's a game of go, or whether it's the

480
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:51,520
human natural language, or if it's images and video or audio and even actions and different

481
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,280
video games and actions of robotics and so on. And then you realize with diffusion models and

482
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,760
different generative models, you start to realize, holy shit, it can actually generate not just

483
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:12,480
interesting representations or interesting manifestations of the representations and forms,

484
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,600
but it's able to do something that impresses humans in its creativity. It's beautiful in

485
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,000
the way we think of art is beautiful. Like it surprises us and makes us chuckle and makes us

486
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,520
sit back and all and all those kinds of things. And yet the thing that it seems to struggle with

487
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,880
the most is the physical world currently. So that's counterintuitive. We humans think that it's

488
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,720
pretty trivial, being able to pick up a cup, being able to write with a pen in the physical

489
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,440
space, we think that's trivial. We give ourselves respect for being great artists and great

490
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,240
mathematicians and all that kind of stuff. And that seems to be much easier than the physical

491
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,280
space. Our bodies are really cool. There is a, I don't know, it's probably Asimov or something,

492
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,480
there was some science fiction writer that had a short story and it was like an alien that had

493
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,720
landed on earth and it was describing our bodies from a totally alien perspective. And when you

494
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,320
think about all the things we can do, it's pretty cool. We can climb through a whole multitude of

495
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,920
environments. We can exist in a multitude of temperatures. We can manipulate things just

496
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,240
with our hands and the way that we can interact with things around us. And yeah, we're very capable

497
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,360
on a physical level. Even though, like you said, we think about ourselves like, oh, well, human

498
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,040
beings have really big brains and we do. We're really intelligent as well, but our bodies are

499
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:33,520
pretty cool too. And it's a fascinating hierarchical biological system. We're made up of a bunch of

500
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:41,280
different living organisms that all don't know about the big picture of our body and it's all

501
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,120
functioning its own little local world and it's doing its thing, but together as it forms a

502
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:57,120
super resilient system, all of that comes from a very compressed encoding of what makes a human.

503
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:04,640
You start with the DNA and it builds up from a single cell to a giant organism. And because of

504
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,760
the DNA through the evolution process, you can constantly create new humans and new living

505
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,160
organisms that adapt to the environment. Like that resilience to the physical world,

506
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,960
it seems like running the whole earth over again, the whole evolutionary process over again,

507
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,520
is might be the only way to do it. So to create a robot that actually adapts

508
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,520
is as resilient to the dynamic world might be a really difficult problem.

509
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,920
Possibly. Well, it's going to say like in a programming environment, you can do things on

510
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,640
time scales that are impossible in the real world, right? Like the benefit to AI and computers is

511
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,520
computationally, they can compute so much data so quickly. Whereas on human timetables, we have

512
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,240
to wait. When you talk about evolution, you know, it's generation after generation after

513
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,400
generation, you know, maybe in a virtual environment that could be simulated and then those changes

514
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,160
could happen a lot quicker. Well, that's not a human time scale, but you have to look at earth

515
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,320
as a quantum mechanical system, the computation is happening super fast. This is a giant computer

516
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,760
doing a giant simulation. So just because for us humans, it's slow, there's like trillions of

517
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,760
organisms involved in you, destiny being you. Sure. But the next iteration of like,

518
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,840
from human to human, even if on the quantum level, there's a lot of stuff going on, you talk about

519
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,720
like, like changes in DNA, for instance, right? Like, that's happening from a generation to

520
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,160
generation time scale, like in a virtual environment that could theoretically happen.

521
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,080
Well, it already is, there's like protein folding, like huge cloud computing,

522
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,800
probably ML stuff that's like working on doing all that stuff, and it'll run like

523
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,400
trillions and trillions of simulations, you know, every second and stuff, maybe not every second,

524
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,800
but still slower than the actual protein folding, much slower. That's for the problem

525
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,200
of solving protein folding to estimate the 3D structure, but the actual body does the actual

526
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,960
protein folding way faster. So like we're, the question is, can we shortcut the simulation of

527
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,360
human evolution, try to figure out how to build up an organism without

528
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,240
simulating all the details? Because we have to simulate all the details of biology were

529
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,160
screwed. We don't have- Oh, sure. We'd have to put something in a pond and then watch it for-

530
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,320
That might be the most efficient way to do it. Sure.

531
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,520
That's what the universe most likely is. It's a kind of simulation created by a teenager in

532
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,200
their basement to try to see what happens. It's a computer game. That might be the most

533
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,760
efficient way to create interesting organisms, but within the system is perhaps possible to create

534
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:39,520
other robots that will be of use and will entertain us in the way that other humans

535
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,880
entertain us. And that's a really interesting, of course, problem, but it's surprising how

536
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,400
difficult it has been to create systems that operate in the physical world and operate in

537
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,160
that physical world in a way that's safe to humans and interesting to humans. Because there's also

538
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,560
the human factor, the human robot interaction. To me, that's like the most interesting problem,

539
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,520
to figure out how to do that well. Elon Musk and others, Boston Dynamics have worked on

540
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,280
legged robots, so I really care about legged robots. Those are super interesting, how to

541
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,800
make them such that they're able to operate successfully in a dynamic environment. It's

542
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,040
super tricky. They're like the dumbest of dogs, speaking of which is a dog barking outside.

543
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,520
It's really tricky to create those kinds of organisms that live in the human world.

544
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:39,760
Then again, if more and more of us move into the digital world, to you stream a lot,

545
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,000
like part of who you are exists in the digital space. The fact that you have a physical

546
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,280
representation also, maybe more and more will become not important.

547
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,600
I hope that's the case, because I bought a lot of stock in Meta, and man, it's down

548
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,240
a lot. Meta the company. Is there some degree? Can you look at yourself,

549
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,200
like Steven, the physical meat vehicle, and then the destiny of this digital space,

550
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:14,000
like digital avatar? Do you sense that in a certain way, you're the digital avatar?

551
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,400
I've always tried to keep my on-stream personality as genuine as possible. They're

552
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,920
one and the same to me. I don't really view them as two separate entities, but I mean,

553
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,800
I always view myself as Steven, the real-life person. Destiny's my online name, but...

554
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,440
No, but because so many, your social network has established the digital space. So many people

555
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,240
know you through the digital space. Can we swap out another person that looks like you

556
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,680
in the AI system, and then that entity known as Destiny will continue existing?

557
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,680
There must be some level of sophistication that could emulate a human brain, I would imagine.

558
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,760
Probably tech's not there yet, but... Well, the question is, what's the level of sophistication

559
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,520
of the audience that would recognize that something has changed? Like, it's the Turing test.

560
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,800
How hard is it to trick your audience, your large audience of fans that watch your streams,

561
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:14,720
that when you swap out an AI that emulates you, that nothing has changed? And the question is,

562
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,640
do you have to really simulate so much of the human brain for that? I don't think so.

563
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,480
Probably not. So, I mean, like you said, a lot of political discourses are just walking down the

564
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,280
tree together, so you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion. Yeah, it would depend on if

565
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
you're doing old data sets, and you're training on that, and I'm having conversations about abortion

566
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,400
and your crane and vaccines. I imagine it could do it for quite a while. The only thing that would

567
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,280
be weird is when novel issues pop up, then you probably need a more sophisticated resemblance

568
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,040
of the inner brain, right? You have to keep training on the internet, so how the language

569
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,960
models, and that's the most incredible breakthroughs, is the language models. You just have to keep

570
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:57,200
retraining the system on Reddit, which is actually what a lot of it is trained on, which is hilarious.

571
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,040
I do think it's really interesting that kind of funny problems, like the trolley problem,

572
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,680
that we can kind of work through our normative ethical systems are now real questions. Like,

573
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,800
if you're driving a Tesla and it's an autopilot and you're going to hit somebody, but a conservative

574
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,040
hit somebody else, what ought the system do? We went very quickly from fun kind of project in

575
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,600
philosophy class to we need to solve this for insurance purposes as quickly as possible. It's

576
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,480
kind of interesting to think about. Actually, I'll bring up the trolley problem with you later.

577
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,800
There's a fascinating version of it that I find hilarious. Okay, let's return to your low point.

578
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,760
You started playing video games. That was a lucky break. You did text-based ones. That was a lucky

579
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,040
break because you got to be pretty good at learning. Then you started thinking about going to college

580
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,520
and so on. What happened next? I went to like a prep school. You kind of have to go to college

581
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:51,040
after. That's like the point, right? I was also millennial. All of us had to go to college. That's

582
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:57,840
always what they told us. My life was kind of, it's hard to describe. I didn't really think

583
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,040
much of the future. I was just kind of enjoying the day-to-day because everything in my life was

584
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,160
pretty weird. Both my parents had moved to Florida by the time I was 16, 17. I was living with my

585
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,200
grandma. I was working. I had a girlfriend. Moved out. We got a place. Did college.

586
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,480
By the time I got into college, I had transitioned from working at McDonald's to,

587
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,880
I was like working in a casino restaurant basically. I was really good at that job,

588
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,480
so a high level of patience for drunk people and sane people. I was doing music in school

589
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,720
because I've really grown to love music. My thought process was I can do music as a hobby,

590
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,440
I guess, unless I get really good and maybe I can make money with that. Otherwise,

591
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,800
I love music. I'm okay going to school for music, getting good at it, and then just doing that on

592
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,360
the side. My main job would kind of be this career I was building at the casino. Basically,

593
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,440
the trying to balance personal life plus graveyard shift, six-day hour weeks at a casino,

594
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,080
and then a full-time music degree was not possible for me. Eventually, I had to drop school after,

595
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,400
I think it was like three years. After I dropped school to maintain my casino job,

596
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,840
after a few months, I got fired from my casino job. I'd essentially just thrown away the past

597
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,480
three or four years of my life. Why did you get fired from the casino job? I heard there's a story

598
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,160
behind that. Yeah, there's a story. Basically, I was just really dumb when it came to understanding

599
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,320
corporate politics. This is funny because the same attitude kind of followed me into the streaming

600
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,680
world. My thought process has kind of always been that as long as I'm really good at what I do,

601
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,800
I should be untouchable. If I'm really good, you can't do anything to me. I don't have to play

602
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,400
any dumb games or whatever. At the casino, I think I was the youngest, it was originally

603
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,560
the supervisor position at the casino. When I started to get my own shifts, there were problems

604
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,960
that I would run into on graveyard shift because of carryover from the swing shift. One of these

605
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,480
problems was underneath the soda machine, they weren't cleaning it properly and fruit flies were

606
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,640
showing up. The manager came in one morning and she was like, hey, what's going on with the machine?

607
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,360
I told her, listen, I can't take everything from swing shift and do everything at grave shift.

608
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,480
I can't do this. They need to figure out their stuff better or I need more employees. It's not

609
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,760
possible for me. She's like, what did you tell anybody? I was like, yeah, I complained to the

610
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,880
supervisor on the swing shift all the time. She told me, if you're not getting the answer that

611
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,840
you like, then it's your responsibility to email the next person up. I was like, oh, okay, that's

612
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:17,920
interesting. Some months went on and I ran into more problems because on graveyard, here's how,

613
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't know if it's everywhere, but morning shift is the easiest and that's when you're the

614
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,560
most overstaffed because that's when all the VPs are in and that's when all the managers are there

615
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,320
and everybody blah, blah, blah. Swing shift is the most challenging. It's where your highest

616
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,920
flow of customers is. You're also decently staffed there, but there's a lot of stuff going on.

617
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,640
In graveyard, nobody cares at all about you. They don't give you any employees. You might get swamped.

618
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,680
You might not. Who cares? Make sure it's clean for day shift. That's the only thing that matters.

619
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,040
A quick question for sort of clarification. So this is a 24 hour?

620
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,520
24 hour dyno. Yeah, inside a casino. Yeah. So it's a dyno in a casino. Oh, by the way,

621
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,560
I had an amazing moment at a dyno in a casino recently. It's a special place. A dyno in a casino

622
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,800
is a place of magic. There's a lot of, I don't know if I'd say magic, but there's a lot of other

623
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,000
worldly stuff going on. There's characters. There's, and I had an interaction with the waitress that

624
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,560
was the sweetest waitress in the world. And it was just like, I don't know, made me feel less alone

625
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:13,760
in this cruel world of ours. So graveyard begins when? For me, my shift was 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

626
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,600
or sometimes I got called in early, so it'd be 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. That's no love for that shift.

627
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,080
No, especially not trying to do school at the same time. Absolutely not.

628
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,280
But yeah, basically, long story short, I ran into a problem where I didn't have enough employees on

629
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,960
my shift. VPs were coming in in the morning. There's something like, hey, the diner's kind of dirty.

630
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,480
And I'm like, you've cut all my employees past 4 a.m. Like on some nights, I'm literally cooking

631
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,000
and doing front of house, like all on my own. Like I can't do this. And my manager, Pam, told me,

632
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,400
well, you've got to figure it out. And so I remembered her advice. So I emailed the VP of

633
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,920
food and beverage and I CC'd her and I said, I'm not getting the help I need in my restaurant.

634
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,800
Now, I didn't know at the time that I was basically completely throwing her under the bus

635
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:57,200
because of that email. But retroactively, when I look back on things or retrospectively, I see

636
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,440
that was the moment that I got marked for deletion. And I didn't really understand it,

637
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,200
even though I'd heard terminology for papering somebody out the door. But after that point,

638
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,400
I started to get written up for a lot of little random things. I'd missed one day of work in my

639
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,480
three years at the casino. And I started to get written up for showing up one or two minutes

640
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,960
late. That's kind of weird. That's whatever. Or written up for random ways about filing paperwork.

641
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,200
And then eventually there came a situation with another employee where they were,

642
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,240
it's complicated, it has to be like call out stuff. But basically, they wanted to come or

643
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,600
they wanted to call out. And I told them if they called out, they were going to get fired because

644
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,600
they were at like 10 points, they were at nine points and 10 points is firing, blah, blah, blah.

645
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,800
Pam told me, you can tell her that she's going to get a point, but you can't tell if she's going

646
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,000
to get fired. I don't know what that meant. And then I told her that if you call out, you're going

647
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,280
to get, you know, you're fucked, you're going to get fired, or you're going to be at 10 points.

648
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,360
And then I got called in early, like three days later, and Pam was like, you inappropriately

649
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,800
communicated with an employee because you said the F word and a text message. And I'm like,

650
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,000
really? There's no shot. And she's like, well, you also tried to fire the employee. And I was

651
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,880
like, no, I told her she was going to get 10 points. She's like, well, you use the F word.

652
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,840
I'm like, this is insane. And just because I was such a high performing employee, there's no way

653
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,240
I'm getting fired. And then I did. And I was like, yeah, cash shot my 401k and moped for like three

654
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,120
months because I had thrown away school for this casino job. And then I got fired from this job

655
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,360
that like, yeah, nobody believed I got fired. It was just insane. So if you look back, if you

656
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:20,240
were allowed to not just look back to your own memory, but actually watch yourself like some

657
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,360
of your court video that whole time, do you think you would be surprised you would notice some things

658
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:32,160
like potentially of not having a self awareness, not having like social, like a civility and social

659
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,080
etiquette that's played in the human relations? Yeah, absolutely. So is that is that at the core

660
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,240
of it, essentially? Yeah, I think so. I mean, it follows me even to this day, there's a lot of,

661
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,320
I don't know if you're recording or not, but when we spoke early about like meta conversations,

662
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,280
I have to think a lot sometimes about meta conversations because the way that I want to

663
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,200
drive a conversation will sometimes be way different than what is like the best way to

664
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,000
have a conversation. Whereas I just want to like go really hard on like some itty bitty, like

665
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
some idiosyncrasy, some factor figure, whatever, but that's not like the human conversation I need

666
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:09,920
to have, you know? So you got fired slash left that job, and that took you to the job that would

667
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:16,400
be the lowest point? Yeah, because there was a huge downgrade in pay. I went from getting like,

668
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,320
I think at the casino, because I worked so much overtime, I was like 22.50 an hour on all my

669
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,080
overtime fifth, and this was back in 2008, 2009, as like a college student, like it's amazing pay.

670
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,720
I had benefits, like everything was good. And then the carpet cleaning was like,

671
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,880
I was probably getting my paycheck like every other week was maybe 1500 bucks or $1,000. And

672
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,080
I'm working like 13 day stretches, like I have every other Sunday off, and it's so many hours,

673
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,920
like I have to show up at the shop at like seven or six, and then I go home at like

674
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,760
eight or nine, depending on when my jobs are throughout the day. You doing businesses or

675
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,560
residential or what are you doing? Everything. Everything. Are you working for a company this

676
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,120
company? Yeah. Okay. And so like there's a schedule thing, you have to go to it and so on.

677
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,760
Yeah, but so like, this is why the schedule would suck is sometimes I'd show up at, I think we had

678
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,400
to be in the shop at, I think it was 7am. We show up at the shop at 7am. First job might be at eight

679
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,240
or nine, but that job might be like a one hour job. So I might show up at 7am and have a job from

680
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,360
830 to 930. Then my next job might not be from, until like say 11. So from 830 to 930, I'll do

681
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,640
one job. And then I'm going to drop from like 11 to 12 or something. Then I might have like a decent

682
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:29,760
job from like five to eight, but like my whole day is destroyed and I'm doing like three smallish

683
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,960
jobs. So I'm getting like 30 bucks maybe for being in the shop or you know, my job for like 10 or 11

684
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,680
hours and it's just like horrible. So you're somebody that seems to be extremely good at

685
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:46,400
thinking and conversation. And so I have a bit of an ego perhaps in both the negative and the

686
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,040
positive sense of that word. Was there some aspect of working at McDonald's

687
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,880
and then working at the casino and then working for the, as a carpet cleaner that was humbling?

688
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:05,920
No, never. The ego burned bright through it all. Well, or no, you can pitch back in the ego.

689
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,680
Yeah, no, I understand. I totally get what you mean. I had a really close friend growing up

690
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,520
whose name was Chris. And I think we probably met when he was, we were like four or five,

691
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,720
I think he lived behind me. And I grew up with him and I'd always been kind of an outsider to the

692
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,480
world that I was in once I got to high school for sure. Because all of those kids were incredibly

693
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,200
wealthy, you know, Corvettes and Mustangs when they turned 16, it was a prep school. And I was

694
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,560
doing the, they had like a work study program there where you could stay after school from

695
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,600
two 30 to five every day to kind of like work to pay for your tuition. So I've been working like

696
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,760
throughout all of high school. I got another job at McDonald's when I was 18, worked at the casino.

697
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,440
I'd always been doing that kind of work. I never really viewed it as like beneath me or anything.

698
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,120
It's not like I don't have like a family of doctors or lawyers or anything. And then me and my other

699
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,280
friend, Chris, we'd always make fun of everybody else for being kind of like, you know, like preppy

700
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:59,760
kids and everything. So there is a, there's some pride to that sort of hard work. Yeah, I guess

701
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,800
a little bit. Yeah. Because, you know, looking especially at my dad, like the solution to every

702
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,200
problem was just throw more hours of work at it basically. So that was always my, yeah, go to.

703
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,640
What was psychologically the low point? I think psychologically the low point was that

704
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:19,600
as I'm doing this carpet cleaning job, driving around my city, there's like this feeling of,

705
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,680
I guess for a lot of people it's probably college, but there's a feeling when you're in high school

706
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,880
that everything is like so exciting and the whole world is kind of in front of you. And

707
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,080
there are a trillion, trillion different branching paths of possibilities. And you know, even through

708
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,920
high school, you're thinking like, am I going to be a doctor or a lawyer or can I join the

709
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,520
MBA or can I do this or that? There's all these things in front of you. And when I especially

710
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,920
felt it when I was doing these carpet cleaning jobs and I think it was in the fall, I'd be

711
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,280
outside some of these houses and I just kind of look around and I'd recognize a lot of these

712
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,200
neighborhoods that I'd drive around with friends in or I'd, you know, be walking through. I ran

713
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,480
cross country, some of them I'd be running through these neighborhoods. And it was just kind of like

714
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,960
this feeling of looking around. And it was like, when I was here in the past, this was like kind

715
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:09,360
of like a transitionary phase of my life where I'm doing this and it's so fun and exciting. And

716
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,480
then I'm going to move on to something else and it's going to be fun and exciting and awesome.

717
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,680
And then like, you know, two years later, my whole life has collapsed. Like I'm in a house that I

718
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:24,640
can't afford anymore. My ex that I hate is pregnant with my kid. And I have no money. I've got no

719
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:31,520
upward mobility. I failed college. My job is horrible. Like just every single like this is like

720
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,240
all of those, the wave function had collapsed into one thing and that one thing was the worst

721
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,080
thing that could have possibly been at the time for me. Yeah. Like everything was gone and horrible.

722
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,040
So yeah, that was the feeling I had at the time. Do you ever contemplate suicide?

723
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,520
I thought about thinking about it, but I've just never been that kind of person. So

724
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:53,280
I mean, basically as a way to escape from the hardship, something that I'm so incredibly lucky.

725
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,080
I don't know why or how I'm just going to chalk it up to biology. I've always had really high

726
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:02,480
mental baseline. I've like depression and all of that. There have been a few short stints of

727
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,440
debt with it past 30 because I did a lot of drugs. But other than that, my mental baseline is just

728
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:12,640
so high. And even in the carpet cleaning days, like if you, man, the videos might still be there.

729
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,400
I think on my old YouTube channel channel where I'll be like playing Starcraft when I first started

730
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,440
to get into streaming and I'll be calling up customers like this is Steve from guaranteed

731
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,880
clean. We had to move your job back one hour. Is it okay if I show up instead of 230? And then

732
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,440
I hang up and it's like, all right, guys, we got three more games and it's like, let's go.

733
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,640
Like stuff like that. So my, my baseline has always been like really high for mental function.

734
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,800
So even in low point, there's that you had strength. Is there, is there anything you can give

735
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:39,680
by way of advice from people that for home to wave function collapses as it does for many of us?

736
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:44,640
Like, holy fuck, the world is not full of opportunity and you're kind of a failure.

737
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,200
Like I've, I've been there. Yeah, I don't know. It's rough because like,

738
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:54,480
I usually ask for compassion from people that have it better off because like, once you're down

739
01:00:54,560 --> 01:01:00,320
there, like the only reason I say I got lucky, but it wasn't even really lucky. Like, or it was

740
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,760
lucky, but it was more lucky. It wasn't just lucky that I got into streaming. It was lucky that I

741
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,040
was into computers at an early age. It was lucky that I played video games at an early age. It

742
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,440
was lucky that all the tech came up at exactly that right point in time. Like I was a pretty smart

743
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,400
guy, but it was definitely a preparation meets opportunity and that opportunity was like at

744
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,640
the exact precise moment of my life. If anything had gone differently than I would just be cleaning

745
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,480
carpets today. So, so in the many worlds, interpretation of quantum mechanics,

746
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,360
this is like one out of like, there's many, many Stevens, they're just still carpet cleaning

747
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,960
and they're full of pain and resentment. Yeah. The one piece of advice that I give,

748
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,640
I hate that I have to push back against all these crypto bros and everybody online for

749
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,480
decently intelligent people that are successful. I've never heard anybody give a contradiction

750
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,600
to this. Maybe you will. You can tell me if you disagree. I always look at kids in high school

751
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:53,200
and I'm like, just try a little bit harder. Like 30 minutes a night, if you don't study,

752
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,160
just do 30 minutes, just do a little bit more. It is, you're laying the foundation for the rest

753
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,480
of your life and you can't appreciate it in high school and college. But oh my God, when you get

754
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,440
out, everything in your life is so much easier. You have probably more responsibility over the

755
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,400
direction of your life when you're like 13, 14 years old than you ever will once you're like 25

756
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,600
and older because this is like when you're determining the foundations that everything's

757
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:22,480
going to be built on. But yeah, 100%. So first of all, it does seem that the liberating aspect

758
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,760
of being young is like anything you learn. So working hard at learning something will pay off

759
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,880
in like nonlinear ways, like you said with video games. I feel like, so like people who are like,

760
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,880
I hate school. All right, well, fine. But find something where you're challenging yourself,

761
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,400
you're growing, you're learning, you're learning a skill, you're learning about a thing.

762
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,520
Of course, you know, you can push back and say, well, there's some trajectories that might not

763
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,760
be productive. Like if you spend the entirety of your teen years playing, I don't know,

764
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,840
League of Legends, a game you have love and hate relationship with.

765
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,240
No, just a hate and hate relationship. Okay. Well, we'll talk about, I think you have a love,

766
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,320
hate relationship with hate in general. We'll just in love. We'll try to de-complexify that one.

767
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:16,400
I think in general, just investing yourself fully with passion really does pay off. But that said,

768
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:23,440
also school, I feel like doesn't get enough credit, like high school in particular, middle

769
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:31,520
school and high school, because it's general education. I think if you're, especially if

770
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:37,120
you're lucky to have good teachers, but honestly, I haven't mostly the textbooks themselves with

771
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:44,080
good teachers. It's a one chance in life, you have to really explore a subject. Fuck grades.

772
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:50,640
Like getting good grades is at tension, I would say, with actual learning. That is true. But

773
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,640
just get a biology textbook and to explore ideas and biology and allowing yourself to be

774
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:05,440
inspired by the beauty of it. Yeah, I don't know. I think that really, really, really pays off and

775
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,120
you never get a chance to do that again. And maybe not even textbooks, like reading, straight

776
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:17,680
up reading. I think if you read, this is one time in life, you get a chance to read, really read.

777
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:25,200
Like read a book a day, read. You can really invest, you can really grow by reading. I mean,

778
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,680
I must, all those guys talk about it. It's very, very rare that you meet like a dumb person who

779
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,800
reads a lot. I don't know if that's ever happened in my life. Yeah. Dumb or not successful. And

780
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,560
the cool thing is, it seems like the reading, it's like investment, the reading you do early

781
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:48,000
on in high school pays off way more than the reading you do later. So like the really influential

782
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,040
reading is doing those high school years, because you're basically learning from others,

783
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,400
the mistakes they've made, the solutions to problems, you're basically learning the

784
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,120
shortcuts to life. Like whatever the hell you want to do, music, read from the best people

785
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,760
that the music theory, like learn music theory, learn, read biographies about jazz musicians,

786
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,240
blues musicians, see their, like see all the mistakes, see what they did, see the shortcuts.

787
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,600
If you want to do podcast and read about other podcasts, if you want to do streaming,

788
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,640
read about other streamers, physicists, and so on, I feel like you figure out all the mistakes

789
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,120
and get to shortcut through life, because most people show up to college without having done

790
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:36,480
that. And now you get a chance to shortcut your way past them. Yeah, 100%. But nobody really teaches

791
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:44,480
you that. They're like, go to school from this time to that time, shut up, this is just what you

792
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,920
do, eat your broccoli. I think I was like, there's two huge problems. One is, now that I'm older,

793
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,120
because you don't know anything as a kid, you can't really criticize as an adult as a kid,

794
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:57,600
because you're a kid. By the way, you're ageist, if I may say so. I am super ageist. As I get older,

795
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,760
I get even more ageist. There are a lot of people I argue with, I was like, man, dude,

796
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,120
you're really 22, aren't you? I can tell every word you say, just seeps of like 22-year-oldness,

797
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,400
but that's okay. I love that for you. I could just say, because you mentioned this,

798
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,760
your wife is a fellow streamer, Molina. You mentioned that this is a source of fights

799
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,520
for the two of you that, and I could just feel that. There is truth to what you're saying,

800
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:26,720
which is like, all right, you're saying that because you're 22. Just wait until you're 25,

801
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,280
and you won't be saying that anymore. Sure. No, that is the most annoying thing for people to hear.

802
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,720
Yeah, you can't ever say that, of course. Because it's actually usually true,

803
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:42,160
because we do go through phases in life, and you can understand that most things are phases.

804
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:49,040
So just in general, you can say, just wait. Just wait. You won't feel this way. Again,

805
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,960
I could say that to you. You could say that to yourself. Just wait. Whatever you're feeling

806
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,600
like, just wait. In five, 10 years, you'll be a different person, and you will laugh at the

807
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,400
things you take seriously now that are causing you pain now, all that kind of stuff. But people

808
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,680
hate hearing that. Absolutely. I think the joke that I always say is that if I could literally

809
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,320
step into a time machine, and I could come back out and see myself as a 17-year-old, and I could

810
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,560
say, hey, I am literally you from the future. You see the time machine, and I would look at me,

811
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,320
and I would see the time machine, and I would give myself the best advice in the world,

812
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,160
to be the most successful person. I would ignore all of it. Even knowing it came from myself,

813
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,200
I'd be like, this guy sold out. This dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. I'll

814
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,520
figure it out better. He must have made some mistakes. That's what I would think is this

815
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,040
everything. Even I knew it was myself from the future, I would just 100% never believe it,

816
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,920
and knowing that is very frustrating. But I keep that in mind when I deal with younger people.

817
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,480
That's why I always say on stream when I'm talking to, there's been stuff with Sneak-Os,

818
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,720
another girl on my stream called Lab. When I see the mistakes they're making, oftentimes,

819
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,000
because I've made all of these mistakes, sometimes in the most public and horrible

820
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,440
fashion ever. But I'm never like a mentor. I'm not going to sit there and tell you,

821
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,400
oh, do this or that or that or that, because I don't know if you're going to listen to me,

822
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,280
and I don't want to condescend to you. You figure your stuff out, and I'll be here if you want to

823
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:04,080
talk about it. There was a company that didn't work with me, because I was very adamant on

824
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:08,560
defending very radical notions about language and racial slurs and everything, when I was like

825
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,840
22 or whatever. There was a company, and they said, well, we don't want to work with this guy

826
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,080
for an event. After they had said that, I had written an article on my website called,

827
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,440
the company was Gigabyte. They make motherboards, and I said, fuck Gigabyte in the ass. That was

828
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,480
the title to my article. And it was like, well, if they don't want to work with me, I'm going to

829
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,040
blow them up and never do anything ever with them again. And it was just like, looking back at it

830
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,720
now, obviously, as an older person, like, hey, you need to pump the brakes and chill. You're

831
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,880
destroying yourself. But as a young person, it's like, yeah, you're 22. Of course, you think that

832
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,760
you can say whatever and do whatever. And as long as you're good at what you're doing, you've got

833
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,480
the whole world behind you. And yeah, geez. Well, let's go there. You have a history of using

834
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:51,280
offensive language, like the R word, the N word, including the N word with a hard R, calling women

835
01:08:51,280 --> 01:09:01,840
bitches, talking about rape in a nonchalant way. What part of that do you regret? And what part

836
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:07,520
of that do you not? Language is very complicated. When it comes to stuff relating to slurs,

837
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:15,760
there's been a whole trajectory of feelings on everything related to language. For you personally

838
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,040
and for the internet as a whole. Yeah, I don't care about the internet, almost for me personally.

839
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:25,440
In my early 20s, I'll say like 22, 23, I think probably when I first started streaming, my feeling

840
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,240
is that any word is just a word. And if it hurts you, that's your fault. Take responsibility for

841
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,240
yourself. This probably came from my background of being a really independent person. So that's

842
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:38,960
just kind of like the mind that I had for everything. And there were basically, they were like a

843
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,160
collection of experiences that I had that as I grew, I started to realize like, okay, well,

844
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,360
I feel differently about some of these words depending on the context. And I can see how

845
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:51,600
they can affect other people depending on the context. So as I've kind of like grown,

846
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,840
I think I've developed a more sophisticated understanding of how different words are used

847
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,120
and how they affect people, whether they like it or not. And more importantly, whether I like it

848
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:04,880
or not. And that words can, even if I don't want it to be, they can be a vehicle for emboldening

849
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,040
certain types of ideas that I don't want to embolden. And yeah, that's kind of been the whole

850
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,960
like growth. I've been lucky that in the time that I came up on the internet, I was able to learn

851
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,400
these lessons. Because if I was trying to learn those same lessons today, I would have been completely

852
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,040
destroyed because I had insane views on language like 10 years ago. We could talk about the past,

853
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,880
we could talk about the present, let's talk about the past first. So how do you deal with the fact

854
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:31,520
that there's videos of you in the past saying the N-word, including the N-word with a hard R?

855
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,440
So generally, and what's the context? Can you give me like, what would be the context usually?

856
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,240
When I lay out this defense, it's not because I wouldn't have used the N-word. Generally,

857
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,680
whenever I said the N-word, it was usually in an example of like, this is something that like a

858
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,320
racist person would say, I don't think I've ever, on the internet, I think I've ever called anybody

859
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,080
like the N-word with a hard R. Not because I wouldn't have, but just because it wasn't in

860
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:00,640
my vocabulary. I played RTS, Real Time Strategy, and we use the F-slur for gay people. That's

861
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,520
what I use that one a ton. I've called people that a ton in the past. So I should actually just

862
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:13,360
as a small tangent, and this is what I'd like to explore with you. There's a ruthlessness to the

863
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:19,600
language in the gaming world. And there's different communities. They have different

864
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:27,600
flavors of language, of hate speech, essentially. And there's also a humor to it,

865
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:36,160
which really bothers me in a dark way that I haven't been able to really think through,

866
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:45,200
because humor seems to be a kind of catalyst for hate. It seems to normalize hate. Like you say,

867
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:52,400
basically, it's like Lucy Kay says a lot of edgy things, but you take something Lucy Kay says

868
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:58,480
and do it in a non-fine way and do it over and over and over and keep increasing the hatefulness

869
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:05,440
of it, the vitriol, and somehow you find yourself like Alice in Wonderland in a world full of hate

870
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:12,240
where there is no good and evil. It's all the same. In fact, the good is to be mocked, and the evil

871
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:18,880
is to be celebrated for the humor of it, basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously. And I

872
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,440
don't know what it, it reveals something about human nature that you can let go, the moral

873
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:30,000
relativism that can happen when you do that kind of stuff. At the same time, I'm a fan of dark humor

874
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,640
when done well. Anyway, for people who are not familiar, I just wanted to mention that

875
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,920
some of the worst hate speech that ends in LOL happens in gaming communities.

876
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,120
And that's where you come from in a certain part.

877
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,640
So a lot of people don't remember this or don't know this because they're younger, but

878
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:57,200
way back in the day, in the late 90s, early mid 2000s of the internet, the way that online kind

879
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:03,600
of like shit talk worked was you were just trying to ramp up to the most insanely edgy, crazy stuff

880
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:08,560
you could say to like provoke a reaction. Have you ever heard of something called the aristocrats?

881
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,200
That it's like a joke, the joke? Oh yeah, the joke. Yeah, there's a movie on it. Yeah.

882
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,360
Okay. Basically, every single like shit talk back and forth on the internet was like that.

883
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,920
Like what is the most increasingly depraved and back then you didn't get banned for slurs or

884
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,720
anything on any of these chat rooms. So it was just like insane world to walk into. And I was

885
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:32,560
fully 100% a part of a product of and a contributor to that world. So that probably still goes on

886
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,920
on the internet in some way and that probably still goes on the internet in a maybe more

887
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,400
pacified way. Only in darker parts of the internet. I'd say for the most part, most,

888
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,000
well, compared to back then compared to 20 years ago, the internet is way cleaned up now.

889
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,120
There are still going to be boards you can go on or parts of the internet where you see that

890
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,200
type of humor, but not nowhere near as mainstream. Like back then you could open your mic on

891
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:57,840
Xbox Live and hear some insane stuff when that first started nowhere near what you hear today.

892
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,160
Although there are still elements of escalation that happened that just seems to be part of

893
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:07,360
human nature on the internet. Because we don't get the feedback of actually hurting people

894
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:15,520
directly. So the trolling, like for the lulls, you'll do like you will still escalate within

895
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,600
the bounds. You're just saying that there's more bounds now. On Reddit, there's more bounds and

896
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:26,160
so on. There's moderators that kind of yell at you that ban you and so on if you cross those

897
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:33,040
bounds. But overall, that basic human instinct to escalate, especially under the veil of anonymity

898
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,960
is still there. I don't know. It's dark. It's dark. Yeah, just there's a lot of different ways to

899
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,000
look at it. And there's different ways you can break that art. Like for instance, like you mentioned

900
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:46,480
dark humor and you say that like sometimes dark humor is funny and sometimes it's not. I think

901
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,560
that it's really important to dig into and figure out like why certain things are funny and why

902
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,680
certain things. Yeah, go. It's from your subreddit. Oh boy. No, that made me laugh and I felt wrong

903
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:04,320
about it. Oh no. So this is, I already know what this is, yeah. Yeah. So this is a trolley

904
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,280
problem. To me, it connects because I think about the, it keeps, because I worked on autonomous

905
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,240
vehicles, the trolley problem, the philosophical thought experiment keeps brought up a lot.

906
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,840
You know, when AI is part of making the decision, do I kill three people here or five people here?

907
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:26,640
In AI makes that decision, how do you do that calculus? And this particular, there's a deep

908
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:32,960
satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society. I feel like that's why- That's what dark humor

909
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,360
does? Successful dark humor does. And I don't know if this- It feels a flaw. Hmm. I feel like

910
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,000
certain, there's a certain brand of dark humor. And I think the reason, I think the reason someone

911
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,480
is why it's good, or why it is good humor, I think is because I don't think it necessarily

912
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,320
reveals a flaw. So sometimes I feel like it reveals like a kind of virtue, I think. Like,

913
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,760
if you look at this particular thing- Yeah, can I explain what we're- Yeah, go for it.

914
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,400
Oh yeah, sure. We're just listening. The title of the Reddit post is, You Know What to Pick.

915
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:05,920
And it says, five people are going to die either way, but if you flip the lever, the trolley will

916
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:15,280
do a sick fucking loop first. And also the top comment is a question saying, which I think is

917
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:20,000
also part of the dark humor that's successful. Can I get the gender and ethnic backgrounds

918
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,960
of the groups first? And the top answer is both groups are each comprised of five white orphaned

919
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:35,600
cis male heavy meth users who are consistently in and out of drug rehab, all who identify as

920
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,800
right wing extremists. Humor is such a sophisticated thing that we engage in. Humor is like really

921
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:47,280
complicated. But I would argue that hopefully the humor here shows the virtue of like, this is

922
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,280
obviously horrible, but that's kind of why it's funny. It's funny because it's such a horrible

923
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,280
question to ask. Like, do we kill five people in a boring way or in a really entertaining way? And

924
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,880
it's like, that's really, that's really- And then when you ask even more like, what are the ethnic

925
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,040
backgrounds? Like, that's even worse to say that, you know? So I feel like that's like the type of,

926
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,120
there's a way that you can engage with dark humor where it's like, oof, like, it's funny because

927
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,720
it's so wrong and so taboo. And we all know that it's wrong and taboo. And that's kind of where

928
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:15,840
the shared laugh comes from. So for me, the question that asking the diversity question

929
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,440
is a sophisticated way of revealing the absurdity of asking about diversity when it's talking about

930
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,360
human life. Oh, interesting. Because the way that I took that was, I think it reveals the absurdity

931
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:31,360
of how people will weigh different ethnic backgrounds so differently when it comes to value of human

932
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:35,600
life. Like, I'm actually thinking of that in terms of like a an immigration related question,

933
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,160
where people are really keen and quick to dehumanize like black or brown people. So like,

934
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:43,040
the question is like, well, if five of them are brown and five are white, well, I know which one

935
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,400
I'm going to, you know, pull the lever for. That's how I read that. But it's satirizing that.

936
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:52,000
Yeah, exactly. Yes, of course. Yeah. But that's what I mean, that that's the flaw. To me, at least,

937
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:00,800
it showed that humanity or social networks that are easy to be outraged and love the outrage

938
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:07,920
and the chaos, that Twitter and social networks will pull that lever. Like, they would,

939
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,960
they would always try to maximize the fun. And there's like a, there's a sick aspect to

940
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,920
all the atrocities, all the tragedies that happen in the world, that we kind of always

941
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:26,640
lean towards the, the outrageous narrative weaved around it. The, yeah, the, the one that leads

942
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:33,040
to sort of the most clicks, to the most attention, to the most outrage, to all that,

943
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:38,960
all that kind of stuff. So that, that's almost like a satire of society. When they are faced with

944
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:47,040
tragedy, they will maximize, trying to think of a word that's not fun, but entertainment,

945
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,760
maximize the entertainment. Yeah. This is a big criticism I give, especially to conservative

946
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,320
crowds. You know, left-leaning people, everybody doesn't. I don't like when people blame the media

947
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,960
for the state of the media today. I very much believe that everything in society is a feedback

948
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,320
loop and that if you're really unhappy with the state of the media, I think that the media is

949
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,000
a good reflection for what people want to see because there is a room right now in the United

950
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,320
States where somebody could start a company where all they do is completely factual reporting.

951
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,600
They don't have a political slant and they're not giving you these like sensationalist narratives

952
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,040
or stories and that media company would fail in two weeks because people don't want to see that.

953
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:22,320
Generally, people really want to see the like, show me the guy that really believes in what I

954
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,680
say, that calls the other guy an idiot, the guy that are screaming on TV or on the radio,

955
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:30,000
like, this is what I really want. And people will engage in that and that feedback loop will

956
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,720
continue for generations. And then all of a sudden people are like, why is the media so bias? Why is

957
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,600
the media driving so many narratives? I was like, well, what do you mean? This is exactly what you

958
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,240
want to see. And that's frustrating for me. That's one of my big kind of when I defend

959
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:47,840
establishments or when I talk about like the interplay between citizen and all these institutions

960
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,880
we have, that the institutions are very much a reflection of the population, at least in

961
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:57,680
democratic societies. And I think that people very much try to elude the personal responsibility

962
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:01,440
or the country's responsibility to why some of them look the way that they do.

963
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,720
But that takes us back to the N word with a hard R. Sure. Why?

964
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,760
For the particular examples that I was giving for the particular conversations that I was having,

965
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,720
if you're going to have challenging conversations around certain words,

966
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:18,400
I think you should probably be able to say them otherwise it feels really ridiculous to me.

967
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,680
That's like, do you still believe that?

968
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,440
Yes. Not like calling people those words, but in having conversations about those words,

969
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,040
I would say that I still believe that, yeah.

970
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,320
But don't you think, as you said, that using those words

971
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,000
actually gives motivation and strength to people who have hate in their hearts?

972
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,360
I think depending on the context of what's going on, I think that that's going to be a big driver

973
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,240
in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it.

974
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,760
So in a conversation about the N word, I don't think I would normally say the N word,

975
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,840
we would just talk about the word much the same way that like in a movie,

976
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,360
like in Django, people use the N word. Should that be censored in that movie?

977
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,960
Or in the context of that movie, is it being employed in a way where these aren't good people?

978
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,360
You're not supposed to like them. And that's what the audience walks away with.

979
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,600
Yeah, but that context is different than conversation. It feels like in conversation,

980
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:15,200
you using that word normalizes it. And that normalizing that word is going to make it easier

981
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:22,320
for people who use that word in a hateful way to use it. Same with the F word, the F slur.

982
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:31,280
If you use that casually and normalize it in a way that's not hateful, you use it in a way

983
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:36,960
that's not hateful, but the side effect is that it normalizes it than people who do use it in a

984
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:43,120
hateful way will be more likely to use it. Therefore, the mathematically looking at the

985
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:48,480
equation of the number of times the N word or the F word is used throughout the world,

986
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,640
it increases the number of times it's used in a hateful way.

987
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,320
Yeah, I think that human beings-

988
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,320
And you're part of that problem, Steven.

989
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:00,160
I don't agree. I understand the thought process. But I don't know if using certain words

990
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,840
within different contexts is going to necessarily normalize like the hateful use of that word.

991
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,040
That is an argument that I've heard people use. Somebody will say like, okay, well, hold on.

992
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,440
That should never be used ever because by virtue of you normalizing it, even in an

993
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,600
inoffensive environment, you increase the proclivity for people to use it in a potentially

994
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,960
more offensive environment. And my argument is always like, no, I don't think that crossover

995
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,320
exists. But if you did want to take that argument, and maybe you do feel this way,

996
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,680
I think that you get really problematic when you run into communities that do use certain

997
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,640
words that people would say, well, they should be allowed to do it. So for instance, if you think

998
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,400
that any utterance of the N word at all is highly problematic and might increase hatred,

999
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,440
then like the entire rap industry has to dramatically change the way that they engage

1000
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,040
with the N word. And obviously a lot of people that criticize people's use of the N word

1001
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,840
aren't going to turn to rappers and say, well, you guys can't say it either.

1002
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,960
No, it's who, I mean, it's who uses the N word. That's what it's not. So it's not just the word.

1003
01:22:50,960 --> 01:23:01,600
It's the, it is context dependent. But I would say that you as a white person having conversations,

1004
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,640
the context there is the kind that would lead to any increase in hate.

1005
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,880
Do you think the N word should be censored in the dictionary?

1006
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,440
No. And I believe there's a Wikipedia page on it and it's not censored.

1007
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:18,320
Yeah, I don't, I think it should be in the dictionary. I think the context of casual

1008
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:24,800
conversation, like I said, I just believe that on the internet, having humor,

1009
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,120
having fun conversations as you have on your streams,

1010
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:35,120
that leads to the normalization of the word without any educational value,

1011
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,960
without significant educational value. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think I would,

1012
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,920
I think I would agree with that. No, sorry. So there's a difference between

1013
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:47,680
F slur and N word and both I think should not be used in a fun way, but the F word was used

1014
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:52,560
in a fun way for the longest time. For sure. And I'll tell you something that bothers me about

1015
01:23:52,560 --> 01:24:00,880
your streams, not your streams and basically every other stream is the casual use of the R word.

1016
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,800
Oh, the ableism, yeah. I don't know if it's about the able, I don't even know,

1017
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,720
listen, it's complicated. I'm not like virtue signaling here.

1018
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:13,040
No, ableism isn't a virtue signal. I mean, it's a legitimate, yeah. Like I get emails

1019
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:17,520
from fans that say like, Hey, like I deal with this particular issue. Every time you use this

1020
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:21,440
word, it kind of feels like you're attacking me. Like just like, so it's not, it's a valid concept.

1021
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,600
It's just something cuts wrong for me. Like for example, I'm not bothered by,

1022
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,680
I am bothered by the excessive use of the word fuck, but not in the same way that moderate use of

1023
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:37,520
the word fuck. What is it? I'm curious. And when somebody calls somebody in R word,

1024
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,040
what is it that, what is the feeling that you get that makes you feel bad about it?

1025
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:47,280
It signals to me that you don't give a damn about

1026
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:58,320
people who are struggling in ways that you are not struggling. Like that, that signals to me

1027
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:04,320
like, about the experience of others. Do you think that there are other words also that could

1028
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,920
convey like a similar feeling to your wife? Cause it feels like you've drawn a pretty special

1029
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,240
circle around cause like, I imagine I call, oh, this guy's, you're an uneducated dumb fucker.

1030
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:17,760
You're a nitwicker. Like, do those words probably don't feel it? That circle keeps changing.

1031
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,200
Which it can, which is fine. I think that's the whole point with the culture.

1032
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:26,560
So I'm trying to feel my feeling is a kind of, you know, I'm a human being that exists in a

1033
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,200
social context that we're all evolving that language together and just feels wrong. Like,

1034
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:36,640
you know, the word bitch, for example, it really bought, like I've heard on your streams and in

1035
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:44,320
general, calling a woman a stupid bitch really bothers me. But it's not just the word bitch,

1036
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:49,680
it's context. Like for example, me personally, I'm speaking to me personally, like badass bitch,

1037
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,360
is different than stupid bitch. Sure. Like a bad bitch or something is different. Yeah,

1038
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:01,840
of course. Way different. Sure. I think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility and respect for

1039
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:07,680
human beings that are not like you. That's what, that's, that's the feeling that I'm bothering.

1040
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:15,760
So I guess what I'm trying to say here is just because people speak in this kind of way

1041
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:23,600
in the gaming world and streams doesn't mean that you, like a lot of people look up to you.

1042
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,880
It doesn't mean young people especially, doesn't mean that you don't have the responsibility to

1043
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,880
sort of stand alone from the crowd. Because you're somebody that values the power of affected discourse.

1044
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:42,960
And to be effective discourse, there's some level of civility. So you can be the sort of

1045
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:50,960
the beacon of civility in that world versus giving in to the derogatory words. Because like

1046
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:59,440
you have to, you have to lift people out of that world, out of the muck of what I would say is

1047
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:05,200
like drama and effective discourse. Like I think that's one of your missions, right, is like to

1048
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,840
inspire the world through conversation, through debate, through effective discourse. Yeah.

1049
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:14,480
So I guess I'm just calling you out that I think using our word, for me personally,

1050
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:22,160
as a fan that believes in your mission, it just makes you look ineffective and bad and

1051
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:27,040
uninspiring to young people that look up to you. Because those young people are going to use those

1052
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:32,160
words that you're using and they'll do it much less effectively. That's the problem.

1053
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,720
Yeah, I guess the challenge is always just like finding the line. Like my, my book I really shifted

1054
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:41,120
dramatically from, even from like two or three years ago, I think my vocabulary shifted quite a

1055
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,880
bit as we've like, we've kind of gotten rid of some words and some things are kind of coming

1056
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,600
out. The R word is one that has kind of gone out and come back and gone out and come back,

1057
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,560
that one we've definitely gone back and forth on. I know there are different thoughts about it in

1058
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,680
different communities on the internet. This is interesting. I mean, I'm just telling you,

1059
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:02,800
for me, it cuts, and I'm not a social justice warrior type, it cuts pretty hard.

1060
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,520
So what you're saying is I'm going to lose a subscriber if I'm,

1061
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:11,840
no, it's not a subscriber. I know, I just, I actually have to empathize harder because I'm

1062
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:17,120
like, maybe this is not a very good person. That's what I feel. Like if you're so carelessly using

1063
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:23,200
that word, then maybe you're not actually thinking deeply about the suffering in the world. Like

1064
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,640
to be a student of human nature, you really have to think about other humans and other

1065
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,640
experiences that are unlike your own. And so that's the sense I get. But at the same time,

1066
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:37,760
you're also like the grandpa, the ages, who's trying to be cool with the young kids. A lot of

1067
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,880
the reason young kids look up to you is like, you also know the language of the internet.

1068
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,560
Yeah. But I mean, it doesn't, that's not an excuse to use words that we think shouldn't be used.

1069
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,760
I guess the question that I would have, because it's always a struggle, and to some extent,

1070
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,880
it's kind of happened, is let's say that like three years ago, I would have said I'm no longer

1071
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,400
saying the artwork. That's just, I'm just going to get rid of that on my vocabulary. Like,

1072
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,760
is there a chance that today we would be having a conversation about like,

1073
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,200
why do you call people dumb fucks? Like, is that really appropriate? Like,

1074
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,280
does this attack at the core of like somebody's like level of intelligence, education,

1075
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:12,640
opportunities in life? Like, is that a worthy, you don't think so?

1076
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:17,520
I think that's a, as the kids say, cope. You really think so? I think because the words have

1077
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,680
definitely moved in a way where it's like, this was okay. Now it's not this. So you're

1078
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:28,960
standing your ground by using, listen, you could, you could, you could, but I think it's better

1079
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:34,960
to use those words. If you want to defend the ground word stand on, to use them rarely and

1080
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:42,640
deliberately versus how you currently use them, which is to express an emotion. Like you,

1081
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,040
I'm going to be honest, you use our word, not when you're at your best.

1082
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,160
True. And so that's not, that's generally, that could be true for a lot of swearing to that,

1083
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:56,240
but yeah, I know what you mean. No, but like, you know that our word is offensive, you know,

1084
01:29:56,240 --> 01:30:04,080
and there's part of it is like the, you tell yourself that like, you're still kind of fighting

1085
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,560
political correctness by using it a little bit when you say it. No, I don't think so. I think,

1086
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,160
I'm trying to think in terms of like, where is the virtue where, like, there's a whole bunch

1087
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,680
of arguments for why some words are okay, some words aren't okay or whatever. And I try to,

1088
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:19,760
like think more along those lines rather than, but like, there's going to be like a lot of

1089
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,080
phrases where like, if the our word has come out, the conversation is over. I know that,

1090
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,120
like things, my brain is shut down, the person I'm talking to is, but there's like,

1091
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,480
there's a lot of words also in terms of like, it like, if you ever hear me say like,

1092
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,840
fucking moron in a debate, it's like, it's done, like this conversation is over,

1093
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,880
there's no way that anything productive is happening past that point.

1094
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,520
I think fucking moron is not, I think it's ineffective, it's not civil, but it's not,

1095
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:48,400
it doesn't bother me in the way. It's basically when you speak in a way that I know there's

1096
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:53,920
a group that's going to be heard by that. Not only do I think about the hurt that group experiences,

1097
01:30:53,920 --> 01:31:00,400
I think of you as a lesser intellectual, like as a lesser person who's thinking about the world.

1098
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:07,680
What bothers me the most is just what kind of mindset that inspires in young people,

1099
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:11,360
especially when you're a public figure and a lot of people look up to you.

1100
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:18,240
So I definitely don't think, sort of this idea, the R word is not the battleground of expanding

1101
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:26,720
the Orton window of discourse. Okay. Like I don't think it'll lead to dumb fuck

1102
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:34,880
being canceled two years later, unless that word is hurting people's experience,

1103
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:43,040
which I don't foresee that happening. I think legitimately our word and F slur and calling

1104
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:50,640
women bitches, context matters here too. Of course, but just the way I've heard you use it,

1105
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:55,840
it is not, it's from emotion and it's from frustration and it ultimately is rooted in

1106
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:02,160
disrespect. I don't, I think it's ineffective. And of course, like who gets to say, I don't know,

1107
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:10,720
but I'm saying somebody who would like, I admire effective conversations and I admire great humor,

1108
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:19,600
dark humor, wit. To me, oftentimes the use of the R word in the way you've used in the way I see

1109
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:24,320
the community use it is none of those things. It contributes not at all to the humor and so on.

1110
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,080
Now I could see it might contribute to the, to the camaraderie of that particular group,

1111
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:36,080
especially when they normalize the use of that word. You kind of take some of the edge off,

1112
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:43,360
but you forget that there's a large number of other people that don't have the chemistry,

1113
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,840
that don't hear the music of the friendship that you have, the relationship you have.

1114
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:52,640
And instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word and it ultimately has an impact

1115
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:57,440
that's hateful. And then people like me who show up, you know, I haven't watched much of your stuff.

1116
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:03,440
It turns me off from like a couple of times your content came before me.

1117
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:07,120
And I listened to it a little bit, it turned me off completely. I didn't understand

1118
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,640
how good your heart is. I didn't understand how your mission of actually

1119
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:20,880
deradicalize people, help people like you're, and increase the level of good faith discourse

1120
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,400
in the world. I didn't understand any of that because like what I was hearing is pretty rough,

1121
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:30,880
like the R-word type of stuff. And I just feel like the benefit cost analysis is heavy on the cost.

1122
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:37,440
Gotcha. So I just have to sort of call this out. I think, and I straight up think it's wrong,

1123
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:43,680
but that's my own. Why do you think it's wrong? Because it's hurting people without any benefit

1124
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,200
to you whatsoever. When you say hurting people, do you mean the person I'm using it at? Or do

1125
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:53,200
you think there's like the third group? It's good feedback, right? I always consider everything,

1126
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,840
especially, I respect you a lot, you're a really smart guy. Something that I always kind of like

1127
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,680
fight over in terms of like language or like who to attack or what to attack or what to do

1128
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:10,960
is that it's very hard to draw like what boxes are okay to insult people on versus what aren't.

1129
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:17,600
So for instance, if I call somebody like a Nazi with a lot of vitriol, I'm okay with every single

1130
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:24,080
Nazi being negatively affected by that because that category intrinsically calls upon it some

1131
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,560
level of more condemnation for me, right? Whereas like if I'm out there, I try not to do like image

1132
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,840
related jokes, right? I don't want to call you like, oh, you're a fat fucking loser because there's a

1133
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,960
lot of people that are fat that are overweight where I don't want them to feel bad. I don't want

1134
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,680
them, I'm not trying to call you out or like insult you. So there's like a lot of, you say cost

1135
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:43,440
benefit, I look at like a lot of collateral damage from a word like that where there's no purpose

1136
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:49,120
in doing that. So certain words are easy to get rid of, they're off the table, right? Epsilon

1137
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,560
and word like these are not words you call people because you're there's so much collateral,

1138
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:57,760
it's not worth it. We've got some words where it's like if you have some form of like mental

1139
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,240
thing, it is a bad thing, you're not a bad person, but just using that word could feel like a

1140
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:06,640
collateral damage to those people. And then there's other categories of words. So like if I say that

1141
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:12,480
like this person is like there is a stupid fucking Republican, right? There's probably some Republicans

1142
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:17,440
that aren't dumb that I don't want to feel called out by that. Like are those types of phrases that

1143
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,000
you think should be completely removed as well? Or I'm kind of curious. So this completely removed

1144
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:27,280
just so we're clear. Yeah. I'm not referring to censorship. Oh no, I'm not even talking about

1145
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:32,160
this. I'm just a person like emotionally like removed is the wrong word though. Like I care about

1146
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:37,280
like I'm not trying to listen to people on the internet saying like you shouldn't say that word,

1147
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:44,160
that's not good. I mean, I'm trying to look to your mind and heart. And the reason we're talking

1148
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:51,200
today is you're betraying your gift. You're better than this. You think it's indicative of like a more

1149
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:54,800
flip of thought process where it's like the only way you can say that word is if you're ignoring

1150
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,120
the hurt and suffering of those people. And if you're somebody that says those people, you're

1151
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:05,440
ignoring the state of language. Because I think you're getting to the point because it's not about

1152
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:12,160
a single word. It's about like it's music. And I just feel like there is a very strong note.

1153
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:17,840
It's a strong note that ruins the melody. Gotcha. And I don't think I can say, you know,

1154
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,480
you shouldn't use the R word or whatever. I'm just speaking to it. I'm just listening to music

1155
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:28,560
and reviewing the final result. It's not necessarily because maybe one use of the word, the R word

1156
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:35,600
strategically or part of an actual like, or when you've built up a camaraderie that's

1157
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:41,600
sandwiched in like some love, but then you try to reveal there. Because you're talking about

1158
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,720
a lot of, there's a bunch of drama. You have friends with whom you're worrying and stuff.

1159
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:52,640
And they're all a little bit beautifully insane. And you've said that you are becoming more and

1160
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:56,800
more insane. It's beautiful to watch. It's the human condition laid before us. Wonderful. And

1161
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:04,720
some of that is swearing and so on. So it's a tricky thing. But the whole skill of discourse,

1162
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:11,200
just like it is with dark humor is walking that line. I just feel like it's overuse of the R

1163
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:15,440
word. And I don't want to die in that grog because I don't think it's that that represent. Like,

1164
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:21,200
there's certain things like that. It feels like it ruins the music. Gotcha. And I don't, you know,

1165
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:26,080
it's just saying like a dumb Republican or dumb Democrat. I don't, yeah, that ruins it too a little

1166
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:32,000
bit. Depends on how you use it. You can be lazy with that. You know, like even overuse of the

1167
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,240
word, I think bots is what's used for people who don't think or something. I don't actually know

1168
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:42,320
the definition. I'm offended on behalf of robots. That might be a compliment soon.

1169
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:48,560
Exactly. But I guess bot means you don't think. Yeah, you're like an NPC. You just copy.

1170
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,680
Again, I'm a friend on behalf of NPCs. I come myself as one. But there's a sense if you say

1171
01:37:53,680 --> 01:38:00,480
bots too much, that you're just dismissing people. Like everything I say is right.

1172
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:07,120
And anyone that disagrees with me needs a bot. That's lazy too. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes

1173
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:11,760
it's effective. Basically saying a lot of people in the mainstream media or something like that are

1174
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:18,080
bots. Okay, that's a little bit of that is effective. But too much, it becomes ineffective.

1175
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:22,160
And I'm trying to speak to that. And I'm just the reason we're highlighting

1176
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:30,240
clear examples like the N word. Joe Rogan had to contend with that. I think it's

1177
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:35,360
ineffective. It makes you less effective at discourse. But like you've talked about many

1178
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,840
times, language is a tricky one. It's always hard because you talk about constructing a melody.

1179
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,080
There's not one melody that sounds good to everyone. But there are probably certain notes

1180
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,160
that like if you got rid of them, everybody's still going to like it about as much and you

1181
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:51,040
don't really lose anything. There's a whole other part of an audience that might be more

1182
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:55,120
willing to listen. Yeah, of course. And it's not about losing the magic of that melody. Like you

1183
01:38:55,120 --> 01:39:00,160
don't want to be vanilla. I just feel like there's stuff that doesn't need to be there.

1184
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:05,120
Yeah, for sure. It's fat. But then again, the other thing that people should understand

1185
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:11,680
that might be listening to this, you're streaming many hours a day for many years. I don't know

1186
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:16,480
11 or 12, I think. Yeah, started in 2010. And so one of the things that people can do is just

1187
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:22,320
clip out anything. You're going through the full human experience of emotion, anger,

1188
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:28,400
fear, frustration, all of it. So of course there's going to be moments when you're not the best

1189
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:34,960
version of yourself. Anything else to say about the language? It's complicated. I'm still always

1190
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,800
trying to figure it out. There are opinions that I have that have changed throughout the years.

1191
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,400
It's possible that the R word has always been the next one on the chopping block that we're all

1192
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:45,840
kind of looking at, but people are always worried about that treadmill. But it's possible in a year

1193
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,520
or two, I'll have a different view on it or all have changed away some of the words I use.

1194
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,160
It's always like a work in progress. There's always different communities that feel different

1195
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:58,000
ways about different words. Yeah, but do you acknowledge that there's people out there

1196
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:06,080
that are never going to talk to you? They're never going to think of you as a good man because

1197
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:11,440
you used the N word with the hard R publicly. In the past, I mean, yeah, those people exist.

1198
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:17,840
There are some people that are beyond my reach, which I'm okay with. There's going to be some

1199
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:21,920
people because of things that have been involved or even ideas that I have now that might make them

1200
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,200
beyond my reach. Something you said earlier is very true. I think the goal is to identify what

1201
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:31,920
are the elements that you can cut out that aren't integral to your message, but could be alienating

1202
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:37,040
to more people. And those are probably the things that you identify. But I think that you can get

1203
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:42,880
lost in yourself or lost in the internet or lost in the outside of yourself if you're trying to

1204
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,880
appeal to every single person. It's just never going to be the case. I like that I've had the

1205
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,720
journey that I've had on the internet that you can find me saying and defending a lot of insane

1206
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:56,640
stuff 10 years ago, because I think it shows a level of progress. And I think I do get a lot

1207
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:00,960
of respect and buy into certain communities where it's like, I'm not just some random dude telling

1208
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,800
you that, oh, you shouldn't say the F word or the N word. I'm a guy that's been there,

1209
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,480
that's done it, that's defended it. And you can see my whole past, my whole history is laid bare

1210
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:13,760
for you to watch every thousands of hours of it. But I can show that there's growth and evolution

1211
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:19,360
and change that can happen in a person. And you're honest about that growth. It's a tricky thing

1212
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:26,960
because people just bring up stuff from your past. I hope we figure out as a civilization,

1213
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:33,760
a mechanism to clearly say, this was me two years ago. This is me five years ago. I'm a

1214
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:40,160
different person. Because Twitter doesn't care about that. These social mechanisms that bring

1215
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:45,680
stuff out doesn't care about that. It's like one stupid thing you say, it becomes like a scarlet

1216
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:49,920
letter. And I don't know how to fight that. It's tricky to fight that. Have you ever seen men in

1217
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:55,440
black? Yes. When K and J are on the bench and he says a person is smart, but people are stupid,

1218
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,000
dumb, finicky animals or whatever. There's something that changes for human dynamics when

1219
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,040
there is a group of people that make it so hard to control. I think one-on-one, anybody can

1220
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:12,240
sit across on somebody and admit to some horrible stuff. I abused my husband when I was 20 and

1221
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:16,160
35 and I see what's wrong or I did this. I was addicted to whatever and I made these mistakes.

1222
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:21,520
One-on-one, it's always easy. But in group environments that in group, out group, tribalistic

1223
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:27,200
thing of identifying one thing and then coming to destroy a person's life is such a huge impulse

1224
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:31,840
we have. And I think probably when we were hunter-gatherers in the forest, it's probably good

1225
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,840
because you really want to push weird people out or anything like that. But now on the internet,

1226
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,960
when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion and just with ruthless precision, destroy somebody's

1227
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:46,640
life over it, it's pretty scary dynamic. I think one of the mechanisms that could fix it is make

1228
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,840
it super easy for each individual person to analyze all the stupid shit they themselves have said

1229
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:59,040
in the past. Like a full recording because I think people are just honestly paying a very

1230
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:05,600
rosy picture to their own brain of who they have been in the past. If we can have empathy for the

1231
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:10,960
fact that we've said stupid shit or we're drunk, the ridiculous things you say, the offensive

1232
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,680
things you might have said, the offensive things you might have done, I just feel like that would

1233
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:22,560
give us the ammunition to have empathy for others that are like, okay, yeah, this guy five years

1234
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:28,640
ago said this, maybe that doesn't represent them, who doesn't represent who they are anymore than

1235
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:33,920
stuff I said five years ago represents who I am today. I feel like technology can actually enable

1236
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:38,400
that. Maybe, although you're talking about more recording and more stuff, which people already

1237
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:44,400
worry about. It's a double edged sword. I think there is going to be more and more recording,

1238
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:48,160
we have to figure out how to do that in a way that respects people's privacy and gives them

1239
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:52,720
ownership of their data and so on. I've looked at the search history I've done on Google,

1240
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,960
which for most people is available, like your Google search history, and it's fascinating to

1241
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,320
watch the evolution of a human being. It doesn't seem like the same person, like a different person.

1242
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:07,200
For sure. It's weird. It's also hard to with the internet today. I'm going to be agist again,

1243
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:12,480
but like now all of the people are thrown together, whereas like, I don't want a 27-year-old

1244
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:17,280
judging the age of like a 15 or 16-year-old. Obviously, he's in high school. There was that

1245
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:21,040
story that came out of the... There was a kid that saved the recording of... I think it was like

1246
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:25,760
some white girl. I think that she got her driver's license and she's like, I can drive now and words

1247
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,120
with the A or whatever. It was dumb. She shouldn't have said it, but I think she was like 15 or 16

1248
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,120
when she ticked off this or whatever. He held on to that recording until she applied and got

1249
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:37,120
accepted to college three years later, and then he released it to get her kicked out of college.

1250
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:43,520
And I'm like, damn. Everything that I had ever said as like a 15, 16-year-old was like immortalized

1251
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:49,600
on the internet. My life wouldn't have even begun. And those are insanely high standards to hold

1252
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:54,160
people to. Not that like, obviously you shouldn't be saying those... You shouldn't be saying certain

1253
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:58,480
words or whatever, but you have to be able to make mistakes in adolescence like everybody does.

1254
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,400
We all did. Everybody did it growing up, you know?

1255
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:07,520
Why do you think there's so much misogyny in the streaming community? And how can you fight it?

1256
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:14,640
Because you've shown a lot of interest in fighting it. Trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny from

1257
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:19,440
your community. I think it's really difficult. I think that eliminating racism is easier than

1258
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:25,200
eliminating misogyny. On the internet, you mean? On anywhere. Because I think fundamentally,

1259
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,240
I don't think there's that much difference between like white people and black people and brown

1260
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:31,680
people and Asian people or whatever. We have different cultures and stuff, but at the end of

1261
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:37,120
the day, we're all people. But I think there are differences between men and women throughout all

1262
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:42,880
of history and time and then even today in every culture. And when real differences do exist,

1263
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,880
it's harder to account for them in a way that can we have conversations with each other without it

1264
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,880
becoming very gendered in a negative way, right? Negative way of gendering something,

1265
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:57,520
be like a misogynistic way of doing it. Of course, it's unclear to me that it's so difficult to

1266
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:04,160
to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive. Because there's a lot of positive to the

1267
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:08,000
tension, the dance between the different genders and so on. Maybe in this particular moment in

1268
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,080
history, it's not. But it's not trivial to me that racism is easier to eliminate. It's an interesting

1269
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:18,880
hypothesis just because there's more biological difference between men and women. That means

1270
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,640
it's harder to eliminate. But I don't know if this is true. I hear this a lot. I feel like I read

1271
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,120
this somewhere, but I need to get a better source of it. I repeated it everywhere. But I've heard

1272
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:31,520
that in the US military, for instance, they do an exceedingly good job at getting different

1273
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:36,480
people of different races to integrate. And it's not a huge problem once you're through basic

1274
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,240
training, all the training, everything. But for a different sex, it still represents a

1275
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:43,680
significant problem that the military hasn't figured out. And as you look to, well, what's the

1276
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:47,680
military doing? Because if something was solvable, can we sleep for four hours a night and be healthy?

1277
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,640
If we could, I bet the military would know. So I kind of look sometimes at them to see their

1278
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:53,440
integration. But it might be that there are other issues there that make it ironic.

1279
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:58,800
Yeah, it feels like the military is a very particular kind of thing. The actual task at hand

1280
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:05,680
might bias the difficulty of the process. Potentially, yeah. There's been a lot of interesting

1281
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:13,440
talk about women integrating into male groups. And how do you do this in a way where everybody

1282
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:19,680
is happy with the outcome? And there's not issues. I think Jordan Peterson spoke about this a little

1283
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:24,480
bit and then Workplace Culture speaks about this a bit. Would you happen to remember, I want to say

1284
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:29,040
it was like five or 10 years ago, there was a big tech conference and there were two guys behind a

1285
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:34,320
woman and they made a joke about like a USB dongle, like dongle was a dick. And this woman turned

1286
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:39,440
around, she tweeted pictures of them, spoke about like misogyny and then that blew up into a huge

1287
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:47,760
ordeal that like, yeah. There was this interesting phenomenon that in a less misogynistic and more

1288
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:53,920
inclusive workplace environment, some women might end up feeling worse because in a more

1289
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,520
misogynistic environment, you're thinking like, okay, that's a woman. She doesn't get our humor.

1290
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,400
I'm going to treat her in a very indifferent, very dispassionate, cold way and whatever. And then

1291
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,680
I'm going to have my boys over here. And then you've got like these environments where they're

1292
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,880
a little bit more warmer. And it's like, oh, cool, we're going to bring this woman into our environment

1293
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,560
and we're going to make all the same types of like crash jokes we did before. And it's actually

1294
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,680
worse now. Another woman feels even more otherwise because like, oh my God, why do you talk like

1295
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:20,480
this? I think that internet communities, especially online ones that do like political debate and

1296
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:25,920
video games are very much like big boys clubs. So it's not enough to just say you can't be

1297
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:29,920
misogynistic to get rid of misogyny. There's always going to be an othering effect on women.

1298
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,600
There's a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive that you have to account for and you've

1299
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:38,000
got to try to like push that back. And that's just a very, very, very challenging thing to do.

1300
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,560
So like, I like to deal with concrete examples more. So here's a concrete example. And this is

1301
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,840
like a recent initiative in my community because I'm trying to like be, because misogyny hasn't

1302
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,240
been fixed anywhere on the internet. And I'm curious, well, there are ways that I can push my

1303
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:52,960
community to do this. I don't think you should almost ever make a comment on a woman's appearance

1304
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,200
ever if they're appearing in like some political or professional manner. Even if it's a positive

1305
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:01,360
comment, I think it's equally bad to a negative comment. It's just never good to do. And that's

1306
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:05,120
kind of an unintuitive thing because it's like, well, a woman appears, wow, she's really cute.

1307
01:49:05,120 --> 01:49:07,840
It seems like a nice comment. You're being nice, you know, she looks cute or whatever. But it's

1308
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:11,280
like, it's not at all the point of why she's there. And just by saying that, you're kind of like

1309
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:15,600
otherizing her as like a person to like think she looks good rather than listening to anything she

1310
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:20,080
has to say, you know? Well, there's a lot of stuff that you're saying and

1311
01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:27,600
that is a part of misogyny. It's almost like obvious, like any woman will tell you that.

1312
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,400
Woman, well, yeah, but they're not in these spaces and a lot of the guys don't know.

1313
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:37,120
But I think what that requires is just empathy. You don't need, you don't need, you need to

1314
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:44,160
consider the female experience. That's it. Like you have to either read about or talk with women.

1315
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:49,040
You learn like the low hanging food is very easy to learn. It feels like just the level of social

1316
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:56,080
skill oftentimes in internet communities is quite low. I disagree. I don't like to say,

1317
01:49:56,080 --> 01:50:00,800
here's the problem with empathy is it's very hard to have empathy for experiences that are so

1318
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,400
outside of your own. Well, maybe some people, there might be some people that can do it,

1319
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,640
I can't. There's a lot of stuff that I had to learn. Women are half the population.

1320
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:14,000
But they're women. They're totally different. They're totally different.

1321
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,760
We'll talk about, they're not totally different. So here's an example, okay? So

1322
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:27,920
especially for me, my archetype makes up a lot of the internet. White man. There's never been a

1323
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,640
point. The name of a beautiful woman. Who might be a dancer. What's the backstory from New Orleans

1324
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:37,360
I haven't thought that through yet. It's ambiguous. Like an open world.

1325
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,120
Open world. I want you to project wherever you want destiny, the dancer to be from.

1326
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:44,000
That's in your mind. I'll see that for later tonight.

1327
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:50,240
As a white guy, I don't know if there's ever been a spot that I've been in

1328
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:53,760
where I've been made to feel like I don't belong there just by virtue of who I am.

1329
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:59,120
It's impossible for me to empathize that because I don't even have that experience.

1330
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:04,080
If you go back eight, nine years, one of the big issues that came up was harassment and

1331
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:09,280
gaming against women. And I was one of the big debaters against that saying that like,

1332
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,520
sure, women might get harassment, but everybody gets harassment. If you're a woman and you're

1333
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:17,120
in gaming and you get harassed, congratulations, you're being treated like a man. What you're

1334
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:20,880
actually asking for is for us to actually treat you differently. You don't want to be insulted.

1335
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,240
You don't want to be treated like a man. And that's actually misogyny is women making that

1336
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:28,400
argument. You still stand by that? Is that a problem if I do? No, I'm just kidding.

1337
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:33,360
Okay, hold on. So a little while after. I disagree with it. Sure. Okay. That's good.

1338
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:39,280
You should. A little while later, I had a friend, Jessica, super cool girl. We go to play games.

1339
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,640
She was between jobs. She's like, I've got like two months and we're going to grind CS go.

1340
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:46,480
And I'm like, okay, this is awesome. Let's do it. CS go, Counter-Strike,

1341
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:51,360
Global Offensive, Shooter Game, FPS, microphones. First day we start playing. Okay. Hop into our

1342
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:55,200
first game. Obviously she talks. Everybody's making, is that a 12 year old boy? Why aren't

1343
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:58,240
you making sandwiches? Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, okay, whatever. Play our first game.

1344
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:02,480
Play our second game. Same jokes. Third game, fourth game. By like the fourth or fifth game,

1345
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:06,080
I was actually starting to feel triggered. Like every time the game started, I was like,

1346
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:10,400
can you just like talk so we can get over like the stupid fucking jokes? It's so fucking stupid.

1347
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:16,000
And you hear the same fucking joke every single time. And it took one day of that experience

1348
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,720
for me to realize it's not about being insulted. It's like this othering feeling that you don't

1349
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:24,480
belong. And I've never felt that because I'm a white guy. Like it's not to be like virtue

1350
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,200
singular. So like there's just, there's no places where it's like, you're white, you don't belong

1351
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:31,360
here. You're a guy, you don't belong here. Like I've never felt that not inclusion. And playing

1352
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:37,040
with her, there's a different feeling when it's the same types of jokes coming from a group of

1353
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:41,120
people to make you feel like you don't belong there. Where I was like, damn, this actually

1354
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:46,400
feels really bad. And it feels bad in a different way where it's like, if you call me like NF Slur

1355
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,400
or any other type of swear word or insult, like, yeah, you can call me that. But at the end of

1356
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,520
the day, like we're all kind of the same, we're all white dudes and we call each other names.

1357
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,120
But like this is a woman and this is not her place and she doesn't belong here.

1358
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,760
Kind of the analogy that I would make because I after getting these experiences, I would learn

1359
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,880
this afterwards. If I tell you that there's another guy in a room and you need to think of the worst

1360
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,640
insults ever for that person without ever knowing anything about them or meeting them.

1361
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:15,040
If I tell you that it's like a white straight guy and you have to write insults, you're fucked.

1362
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:19,200
Maybe you can do like school shooter. There's not really much you can say at the end of the day.

1363
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,960
But if I tell you it's a woman, whoo, there are so many different jokes you can write.

1364
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,760
If it's a black person, so many different racist things we can say.

1365
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,720
Are you sure? I can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy.

1366
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:31,680
In terms of stuff that is just intrinsic to him being a white guy?

1367
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,840
Yeah, like there's really?

1368
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:39,440
Wait a minute. What are you talking about? There's a lot. The internet has sharpened that sword.

1369
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,640
In terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex or targets?

1370
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,560
Incel, virgin, weak.

1371
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:50,080
Some of the incel, virgin, maybe. Yeah, that's getting there, sure. That's for sure.

1372
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:53,920
That's recent though. Sorry, I'm older on the internet. We didn't have those words way back

1373
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,960
then. When I was making these analogies that incel and virgin.

1374
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,560
Back in my day, we didn't have gender. There were no incels back then. None of us had sex.

1375
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:04,000
We just accept it. We were all computer gamers. Nobody had sex to play video games back then,

1376
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,200
okay? People don't remember that. There wasn't the big bang theory. You were just a loser that

1377
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:10,400
was stuck in zero. You guys didn't even know sex exists as we can use this as an insult.

1378
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,360
We had to download sexual pictures and they took two minutes and you didn't even know if

1379
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,480
you were going to get the right thing by the time it finished loading. But what I'm saying is that,

1380
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:21,280
okay, I think you agree that if somebody gives you a race, like a black person who's a woman,

1381
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:26,160
we can write very cutting, scathing insults for that person that are very otherizing.

1382
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:31,280
Or words that would really hurt. Yeah, that are very cutting to the person. But for a white guy,

1383
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,080
it's kind of hard because that's the default. There's not as much otherizing of those people.

1384
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:41,600
Yeah. So the insults you have from white guy to white guy, the insults are much harsher.

1385
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,640
So when you start to apply the same kind of harshness to other groups,

1386
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:49,280
you can make them feel like they really don't belong. And that otherizing effect is something

1387
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,720
that's very hard for me. I can't really empathize with it because I never felt it. So I have to

1388
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:56,080
intellectualize it and then sympathize with it. It's like a whole process I have to go through.

1389
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,440
And then I try to walk other people through that because if you're a white guy on the internet,

1390
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,080
which is a lot of the internet, you really don't know what that feels like. You've never felt

1391
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:08,960
like that before. Well, so you're now in a leadership position, grandpa destiny. So that's

1392
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:14,320
a lot of people look up to you for that. For that sort of pathway to empathy. Yeah.

1393
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:20,400
How not to otherize. I mean, you have felt otherizing. You mentioned high school people

1394
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:25,760
like not being... Yeah, but those are always for things that like it's different to insult somebody

1395
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:29,920
for a non-immutable characteristic. Like, okay, you think poorly about me because I'm like not

1396
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,880
enough money or what? I don't have money, but I could get more money and I could change that.

1397
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,960
But it's different for somebody to really attack you for like your gender or attack you for like

1398
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:44,160
your race. A lot of the attacks that hit the hardest is not about gender. I do think that

1399
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,920
the way women are attacked on the internet, it's the same kind of attacks you would do

1400
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,320
towards other guys, but you'd go harsher. I feel like they're fundamentally different.

1401
01:55:54,400 --> 01:56:00,880
I feel like when we're attacking guys, I'm not usually attacking you on like the virtue of you

1402
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,440
being a guy. But like, if it's a woman and she's typing something like, oh, did your boyfriend

1403
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:08,960
type that for you? Or like, what are you even doing here? Like, shouldn't you be trying to find a

1404
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,560
husband? Or like, oh, you're like a stupid kind of like ghost type and only fans? No, but the

1405
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:16,240
stupidity, the intelligence aspect is what's attacked. Yeah, but it's so much different. Like,

1406
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:19,840
you can call a guy stupid, but that's because he's a guy that's being stupid. But when you call

1407
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,080
a woman stupid, she's stupid because she's a woman. Yeah, but I honestly think that women

1408
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:29,840
are called stupid more than men on the internet. But it's nothing to do, like the attack

1409
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:38,080
is not gendered. It's the gender inspires an increased level of attack. I feel like it is

1410
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:43,360
gendered. I wish we had data on this. Have you ever heard of the XKCD comics? Yes. It's a really

1411
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:47,760
good comic where, and this is something that I've dealt with a lot in my community, okay? There's

1412
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:53,120
a guy at a board and he fucks up a math equation. And it's like, wow, you suck at math. And then

1413
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,640
the next panelist, there's a girl that does it and she fucks it up. And it's like, wow, women

1414
01:56:56,640 --> 01:57:02,560
suck at math. And there's like that feeling that happens where when I bring on, I won't use names,

1415
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,720
but they're like YouTube people that are brought on that have crazy opinions. And when they're men,

1416
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:11,760
that person is crazy. Oh my God, he said the crazy stuff. He's so dumb. He's so crazy, so stupid.

1417
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,680
But when it's a woman, it's like, oh my God, why do you always bring dumb women here? Why do so

1418
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,120
many women on the internet have crazy opinions? There's a different like minority character

1419
01:57:19,120 --> 01:57:24,240
that has to like stand it and like represent like they're a whole group where like white men

1420
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:29,920
don't typically have to. Speaking of group sources, individuals, yes. But then what I feel happens is

1421
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:36,080
then another person from that group comes, another woman comes and people before she says anything

1422
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:42,400
will already feel like they're ready with that attack. For sure. But they're ready for the attack

1423
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:45,920
because she's a woman. They're going to call her she's stupid because she's not because she says

1424
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:53,360
something to them or just because she's a woman. So like the group in their brain accumulates all

1425
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:57,680
the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met, not the positive, the negative,

1426
01:57:57,680 --> 01:58:03,200
and it becomes like this ball of stickiness. And then that becomes the bias for their judgment of

1427
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:08,480
a new person that comes with white men. There's more of a blank slate in terms of bias of how

1428
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:15,280
they analyze the person with any of the minority group, they basically make a judgment based on

1429
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:20,080
the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met in the past. That leads to a system

1430
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:25,440
where you're just harsher towards minority groups and towards women. How do you solve that?

1431
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:29,920
The most important thing for any problem ever is step one is to be aware of it. If you're not aware

1432
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:34,640
of it, then you're hopelessly lost at sea. But yeah, the first thing I like to say is she's like

1433
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:38,240
be aware of it. Like I've had, there's a girl that I've had on recently and she says a lot of,

1434
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:42,240
in my opinion, kind of crazy things, but people will use her as like this is why women shouldn't

1435
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:45,760
be here. This is like she's crazy and she's a woman and blah, blah, blah. But I can bring on a guy

1436
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:51,280
who's has similarly done things and he's evaluated on his own merits because it's a guy. There's never,

1437
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:54,560
ever, ever been a case where I brought a stupid guy on stream and everybody's like,

1438
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,480
this guy makes me hate men. This guy makes me hate white people. That has never happened.

1439
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:01,920
But then there's like other women that come on and it's like, now I know why incels exist.

1440
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:05,760
Or I totally understand where red pill ideology comes from. And even if the statements are kind

1441
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:10,400
of true, when you're making these observations over and over and over and over again, it damages

1442
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,480
your ability to individually perceive somebody. And then two people that make the same statements,

1443
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:18,240
one can be perceived more harshly just because of that like group bias you've got built up.

1444
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:21,280
I think there's something about streaming that just brings that out of people. Like because

1445
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:26,080
you have to talk for like seven hours. So you're like, all right, well, whatever psychological

1446
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:30,560
issues and complexities I have, I'm going to explore that for some magnified magnified.

1447
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:37,920
And then it's the, as you talked about the memetic theories or Gerardian, like whatever

1448
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,280
the things that are very similar and you're going to magnify the conflicts that you have and you're

1449
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:47,360
going to explore the, all the different perspectives on those different conflicts.

1450
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:52,960
And I mean, I don't know if it's just anecdotal, but it's nice to have women on stream. And I think

1451
01:59:52,960 --> 02:00:00,400
the dynamic that you guys have is wonderful. It's really interesting. So it's just the female

1452
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:06,160
voice in general. I love having women on the podcast. The female voice, I feel like is under

1453
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:11,600
heard on the internet and I would love the internet to be a place where women feel safe to

1454
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:18,560
speak. All right, given that you're, like we talked about a progressive with non-standard

1455
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:25,600
progressive views. So you're very pro free speech, pro capitalism. So given that it's very

1456
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:32,240
interesting that you're also pro establishment and pro institutions. So right now if you look

1457
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:37,680
at the world, there's a significant distrust of institutions, at least in sort of public

1458
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:42,720
intellectual discourse. What is the nature of your support for government and institutions?

1459
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:51,520
Can you make the case for and against them? Broadly speaking, there is a synergistic effect

1460
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:57,920
when two humans come together. If I can speak very broadly in terms of, we'll say utility,

1461
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:05,600
my happiness with one person might be 10. When they come together, it's like 50

1462
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:09,360
between the two of them. There's like the synergistic effect when humans work together

1463
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:13,520
that the sum is greater than all the individual parts or whatever. There's like an emergent

1464
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,080
thing that happens there. There's a capacity, there's a possibility of that. Yeah, a possibility,

1465
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:21,280
sure. Things could go really wrong. There could be a cannibalistic tribe that all eats each other,

1466
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:24,960
but for the purpose of this. There's all their failure modes, but yes.

1467
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:30,080
Okay, sure. Yeah. But I think broadly speaking, are you going to be the well actually guy?

1468
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:36,000
Okay, if you want to well, okay. Well, actually. Sometimes cannibalism is actually good for both.

1469
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,680
True. Yeah, sometimes things do go wrong. But I think broadly speaking, the fact that

1470
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:42,880
you're sitting here in clothing that you didn't make and I'm sitting here on an airplane that

1471
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,480
I don't know how to fly or build, like right, there's a lot of cool stuff that happens when

1472
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:52,960
people come together and they make civilizations. And part of that civilization building is the

1473
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:58,720
fact that we can specialize. And it's the fact that we can offload a bunch of trust onto third

1474
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:03,840
parties that we delegate the power to make important decisions about our lives, right?

1475
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:08,800
I don't know anything about how to like build like a combustion engine, but I know that when I

1476
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:12,080
push the button in my car, it's going to drive around and the fumes aren't going to kill me

1477
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:15,760
and I can park it in garages and the building's not going to collapse. And the only reason all

1478
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:19,440
of this works is because I've offloaded a lot of trust onto these third party things.

1479
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:22,720
And I would say that the pillars of these third party things that society is built on

1480
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:28,160
are roughly speaking institutions. So that might be the institution of peer review for

1481
02:02:28,160 --> 02:02:35,200
scientific articles. It might be the institution of voting for government, right? Or the ability

1482
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:39,360
for us to vote in that whole process. It might, yeah, all the FDA, like all of the institutions

1483
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:43,840
and things that they need to exist because we don't have the time or the capability to

1484
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,080
individually sort through all of these things individually. We have to rely on some third

1485
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:56,000
party to do it. Okay. So you believe at scale, when we're together, we're greater than the

1486
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,360
sum of our parts. That's the case for institutions. Absolutely. What about the inefficiencies of

1487
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:08,400
bureaucracy? Is there some aspect when at scale, different dynamics come into play than they do

1488
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:12,480
when there's two people together, two people that love each other, the birds and the bees?

1489
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,320
Is there some aspect that leads more to cannibalism at scale? So like corruption

1490
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:24,080
inefficiencies that due to bureaucracy and so on. Bureaucracy, which is not, I hate it when people

1491
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:28,400
try to say bureaucracy is government because bureaucracy exists a ton in private environments

1492
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:33,360
as well, right? In businesses and everything. Bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems.

1493
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:38,080
But I mean, a bureaucracy is necessary because it's coordinating all of the underlying things

1494
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:43,280
in order to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts, right? Like all of the

1495
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:46,640
software developers in the world are useless without being paired with good designers in

1496
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:50,320
order to make their products usable by a person. And the coordination of those people and the

1497
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:54,320
coordination of increasingly more and more things necessitates some level of bureaucracy.

1498
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:58,480
I think we always say bureaucracy when it's like a bad, it's like a slur on us. Like you're

1499
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:01,520
a bureaucrat, you're bureaucratic. The bureaucracy is slowing everything down. It's like,

1500
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:05,200
sure, the bureaucracy slows things down, but bureaucracy also gives us things like, you know,

1501
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:09,840
safe medicine and safe water to drink for most of the US or safe buildings to live in or safe

1502
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:15,200
cars to drive. So the managers in institution versus like the software developers and the

1503
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:22,320
designers, the managers is the bureaucracy. The reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is that

1504
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:30,960
something about human nature leads to bureaucracy often growing, growing indefinitely and becoming

1505
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:37,280
less and less efficient. I mean, this is where capitalism can come in, that capitalism puts

1506
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:43,760
a pressure on the bureaucracy not to grow too much because you want the bureaucracy to be useful,

1507
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:53,040
but not large. To be a certain size, of course. To be the minimum size to get the job done.

1508
02:04:53,040 --> 02:05:01,280
And so capitalism provides that mechanism. Government does not always. And so that's

1509
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:06,800
the criticism of government of institutions where it can grow without a significant mechanism that says

1510
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:12,480
there's a cost to bureaucracy that's not being accounted for here. We're just paying for the

1511
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:19,120
increasing size of government without the benefit. Yeah, government is a special institution because

1512
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:23,600
it doesn't have to show itself to be financially viable. And we kind of live in a capitalist economy

1513
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:27,680
where that's generally the case. So government gets its powers from votes from the people,

1514
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:32,800
which introduces a whole new set of possible positives and possible negatives. Having something,

1515
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,800
for instance, that gives food or shelter to homeless people, maybe you don't want that to

1516
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:42,480
have to run at a profit. But giving an organization that can self-justify its budgets perpetually

1517
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:46,320
and indefinitely growing, maybe that's not the best thing. Yeah, we always have to figure out

1518
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:53,120
how to do the constraints there. What about the corrupting nature of power? That comes with

1519
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:58,720
institutions as well. Absolutely. So then you better pick your style of institution very carefully.

1520
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:02,000
I think that the democratic institution we have in the United States today,

1521
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,360
I think works very well. But I mean, there are other styles of government that have been tried

1522
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:08,800
in the past that I think lend themselves more to corruption. Not to say that, by the way,

1523
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:11,920
there's not corruption in the United States. Of course, there's going to be varying levels of

1524
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:19,520
corruption at all levels. But you run into this interesting problem where authoritarian regimes

1525
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:23,920
can act with ruthless precision and swiftness because they don't have to ask any questions.

1526
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:28,720
They just do, do, do, do, do. And that's it. But the problem is, it's an authoritarian regime.

1527
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:33,680
They're prone to missteps. They're slow to respond to changing or evolving needs. There was an

1528
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:37,280
interesting study that was put out a while ago that showed that every single famine that happened

1529
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:42,320
around the world, almost 98% of them happen under authoritarian regimes where freedom of

1530
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:46,640
speech is very limited. It's very rare for a famine to happen under democracy because

1531
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:49,760
press and everything makes the government more responsive to the needs of the people.

1532
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:53,280
Power can corrupt. Their level is of corruption. But you have to have a system of checks and

1533
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:56,880
balances on all of those different levels to make sure it doesn't run off the rails, I guess,

1534
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:02,960
and do a sick loop-de-loop and half the population gets nice callback. There's a lot of people that

1535
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:07,520
will listen to you say that the democracy in the United States is working pretty damn well

1536
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:14,080
and they will spit out the drink if they're drinking a drink and be very upset. Can you make the case

1537
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:17,680
that they're right and you're wrong? Can I make the case that- Can you steal man?

1538
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:22,160
They're right. Yeah. Well, the steal man for them is that people have a lot of problems on the day

1539
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:27,680
to day. And when they look and they see what government is doing, they might see potholes

1540
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:33,040
outside their house, homeless people all over their downtown, and the United States just approved

1541
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:38,640
another X billion amount of dollars for Ukraine. Or they might be living in a city where half

1542
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:43,200
the factors are shut down. A lot of their people are out of work, but the president is on the TV

1543
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:47,280
talking about how to find jobs for immigrants coming in from Mexico. And for these people,

1544
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:52,160
they have problems that exist in their lives. Some of them are paying taxes to alleviate these

1545
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:56,080
problems. And then when they listen to the government talk, it feels like the government is

1546
02:07:56,080 --> 02:08:00,400
not responding to the needs that they have. And then that's one problem. Then on top of that,

1547
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,960
you've got all of these people working in alternative media that can show you, well,

1548
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:06,960
look at this politician wasting this much money. Or look at him double speaking here or there.

1549
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:10,960
Look at Hillary Clinton saying she's got a private position and a public position. Look at how

1550
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,240
all of these politicians have family members that are getting rich because of their relationships

1551
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:19,280
with people in Congress. Look at the revolving door between capitalist companies and the government.

1552
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:22,480
How can you look at all of that, take into account that the government's not responding

1553
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:26,160
to your needs and then really feel like it's a government by the people and for the people?

1554
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:31,920
Yeah, this was a very good, good steelman and good question. How can you, how can you,

1555
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:35,120
how can you tell that they're not just politicians that care more about

1556
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:40,560
continuously winning the elections versus being running government effectively?

1557
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:43,360
They should care about winning the elections. That's the first misconception. A lot of people

1558
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:48,640
say this guy only cares about getting voted in. This guy, like, he doesn't even believe in fracking

1559
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:52,240
or abortion. He just changed his opinion to get voted in. Anytime somebody says that,

1560
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:55,680
you say, that's really good. You want them to change their opinions so they get voted in.

1561
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:58,720
That's the whole point of the democracy. You don't want them to remain obstinate. You don't

1562
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:01,600
want them to say, I'm not changing my opinion no matter what the people want. You want them to

1563
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:05,360
evolve and adopt new opinions based on what the population, their constituents are voting for.

1564
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:10,080
Yeah, but the cynical take is that on the surface they're changing their opinion,

1565
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:16,800
but that there's a boys club or boys means the elite that under in the smoke filled rooms

1566
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:21,920
in secret, they're actually have their own agenda and they're following that agenda and they're

1567
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:28,800
just saying anything publicly to placate the public based on whatever the new trends are.

1568
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,840
So here's the cynical take a poll.

1569
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:37,680
Yeah, I understand. Somebody asked me this question and it flipped. I won 80 completely.

1570
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:43,840
I was a Bernie Sanders supporter in 2016 and my single issue voting thing was lobbying.

1571
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:46,560
I thought that lobbying, the government was corrupt, they weren't responding to these people.

1572
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:51,840
It was completely destroyed my faith in government and everything. And I had one question post me

1573
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,680
by a conservative that used to come on my stream and shout at me and he said, I think he asked me,

1574
02:09:55,680 --> 02:10:01,760
can you think of any popular opinion that the American public has that the government is

1575
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:05,360
unresponsive to? Is there some big piece of legislation or policy or whatever that people

1576
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:10,800
want that the government isn't doing? They asked me that. I couldn't think of a single good answer.

1577
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:17,600
And I'm like, oh, geez, there's good. There's drugs. There's not. Legalization or drug. Hold on.

1578
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:20,800
Yeah, go for it. Oh, shoot. You're doing the Joe Rogan thing. You're pushing back because I brought

1579
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:30,720
up weed. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I have become meme. I don't even, I don't want to interrupt your quote

1580
02:10:30,720 --> 02:10:35,440
because there's memes upon memes upon memes I can go with here. But no, because people bring up,

1581
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:40,800
okay, there's no issues. There's no issues that the government is not representing of the public.

1582
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,480
So here's the issue. So somebody will bring up like, well, what about the legalization of drugs?

1583
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:49,360
Okay. The first issue people have is one, they look at national polling. Very few things are

1584
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:54,640
decided on a national level. So that's the first huge mistake. Arguably, a lot of BLM made mistakes

1585
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:58,560
in this arena where they're saying like, why isn't the government doing anything about policing?

1586
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,960
Federal government can't do anything about policing. That's going to be your, sometimes

1587
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,840
not even your state government, sometimes your local city government, the people that like elect

1588
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:08,800
like your chief of police, your police commissioner, that's coming from your mayor, right? So you've

1589
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:12,400
got people looking, one, at the wrong parts of the government to even figure out the solutions to

1590
02:11:12,400 --> 02:11:17,440
the problem. Two, oftentimes for polling, the questions are vague enough that you can pull

1591
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:22,240
very high. But when you get into the weeds on things, no pun intended, you start to realize

1592
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:25,840
like, oh, shoot, this is more complicated than I thought. I don't know the numbers in particular

1593
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:30,160
for legalization of marijuana, but this is what I'm going to guess is the case. If you poll and you

1594
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:36,720
say, should we legalize marijuana, that number might pull at like 65, 70%. But that's including

1595
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:41,040
people that are in favor of medical marijuana. If you were to poll, like, should we legalize,

1596
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:45,040
should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana, that number might drop to like

1597
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:49,120
52%. And then if you poll, like, should we completely legalize, not just decriminalize,

1598
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,240
but completely legalize recreational use of marijuana, that number might drop to like 40%.

1599
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,280
There's like all these different ways you can pull around issues where people are like, oh,

1600
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:58,960
no, we broadly agree on this topic. But when you really figure out, well, do you,

1601
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,920
do we really agree? Or is it just like broad consensus around a thing that's never going

1602
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:05,920
to show up like in a piece of legislation? A really good example, one example I do know is

1603
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:10,320
socialized health care. I think if you poll, there was a time a few years ago where if you

1604
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:15,760
poll America, do you think every American citizen should have access to like free health care?

1605
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:21,760
I think that answer, that poll like 74% yes. But when you asked, should the government be the sole

1606
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:27,280
provider of health care, it dropped to like 26%, dropped 50 points. And you could see it was both

1607
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:30,960
asking questions about single payer, but the way that it was asked was so different that even if

1608
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,960
you all, it looks like there's consensus, there's not nearly as much consensus as people think

1609
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:39,600
around certain ideas. Yeah, go. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right.

1610
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:45,920
That polls, the way you ask the polls really matters. But when you ask, should the government

1611
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:52,480
be in charge of a thing, that also biases the answer, right? Like, because there's such a negative

1612
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:57,680
experience with government creating a dog gov site that runs the thing. But sometimes,

1613
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:03,440
sometimes, I think if you dig in, if you have a one hour conversation with each individual

1614
02:13:04,080 --> 02:13:09,040
citizen, I think you will understand that, yes, there is support for socialized medicine.

1615
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:13,920
The argument has to be made though, yeah. What do you mean with the argument has to be made?

1616
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:17,040
Like, if you just ask a conservative, like what about single payer, they're going to tell you,

1617
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:20,240
no, you might be able to build up to an argument for it, but you're going to have to make the case

1618
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:25,680
for it. No, but I thought we're talking about the feeling deep inside your mind and heart.

1619
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:32,240
Does the government represent that? Oh. So it's not like some shallow surface layer

1620
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:39,600
public opinion. Does the government effectively represent what the people want? Not a shallow

1621
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:44,320
survey, but deeply what they want. I'm not actually that familiar with the debates over

1622
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:49,600
healthcare, but let's maybe look at an easier one. Sure. Maybe you'll say it's harder. War.

1623
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:54,960
War is a really good example where the government was very responsive, I think, to the people.

1624
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:01,840
You think so. So, Iraq, Afghanistan, the government didn't manipulate public opinion.

1625
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:06,080
There is an argument to be made that they did in terms of like WMD and everything,

1626
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:11,040
but after 9-11, were you in the United States after 9-11? After 9-11, I legit.

1627
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,600
That seems accusatory. Like, where were you in 9-11?

1628
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:20,560
Just checking, okay. All right, cool. I have evidence and witnesses. No, okay,

1629
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:24,800
I'm very defensive right now. That's very strange. Look into it.

1630
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:30,000
I think after 9-11, we could have gone to war with any country in the world.

1631
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:36,000
We were ready because all of America was like, oh my God. And they pointed to Iraq and, you know,

1632
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,840
the reasons for the WMDs was kind of dumb, but I don't think we even needed WMDs to go to Iraq.

1633
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:43,760
We could have just said, you know, Saddam Hussein was giving medical aid to Taliban,

1634
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:49,680
al-Qaeda, Iraq, let's go, and we would have gone for it. But post Iraq, Iraq was for a while

1635
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:54,000
popular and then became obviously deeply unpopular, Iraq and Afghanistan. And I think you could see

1636
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,160
that influence other foreign policy that the United States had. For instance, we opted more

1637
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:02,400
towards like drone warfare than troops on the ground for places like Yemen. We opted more

1638
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,440
towards like kind of like sending money and help instead of boots on the ground for places like

1639
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:10,880
Syria. And I think that a lot of that was kind of in response to how unpopular the Iraq stuff

1640
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:14,880
had become. And when you looked at a lot of elections afterwards, even for Obama, like one

1641
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:18,480
of the defining characteristics of a lot of campaigns were like, I'm going to close Guantanamo

1642
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:22,640
Bay. I'm going to get us out of foreign wars. Even up to Trump, I'm going to, you know, I'm not

1643
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:26,320
going to stop doing all this weird stuff in the Middle East. But they didn't still withdraw from

1644
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:30,080
Afghanistan. They didn't withdraw, but they definitely like tapered off and weren't like as

1645
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:33,840
aggressively pushing those types of conflicts because they knew it was unpopular. But I think

1646
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:39,600
if you also consider perfect information or good information, if you ask a lot of people,

1647
02:15:41,200 --> 02:15:47,120
are you okay spending this amount of money for this purpose? So military conflict in

1648
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:50,800
Iraq and Afghanistan, I think almost from the very beginning, they would say no.

1649
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,880
After 9-11? I feel like maybe like a few days after 9-11, like,

1650
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,160
I remember Freedom Prize.

1651
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:02,080
What was the nature? Well, there's some memes and so on, yes. But the nature of the public support

1652
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:08,160
for the war, was there public support in 2003, which is when the invasion happened?

1653
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:12,080
I feel like initially there was a lot, I remember seeing it on, but then I also lived in a republican

1654
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:15,520
household and I was not very like media savvy at that. And I don't know if the nature of that

1655
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:20,080
public support had to do with WMDs or with 9-11. Because the weird-

1656
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:21,520
It came about WMDs.

1657
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:26,240
But I wonder what is the, if you were to poll people and let's say hypothetically,

1658
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:30,640
there was above 50% support for the war, what would be the nature of that support?

1659
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:37,600
And to what degrees the government actually representing the will of the people versus

1660
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:44,560
some complex mechanism like the military industrial complex is manipulating the narrative

1661
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:51,280
that's controlling public opinion. And then there's the media that gets a lot of attention

1662
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:56,480
by being divided and how they're shaping the narrative through the mechanism of division.

1663
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:01,600
There's a lot of complicated things out there. It's not just like the people and then the

1664
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:04,400
government. And that's, yeah, for sure, I agree that there are going to be different

1665
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:05,520
elements at play.

1666
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:12,000
And how much of those elements that lead us astray can be attributed to the

1667
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:19,440
largeness of the different systems and the different institutions, like the media institutions

1668
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:24,640
and government, the institutions that have a monopoly on violence. Let's put it this way,

1669
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,880
which is one way to define government.

1670
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:30,880
Sure. It's complicated. There's definitely going to be different institutions at play.

1671
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:34,560
But I think that like, all I would say is like in reference to my original point,

1672
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:38,400
when there becomes like broad consensus around a thing, I think the government will usually

1673
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:41,120
follow. It's not going to fight. It's going to follow more often than not.

1674
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:45,360
But I think that a lot of times I think Americans think that there's more consensus

1675
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:49,440
around certain issues than there actually are. So like a really good example, we're on that war

1676
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:56,080
point too. What caused like the lowest dip in Biden's approval rating? I'm pretty sure it was

1677
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:01,120
right after we pulled out of Afghanistan, which I think if I would have asked people like a year

1678
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:05,440
before, like, let's assume that we could pull out of Afghanistan, the government's probably

1679
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,240
going to collapse after we leave because they just don't have the will to fight, they don't have

1680
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:11,920
the support, whatever, it's just not going to work. But like no Americans are going to die.

1681
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,760
There might be a couple other people who are like, no Americans are going to die,

1682
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,960
we're going to get out of Afghanistan. Would you support that? I think broadly speaking,

1683
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:21,040
I think more than 60 or 70% of Americans are like, yeah, that would be fine.

1684
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:24,080
But then when it actually plays on TV, when we see the people hanging onto the planes,

1685
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:27,280
when we see like helicopter embassies, some of the courts and politicians,

1686
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,080
well now it's like, oh my God, this was horrible and it was so botched.

1687
02:18:30,080 --> 02:18:32,640
And it could have gone so much better. It's like, well, could it have gone better?

1688
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:37,520
Maybe, maybe not. But I mean, it seems like you can have consensus around a certain opinion.

1689
02:18:37,520 --> 02:18:40,880
But the way that things play out and the way that people actually feel,

1690
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:44,880
it's actually way, way, way more complicated. And there's not usually this broad consensus

1691
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:51,360
opinion. All right, yeah, go ahead. I'd like to believe that. I mean, just to lay my cards on the

1692
02:18:51,360 --> 02:19:04,480
table, I have faith in the power of effective government. I just have a lot of concern about

1693
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:10,000
what happens as institutions grow in size. For sure. And I just have a lot of worry about the

1694
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:17,200
natural corrupting influence on the individuals and on the system as a whole, like the boys' club

1695
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:22,320
nature of it. I don't know, there must be a better term. But basically, they, they agree to the game

1696
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:28,800
and they play the game and there's a generational aspect momentum to the game. And they more and

1697
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:33,840
more stop being responsive to the people that they represent. I just feel like there is that

1698
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:41,200
mechanism. And I think the nice thing, democracy elections are a resistance to that natural human

1699
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:46,880
mechanism. Also, the balances of power is a resistance to that mechanism. In some ways,

1700
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:52,560
the media that reveals the bullshit of politicians is also a resistance to that mechanism. It's hard

1701
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:58,160
to be full of shit as a politician because people will try to catch you on it. So there's a honesty

1702
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:04,080
method there that keeps you honest. It's to some degree, but it still feels like

1703
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:11,520
it still feels like politicians are going to politician. Yeah, they definitely play their

1704
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:16,240
games. That is true. There's probably always going to be that meta narrative over like

1705
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:20,880
governance that just develops as like, you have to form relationships and play games to

1706
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:24,880
like get legislation passed and everything. The only, the only reason why I don't like it when

1707
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:29,280
people attack institutions is because one, institutions are incredibly important, arguably

1708
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:34,080
paramount. No, they are to keeping society running. And two, I think sometimes when we shift the

1709
02:20:34,080 --> 02:20:38,480
blame onto institutions too much, I think that we lose sight of what the real problems are.

1710
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:42,640
So for instance, in the United States today, people might be very critical of the government not

1711
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:47,120
getting much done, but then everybody turns their eyes to the government for being ineffective.

1712
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:51,360
What I would argue is I would say the government is actually incredibly effective and it's

1713
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:55,680
showcasing the will of the American people really well right now, which is we are historically

1714
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:00,160
more divided than we have ever been. And if I were to just look at the people and I would say

1715
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:05,040
we have a historic divide that is getting like rapidly blown apart by things like the internet

1716
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:08,560
and the media, right? If that exists, well, what would I expect that government to look like?

1717
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:11,440
I wouldn't expect the government to be governing very effective. I would expect that government

1718
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:16,720
to show that legitimate divide in people. Do you think that divide, we have a perception of a

1719
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:22,160
large divide between left and right. Do you think that's a real divide that's in this country?

1720
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:27,520
Narrow the language. What do you mean by real divide? Do you think there is that divide in

1721
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,520
ideology, that there's a large number of people that believe a certain set of policies and the

1722
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:36,320
different set of policies? Or is it just the perception on Twitter? No, I think there is a

1723
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:39,600
large divide in terms of belief. I don't think there's very much divide between any people

1724
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,840
in terms of like what they like on the most fundamental levels want in terms of like human

1725
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:48,000
beings. But in terms of like Democrat versus Republican right now, I think there is a huge

1726
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,520
divide in terms of the direction they want to see the country go and what they believe

1727
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,720
really and what they even believe is reality, right? Unfortunately, that's who we've gotten to.

1728
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:59,520
Can I just speak about the mechanism of the left and right here, maybe on the

1729
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:05,440
memetic-roverly aspect? Is there some aspect to the left on which you're a part of that attacks

1730
02:22:05,440 --> 02:22:12,080
their own for ideological impurity more than the right does? Is it the bigotry of small differences?

1731
02:22:12,640 --> 02:22:18,560
There's a concept where when you're near somebody who is very slightly different than you,

1732
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:22,160
you want to destroy it, but when you're with somebody that's way different than you, you don't.

1733
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:26,320
I think the left does it, but I think the right does it too. I didn't realize it until

1734
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:29,920
I started dipping more into conservative communities, but oh my god, the people from the

1735
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:34,960
Daily Wire and the people from Turning Point and the America First, all these different groups

1736
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:39,040
of people hate each other and they fight each other so much. They hire and fire sometimes,

1737
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:43,120
employs, they talk smack about each other. I think there's a lot of political division between

1738
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:46,320
both sides. I think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more because it's like the

1739
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:49,520
internet and a lot of the internet spaces have a lot of left-leaning people, so you see like

1740
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:54,080
the crazy communists and the crazy progressives and the crazy center-left liberals and the crazy

1741
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:57,680
blah blah blah, whereas a lot of the right-leaning people have kind of been pushed off of the main

1742
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:02,960
areas of the internet now. Interesting. My sense was that it's hard to exist on the center-left,

1743
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:08,800
but maybe because I just don't have the full spectrum view of the political divide. It felt

1744
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:12,720
like center-left is a difficult position to occupy. Yeah, I would definitely say so, yeah.

1745
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:17,120
I don't know if it's that difficult to be center-right. It's very difficult to be center-right.

1746
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:21,040
I think actually maybe even more difficult, because a center-right person might be somebody

1747
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:26,960
who's like conservative, but not a fan of Trump and you're like over, like looking like Liz Cheney,

1748
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:30,160
right? You've had politicians that are just like, they didn't back the Trump stuff and now they're

1749
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:33,760
gone, or you might be like center-right, but like you don't think the election was stolen

1750
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,280
and now you're like half the Republican party is looking at you like you're crazy, you know?

1751
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:44,400
That's true. That's true. I think there's a Ben Shapiro I'm talking with. I think he publicly

1752
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:48,400
spoke against Trump, right? He did initially, but I feel like he softened his language up on

1753
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:52,640
him pretty significantly, but... So there's a significant pressure to kind of count how to

1754
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:56,160
a certain kind of messaging. Which the whole Republican party is feeling right now. Geez,

1755
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:58,320
that two years from now, that election is going to be insane.

1756
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:02,880
It's just hard. Okay. So to generalize, it's hard to be in the center, it feels like.

1757
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:03,440
For sure.

1758
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:10,800
To center and then like do like a random walk among the policies around that. I don't know

1759
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:17,360
what that mechanism is. I mean, it makes people like me not feel good being in the center. It

1760
02:24:17,360 --> 02:24:24,160
seems like people are just not nice to people in the center. Like the public, the Twitter machine

1761
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:29,360
is not nice to people who are open-minded in the center. Is there some truth to that?

1762
02:24:29,360 --> 02:24:33,360
Two reasons for that. One is because I think a lot of people that market themselves as center

1763
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:38,800
are legitimately spineless cowards and deserve to be called out. I've never killed the man,

1764
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:46,080
but today might be my first. Oh no. Like I told you, I'll take over your stream with the AI.

1765
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,880
Yeah, we'll see. Is that guy going to be streaming in the background?

1766
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:56,400
Hey fellas. Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Lots of gotchas, lots of gotchas. Okay, gotcha.

1767
02:24:56,400 --> 02:25:02,560
And decrease them up, which already is a pretty low level of emotion. Just decrease it completely.

1768
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:07,200
When people are screaming at you and accusing stuff, just remain calm.

1769
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:09,680
Absolutely. Emotionless. The gaslighter strategy.

1770
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:16,240
Okay, so what we're talking about. So I don't. I don't even, I don't ever identify a center

1771
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:18,400
anything because it's got such a bad reputation because so many.

1772
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:24,080
Fuck that. I stand center with a spine. It's called being open-minded and it's not

1773
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:28,080
center left and right, those are just labels. Here's a really good quote my mom said to me

1774
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:32,000
when I was really young. She said, Stevie, don't ever let your mind be so open that your brain

1775
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,520
falls out. And that's what I find that a lot of center people do. That's not what she told me

1776
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:42,720
last night. Why are you like this? I'm sorry. Okay, I'm glad I can, glad I can bring that. I'm glad

1777
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:45,920
you feel like this is safe space. Like I said, people, not judgmental. If you want to talk about

1778
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:49,120
fucking my mom, you know what? You're totally within your rights. I didn't say that. You said

1779
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:52,720
that. I didn't say that. I support that. She's a beautiful woman. Her husband probably wouldn't

1780
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,680
be too happy about it, but you know, I didn't say those any sexual relations. It was just that

1781
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:02,480
having a conversation with her, you projected that that says more by you than me. Anyway,

1782
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:09,280
go ahead about spineless center. There is some aspect to that, which is like amorphous. To me,

1783
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:16,240
center means you think freely about each individual policy without being stuck to a king.

1784
02:26:16,240 --> 02:26:19,520
Some ideal, yeah, but a lot of people don't do that. They call them so centrist, but then they

1785
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:23,440
just, they're anti-establishment essentially on everything. I don't know your position on

1786
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:27,600
like the vaccines or anything, but like, I've met a lot of like free and open thinkers who are like,

1787
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:31,920
you know what? I'm open to everything and it's an experimental vaccine and I'm going to eat hydroxy

1788
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:35,600
chloroquine and ivermectin because that's what the institutions are telling me not to take. And I

1789
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:39,920
think Fauci got too much money from that company and these are, but I'm an open thinker. And they,

1790
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:44,400
what open thinker becomes- I'm an MIT. What do you think my position of vaccines is exactly?

1791
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:47,120
I hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people. Okay. You might be from MIT,

1792
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:50,080
but I know you're from the internet. Okay. And people from the internet are weird and crazy.

1793
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:58,400
So yeah. Well, I- Who knows? I don't like arrogance. And I have criticized scientists during COVID,

1794
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:02,720
a lot of people, but scientists included having arrogance. Which is fair. But- And that's, and I

1795
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:08,400
think there's a lot of good criticism to be made of different scientific and medical establishments

1796
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:14,160
over a lot of stuff. But nobody can make those good criticisms because they're too like obsessed

1797
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:18,880
over like just trying to have the anti-establishment answer. And that is what is upsetting me the most.

1798
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:24,640
Like I think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handled

1799
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:28,480
the coronavirus. You know, were lockdowns effective? Was there enough data to support the

1800
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:34,240
huge measures we took? You know, why didn't we have the option to show I was infected a month ago?

1801
02:27:34,240 --> 02:27:37,040
Why do I need to be vaccinated? Why did, why wasn't that option ever a thing in the United

1802
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:41,760
States? I don't think it was. There are really good questions to be asked there. But all the people

1803
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:45,520
asking the questions are also trying to tell you that ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the

1804
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:49,040
way to go for everything. And the vaccine is evil. And they're just going to turn you gay like the

1805
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:54,080
frogs. And it's like, Jesus, like you get, there's like no place to reasonably criticize from

1806
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:58,160
because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or, you know,

1807
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:01,600
they're not reading studies or do anything. They're saying like, I do my own research, which means

1808
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:04,960
they listen to whatever the last guy on Joe Rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion 100%.

1809
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:09,040
Easy no. Easy no, gross. The last guy on Joe Rogan, not Joe Rogan. Okay. That Robert Malone

1810
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:13,280
guy on Joe Rogan got me real fired up. That's one guest. People see him as like the father of

1811
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:18,960
mRNA technology. He published one paper. Okay. What do you mean people? Which people think that?

1812
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:22,080
Joe Rogan fans. I get like, I run into these people. I start arguing with people and they

1813
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:26,400
start studying me. But what about- I'm a Joe Rogan fan and I appreciate the vaccine.

1814
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:28,480
That's good. I'm glad you do. But there's definitely-

1815
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:32,960
Sorry, but you said there's a type. There's a type. What's the type of Joe Rogan fan?

1816
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:38,240
Anti-establishment. I think that's not Joe Rogan. That's a general public discourse. There's a

1817
02:28:38,240 --> 02:28:44,960
default anti-establishment on the right and the left. That's the default easy thing to go to.

1818
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:48,160
I think Joe Rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though.

1819
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:52,480
Like I could guess the Joe Rogan fan. Like if I were to do general population versus Joe

1820
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:54,720
Rogan fan, who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine?

1821
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:57,920
Do you have data on this? Are you just guessing?

1822
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:01,600
Just guessing. Yeah. I think you are actually judging.

1823
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:04,400
I am. Yeah. I think you're judging. Because I think you're also-

1824
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:10,400
The beautiful thing about podcasting, this could be similar to streaming, is there's a large

1825
02:29:10,400 --> 02:29:15,440
number of people that just listen. Like what does it mean to be a Joe Rogan fan?

1826
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:19,280
I don't think you just listen. I think people listen and absorb the information.

1827
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:24,480
I would say that Joe Rogan fan base is as divided in the vaccine as the general public.

1828
02:29:24,480 --> 02:29:28,000
Gotcha. Man, I'm going to look for polling data on that. I'm sure somebody's got to have done it

1829
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:33,120
out there. But you're basically revealing the fact they have no data. You're using your own judgment.

1830
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:37,600
For sure. Based on how he's had conversations about his experience with the coronavirus,

1831
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:41,120
and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like

1832
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,640
anti-vax talking points and been completely unchallenged. And then based on statements

1833
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:47,840
he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well. Yeah.

1834
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:50,720
So that it's the level of challenge or not that he's doing.

1835
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:53,920
Well, yeah. And then what his true positions are. And then the types of guests he typically

1836
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:56,000
chooses to bring on to talk about the vaccines. Yeah.

1837
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:02,560
Okay. But that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine.

1838
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:07,440
I mean, I've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people.

1839
02:30:07,440 --> 02:30:11,920
They seem to- All the coronavirus, that whole one or two years broke. A lot of people.

1840
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:16,960
Because there's a lot of emotion and their emotion quickly solidified into an opinion

1841
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:22,720
that almost had nothing to do with like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on.

1842
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:26,480
You just made up your mind. Yeah. But I think a lot of it comes from that anti-establishment

1843
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:32,960
place. Like the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment. It was a huge private company

1844
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:39,920
backed by a huge public government. And there's Fauci, and there's Biden, and there's Pfizer,

1845
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:43,200
and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing.

1846
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:48,720
Like the vaccine was like the ultimate submission tool to show you that the government owns you.

1847
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:52,320
Not only do you have to get injected once, it's a series. And then you got to get boosters,

1848
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:54,960
and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb, and that's the control.

1849
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:58,320
I feel like that vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like,

1850
02:30:58,320 --> 02:31:01,440
do you support, are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government

1851
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:05,120
tells the sheep to take? Or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd

1852
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,640
and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the

1853
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:12,960
evil Fauci medicine jab them in the arm? And the funny thing is the crowd that stands

1854
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:19,360
against the institution is now larger than the crowd of sheep. There's like one sheep standing

1855
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:24,960
there. Sure. Or it feels that way sometimes. One vaccinated sheep. Well, okay. What's the

1856
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:29,760
defense of institutions? How do you regain the trust of institutions? Like, for first of all,

1857
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:36,640
do you think that there's ways in which WHO, CDC failed? And do you think there's criticism

1858
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:41,360
towards Pfizer and the big pharma companies that's deserved? Damn, there's the pharma companies,

1859
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:47,360
I'm not sure. For CDC and WHO, so here's a criticism that I have of all of academia and I

1860
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:53,120
feel it's stronger, stronger every day. I don't think it's enough to be a researcher or to be

1861
02:31:53,120 --> 02:32:01,760
correct about issues. Academia needs to increase its ability to communicate. It is just an unbelievable,

1862
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:07,600
unmitigated failure that academics are unwilling to wade into the complicated topics

1863
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:12,640
that exist today because other people are, you know? First, you call me spineless and then you

1864
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:16,320
call me a bad communicator. But no, look, you're here, you're doing it. So you get props from me,

1865
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:21,200
okay? Good job. That motherfu- But there are like so many, but I'm sure you've, I'm sure that you

1866
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:28,080
must have heard another fellow academic, a fellow colleague express some amount of frustration about

1867
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:32,320
like in their specific discipline, they know something to be true and they know that like,

1868
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:35,600
a lot of the messaging is like wrong or bad and the public about it, but they're never going to

1869
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:38,960
step out and say anything because either one, they're very measured and careful with their

1870
02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:43,120
take, which they feel is incompatible with what people want to hear or two, they're really worried

1871
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:46,400
that they might be incorrect. So they're going to be cautious while everybody else is going out in

1872
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:50,480
like hardcore. And they also don't have the support of institutions for them to go out on a limb.

1873
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:55,760
Yeah, that too. So like to take risks. For example, I've heard that with lab leak theory.

1874
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:00,640
I've had a lot of biologists, virologist friends that are like, yeah, it's obviously leaked from

1875
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:07,120
lab early on. Oh, maybe. Okay. We can fight over this one. But sorry, go ahead. We can fight over

1876
02:33:07,120 --> 02:33:13,040
this. But like they, okay, I should sort of back step and say like, that's like, you talk about

1877
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:16,720
shooting the shit you haven't really investigated, but it's your gut. Like, this doesn't make any

1878
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:22,400
sense. There would never say that publicly. Of course. Mostly because you're saying like what

1879
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:26,720
they would all say is like, we want to see data. Yeah, which would be good, which is fine. So

1880
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:31,360
they're going with like, this is too many coincidence in the same place. That's the logic,

1881
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:34,720
but they don't want to say anything because there's no data. You need to have evidence.

1882
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:39,440
You need to have actual evidence to say one way or the other. There's that. But there's also just

1883
02:33:39,440 --> 02:33:44,240
like you said, I mean, effective, effective communication. You're a fan of Sean Carroll.

1884
02:33:44,240 --> 02:33:49,360
Oh, yes. He's like one of the only people in this whole planet that I like besides you. I love

1885
02:33:49,360 --> 02:33:55,520
Sean Carroll. Anytime Sean Carroll is brought up as evidenced, there's a smile that comes over your

1886
02:33:55,520 --> 02:34:00,480
face. I love it. Of like joy. Yeah. Of like a little kid thinking about Santa Claus. Okay,

1887
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:07,200
I love Sean Carroll too. I love Sean Carroll because I hate this divide between like you're

1888
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:10,800
either STEM or you're like philosophy, arts and all that other stuff. And the two worlds kind of

1889
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:14,880
across. And I love that it was so good at physics, but like explorers and pays attention to all of

1890
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:19,440
the like sociological stuff too. It's so rare to find that quality in a person. He's legit. One of

1891
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:22,880
the really, really, really specialized, but you don't have to be a Sean Carroll. You can be just

1892
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:28,560
a little better at educating. Another person in the medical and the health space is somebody

1893
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:34,000
named Andrew Huberman, a friend of mine from Stanford. He's an incredible educator. There's

1894
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,360
the kind of process and science they usually call like review or survey papers where you basically

1895
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:45,440
summarize all that's going on, integrate it and like draw wisdom from it and also project like

1896
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:49,840
where's the discipline headed. And Andrew does that basically on all these subcomponents of

1897
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:54,800
the different stuff going on in neuroscience and biology and neurobiology, all of that. He's able

1898
02:34:54,800 --> 02:35:00,800
to, he does a podcast called Huberman Lab where he just summarizes all and is able to explain

1899
02:35:00,800 --> 02:35:06,000
like what does that actually mean for your, for your life in terms of protocols of how to make

1900
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,480
your life better. I feel like people should be able to do that more and more, but with viral,

1901
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:17,120
virology and boy, that's a tricky one. That's a really tricky one. I wish that people could have

1902
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:21,040
honest conversations. Like I attack a lot of people that do the lab leak theory stuff, but

1903
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:25,120
truly we should be able to have that conversation publicly. It just, it always feels like the

1904
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,000
people that are having the conversation don't ever really want to have the conversation. They're

1905
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:34,240
not being honest. Like I'm a guy that like does his own research and it's so boring reading studies

1906
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:39,680
and a lot of it, I can only do abstracts and like, it's so much work, but I'll never ever say that

1907
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:43,120
about myself. I'm a guy that does his own research because every time I hear somebody say that,

1908
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:45,920
they don't do any research. When they say they do their own research where they mean is they've

1909
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:49,600
seen one podcast and their opinion on his computer podcast is that definitely not mine

1910
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:53,680
because it was mine. I wouldn't be criticizing anything they say. But yeah, so like lab leak

1911
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,520
is another one where it's like, well, how do you know it's lab leak? How do I know it's lab leak?

1912
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:01,760
Because Fauci lied and Hunter Biden laptop and it's like, okay, come on, you haven't engaged with

1913
02:36:01,760 --> 02:36:05,840
it at all. There's really interesting research that shows us a really strong study that shows

1914
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:10,800
that there's like a high degree of certainty that it came from the wet markets, very, very high

1915
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:14,080
degree of certainty. And there was an article that came out recently where it's like, Senate

1916
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:20,000
concludes that virus actually came from the Wuhan virology lab or whatever. And that whole article,

1917
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,720
if you actually read it, it never says that in the article. I don't know why they tweeted it

1918
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:28,480
with that headline. But yeah, to back up, I'm sorry, I think we should have good, you should be

1919
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:33,520
sorry. Yeah, I'm not sorry, actually, I get to ramble here. Okay, I'm here for a long time. I

1920
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:38,800
rescind my apology. Okay, I actually rescind my apology. We should be able to have challenging

1921
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:42,640
conversations about things, but you gotta man, be well read on both sides, not this like, I do

1922
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:45,920
my own research. So I don't believe anything that Fauci says, like, come on, dude, do you think

1923
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:50,320
you can do better than that? Not you personally, but gotcha. How does that feel?

1924
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:58,880
So for people who don't know, that's the catchphrase. Gotcha. Through all tragedy and triumph,

1925
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:05,920
through all the roller coaster of life, your response to it is gotcha. It's election. Let me

1926
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:13,920
jump to that before I continue with political discourse. Psychologically, you are in a lot

1927
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:19,040
of heated debates. And you're usually super calm under fire until you're not. Sometimes you lose

1928
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:24,160
your temper completely. Very rarely. But that's like your opinion, man. Let me ask you about

1929
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:27,760
your psychology. What are psychologically your strengths and weaknesses that you're

1930
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:32,480
self aware about? I think I'm very non judgmental. So I can entertain a lot of different thoughts

1931
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:36,320
without agreeing with them or condoning them. I think that's a really big benefit to me.

1932
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:43,520
For whatever reason, I seem to be like pretty calm and dealing with annoying people. It's why

1933
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:47,120
I got promoted at the casino so fast, I could deal with like drunks or whatever, like it just didn't

1934
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:53,120
affect me that much. What percent of the population is annoying? Depends on how you're engaging with

1935
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:56,080
them. Most people aren't really annoying ever. That's why I mean that. But if you're doing like

1936
02:37:56,080 --> 02:38:00,400
political debate, what percentage is annoying? I guess it depends on who I'm debating and what

1937
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:05,200
the topic is. I guess I'm trying to point out the fact that sometimes you can say

1938
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:10,000
that reveals something about you if you think a large percent of people are annoying.

1939
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,760
Well, I would say working graveyard shift when alcohol is involved, that percentage of people

1940
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:18,400
goes very, very, very high. Or to be more fair, actually, it's not a high percentage truly.

1941
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:22,880
But if you're a server, one bad customer can ruin the rest of your shift. So you only need like

1942
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:27,200
one or two people acting in that manner to just like totally throw you off. And you're able to,

1943
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:32,720
at least these days, not allow that one customer to throw you off, quote unquote.

1944
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:37,920
Yeah, very much like a, I noticed this especially after having a son, there's something about like

1945
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:41,120
six year old kids or whatever, where it's like, if they get mad, they're never going to be mad

1946
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,640
for that long. Like they'll move on. Like that's my mentality. I'm like a six year old kid. Like

1947
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:46,800
I might be mad about something, but I'll get over it in like 30 minutes or an hour.

1948
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:51,600
I'm pretty good about not carrying that through. It's very rare that I'll like hold a grudge

1949
02:38:51,600 --> 02:38:56,240
against anybody or like be angry about something or really disaffected by something over the

1950
02:38:56,240 --> 02:39:00,400
long term that almost never happens to me. What are your weaknesses psychologically,

1951
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:05,120
would you say? I still have a problem with projecting. I think we all probably do,

1952
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:08,480
but like my mind onto others, it's like, if I understand this and I've said this,

1953
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:12,400
you should understand it. And if you're not, you're dumb. That's like an issue that I,

1954
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:16,640
I still have that where I project too much. What about like holding grudges and stuff like that?

1955
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:20,160
I'd never hold grudges. I'm like the least grudgy person ever. It's kind of a meme in my

1956
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:24,000
community because anybody can always like come back as long as they're acting different. Yeah.

1957
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:27,120
What about the, as long as they're acting different?

1958
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:28,880
As long as they're acting different. I mean, all right.

1959
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:32,880
The reason why I say that is because so friends, nobody likes this, but I have a strong stance

1960
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:36,560
on apologies and then I hate them. I don't ever want to hear an apology. I don't care about them

1961
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:40,400
ever. They don't mean anything to me. If you did something bad, as long as you've like fixed the

1962
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:43,120
behavior and you're not doing that thing, then we're generally chill. It's like there's been a

1963
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:45,920
lot of people that have been involved in weird stuff with me, but then like they, they go off,

1964
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:48,800
they do the thing and they come back and it's like, okay, cool. As long as you don't do it again,

1965
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:55,280
like we're fine. Like it's all good. I'm sorry. You feel that way. It's not your fault, Steven.

1966
02:39:55,280 --> 02:40:00,720
It's not your fault. Okay. Gotcha. You said plenty of negative stuff, positive stuff and

1967
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:06,160
negative stuff about Hassan. Yeah. This is my podcast. I get to get you to force you to say

1968
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:11,440
positive things. What do you love? I'm all about love. Let's go back to grilling me on the R word

1969
02:40:11,440 --> 02:40:14,800
stuff. You're going to make me compliment Hassan. This is going to be a harder conversation than

1970
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:22,480
that. All right. We're going to get you to feel emotions. Okay. For people who don't know,

1971
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:28,800
he's another popular political streamer. I think you had, as the kids call it, a bridge burning

1972
02:40:28,800 --> 02:40:34,720
over Bernie Sanders. I don't know. My research is very limited on this, but what do you respect

1973
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:40,400
and love most about Hassan? He puts in a lot of work when he was like growing his stream from

1974
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:44,720
2,000 concrete viewers to 15,000. He was streaming like, it was like 12 hours a day,

1975
02:40:44,720 --> 02:40:50,240
like every single day. So that was, I remember I did a lot of work. He does seem to be pretty good

1976
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:54,160
at networking and socializing and making the correct friends and connections to continue

1977
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:57,680
to build his business. What about him as a political thinker? I know you don't think

1978
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:04,640
I leave him in that regard, but I think that's unfair. I honestly want to push back on that because

1979
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,240
I have zero respect for him as a political thinker. There's not going to be almost anything.

1980
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:17,040
So I will say, I admire the fact that through no actual capability or ability of his own,

1981
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:20,240
he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers just because he's towing the line.

1982
02:41:20,800 --> 02:41:24,400
Good job for him on that. He's got a lot of correct opinions, just he has no idea why.

1983
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:28,640
I think that's undeserved. I think that's too harsh, man. The reason I bring that up,

1984
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:35,200
because I feel like there is a deep grudge in there somehow. So you're the father now,

1985
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:41,120
so since you're so old, the grandfather of the political debate on stream,

1986
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:46,240
on live stream political debater. So there could be some grudge about that

1987
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:52,400
split that happened or not enough credit given all that kind of stuff. I just think he's somebody

1988
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:58,320
that has a left-leaning ideology that's different than yours. He was a Bernie supporter,

1989
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:02,880
and I guess you were not. Can you explain to me where the division is?

1990
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:08,960
He exemplifies everything that I absolutely hate about politics, which is shallow engagement,

1991
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:13,440
heavily ideologically driven, and you're not ideologically different.

1992
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:18,320
Absolutely not. That's what we're talking about, like the free thinker in the real

1993
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:25,120
meaning of that word. Let me qualify what I mean when I say that. I spent a lot of time,

1994
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:28,880
unfortunate time, delving into the boring world of philosophy. I spent a lot of time

1995
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:34,720
thinking about what are my ethical positions? How do I feel about myself, the people around me,

1996
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:37,920
and how that relates to the world around me? And then from all of these positions,

1997
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:41,840
I think you might have used the phrase first principles earlier. From these kind of first

1998
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:47,360
principles, out of that is where all of my political positions are built out of, like full stop. So

1999
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:51,200
if you ask me a question, how do you feel about the right to own a firearm, or how do you feel

2000
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:55,520
about social health care? We can walk through, well, this is how I feel about it is like a

2001
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:59,520
thing from the government. This is where the government gets its power. This is ethically how

2002
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:03,040
groups of people are supposed to function. This is morally how we relate to each other. And

2003
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,320
personally, this is how I feel. I'll be able to do every single political belief back there.

2004
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:11,200
It's not like I'm telling you, if I were to ask Hassan, what do you feel about this political

2005
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:14,320
topic, he's going to tell me what progressives are supposed to say. I don't know what he thinks

2006
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:17,440
about it. I don't know if he thinks so. Don't you think that's a cynical take? Why is he,

2007
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:22,720
just because his views coincide with the mainstream narrative, mainstream viewpoints

2008
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:28,400
of progressive thinkers? I mean, why does that mean he's not thinking? Because his engagement with

2009
02:43:28,400 --> 02:43:34,160
every subject is incredibly shallow, 100% predictable. Like I could write like a, I could

2010
02:43:34,160 --> 02:43:37,840
probably program a script to like give you every single potential answer you could have to any

2011
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:41,760
single question you could give him. Again, I think that's pretty cynical take. Okay, it could be the

2012
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,440
case that his brain perfectly aligns with every single mainstream. But I don't know if you know

2013
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:50,080
it is perfectly aligns, because I think you're just taking a very select, just extremers do of

2014
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:56,960
each other, a very select slice that represents the perfect alignment, as opposed to looking at a

2015
02:43:56,960 --> 02:44:01,600
person struggling with ideas and thinking through ideas, and then giving him a pass like a lot of

2016
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:08,000
people, like I give you a pass on just the fact that you say a lot of crazy shit on streamed for

2017
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,600
drama, like, which is why I don't say things for drama. That might be dramatic, but I mean,

2018
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:20,480
you've evolved as a fish evolves legs, you've evolved a mechanism which creates controversy.

2019
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:26,080
Sure. You could say it's not intention, but it happens. I think the extremists kind of learn

2020
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:31,680
that kind of thing. And so I'm sure Hassan does the same kind of stuff. And so like underneath it,

2021
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:36,800
there's still thinking being that's contending with political ideas. You don't think so.

2022
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:40,640
He does a really good job at hiding it. There are other political figures that I really don't

2023
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:43,520
like that I wouldn't say the same thing about. So like, I don't know if you have Vosch written in

2024
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:48,560
there. Like, okay, that's a person that he also split out of my community and grew up to something

2025
02:44:48,560 --> 02:44:51,760
and now he hates me and he's an anti fan community and they all have him. Okay, tell me something

2026
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:55,680
you love about Vosch. I can tell you a lot of things about Vosch. I think Vosch legitimately

2027
02:44:55,680 --> 02:45:00,800
thinks through a lot of his political positions. I admire or did admire that he has like his own

2028
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:04,800
like positions that we take sometimes contrary to people further left than him. He's got some

2029
02:45:04,800 --> 02:45:08,560
positions that don't fit his ideology kind of at all, like he's his own independent thinker.

2030
02:45:08,560 --> 02:45:13,040
Rhetorically, he's very effective. He was willing to sit down and do research for like his debates

2031
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:17,120
and everything. He would spend a lot of time practicing like his rhetorical effectiveness

2032
02:45:17,120 --> 02:45:21,360
and navigating conversations. He intentionally and purposefully built like a community that

2033
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:26,800
exemplified his values. Yeah, I've got a lot. I don't, we are completely split and hate each other

2034
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:31,440
now, but like I have a lot. Why? Why? Why? First of all, hate is a strong, why the hate?

2035
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:35,120
Okay, I don't hate him, but he hates me because we had a couple of really big debates.

2036
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:38,880
What happened? Well, one had to do with whether or not you should live your values.

2037
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:42,640
And can you give me the story that's a charitable interpretation? I always

2038
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:46,160
give charitable interpretation. You don't. I absolutely do. You don't. Wait,

2039
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:49,440
name one time it happened. Five minutes ago, you talking about Hassan.

2040
02:45:49,440 --> 02:45:52,800
Everything I said about Hassan is true. There is no steel man there. Okay. That's not charitable.

2041
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:57,760
That's, I'm sorry. If you can, if you can prove me wrong, I would love for you to do it. Okay.

2042
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:04,080
I'm using my gut instinct. Usually when somebody feels strongly about another person in that way,

2043
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:09,040
it's not coming from a place of data and reason. It's coming from a place of emotion.

2044
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:13,040
It's coming from a place of resentment and grudge and all that kind of stuff.

2045
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:16,800
Yeah, I understand. There's deep, there's emotions deep in there. So the gacha is hiding,

2046
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:23,680
the gacha is a surface of an iceberg and there's a deep ocean underneath that you yourself have

2047
02:46:23,680 --> 02:46:25,840
not explored. I disagree, but I understand why-

2048
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:31,680
And Lav is actually a doorway. The young Lav is a doorway for you to explore the depths of-

2049
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:34,240
Get into that ocean to find my fish, my pre-vol form.

2050
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:39,040
I understand why you think the way you do and you should, you shouldn't believe me and I understand

2051
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:42,000
that because if somebody told me the same thing, I think you probably just really don't like this

2052
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:45,920
person for a reason or two. I understand what you think that way. Okay. The reality is though,

2053
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:49,440
for any political person that I disagree with, like I can give them a fair shake. It's one of the

2054
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:53,520
few things I think I do exceedingly well on my stream. Even with Hassan, there's been drama that

2055
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:57,680
he's been involved in and I've like very, when I'm involved in drama, he'll always throw me out of

2056
02:46:57,680 --> 02:47:00,480
the bus, but when he's involved in stuff, I'll always say like, oh, like I think Hassan was

2057
02:47:00,480 --> 02:47:05,600
right here or I think that he meant this. There was a thing that came up once we're on

2058
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:09,600
live stream fail. He was getting roasted because he referred to somebody, he used the expression

2059
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:15,760
shit skin to refer to somebody's like the way they looked. And I have only ever heard that in

2060
02:47:15,760 --> 02:47:20,400
the context of 4chan people talking about like Indians or like black people. Like it's a racial

2061
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:25,760
thing, but I could tell the context and everything that he was saying. He was insulting some guy.

2062
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:28,800
I think it was kind of like incel virgin or whatever. He was going for like acne skin.

2063
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:31,280
I think that's what he meant when he said it. And there were a whole bunch of people that were

2064
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:33,920
insulting like, oh my God, did he just say racist term? And I was like, no, I don't think he was

2065
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:37,760
racist. I think he was like, he was just reaching for words. And that's what came out. So like that's

2066
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:43,040
an example of me being charitable. Okay, but didn't you criticize him for something? I was trying to,

2067
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:46,720
I like Googled why the hell you guys split out because I thought you're friends or you should be

2068
02:47:46,720 --> 02:47:50,320
like, it's a little bit more common Harris video, but go ahead. Is that why is that the

2069
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:56,960
I feel like you criticize them over something. And I'm okay, this is very vague memory, but

2070
02:47:57,040 --> 02:48:00,800
you criticize them over something. And I felt that criticism wasn't charitable.

2071
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:03,920
Was it Pete Buttigieg stuff? Yeah, Pete Buttigieg. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2072
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:08,240
Yeah. So I've said this a million times, but there's no amount of context or no amount of nuances

2073
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:12,720
is ever accessible to people. I don't think Hassan is homophobic, but I think the comments

2074
02:48:12,720 --> 02:48:17,680
made about Pete Buttigieg were really homophobic. That's what he said. Yeah. And there were a lot

2075
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:23,200
of people making a lot of comments that made me really uncomfortable about Pete Buttigieg.

2076
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:26,960
That was insane to me. Spurred by the comments of Hassan?

2077
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:32,400
No, but it was an environment of progressives. All the progressives were attacking Pete,

2078
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:38,240
and I felt like his gayness became like the subject. Yeah, but why, why throw Hassan under

2079
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:42,560
the bus for that? He was jumping along with all of those types of like insults. You don't think

2080
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:46,080
you've done the same kind of stuff? If I do, call me on it and I'll probably say I shouldn't have.

2081
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:49,120
That's what the R word was about. That's a good call out.

2082
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:52,880
But like your friend, like you should privately tell him, right? Well, no,

2083
02:48:52,880 --> 02:48:57,200
by then we were sworn enemies. So that wasn't the reason. No, no, no. It was over a Kamala Harris

2084
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:02,000
video. Sworn enemies. He hates me. What am I supposed to, listen, for all of these people,

2085
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,880
I will accept them back into my life if they ever want to come back in at any point in time,

2086
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:07,840
but usually they're the ones that would say. If they correct themselves, right?

2087
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:12,640
No, I'm not expecting anybody to. So here's the deal with Vosh and Hassan. These are like the three,

2088
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:16,880
we're the three guys on line. None of us will talk to each other. Hassan, because he won't give

2089
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:21,440
clout to anybody and Vosh because he thinks I'm bad faith. And then neither of them will talk to me

2090
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:25,760
because they both hate me. You guys should go on a camping trip together. It's like broke back

2091
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:31,520
modern, but three way and just like rejoin, refine, refine the vision for each other. Honestly,

2092
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:37,760
just from the internet perspective for me as a, just stepping into this world. There's some aspect

2093
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:45,120
to which you have a responsibility. I hate that word. You have an opportunity. I wish you guys

2094
02:49:45,120 --> 02:49:50,560
would kind of be the beacon of like forgiveness and friendship and like camaraderie and that kind

2095
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:53,760
of stuff. Yeah, I agree. And even if we disagree, it would be really good content for us to argue.

2096
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:59,840
Shit talk, like friends shit talk versus not, like the fact that you guys don't talk to each other.

2097
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:05,120
Like I would love for you to shit talk publicly with the camaraderie always there. Like there's

2098
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:09,040
love in the beginning, love in the end, but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle.

2099
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:13,200
And that's what live streaming is for, the political discourses. That's great political

2100
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:20,400
discourse versus I think what underlines some jealousy and so on. You get this many followers.

2101
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:25,280
I just want to make sure you're clear to your audience. Everybody has to your audience.

2102
02:50:26,080 --> 02:50:30,640
I'm sure you have flaws and I'm just not in this dynamic. Hard to find, you know, because I'm,

2103
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:36,000
your only flaws, you're too modest. Yeah. So why did you guys split up? Because I would love it

2104
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:41,920
honestly. Just let me just put that idea out there for you guys to make up. Yeah, it's out there,

2105
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:45,840
of course, as everybody talks, me, Vash and Hasan, it's crazy that like the three largest like

2106
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:51,200
political debate left leading people online, like can't do any type of content or collaboration

2107
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:55,920
at all. It's so stupid. Yeah. What was the reason you guys split up? The Kamala Harris?

2108
02:50:55,920 --> 02:51:01,760
So Hasan's entry into kind of like the Twitch political debate world was in, I think 2018,

2109
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:06,320
I think he did a debate with Charlie Kirk and he reached out to me to kind of like review that

2110
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:10,720
debate to like go on, to go over it on stream. And he came on, we went over it and then we kind

2111
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:14,080
of friendship developed. We hung out in real life. I think when I came to LA, I think I saw

2112
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:20,000
it on his couch, we played with his dog, we were like kind of friends. And as time went on, and

2113
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:26,240
then he was a little bit more, he was farther left than he led on. So like I was a social Democrat,

2114
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:30,400
he was a social Democrat. But back in those days, like 2018, when people said they were a social

2115
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:33,360
Democrat, they really met socialists, but they just didn't want to say it. So he was farther

2116
02:51:33,360 --> 02:51:39,200
left than me. And we had a lot of deep divides in our approach to politics. Whereas like I was

2117
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:43,440
very much like a first principles, this is my whole political position. And he was very much kind

2118
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:46,880
of like a, this is like the political ideology I'm involved in. And this is kind of like the

2119
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:51,440
field that I kind of like navigate in. So there were a couple instances where these divides would

2120
02:51:51,440 --> 02:51:57,360
be laid very bare. One was when it was either him or the young Turks, I think it was him.

2121
02:51:58,320 --> 02:52:02,720
There was a shooting in a neighborhood where a very young black child gets killed by a white

2122
02:52:02,720 --> 02:52:07,600
shooter. And they did a video about like hate crimes and how hate crimes are on the rise

2123
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:11,040
between races and white people are evil and blah, blah, blah. Not that, but like white people,

2124
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:14,240
community hate crimes against black people. And I remember saying to him, I was like,

2125
02:52:14,800 --> 02:52:20,000
hey, we don't have all the data yet for this. It feels really bad to make videos about this

2126
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,400
beforehand, because it's the same type of shit that happens at airports. Is there a thing going

2127
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:28,480
on? Was it a brown person? Are they Muslim? It's Islamic extremism. We see this played out so many

2128
02:52:28,480 --> 02:52:32,480
times in recent history, probably not a good idea to jump to conclusions. And he's like, well,

2129
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:36,240
no, you don't understand, like it's not that big a deal, whatever. And obviously, as the story goes,

2130
02:52:36,320 --> 02:52:40,720
tale as old as time, the data comes out, it was just an errant shot. There was like gang violence,

2131
02:52:40,720 --> 02:52:43,680
shot goes out of nowhere, hits a kid in the car. It wasn't like a hate crime. The guy was trying to

2132
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:48,320
kill a kid. But yeah, we basically, we bump up against a few kind of political disagreements like

2133
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:52,960
this. And an annoying thing is happening in my community where Hassan is like the serious political

2134
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:56,320
figure because he's from the young Turks. And I'm just kind of like, I do politics, but I also

2135
02:52:56,320 --> 02:53:00,400
game. And anytime I criticize Hassan, people like destiny, you need to be more respectful. He does

2136
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:03,920
this full time. If you're going to bring criticisms, you need to be like really well read and researched

2137
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:06,880
because he's got a, you know, more serious, whatever, which I thought was ridiculous.

2138
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:11,120
So by the way, if people don't know, he worked at the young Turks, which is

2139
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:14,240
like the largest left-leaning YouTube channel probably, or at least at the time. Yeah.

2140
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:20,480
So finally, he did a video on, we skip ahead to some more minor disagreements. He does a video on

2141
02:53:20,480 --> 02:53:24,640
Kamala Harris. It's called the Kamala Harris. And it's like seven or eight horrible things about

2142
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:28,400
Kamala Harris. And I'm like, okay, I know at least one or two of these things are not fully accurate.

2143
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:31,920
So I'm going to do all the research. I'm going to have all the sources and we're going to have a

2144
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:35,600
long conversation about it so that now when I provide criticism to him, it's not going to be

2145
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:39,680
like this horrible, like just me saying something flippantly or whatever, it's going to be like

2146
02:53:39,680 --> 02:53:47,120
substantial criticism. So I was on a plane ride, JFK to Orlando, whatever, flying to Sweden to visit

2147
02:53:47,120 --> 02:53:52,240
my wife. And on the plane, I review all of the video, all the data, do all the research and I

2148
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:59,440
write everything. I'm just like, okay, I get to my, my wife's dad's house and I'm at the table,

2149
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:03,840
we're having a conversation like, hey, we should talk about the Kamala Harris stuff. And he's like,

2150
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:09,920
okay, well, let's do it. And we go over it and I'll leave to the audience to watch the video.

2151
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:13,200
Enough people have said this. I feel pretty common to say this. I was pretty reasonable,

2152
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:17,040
pretty measured, pretty calm the whole time. And I think he started to get increasingly irritated

2153
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:21,440
that I was levying like more and more serious criticisms at like the quality of work that he

2154
02:54:21,440 --> 02:54:26,080
did. Probably because he felt a little bit intimidated, I think by my willingness to like

2155
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:29,600
dive through political stuff, there'd been a couple of awkward blobs where like on,

2156
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:34,400
there was like a show called the Raj Royale, where sometimes politics would come up and

2157
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:37,440
Hassan would kind of try to explain something. And there was another person one time on the

2158
02:54:37,440 --> 02:54:40,240
show that made the joke was like, instead of Hassan taking 10 minutes to explain this

2159
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:44,160
condesity, just come here and explain it in 30 seconds. And he like exploded that he got so

2160
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:48,640
fucking mad at that. So yeah, I think that when I made that kind of call out or critique of him

2161
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:52,240
over the Kamala Harris stuff, he's probably feeling like increasingly irritated, threatened,

2162
02:54:52,240 --> 02:54:55,920
agitated. And then that's kind of what began the huge split from ours.

2163
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:59,200
So you don't think you were a dick at all? I don't think so in that conversation,

2164
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:05,920
especially given that like, at that point, because this is still 2018 or 20, this might be 2019,

2165
02:55:05,920 --> 02:55:10,960
I'm still known at that point as being very aggressive towards conservatives or all writers.

2166
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:15,680
Yeah. So and with lefties is what I call them. I think I'm being like very gentle,

2167
02:55:15,680 --> 02:55:19,440
like my conversation with conservatives is like, you're so dumb. Like that's how I'm

2168
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:22,720
like doing it. So like with him, I'm like, well, don't you think that like this is like a little

2169
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:26,640
bit of like an inconsistent presentation of how like I feel gonna be nice. But I always leave

2170
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:30,720
to the audience so they can go and watch that Kamala Harris video, Destiny Hassan, if they

2171
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:33,680
think that I was being a dick or not. But a lot of people watch and said I was being pretty gentle.

2172
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:40,320
Well, let me say as a new fan of this space, I hope you guys make up and I hope you guys fight it

2173
02:55:40,320 --> 02:55:45,280
out in the space of discourse and ideas. Me too. And also with empathy, understanding what the

2174
02:55:45,280 --> 02:55:50,320
strength of the other person is, what their buttons are. And, you know, there's like an

2175
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:55,600
unspoken rule that you don't press the buttons that you don't need to, unless you're doing it

2176
02:55:55,600 --> 02:56:00,160
mutually and it's fun because, you know, it's fun to piece each other off. So that's kind of

2177
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:04,720
like what friends do. You don't cross a certain line. But then other than that, you fight it out.

2178
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:11,440
Okay, let's step back. One other super interesting aspect of your worldview is your big supporter

2179
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:17,280
of Biden. Can you explain what you love about Biden? Do you love Biden more than Sean Carroll

2180
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:23,760
or less? Sean Carroll is just like in another world of admiration. I feel like I'm culturally

2181
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:29,280
appropriating you by saying gotcha now. But it's so convenient. It's an easy word. You just, I know

2182
02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:33,200
we're on the same wavelength. Okay, we're synchronizing. That's good. I mean, it is really

2183
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:37,840
interesting because even people that support Biden usually don't say they love sort of,

2184
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:42,160
they don't support it strongly, you know? Ideologically, philosophically, the reason

2185
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:46,560
why I like Biden is because he's really committed to this bringing the left and right together,

2186
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:51,280
which is something we so desperately need in the country. And his, you know, statements over and over

2187
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:55,440
again of like, I'm not the Democrat president or the Republican president. I'm the president of

2188
02:56:55,440 --> 02:57:00,480
the United States. His desire to bring Republicans together to work on things like the infrastructure

2189
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:06,400
bill, that's so incredibly needed. And I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for him

2190
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:10,960
for trying to push through on that message. Do you think then it's unfortunate that he made

2191
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:15,040
that comment about MAGA? MAGA Republicans? Yeah. I mean, I figured what the comment was,

2192
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:20,720
but it's MAGA Republicans are not good people kind of there. I watched the full video and

2193
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:25,280
he's right. There is this toxic aspect. And it's hard to call out because they're always going to

2194
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:28,560
spend like, oh, he hits our Republicans. He's not. If you watch the quote, he's very specifically

2195
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:33,040
calling out like this group of people that think that the election was fraudulent.

2196
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:36,240
Is it clear? That's what he meant by... We can bring it up.

2197
02:57:36,800 --> 02:57:40,320
All right. This is... Oh, no. Uh-oh. Did I remember watching it on stream? It was like,

2198
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:43,760
if you said it, yeah, that's bad. You can probably like YouTube MAGA Republicans Biden.

2199
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:46,480
But like, it feels like it's pretty clear he's talking about the people that are like election

2200
02:57:46,480 --> 02:57:54,960
denying. Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA

2201
02:57:54,960 --> 02:58:01,920
Republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.

2202
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:10,080
Now I want to be very clear, very clear up front. Not every Republican,

2203
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:15,760
not even the majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces

2204
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:22,320
their extreme ideology. I know because I've been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.

2205
02:58:23,440 --> 02:58:29,360
But there's no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated

2206
02:58:30,240 --> 02:58:35,680
by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.

2207
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:42,480
I disagree with that, man. He didn't clearly say extremist ideology. He didn't say the

2208
02:58:43,280 --> 02:58:46,480
people that doubt the validity of the election. I mean, that's Donald Trump.

2209
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:50,720
No, but there's... That's all the candidates that Donald Trump is supporting. How many,

2210
02:58:50,720 --> 02:58:54,880
what is it like, 40, 50, how many candidates right now that are MAGA candidates are election

2211
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:59,440
Democrats? No, but there's 80 million or whatever people voted for Donald Trump.

2212
02:58:59,440 --> 02:59:06,480
You could say that's the MAGA Republicans. So to me, it sounded like he was referring to

2213
02:59:07,360 --> 02:59:13,440
not even the majority. I mean, that's one nice helpful clarifying statement. But basically,

2214
02:59:13,440 --> 02:59:17,280
there's the mainstream Republicans and then there's those that voted for Donald Trump.

2215
02:59:17,280 --> 02:59:18,960
That's the way I heard it. Okay.

2216
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:21,520
And so maybe you should have done a better job at clarifying, but...

2217
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:27,120
Yeah, I feel like there's a clear, there is a huge problem with this group of Americans.

2218
02:59:27,120 --> 02:59:29,280
I think the election is stolen. I feel like that's what he's trying to call.

2219
02:59:29,280 --> 02:59:37,680
No matter if that's what he meant, even flirting with that line is not a person who's bringing

2220
02:59:37,680 --> 02:59:43,040
people together. I feel like the extending a hand to the most... I've worked with Republicans in

2221
02:59:43,040 --> 02:59:48,560
Congress, not even a majority of Republicans are like this. No, but why say not the majority of

2222
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:56,320
Republicans that like to say, we're one country. We believe the same thing. So focus on the uniting

2223
02:59:56,320 --> 02:59:58,960
part versus saying... Maybe he does before and after. That was 50 seconds, okay.

2224
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:05,440
The point is you never say something like that. Listen, you've spoken about the Bosnian speech,

2225
03:00:05,440 --> 03:00:09,200
which is your favorite of his. I went back to it and listened to it.

2226
03:00:09,200 --> 03:00:13,360
Before I move to that, just on this, it's really hard for him to call out that group of election

2227
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:16,000
deniers, I think, without it always feeling like... Well, why call them out?

2228
03:00:16,640 --> 03:00:20,240
Because it's arguably one of the most destructive forces that exist in this country today.

2229
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:24,240
Did it destroy anything? They were trying to.

2230
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:27,120
Did it though? It didn't, did it?

2231
03:00:27,120 --> 03:00:29,600
So does that mean we don't call it out? We wait till next time?

2232
03:00:29,600 --> 03:00:36,880
Because calling it out is giving fuel to the division. The people that doubted the validity

2233
03:00:36,880 --> 03:00:42,800
of the election, that's anger, that's frustration with the other side. You heal that as opposed to

2234
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:49,040
saying all those people that believed that at any time are idiots. They're un-American.

2235
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:51,840
I mean, they don't think the election was real. I don't know if Biden has the

2236
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:54,080
ears of these people at all. I don't know what he can do for...

2237
03:00:54,880 --> 03:00:59,440
There's people that believe the same thing in 2016 with the Russian hacking, right?

2238
03:00:59,440 --> 03:01:01,600
There's this... Hold on. Yes.

2239
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:08,880
That is a super not fair comparison. There were definitely the mainstream Democrat opinion

2240
03:01:08,880 --> 03:01:15,360
was that Russian intrusion in terms of social media and stuff happened, but there was never

2241
03:01:15,360 --> 03:01:19,760
a claim that the election was stolen. Or at least I don't know of any mainstream Democrat

2242
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:23,040
that supported that. Donald Trump is not just saying there was interference and blah, blah,

2243
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:28,160
blah, blah. Donald Trump is literally saying the election was literally stolen, that ballot boxes

2244
03:01:28,160 --> 03:01:32,640
were hidden, that vote tallies were manipulated. I think the claim is there's a huge gulf of

2245
03:01:32,640 --> 03:01:36,320
difference in the two. You can attack Donald Trump for that.

2246
03:01:37,440 --> 03:01:43,600
I believe it's not the words of a uniter to attack people that believe that.

2247
03:01:44,960 --> 03:01:49,840
You could argue maybe it's okay, but especially not being super clear about that,

2248
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:55,840
about who you're referring to when you say MAGA Republicans, because MAGA is a hat

2249
03:01:56,560 --> 03:02:04,960
and a slogan that refers to whatever the number is, 70 million people who voted for Donald Trump.

2250
03:02:06,160 --> 03:02:09,360
Of all the Republicans that consider themselves MAGA Republicans, what percentage of them do

2251
03:02:09,360 --> 03:02:15,120
you think believe the election was stolen? I feel like that number is probably more than 70%.

2252
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,600
What's a MAGA Republican? Maybe I'm not familiar...

2253
03:02:19,600 --> 03:02:22,240
Like a Trump supporting Republican, a MAGA Republican. They're there for Trump.

2254
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:27,760
What's the difference between somebody that voted for Trump and a MAGA Republican?

2255
03:02:28,320 --> 03:02:33,680
My mom is a MAGA Republican. If Trump ran independently and DeSantis ran under the

2256
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:37,600
Republican ticket, my mom would vote for Trump. She'll follow him to the end of the earth. That's

2257
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:42,720
like a MAGA Republican. I think it's easy to mistake that distinction in these kinds of

2258
03:02:42,720 --> 03:02:49,120
political speeches. As to me, anybody who voted for Trump can easily in the context of the speech

2259
03:02:49,120 --> 03:02:56,240
be interpreted as a MAGA Republican. I understand what you're saying. Maybe you

2260
03:02:56,240 --> 03:03:00,560
could have been more clear, but I think in listening to that, I think it's pretty obvious who

2261
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:03,680
he's talking about, but I guess if you have an emotional response to it, I can understand

2262
03:03:03,680 --> 03:03:09,360
the emotional response. I don't have an emotional response. I just don't like... I think I'm with

2263
03:03:09,360 --> 03:03:16,800
what is it? Michelle Obama, they go low, we go high. Meaning like, to me, a uniter doesn't

2264
03:03:16,800 --> 03:03:21,120
participate in derision. Sure, a uniter might not, but a leader has to be able to accurately

2265
03:03:21,120 --> 03:03:24,960
assess the situation before him and make people aware of what's going on. You mean all the

2266
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:30,240
impeachment trials, all the censoring from social media, all of that didn't do the job?

2267
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:35,200
That's not his job. I don't know about censoring. That mechanism, his job is to inspire a nation

2268
03:03:35,200 --> 03:03:39,120
to unite a nation. How can he do that when half the people don't believe that he was even legitimately

2269
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:43,200
elected? I think he's done a good job at working on legislation and doing stuff that hopefully

2270
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:47,040
benefits all Americans, but I think it's important to recognize that there is a contingent of

2271
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:50,880
Americans that don't even believe that this is really crazy. There are plenty of people that

2272
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:55,120
recognize that and are fighting that and are constantly screaming that from the rooftops.

2273
03:03:55,120 --> 03:04:02,800
His job is to be the inspiring figure that makes the majority of Americans be proud for him to

2274
03:04:02,800 --> 03:04:10,960
be a president of the nation they love. That's what the uniting aspect is. You remind people

2275
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:14,800
that we are one and we love this country. We love the ideas that it represents.

2276
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:17,360
He does that in other parts of that speech. It's like a 20-minute speech, isn't it?

2277
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:24,640
But that's a fuck-up. You just don't participate in that division. Anyway, I understand. I just

2278
03:04:24,640 --> 03:04:31,920
wanted to push back on the saying one of his strengths is that he's uniting. But yes, that

2279
03:04:33,360 --> 03:04:40,000
is an ideal. That is a goal, is a great one, and he is one that espoused that goal for a long time.

2280
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:44,400
Do you think, what else? From policy perspective and so on.

2281
03:04:44,400 --> 03:04:47,360
I thought the way he's handled Ukraine and everything thus far has been almost perfect.

2282
03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:51,440
I think he did a really good job at the political maneuvering and bringing other

2283
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:55,360
countries into the fold at establishing clearly what our mission was in relation to Ukraine.

2284
03:04:55,360 --> 03:04:59,360
I thought he did a good job there. I admire him for pulling out of Afghanistan. Even it was a

2285
03:04:59,360 --> 03:05:03,120
little bit rough around the edges. We got out and we're gone. No American lives are lost.

2286
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:09,360
The domestic policy, he's passed more major legislation than I think anybody thought possible.

2287
03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:14,480
The green energy stuff with the last bill, the infrastructure bill, a lot of the coronavirus

2288
03:05:14,480 --> 03:05:17,200
relief I thought was really good, especially the expansion of the child tax credit.

2289
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:21,520
So from a policy perspective, foreign and domestic, I think he's been successful.

2290
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:25,200
Rhetorically, I think he's generally been above board in terms of not attacking people,

2291
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:28,720
being too divisive. He's trying to bring people together and work on them.

2292
03:05:28,720 --> 03:05:34,160
What do you think about the popular in the media criticism of his mental decline?

2293
03:05:34,160 --> 03:05:36,080
Do you think he's experiencing mental decline? He's an old guy.

2294
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:42,000
But do you think, I mean, yeah, maybe a little bit, but he's still doing a good job.

2295
03:05:43,200 --> 03:05:45,600
Not from a speech perspective, you mean from a policy perspective?

2296
03:05:45,600 --> 03:05:49,280
Yeah, I'm analyzing it as a job. Yeah, from a speech perspective, maybe not the greatest,

2297
03:05:49,280 --> 03:05:52,320
but yeah, I mean, he's definitely, what is he, like 80, 81? How old is he?

2298
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:59,440
I lose track after so many years. But you did say that he's probably going to run in 2024

2299
03:05:59,440 --> 03:06:03,040
and he's probably going to win. Did I say that? That he's probably going to win? No way did I

2300
03:06:03,360 --> 03:06:07,600
say that? He's probably going to run. Who knows who will win? But I think,

2301
03:06:07,600 --> 03:06:10,320
I feel like the incumbent advantage is so strong. You're really going to throw that away.

2302
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:13,280
Like, I think it's been like one or two times in history in the US, right, where like,

2303
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:15,520
the non-incumbent, the parties put somebody else up.

2304
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:22,320
Yeah, I mean, the concern is like the, just the age and the mental decline, just the

2305
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:28,000
wear and tear of the campaign, all of that kind of stuff, all the speech you have to make,

2306
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,400
the debates and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I guess we'll see what happens.

2307
03:06:31,280 --> 03:06:37,600
What? The least excited, I mean, two years from now is a long time. And his current mental state,

2308
03:06:37,600 --> 03:06:42,400
yeah, he could run and do it. He could do a passable job in two years. Man, I don't know.

2309
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:46,240
I've seen videos of Bill Clinton recently, he's looking pretty rough. You know,

2310
03:06:46,240 --> 03:06:50,480
if Biden is looking a lot more rough, worse for wearing two years, then maybe they actually

2311
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:54,320
do have to dig out another person for running. Who knows?

2312
03:06:54,320 --> 03:07:04,400
What do you think about Trump when he won in 2016, I think is when you came to fruition,

2313
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:10,080
politically speaking. So what do you think his winning the 2016 election represents?

2314
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:17,840
So for me, Trump, the reason why I got into politics was Trump was like this new

2315
03:07:18,800 --> 03:07:25,440
epistemic force in American politics that you'd kind of have to flirt with facts before,

2316
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:30,480
even if you wanted to be nonfactual. He super didn't care. Lying was like a first language to him,

2317
03:07:30,480 --> 03:07:35,920
just like in speaking in terms of the way that he used language to just say to you what he felt

2318
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:40,560
like you needed to hear, to support him and not care at all about what is going on about,

2319
03:07:41,360 --> 03:07:46,400
yeah, that's what Trump represented to me in terms of things that I cared about. He also

2320
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:50,080
represents a lot more, obviously, that there was this undercurrent of American opinion that a lot

2321
03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:54,640
of people didn't know still existed, and it did, he got elected, that the Overton window was

2322
03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:58,800
misidentified by even a large amount of the Republican Party, that populism was a lot more

2323
03:07:58,800 --> 03:08:02,880
popular than a lot of people figured, you know, yeah, there's a lot that I guess he represented.

2324
03:08:02,880 --> 03:08:07,600
Do you think Trump should have been banned from Twitter? Can you make the case foreign against

2325
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:12,880
it? So you're a big supporter of free speech. Yeah, so the case in favor of-

2326
03:08:12,880 --> 03:08:16,720
Do you think he should be brought back as Elon-

2327
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:19,040
Yeah, because if he gets brought back, there's a higher chance that I'll be brought back,

2328
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:22,400
so I'm supporting that all the way. Thank you, Elon. Unban my account.

2329
03:08:23,840 --> 03:08:28,080
So because you called me weak spine, I'm gonna have to message Elon.

2330
03:08:28,080 --> 03:08:30,800
Okay, at Omni Destiny, it was a verified Twitter account.

2331
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:32,640
Omni Destiny. No, no, I'm just kidding.

2332
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:34,480
Why'd you get banned from Twitter, Destiny?

2333
03:08:34,480 --> 03:08:35,120
I don't know.

2334
03:08:35,120 --> 03:08:40,000
I'll add that to Elon. I saw that there was a screenshot of you

2335
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:43,760
referring to the rape of somebody.

2336
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:46,480
Okay, that was on an older Twitter account, and that was a bad tweet.

2337
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:52,240
You have multiple Twitter accounts, so you're trying to go around the bands that you keep getting.

2338
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:55,360
Okay, hold on. You're slandering me a lot right now, okay?

2339
03:08:55,360 --> 03:08:58,880
Let's get the facts straight, okay? And I don't even remember why my first time I got banned,

2340
03:08:58,880 --> 03:09:02,240
but it was a wild account. I tweeted some wildly inappropriate things.

2341
03:09:02,240 --> 03:09:03,120
You regret?

2342
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:04,720
I don't like that word. I'm gonna give the answer to most people.

2343
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:06,640
They're just like, I don't regret it because I learned a lot,

2344
03:09:06,640 --> 03:09:08,160
so I'm glad I had the bad experiences that I did.

2345
03:09:08,160 --> 03:09:09,440
Why don't you like the word regret?

2346
03:09:10,080 --> 03:09:14,720
I think if we look at where we are, how do you feel about determinism?

2347
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:20,880
I believe in hard, the hardest of determinism. That's who I am.

2348
03:09:20,880 --> 03:09:25,360
Okay, so who I am today is the culmination of everything that's occurred in the past.

2349
03:09:25,360 --> 03:09:35,280
I believe you, speaking about regret is a nice way to communicate that in this deterministic

2350
03:09:35,280 --> 03:09:39,680
world, you've analyzed the acts of the past, and you're no longer that person.

2351
03:09:39,760 --> 03:09:40,800
Yeah, of course, for sure.

2352
03:09:40,800 --> 03:09:43,040
That's what regret usually means.

2353
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:45,200
Okay, thanks for giving me the human explanation. Okay, true.

2354
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:47,840
So in that sense, there's a lot of things I've done that I regret.

2355
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:50,080
Oh, you're, what are you? You're not human, you're a bot.

2356
03:09:51,200 --> 03:09:52,320
NPC is my preferred term.

2357
03:09:52,320 --> 03:09:52,960
Okay, all right.

2358
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:58,480
I wish I would have been smart enough at the time to not have to have had made those mistakes.

2359
03:09:58,480 --> 03:09:58,880
Okay.

2360
03:09:58,880 --> 03:09:59,600
There you go.

2361
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:00,640
Good job.

2362
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:03,520
But yeah, obviously really dumb, really crazy off the wall tweets,

2363
03:10:04,240 --> 03:10:08,640
but that account got banned, but then I made another account called,

2364
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:09,920
I can't believe I'm giving you a history-made Twitter account.

2365
03:10:09,920 --> 03:10:11,440
So I made another account called OmniDestiny.

2366
03:10:11,440 --> 03:10:12,400
It's an honor.

2367
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:16,080
And that was my, I got verified, I was cool, they let me have that account

2368
03:10:16,080 --> 03:10:17,920
because originally they banned it and I said appeal and I was like,

2369
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:18,880
oh, let me have one more.

2370
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:21,440
And the back then Twitter was cool and they're like, okay, go for it.

2371
03:10:21,440 --> 03:10:22,960
And that account lasts for a long time.

2372
03:10:22,960 --> 03:10:27,280
And I don't actually know 100% why that account got banned.

2373
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:33,280
I believe that the tweet that showed up in the final, I got banned for hate speech.

2374
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:36,320
And it was because I was, there was a picture that I tweeted

2375
03:10:36,320 --> 03:10:39,360
with three different alt writers that are kind of like neo-Nazi people.

2376
03:10:39,360 --> 03:10:41,840
And they were all like mixed race people.

2377
03:10:41,840 --> 03:10:44,960
And I said, like the new alt right looks like a Disney channel original movie

2378
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:46,480
in terms of racial composition.

2379
03:10:46,480 --> 03:10:51,280
And somehow they got flagged for instigating violence against minorities, I think.

2380
03:10:51,280 --> 03:10:53,120
And I think that's the tweet that got me banned

2381
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:54,720
because I think that's what showed up in the final report.

2382
03:10:54,720 --> 03:10:56,320
But I don't know, maybe there were other reasons

2383
03:10:56,320 --> 03:10:59,280
because nobody ever communicates, but ever since that account went under,

2384
03:10:59,280 --> 03:11:00,720
it's just been ban evading ever since.

2385
03:11:00,720 --> 03:11:00,960
So.

2386
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Oh, ban evading ever since.

2387
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:05,520
So all my new accounts that have been banned just get banned

2388
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:07,360
because they finally figured out it's me and then they ban evade.

2389
03:11:07,360 --> 03:11:12,080
There's like one dude at Twitter HQ who's like constantly looking for my new accounts

2390
03:11:12,080 --> 03:11:12,640
and they get me.

2391
03:11:12,640 --> 03:11:13,120
Yeah.

2392
03:11:13,120 --> 03:11:13,360
Yeah.

2393
03:11:14,240 --> 03:11:14,800
Anyway, yeah.

2394
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:18,080
So post Trump world.

2395
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:20,480
Do you think, okay, I mean this.

2396
03:11:20,480 --> 03:11:21,280
Oh, should he be banned?

2397
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:22,720
Oh, you asked me to make both cases.

2398
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,120
Should he be banned?

2399
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:26,800
I mean, damn, dude, when you're tweeting out shit

2400
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:30,640
that's arguably leading stuff like January 6th, I can understand why.

2401
03:11:30,640 --> 03:11:32,640
Because it's like, what else is this wild dude going to tweet out?

2402
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:34,640
Like, is he going to start instigating other violent events?

2403
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:36,000
So I'm sympathetic towards the like, okay.

2404
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,240
Well, he can't just be here saying stuff like this.

2405
03:11:38,240 --> 03:11:38,960
That's insane.

2406
03:11:38,960 --> 03:11:40,000
We're going to ban him.

2407
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:40,560
I'm sympathetic.

2408
03:11:40,560 --> 03:11:41,840
Because it's instigating.

2409
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:42,800
Yeah, you're instigating.

2410
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:45,440
Physical violence in the physical world.

2411
03:11:45,440 --> 03:11:45,600
Yeah.

2412
03:11:45,600 --> 03:11:48,000
Like if I would tweet stuff like that, I would get banned probably.

2413
03:11:48,560 --> 03:11:51,280
On the flip side, this is the president of the United States.

2414
03:11:51,280 --> 03:11:55,040
It seems like he's like doing presidential decree by social media sometimes.

2415
03:11:55,040 --> 03:11:58,640
Like is it really right that one public or private, I should say,

2416
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:03,520
one private company can like erase the president of the United States words from

2417
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:06,000
the eyes of a lot of Americans that are using these social media feeds.

2418
03:12:06,880 --> 03:12:12,000
And one big one, which I for sure am against, is the permanent ban.

2419
03:12:12,560 --> 03:12:13,440
Yeah, I don't like that.

2420
03:12:13,440 --> 03:12:13,920
I hate that.

2421
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:17,440
Even in my community, if somebody comes back over like a year, like, I mean-

2422
03:12:17,440 --> 03:12:19,840
Did you just compare yourself to the president of the United States?

2423
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:22,000
No, I compare myself to Twitter banning the president of the United States.

2424
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:22,560
Let me put it this way.

2425
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:25,120
If I ban Donald Trump in my chat room, I don't ban him in a year.

2426
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:26,720
A year?

2427
03:12:26,720 --> 03:12:27,200
Yeah.

2428
03:12:27,200 --> 03:12:29,680
What's the process for unbanning Donald Trump?

2429
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:30,880
What would he have to do?

2430
03:12:30,880 --> 03:12:32,320
Usually people send me an email and they're like,

2431
03:12:32,320 --> 03:12:33,360
listen, I did this stuff.

2432
03:12:33,360 --> 03:12:34,400
I'm sorry, I was dumb.

2433
03:12:34,400 --> 03:12:35,520
I'll give them another chance.

2434
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:37,920
But a year, what if they send an email a month later?

2435
03:12:38,480 --> 03:12:39,600
Usually I'll unban him.

2436
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:40,320
That's usually my problem.

2437
03:12:40,320 --> 03:12:42,160
I ban pretty quickly in my community, but if you ever ask-

2438
03:12:42,160 --> 03:12:43,360
You're big, softy.

2439
03:12:43,360 --> 03:12:44,400
Yeah, I usually let him back.

2440
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:44,960
I'm very-

2441
03:12:44,960 --> 03:12:47,920
Well, because I used to be the worst type of internet person,

2442
03:12:47,920 --> 03:12:50,080
and I think I'm a little bit better than I used to be.

2443
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:50,320
So-

2444
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:51,280
Now that you're older.

2445
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:52,640
Yeah, now that I've matured.

2446
03:12:52,640 --> 03:12:53,600
Yeah, of course.

2447
03:12:53,600 --> 03:12:56,640
Age bestows a wisdom that just can't be gotten any other way.

2448
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:57,760
What's your sense in general?

2449
03:12:57,760 --> 03:13:01,120
Is there something interesting you could say about your view on free speech?

2450
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:04,240
It seems like one of those terms, it's also overused

2451
03:13:04,240 --> 03:13:05,600
to mean a lot of different things.

2452
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:06,800
What does it mean to you?

2453
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:09,920
If you have a democratic style of governance,

2454
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:13,440
you are entrusting people with one of the most awesome

2455
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:15,120
and radical of responsibilities.

2456
03:13:15,120 --> 03:13:17,120
And that's saying that you're going to pick the people

2457
03:13:17,120 --> 03:13:18,720
that are going to make some of the hardest decisions

2458
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:19,920
in all of human history.

2459
03:13:19,920 --> 03:13:22,720
If you're going to trust people to vote correctly,

2460
03:13:22,720 --> 03:13:23,920
you have to be able to trust them,

2461
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:25,760
have open and honest dialogue with each other.

2462
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:28,800
Whether that's Nazis or KKK people or whoever talking,

2463
03:13:29,520 --> 03:13:32,880
you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above

2464
03:13:32,880 --> 03:13:34,320
and make the correct determinations

2465
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:36,080
when they hear these types of speeches.

2466
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:38,720
And if you're so worried that somebody's going to hear

2467
03:13:38,720 --> 03:13:39,840
a certain political figure

2468
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:41,920
and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly,

2469
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:44,800
then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans

2470
03:13:44,800 --> 03:13:46,720
for democracy to be a viable institution,

2471
03:13:46,720 --> 03:13:47,680
which is fine.

2472
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:49,040
You can be anti-democratic,

2473
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:52,080
but I don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech.

2474
03:13:52,640 --> 03:13:53,200
Within reason.

2475
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:55,360
So what's the within reason?

2476
03:13:55,360 --> 03:13:55,600
So-

2477
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:57,920
I mean, you can't post like Child porn or something on Twitter

2478
03:13:58,160 --> 03:13:59,360
where people try to get you on that stuff

2479
03:13:59,360 --> 03:14:01,360
or like direct calls to violence or probably not.

2480
03:14:01,360 --> 03:14:02,080
You shouldn't be tweeting out like,

2481
03:14:02,080 --> 03:14:03,840
we're going to meet up tomorrow and go bomb, blah, blah, blah.

2482
03:14:03,840 --> 03:14:04,160
Probably not.

2483
03:14:04,160 --> 03:14:09,280
So do you think it's okay to allow racism and anti-Semitism and hate speech?

2484
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:14,640
Hate speech, yes, because that can be very broadly defined.

2485
03:14:15,200 --> 03:14:20,160
I can understand there being some basic rules of like no slurs on like a platform

2486
03:14:20,160 --> 03:14:22,480
that gets into like acceptable forms of moderation

2487
03:14:22,480 --> 03:14:25,040
or like excessive harassment and bullying, I can understand.

2488
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:29,760
But past that, when the moderation becomes ideological,

2489
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:32,400
I get a little bit nervous because, you know, for,

2490
03:14:32,400 --> 03:14:33,520
there's a whole other-

2491
03:14:33,520 --> 03:14:36,000
Yeah, there's, of course, it's all a gray area,

2492
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:40,240
but when it feels like ideology has seeped into the censorship.

2493
03:14:40,240 --> 03:14:40,800
Not good.

2494
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:41,440
Yeah.

2495
03:14:41,440 --> 03:14:43,760
Which it's so fascinating to think,

2496
03:14:43,760 --> 03:14:45,520
especially now that Elon bought Twitter,

2497
03:14:45,520 --> 03:14:52,080
how do you engineer a system that prevents ideology from seeping in

2498
03:14:52,080 --> 03:14:57,280
and nevertheless is able to create a platform that has healthy conversations?

2499
03:14:57,280 --> 03:15:00,400
Because if you have one guy who's just screaming nonsense, nonstop,

2500
03:15:01,440 --> 03:15:05,760
it has this effect where the quiet voices at the back of the room are silenced.

2501
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:06,400
Yeah.

2502
03:15:06,400 --> 03:15:08,880
So like that's what you usually don't talk about.

2503
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:12,080
Like if you let one annoying loud person in,

2504
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:14,240
that's actually censoring the voice of a lot of people

2505
03:15:14,240 --> 03:15:16,240
that would like to speak, but they don't get a chance.

2506
03:15:16,240 --> 03:15:18,800
That's one of the things, especially around like trans discourse,

2507
03:15:18,800 --> 03:15:21,760
I have to constantly do that like reminder for my audiences.

2508
03:15:21,760 --> 03:15:24,080
So like when I'm dealing with these types of people on the internet,

2509
03:15:24,080 --> 03:15:25,360
a lot of them might seem really crazy.

2510
03:15:25,360 --> 03:15:26,880
A lot of these types of people might seem insane,

2511
03:15:26,880 --> 03:15:30,240
but like in the real world, outside of like the crazy Twitter activist world,

2512
03:15:30,240 --> 03:15:33,440
like the vast majority of people you're meeting from LGBT communities

2513
03:15:33,440 --> 03:15:35,120
are like the coolest, normalist people.

2514
03:15:35,120 --> 03:15:37,520
All they want us to like write to live their life in the way they want to

2515
03:15:37,520 --> 03:15:39,840
and to be like unobstructed and like, yeah.

2516
03:15:39,840 --> 03:15:42,560
But people will get this impression of like an online activist,

2517
03:15:42,560 --> 03:15:45,120
like a vegan or LGBT person or whatever.

2518
03:15:45,120 --> 03:15:47,440
And then they think that every single person in real life is like that.

2519
03:15:47,520 --> 03:15:49,840
And it's a really negative stereotype.

2520
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:51,600
And then even the other people in that group.

2521
03:15:52,160 --> 03:15:53,520
Oh, is Malina coming over?

2522
03:15:53,520 --> 03:15:54,720
Oh yeah, actually, I don't know if that's her.

2523
03:15:55,280 --> 03:15:57,280
Okay, Malina just joined us.

2524
03:15:57,280 --> 03:15:58,640
What were we talking about?

2525
03:15:58,640 --> 03:15:59,600
Was it interesting?

2526
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:03,920
You were saying that you were going to talk to Elon about getting at Omni Destiny,

2527
03:16:03,920 --> 03:16:05,200
the verified Twitter account on band.

2528
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:06,720
I said, that sounds like a lot.

2529
03:16:06,720 --> 03:16:07,680
That's so gracious of you.

2530
03:16:07,680 --> 03:16:09,520
I can't even believe you would do that for me.

2531
03:16:09,520 --> 03:16:12,960
And then you admitted that you tried to evade the band multiple times,

2532
03:16:12,960 --> 03:16:15,200
which I'm sure would be very looked upon.

2533
03:16:15,200 --> 03:16:17,360
You know, I heard that in Norway, in their prison system,

2534
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:19,200
they don't actually punish you for trying to escape jail

2535
03:16:19,200 --> 03:16:20,800
because that's like the natural human thing to do.

2536
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:21,440
Hug you?

2537
03:16:21,440 --> 03:16:21,840
What are they doing?

2538
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:23,200
I don't know, but they don't punish you.

2539
03:16:23,200 --> 03:16:24,400
Because of course you're trying to be free.

2540
03:16:24,400 --> 03:16:25,520
That's all I'm trying to be on Twitter.

2541
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:26,320
I'm just trying to be free.

2542
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:27,600
Oh, that's the natural humanistic.

2543
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:30,000
Yeah, that's the natural human course, is to ban even.

2544
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:31,200
You're not a destructive force.

2545
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:32,960
No, I'm a force, I'm a force for good.

2546
03:16:32,960 --> 03:16:34,720
That's why all my accounts only get banned for banning and banning.

2547
03:16:34,720 --> 03:16:36,240
I don't get banned for doing bad things.

2548
03:16:36,240 --> 03:16:37,360
And I'm a progressive shill.

2549
03:16:37,360 --> 03:16:38,640
I'm like far left.

2550
03:16:38,640 --> 03:16:40,720
I love like progressive causes.

2551
03:16:40,800 --> 03:16:42,720
This is what you criticize us on for being.

2552
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:45,520
I show them from a place of first principles,

2553
03:16:45,520 --> 03:16:48,480
not from a mindless AI echoing kind of thing, you know.

2554
03:16:48,480 --> 03:16:50,720
Okay, so you're a free thinking bot.

2555
03:16:50,720 --> 03:16:51,840
Yeah, exactly.

2556
03:16:51,840 --> 03:16:52,800
All right, cool.

2557
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:54,400
Well, I'm sure we'll return to some politics.

2558
03:16:54,400 --> 03:16:55,120
That was beautiful.

2559
03:16:56,480 --> 03:16:59,120
William, can you tell us about yourself?

2560
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:00,720
You're also a fellow streamer.

2561
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:03,920
Yes, I stream and I started streaming because I am at him,

2562
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:06,640
basically, kind of, but I don't do the politics.

2563
03:17:06,640 --> 03:17:09,280
I do like travels or talk about relationships,

2564
03:17:09,840 --> 03:17:11,760
talk to my audience, basically.

2565
03:17:12,320 --> 03:17:14,240
You're from that part of the world, right, Sweden?

2566
03:17:14,240 --> 03:17:14,640
Yeah, exactly.

2567
03:17:14,640 --> 03:17:16,960
So did you escape from prison and they didn't?

2568
03:17:16,960 --> 03:17:18,000
That was Norway.

2569
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:19,040
You just mentioned Norway.

2570
03:17:19,040 --> 03:17:19,520
That's different.

2571
03:17:20,240 --> 03:17:22,720
I actually really, I've been to Sweden a bunch of times.

2572
03:17:22,720 --> 03:17:23,520
I love it.

2573
03:17:23,520 --> 03:17:26,640
There's a tech sector there that's really like flourishing.

2574
03:17:26,640 --> 03:17:27,520
Where did you go?

2575
03:17:27,520 --> 03:17:28,080
Which city?

2576
03:17:28,080 --> 03:17:29,280
I went to Stockholm.

2577
03:17:29,280 --> 03:17:30,720
I think I gave a few lectures there.

2578
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:34,000
There's a vibrant tech sector in school and people are super nice.

2579
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:36,560
Yeah, we're friendly.

2580
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:37,840
We're not like very deep.

2581
03:17:37,920 --> 03:17:39,600
Like we don't really have much deep conversation.

2582
03:17:39,600 --> 03:17:40,640
It's like a meta conversation.

2583
03:17:40,640 --> 03:17:43,360
Oh, there's not many intellectuals that come from Sweden.

2584
03:17:43,360 --> 03:17:44,960
We don't really speak very highly of ourselves.

2585
03:17:44,960 --> 03:17:46,800
We're kind of like just chill all the time.

2586
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:47,760
We don't make a scene.

2587
03:17:47,760 --> 03:17:50,400
We don't, we're just like talking, you know.

2588
03:17:50,400 --> 03:17:51,440
Do you know what the name for that is?

2589
03:17:51,440 --> 03:17:52,800
There's a specific name for it.

2590
03:17:52,800 --> 03:17:53,680
Jantelagen.

2591
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:55,680
Yeah, Jantelagen, yeah.

2592
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:57,200
Oh, there's a philosophy behind it.

2593
03:17:57,200 --> 03:17:58,800
When you're part of like Sweden or Norway,

2594
03:17:58,800 --> 03:18:00,560
you don't talk too highly of yourself

2595
03:18:00,560 --> 03:18:01,840
because it's seen as kind of like rude.

2596
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:04,160
Like think of like America as the exact opposite.

2597
03:18:04,160 --> 03:18:05,040
You'd even really want to like,

2598
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:06,960
you don't want to make yourself into a victim too much.

2599
03:18:06,960 --> 03:18:08,320
You don't want to be too much of anything.

2600
03:18:08,320 --> 03:18:10,400
You're just like sticking to the, to the group

2601
03:18:10,400 --> 03:18:12,160
to make big scene about yourself.

2602
03:18:12,880 --> 03:18:16,080
But that said, you came here and you were,

2603
03:18:16,080 --> 03:18:18,560
you put yourself in front of a camera and became a streamer.

2604
03:18:18,560 --> 03:18:20,960
Do you understand how weird that is for my friends in Sweden?

2605
03:18:21,840 --> 03:18:22,000
Do you have anxiety?

2606
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:23,760
I just didn't talk about myself

2607
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:26,480
and just like make a big deal about myself for hours every day.

2608
03:18:26,480 --> 03:18:27,440
Was that like terrifying?

2609
03:18:27,440 --> 03:18:28,720
Did you have anxiety about that?

2610
03:18:28,720 --> 03:18:29,920
No, because I don't see them.

2611
03:18:29,920 --> 03:18:31,360
But then I come back and I'm like, ooh.

2612
03:18:32,560 --> 03:18:34,640
Also, what do you feel like when you're actually streaming?

2613
03:18:34,640 --> 03:18:36,240
You feel like you're just alone in a room?

2614
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:38,000
One-on-one type thing?

2615
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:39,920
No, I see, I see Chad and I'm thinking,

2616
03:18:39,920 --> 03:18:40,960
oh, they're like a little fairies.

2617
03:18:40,960 --> 03:18:41,680
They're not really real.

2618
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:42,640
They're just like out there.

2619
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:43,600
I don't know what they look like.

2620
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:46,400
I just see little names and they're just cute and just some colors.

2621
03:18:46,400 --> 03:18:48,640
So you're talking to little fairies inside your head?

2622
03:18:48,640 --> 03:18:49,280
Yes, I do.

2623
03:18:49,280 --> 03:18:50,560
Is that how you feel about Chad?

2624
03:18:50,560 --> 03:18:51,520
They're demons for me.

2625
03:18:51,520 --> 03:18:52,160
They're demons?

2626
03:18:52,160 --> 03:18:53,360
Okay, my kind of fairies.

2627
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,320
Are they, so is Chad a source of stress or happiness?

2628
03:18:56,320 --> 03:18:57,040
Like is there a...

2629
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:58,800
No, for me, that's a source of happiness.

2630
03:18:58,800 --> 03:19:00,960
I've been very intentional with like the construction

2631
03:19:00,960 --> 03:19:01,600
of my community.

2632
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:02,720
So I'm really happy with where it's at.

2633
03:19:03,280 --> 03:19:05,920
How are you able to actually have deep political discourse

2634
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:07,520
while playing a video game at the same time?

2635
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:10,720
I have a really good chat room in terms of like the way

2636
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:12,080
that people engage in conversations.

2637
03:19:12,080 --> 03:19:16,000
Like I was one of the earliest people to embrace the philosophy

2638
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:19,520
of like I am in total control of what people watch me think,

2639
03:19:19,520 --> 03:19:22,080
that like I have a high level of responsibility

2640
03:19:22,080 --> 03:19:23,520
for how they conduct themselves.

2641
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:25,040
And that if I conduct myself in a certain way,

2642
03:19:25,040 --> 03:19:26,720
I can expect a certain level of conduct from them.

2643
03:19:26,720 --> 03:19:28,160
And for the most part, it's like worked pretty well

2644
03:19:28,160 --> 03:19:30,320
for the past, you know, nine or 10 years, yeah.

2645
03:19:30,880 --> 03:19:32,640
What about the actual playing of the game?

2646
03:19:32,640 --> 03:19:35,520
Like you're able to parallelize the brain like...

2647
03:19:36,160 --> 03:19:39,040
Like it seems like Factory seems like a super complex game.

2648
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:40,400
Yeah, I don't actually think that's possible.

2649
03:19:40,400 --> 03:19:42,240
I don't think multitasking for human brain is possible.

2650
03:19:43,120 --> 03:19:44,560
If you see me playing a game,

2651
03:19:44,560 --> 03:19:46,880
usually what's happening is the conversation is like,

2652
03:19:46,880 --> 03:19:48,720
I've had it a million times, so I'm not thinking about it.

2653
03:19:48,720 --> 03:19:49,760
I've automated that.

2654
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:51,520
Or if the conversation is very challenging,

2655
03:19:52,160 --> 03:19:54,160
then if you watch me, if you really watch what's happening again,

2656
03:19:54,160 --> 03:19:55,200
I'm probably just running around in circles

2657
03:19:55,200 --> 03:19:56,720
because I have to think about the conversation.

2658
03:19:56,720 --> 03:19:57,200
Okay.

2659
03:19:57,200 --> 03:19:59,680
Because with Factory, it looks like a lot of stuff is going on.

2660
03:19:59,680 --> 03:20:00,480
Sometimes, yeah.

2661
03:20:00,480 --> 03:20:03,840
So I guess it's hard for a person who hasn't played the game

2662
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:04,800
to detect that you're not actually...

2663
03:20:04,800 --> 03:20:07,360
Is that come off as like you're super intelligent in multitasking?

2664
03:20:07,360 --> 03:20:10,160
Or does it come off as like he's not interested in this conversation at all?

2665
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:12,480
Yeah, there's a coolness to it.

2666
03:20:12,480 --> 03:20:13,840
Like when you're not paying attention,

2667
03:20:15,840 --> 03:20:18,080
if you're looking elsewhere, like you're checking your phone,

2668
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:19,440
you're too cool for this conversation.

2669
03:20:19,440 --> 03:20:20,240
There's a sense like that.

2670
03:20:20,240 --> 03:20:20,560
Yeah.

2671
03:20:20,560 --> 03:20:22,160
The reality is though is if you watch,

2672
03:20:22,160 --> 03:20:23,600
it was easier to see in Minecraft

2673
03:20:23,600 --> 03:20:25,520
because in Minecraft, when there was a challenging conversation,

2674
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:26,240
if you watch me play,

2675
03:20:26,240 --> 03:20:28,080
I'm literally just running around and jumping in circles

2676
03:20:28,080 --> 03:20:29,920
because I have to think about the conversation 100%.

2677
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:32,640
I can't do a complicated task and think about the conversation.

2678
03:20:32,640 --> 03:20:34,320
Or like the people will always joke in my chat,

2679
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:35,840
like, oh no, the notepad came out.

2680
03:20:35,840 --> 03:20:37,360
If it's a really challenging conversation,

2681
03:20:37,360 --> 03:20:39,120
I'll get rid of the game and I'll bring out a notepad

2682
03:20:39,120 --> 03:20:41,200
and I'll start writing stuff down to keep track of what's going on.

2683
03:20:42,080 --> 03:20:43,920
So what kind of stuff do you stream?

2684
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:44,880
So advice?

2685
03:20:44,880 --> 03:20:45,440
You talk about...

2686
03:20:45,440 --> 03:20:48,800
Yeah, like either I talk to chatter, I travel around, basically.

2687
03:20:48,800 --> 03:20:52,800
Like have a conversation or we like go to countries.

2688
03:20:52,800 --> 03:20:53,920
I've been to like Italy.

2689
03:20:53,920 --> 03:20:56,320
I was in Italy for like one and a half months,

2690
03:20:56,320 --> 03:20:59,360
just like traveling around the loan, going to cities,

2691
03:20:59,360 --> 03:21:02,960
like having like my camera with me and like streaming for hours.

2692
03:21:03,680 --> 03:21:05,520
Where's the coolest place you've been to?

2693
03:21:06,080 --> 03:21:06,800
Ever.

2694
03:21:06,800 --> 03:21:08,000
It's probably New Zealand.

2695
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:08,560
New Zealand?

2696
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:09,760
I think so.

2697
03:21:09,760 --> 03:21:11,440
After it is probably going to be Italy, I think.

2698
03:21:11,440 --> 03:21:13,200
Because I like history and...

2699
03:21:13,200 --> 03:21:15,600
Also both history because New Zealand is also beautiful.

2700
03:21:16,560 --> 03:21:19,760
So it's both natural beauty and historical beauty.

2701
03:21:19,760 --> 03:21:20,960
Yeah, for sure.

2702
03:21:20,960 --> 03:21:23,680
I think it's just really like the Polynesian sort of culture.

2703
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:24,960
I think it's very interesting.

2704
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:27,600
Like the ocean people and it's just really beautiful.

2705
03:21:27,600 --> 03:21:28,800
People are very relaxed, chill.

2706
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:31,680
They're very far away, which is interesting as well.

2707
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:36,560
Because whenever they talk about politics or they talk about the world,

2708
03:21:36,560 --> 03:21:37,600
it feels really far away.

2709
03:21:38,400 --> 03:21:39,520
So where's home for you?

2710
03:21:39,520 --> 03:21:40,400
Is Austin home?

2711
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:42,000
Did you...

2712
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:42,720
Home for me.

2713
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:44,960
A human being is home.

2714
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:45,360
Yeah.

2715
03:21:45,360 --> 03:21:47,680
We travel, we've lived in a lot of places and traveled around.

2716
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:50,000
So that's what you think of home is like humans.

2717
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:51,360
I think so, yeah.

2718
03:21:51,920 --> 03:21:53,680
I mean, if they're going to be a place,

2719
03:21:53,680 --> 03:21:56,560
it's probably going to be like my childhood places probably.

2720
03:21:57,440 --> 03:21:59,440
Like my old country house or something like that.

2721
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:00,320
We don't have it anymore.

2722
03:22:00,320 --> 03:22:03,120
But that's like home for me, I guess.

2723
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:04,240
So how'd you guys meet each other?

2724
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:06,480
You're currently married.

2725
03:22:06,480 --> 03:22:07,360
Yes.

2726
03:22:07,360 --> 03:22:08,240
To each other, yeah.

2727
03:22:08,240 --> 03:22:09,040
Yeah.

2728
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:09,600
To each other.

2729
03:22:13,600 --> 03:22:14,480
All right, cool.

2730
03:22:14,480 --> 03:22:15,120
How'd you guys meet?

2731
03:22:15,760 --> 03:22:19,760
I was watching his YouTube stuff like 2018, I think.

2732
03:22:19,760 --> 03:22:21,840
Like because it was the Swedish election around that time

2733
03:22:21,840 --> 03:22:23,040
and I was interested in politics.

2734
03:22:23,680 --> 03:22:28,800
And then I think he said in one of his videos that he had an Instagram

2735
03:22:28,800 --> 03:22:31,280
and that he needed people to stop DMing him.

2736
03:22:31,280 --> 03:22:32,560
That wasn't cutie pies.

2737
03:22:32,560 --> 03:22:35,200
And then I messaged him and said, am I a cutie pie?

2738
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:36,720
And then you're pie in like two minutes.

2739
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:40,400
And then that's when I was in New Zealand.

2740
03:22:41,280 --> 03:22:45,440
And I guess you wanted to escape America or like LA for a little bit.

2741
03:22:46,080 --> 03:22:48,160
And that included New Zealand.

2742
03:22:48,160 --> 03:22:49,520
What were you mentally there?

2743
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:52,480
Because we've talked to his timeline.

2744
03:22:52,480 --> 03:22:54,000
Where's 2018?

2745
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:55,120
Was it 18, 19?

2746
03:22:55,760 --> 03:22:56,720
Where was the low point?

2747
03:22:57,360 --> 03:22:58,480
Or is that as that was way earlier?

2748
03:22:58,480 --> 03:22:59,280
Low point, carbiclaning.

2749
03:22:59,280 --> 03:23:01,920
That was like 2009, 2010.

2750
03:23:01,920 --> 03:23:02,400
Oh, okay.

2751
03:23:02,400 --> 03:23:03,840
2018 was probably your peak.

2752
03:23:05,200 --> 03:23:06,400
Every day, now was my peak.

2753
03:23:06,400 --> 03:23:06,960
What do you mean?

2754
03:23:06,960 --> 03:23:07,680
That was my peak.

2755
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:08,480
Why would you say that?

2756
03:23:08,480 --> 03:23:11,760
No, nobody ever had missed being past their prime.

2757
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:12,400
Just see.

2758
03:23:12,960 --> 03:23:14,880
Well, I mean, my prime is still coming out.

2759
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:17,120
It was probably around the time where you were getting a lot

2760
03:23:17,120 --> 03:23:19,920
of lefties to your community and you were really like thinking

2761
03:23:19,920 --> 03:23:21,280
about that they would go too far.

2762
03:23:21,280 --> 03:23:21,600
Maybe.

2763
03:23:21,600 --> 03:23:23,760
That was, I think that was still when Hasan and Vash were both

2764
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:24,400
in my community.

2765
03:23:24,400 --> 03:23:24,880
Exactly.

2766
03:23:24,880 --> 03:23:28,160
So I would say it feels like there was not really like much issues

2767
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:31,520
when it come to your stuff or like your work stuff back then.

2768
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:33,840
Oh, something we didn't talk about is that like there were no

2769
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:34,720
politics on Twitch.

2770
03:23:34,720 --> 03:23:37,440
I exclusively inhabited that place for like two years

2771
03:23:37,440 --> 03:23:39,120
because nobody else did it because it was a really toxic

2772
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:40,000
environment for politics.

2773
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:43,360
So for a couple of years as it grew, I kind of grew the whole

2774
03:23:43,360 --> 03:23:44,080
space because it wasn't.

2775
03:23:44,080 --> 03:23:44,800
Nobody was doing that yet.

2776
03:23:44,800 --> 03:23:45,680
What did that look like?

2777
03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:49,680
You're having like political debates, political discourse.

2778
03:23:49,680 --> 03:23:52,240
Yeah, mainly like going into YouTube people to try to argue

2779
03:23:52,240 --> 03:23:54,720
with them or just doing politics on stream like reading stories,

2780
03:23:54,720 --> 03:23:56,320
researching stuff, talking about stuff.

2781
03:23:56,320 --> 03:23:58,800
But there's not like other people on Twitch to debate about politics

2782
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:00,000
because there was no politics.

2783
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:00,800
It was, yeah.

2784
03:24:00,800 --> 03:24:04,560
Was there a debate in the space of communism, socialism,

2785
03:24:04,560 --> 03:24:07,280
social democrats, kind of like this?

2786
03:24:07,280 --> 03:24:09,760
Are you trying to outline your own position during that time?

2787
03:24:09,760 --> 03:24:11,840
I think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives

2788
03:24:11,840 --> 03:24:13,120
because it was like Trump stuff.

2789
03:24:13,120 --> 03:24:15,120
And then it was coming off the back of like there was this

2790
03:24:15,120 --> 03:24:18,160
movement called Gamergate and there was all this anti-SJW stuff

2791
03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:18,640
on the internet.

2792
03:24:18,640 --> 03:24:21,680
And I was like the SJW, like the progressive that was fighting

2793
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:22,800
on the progressive side of things.

2794
03:24:22,800 --> 03:24:23,920
So I think that's what I was known for.

2795
03:24:23,920 --> 03:24:25,440
But I was fighting with people off of Twitch

2796
03:24:25,440 --> 03:24:28,160
because on Twitch there weren't very many political discussions happening.

2797
03:24:28,160 --> 03:24:34,240
So you were holding the SJW flag to what degree do you still hold it?

2798
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:34,960
Like what's the best?

2799
03:24:34,960 --> 03:24:37,040
What's the steelman case for SJW?

2800
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:40,560
I mean like I'm still very much that SJW from 2018-2019

2801
03:24:40,560 --> 03:24:43,200
but the positions have moved so much farther left that

2802
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:44,960
I don't know, some people might not call me that anymore.

2803
03:24:44,960 --> 03:24:45,520
I'm not sure.

2804
03:24:45,520 --> 03:24:46,560
It depends on who I'm talking to.

2805
03:24:46,560 --> 03:24:48,640
Because basically what is social justice?

2806
03:24:48,640 --> 03:24:51,760
Were you like being sensitive to the experience of others?

2807
03:24:51,760 --> 03:24:54,080
Yeah, being sensitive and empathetic towards the experience of others

2808
03:24:54,080 --> 03:24:56,560
and then trying to build a better world that like suits as many different types

2809
03:24:56,560 --> 03:24:59,760
of people as possible while being like aware of like their names.

2810
03:24:59,760 --> 03:25:00,000
Okay.

2811
03:25:01,440 --> 03:25:04,080
So you guys met, what's from your perspective?

2812
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:06,320
Is the, did she, she, she telling lies?

2813
03:25:06,320 --> 03:25:07,200
Is it accurate?

2814
03:25:07,200 --> 03:25:08,000
No, it's pretty accurate.

2815
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:08,800
It's pretty accurate.

2816
03:25:08,800 --> 03:25:09,120
Okay.

2817
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:10,240
When did you guys actually meet?

2818
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:13,680
I flew out in 2019.

2819
03:25:13,680 --> 03:25:15,280
19 in like in February.

2820
03:25:15,280 --> 03:25:15,760
Yeah.

2821
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:17,600
Basically there was like weird stuff happening in LA.

2822
03:25:17,600 --> 03:25:20,880
I just come off of kind of a weird not kind of sort of relationship

2823
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:23,040
and I just wanted to like go away for a while.

2824
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:25,680
Another company reached out to me and they had like a fun streaming device

2825
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:27,280
and they said they'd sponsor a trip if I went somewhere.

2826
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:28,480
And I was like, oh, well, I know this person.

2827
03:25:28,480 --> 03:25:29,920
I know a couple of people in New Zealand.

2828
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:30,720
And Malina was one of them.

2829
03:25:30,720 --> 03:25:31,600
It's like, I'll go to New Zealand.

2830
03:25:31,600 --> 03:25:32,000
New Zealand.

2831
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:32,880
It'll be fun.

2832
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:34,480
And yeah, I did that for two weeks.

2833
03:25:34,480 --> 03:25:35,920
Do you guys believe in love?

2834
03:25:38,320 --> 03:25:41,280
I feel like you lack the gotcha got us into this.

2835
03:25:41,280 --> 03:25:43,920
I'm not sure to the degree to which you have human emotions.

2836
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:44,640
I have quite a few.

2837
03:25:46,240 --> 03:25:49,360
From your perspective, when did you, when did you fall in love with Malina?

2838
03:25:49,360 --> 03:25:50,480
When you fall in love with Malima.

2839
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:52,240
Malima.

2840
03:25:52,240 --> 03:25:53,360
The minute I saw her.

2841
03:25:54,800 --> 03:25:55,200
I don't know.

2842
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:57,840
We, our first two weeks together were a lot of fun.

2843
03:25:57,840 --> 03:25:59,040
We had a lot of chemistry in person.

2844
03:26:00,320 --> 03:26:02,400
I was kind of shocked that I wasn't thinking about it

2845
03:26:02,400 --> 03:26:04,960
because it was like, we spent like a week together and you said,

2846
03:26:04,960 --> 03:26:06,160
I really want to tell you something.

2847
03:26:06,160 --> 03:26:09,040
And you were like, you were like stalling that for the longest time.

2848
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:12,240
I think she was, oh, he said that like, I love you.

2849
03:26:12,240 --> 03:26:14,240
No, he basically just said like,

2850
03:26:14,240 --> 03:26:15,920
I really like you and it never really happens.

2851
03:26:15,920 --> 03:26:16,720
That's what he said.

2852
03:26:16,720 --> 03:26:19,520
And I was like, oh, and I thought, hey, I thought.

2853
03:26:21,280 --> 03:26:22,400
So let's still run.

2854
03:26:22,400 --> 03:26:23,680
We said Trump getting banned from Twitter.

2855
03:26:23,680 --> 03:26:24,720
Is that what we were talking about before?

2856
03:26:25,680 --> 03:26:26,240
Oh yeah.

2857
03:26:26,240 --> 03:26:27,920
Hey, you agreed to me coming on here.

2858
03:26:27,920 --> 03:26:29,600
Of course I'm going to be doing those to you.

2859
03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:31,120
How long, so how long did that take?

2860
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:31,920
Two weeks, you said?

2861
03:26:31,920 --> 03:26:32,960
That took like a week.

2862
03:26:32,960 --> 03:26:33,520
No, I don't know.

2863
03:26:33,520 --> 03:26:34,560
I think it was just like.

2864
03:26:34,560 --> 03:26:37,120
Thing is, my mind process is like information so quickly.

2865
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:39,520
Two weeks to somebody like you is actually like years for me.

2866
03:26:39,520 --> 03:26:40,160
So.

2867
03:26:40,160 --> 03:26:41,200
Oh, like me.

2868
03:26:41,200 --> 03:26:41,360
Yeah.

2869
03:26:42,240 --> 03:26:45,120
There was like a lot of like factorial type of strategic thinking.

2870
03:26:45,120 --> 03:26:46,080
Yeah, going on.

2871
03:26:46,080 --> 03:26:49,360
I was seeing like all the events, like Dr. Strange or whatever

2872
03:26:49,360 --> 03:26:51,680
and the Avengers when he's like seeing into all the future.

2873
03:26:51,680 --> 03:26:53,440
Oh, so when you saw me, you just saw the future.

2874
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:55,120
Yeah, I was looking at all of them, yeah.

2875
03:26:55,120 --> 03:26:57,520
So you're doing like some game theoretic simulation

2876
03:26:57,520 --> 03:26:58,880
of all the possible outcomes?

2877
03:26:58,880 --> 03:26:59,840
Yeah, exactly.

2878
03:26:59,840 --> 03:27:00,160
Okay.

2879
03:27:01,120 --> 03:27:02,720
But no, yeah, it was probably pretty soon I realized

2880
03:27:02,720 --> 03:27:03,840
that we had a lot of chemistry.

2881
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:05,760
I think before I left after my two weeks there,

2882
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:07,360
I was like, we need to make sure you got like a ticket

2883
03:27:07,360 --> 03:27:08,560
to come visit me in the United States

2884
03:27:08,560 --> 03:27:09,600
because it'll be fun and everything.

2885
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:09,920
And then.

2886
03:27:09,920 --> 03:27:11,840
I kind of decided that last minute too.

2887
03:27:11,840 --> 03:27:14,480
It was like really like five hours before your flight back.

2888
03:27:14,480 --> 03:27:17,040
We kind of realized because it was kind of like men

2889
03:27:17,040 --> 03:27:18,080
is just like a one type thing.

2890
03:27:18,080 --> 03:27:19,440
And then that was it.

2891
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:20,800
But we're like, oh, no, this is a lot of fun.

2892
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:21,760
We should probably hang out again.

2893
03:27:21,760 --> 03:27:24,480
Oh, so you realized you would miss each other.

2894
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

2895
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:26,320
This was one time thing.

2896
03:27:26,320 --> 03:27:27,600
The melancholy side of love.

2897
03:27:27,600 --> 03:27:29,040
Okay, when did you fall in love with Stephen?

2898
03:27:29,600 --> 03:27:30,880
I thought he like hated me.

2899
03:27:30,880 --> 03:27:31,200
I don't know.

2900
03:27:31,200 --> 03:27:32,640
I thought not hated me.

2901
03:27:32,640 --> 03:27:33,440
She still thinks I hated her.

2902
03:27:33,440 --> 03:27:37,280
But no, no, I remember like what he said

2903
03:27:37,280 --> 03:27:38,000
that he really liked me.

2904
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:41,280
I was kind of a little shocked about that because I don't know.

2905
03:27:41,280 --> 03:27:43,680
It was a lot of like random things happening in New Zealand.

2906
03:27:43,680 --> 03:27:45,600
It was a lot of fun, but it was definitely like

2907
03:27:45,600 --> 03:27:47,200
very interesting like things that happened.

2908
03:27:48,160 --> 03:27:50,720
Because I was like around a lot of other people as well.

2909
03:27:50,720 --> 03:27:52,640
So I thought he might have had like a really bad time.

2910
03:27:53,360 --> 03:27:55,200
But when he said that I was thinking about it more

2911
03:27:55,200 --> 03:27:57,440
and then we spent like more time together

2912
03:27:57,440 --> 03:27:58,320
like a week after that.

2913
03:27:58,320 --> 03:28:00,720
And then I felt like that was more like real.

2914
03:28:00,720 --> 03:28:02,480
And I think when he was about to leave,

2915
03:28:02,480 --> 03:28:04,000
I kind of realized like, no, I really like him.

2916
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:07,360
Do you guys ever say love to each other?

2917
03:28:07,360 --> 03:28:08,480
Like I love you?

2918
03:28:08,480 --> 03:28:08,960
Yeah, of course.

2919
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:09,200
Yeah.

2920
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:10,400
Okay, right.

2921
03:28:10,400 --> 03:28:10,880
I wasn't sure.

2922
03:28:10,880 --> 03:28:11,920
Why would you ask that?

2923
03:28:11,920 --> 03:28:12,880
What has he said before?

2924
03:28:12,880 --> 03:28:16,000
Because I haven't, I don't think I've heard you speak.

2925
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:18,880
The only time I've heard you talk about love is when you're like

2926
03:28:18,880 --> 03:28:21,360
criticizing the Red Pill community,

2927
03:28:21,360 --> 03:28:23,520
saying they don't ever talk about love in relationships.

2928
03:28:24,080 --> 03:28:26,080
Almost all the time I'm giving criticism to people,

2929
03:28:26,080 --> 03:28:27,440
like I said, I'm kind of stepping in.

2930
03:28:27,440 --> 03:28:29,360
I'm very disconnected from my own emotional experience

2931
03:28:29,360 --> 03:28:31,200
because I'm trying to talk with them there.

2932
03:28:31,200 --> 03:28:32,560
So it's pretty rare that I'll talk about my own.

2933
03:28:32,560 --> 03:28:35,200
What is your own emotional experience exactly?

2934
03:28:35,200 --> 03:28:36,480
Highly blunted, I guess.

2935
03:28:36,480 --> 03:28:37,120
There's a lot.

2936
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:37,680
Okay.

2937
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:38,400
What does that mean?

2938
03:28:39,280 --> 03:28:41,280
I mean, what's the, what's deep in there?

2939
03:28:41,280 --> 03:28:43,600
Are you, are you, is this just who you are genetically

2940
03:28:43,600 --> 03:28:44,720
or are you running for something?

2941
03:28:45,440 --> 03:28:46,880
I think I have a pretty good understanding of myself.

2942
03:28:46,880 --> 03:28:48,400
A lot of people make that accusation of me,

2943
03:28:48,400 --> 03:28:49,520
but I don't think I am.

2944
03:28:49,520 --> 03:28:50,000
Okay.

2945
03:28:50,000 --> 03:28:51,040
This is just who you are.

2946
03:28:51,040 --> 03:28:52,160
It's just who I am, yeah.

2947
03:28:52,160 --> 03:28:52,560
Okay.

2948
03:28:52,560 --> 03:28:54,640
There's not childhood stuff like trauma.

2949
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:56,480
It's all sorted and done.

2950
03:28:57,360 --> 03:28:58,320
You figured it all out?

2951
03:28:58,320 --> 03:28:58,880
Yeah.

2952
03:28:58,880 --> 03:29:00,240
In your old age?

2953
03:29:00,240 --> 03:29:02,080
As I grow, every year I figure out more and more.

2954
03:29:02,080 --> 03:29:04,080
He did mention, I think I heard this somewhere,

2955
03:29:04,080 --> 03:29:07,440
that this is a source of fights for the two of you, the age thing.

2956
03:29:07,440 --> 03:29:10,000
I felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation.

2957
03:29:11,280 --> 03:29:14,160
He's basically, he's saying that he gambles like with time.

2958
03:29:14,160 --> 03:29:16,400
He's just like, I think she will be good later.

2959
03:29:16,400 --> 03:29:17,120
And then just like,

2960
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:17,840
It's like an investment.

2961
03:29:17,840 --> 03:29:18,160
Yeah.

2962
03:29:18,160 --> 03:29:18,880
Yeah.

2963
03:29:18,880 --> 03:29:19,840
It's like what he's doing.

2964
03:29:19,840 --> 03:29:21,840
And when this treasury bond matures,

2965
03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:22,480
I'm going to be able to cash out for a good.

2966
03:29:22,480 --> 03:29:23,520
What do you think so far?

2967
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:24,880
Is the stock's growing up or?

2968
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:26,720
It's tumultuous.

2969
03:29:26,720 --> 03:29:27,760
What's that mean?

2970
03:29:27,760 --> 03:29:28,720
It's like Bitcoin.

2971
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:29,760
Oh my God.

2972
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:31,840
Like Bitcoin, crypto mill.

2973
03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:32,400
All right.

2974
03:29:32,400 --> 03:29:34,000
If you guys don't mind,

2975
03:29:34,000 --> 03:29:36,000
one interesting aspect of your relationship

2976
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:37,680
is you're in an open relationship.

2977
03:29:38,320 --> 03:29:39,040
What's that like?

2978
03:29:39,600 --> 03:29:41,840
From a game theoretic simulation perspective,

2979
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:43,360
what went into that calculation?

2980
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:45,040
And like, how does that?

2981
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:46,160
Like how that started or?

2982
03:29:46,160 --> 03:29:46,240
Yeah.

2983
03:29:46,240 --> 03:29:46,960
How did that start?

2984
03:29:46,960 --> 03:29:47,680
Sure.

2985
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:49,280
The only relationships I've ever done

2986
03:29:49,280 --> 03:29:52,080
has been open relationships since I was like in high school

2987
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:53,760
because I didn't really understand

2988
03:29:53,760 --> 03:29:55,200
like why wouldn't you be able to like

2989
03:29:55,920 --> 03:29:57,280
do other things with other people,

2990
03:29:57,280 --> 03:29:59,440
but then just like have your main partner basically.

2991
03:29:59,440 --> 03:30:01,360
So what is an open relationship?

2992
03:30:01,360 --> 03:30:02,320
Generally speaking,

2993
03:30:02,320 --> 03:30:04,000
that means you have one main partner?

2994
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:05,360
Not a monogamous relationship.

2995
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:08,160
Like you're somehow allowed like in different ways.

2996
03:30:08,960 --> 03:30:10,400
You can see other people sexually.

2997
03:30:10,880 --> 03:30:11,440
Sexually.

2998
03:30:11,440 --> 03:30:14,480
But like there's one main station.

2999
03:30:14,480 --> 03:30:16,080
It doesn't have to be there for some people,

3000
03:30:16,080 --> 03:30:18,080
but like I think it's probably easier

3001
03:30:18,080 --> 03:30:19,600
and we probably don't really have time

3002
03:30:19,600 --> 03:30:21,440
or the energy for like more than

3003
03:30:22,240 --> 03:30:24,560
like one person to like really like.

3004
03:30:24,560 --> 03:30:25,920
What about like emotional?

3005
03:30:26,640 --> 03:30:27,600
It's really complicated.

3006
03:30:27,600 --> 03:30:29,200
There's a lot of complicated stuff going on

3007
03:30:29,200 --> 03:30:30,320
under the hood there.

3008
03:30:30,320 --> 03:30:30,800
Yeah.

3009
03:30:32,000 --> 03:30:32,960
I think broadly speaking,

3010
03:30:32,960 --> 03:30:35,040
you've got like polyamorous relationships

3011
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:36,480
and you've got like open relationships

3012
03:30:36,480 --> 03:30:38,000
where polyamorous is like,

3013
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:39,920
oh, I've got like three different girlfriends

3014
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:41,840
and we all hang out or sometimes even live together

3015
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:42,960
or three boyfriends or whatever.

3016
03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:44,240
And then you've got like open relationships

3017
03:30:44,240 --> 03:30:45,360
which is like, oh, you know, like,

3018
03:30:45,360 --> 03:30:46,960
you can basically hook up with other people

3019
03:30:46,960 --> 03:30:48,560
and then you've got like your main relationship

3020
03:30:48,560 --> 03:30:49,200
and that's it.

3021
03:30:49,200 --> 03:30:52,000
I think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that

3022
03:30:52,000 --> 03:30:53,680
to where like we've got like long-term friends,

3023
03:30:53,680 --> 03:30:54,800
some of them we hook up with

3024
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:56,320
and that's kind of how we, yeah.

3025
03:30:56,320 --> 03:30:59,360
It's a delicate dance that explodes

3026
03:30:59,360 --> 03:31:00,480
every six months on itself.

3027
03:31:00,480 --> 03:31:02,320
So it does explode, you guys fight over?

3028
03:31:02,320 --> 03:31:03,760
We fight over some things, yeah.

3029
03:31:04,320 --> 03:31:05,200
It things happen, yeah.

3030
03:31:05,200 --> 03:31:08,080
I think it's mostly because a lot of people can handle it

3031
03:31:08,080 --> 03:31:09,520
and they, they agree to something

3032
03:31:09,520 --> 03:31:11,360
and then they realize that we're way too cool

3033
03:31:11,360 --> 03:31:12,880
and then they get really obsessed

3034
03:31:12,880 --> 03:31:14,800
and they think that they can like get in there

3035
03:31:14,800 --> 03:31:15,760
and then it gets really dramatic.

3036
03:31:16,400 --> 03:31:17,360
Have you figured it out?

3037
03:31:19,440 --> 03:31:21,920
I feel like we figure out things more and more

3038
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:22,880
like when it comes to like,

3039
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:24,480
what's a good person for us to hang out

3040
03:31:24,480 --> 03:31:26,960
and what's not a good person for us to hang out with

3041
03:31:26,960 --> 03:31:29,120
or like, I probably have more opinions

3042
03:31:29,120 --> 03:31:30,480
than like who he hangs out with

3043
03:31:30,480 --> 03:31:32,000
because he likes the fucking psychos.

3044
03:31:33,120 --> 03:31:34,960
Yeah, so you like this or not?

3045
03:31:34,960 --> 03:31:37,040
He likes the not like the crazy ones,

3046
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:38,640
like the baby trap sort of women.

3047
03:31:39,200 --> 03:31:40,800
That's the ones and I don't like that

3048
03:31:40,800 --> 03:31:41,600
because that affects me.

3049
03:31:43,440 --> 03:31:45,120
That affects your game theory at a calculation.

3050
03:31:45,120 --> 03:31:45,920
Yeah, obviously, yeah.

3051
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:48,320
Right, you like to surround yourself

3052
03:31:48,320 --> 03:31:50,880
like in general you've talked about with crazy people.

3053
03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:53,040
I say crazy and I really shouldn't.

3054
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:53,920
It's a humorous way.

3055
03:31:53,920 --> 03:31:54,480
It's like, yeah.

3056
03:31:54,480 --> 03:31:55,760
They're very unstable.

3057
03:31:55,760 --> 03:31:57,360
Very, can be unstable,

3058
03:31:57,360 --> 03:31:58,720
but people that are very unique.

3059
03:31:58,720 --> 03:32:00,560
Like when I meet this person, that's like.

3060
03:32:00,560 --> 03:32:01,280
Not boring.

3061
03:32:01,280 --> 03:32:02,480
Yeah, not boring, yeah.

3062
03:32:03,120 --> 03:32:05,360
And you said that you're progressively becoming

3063
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:07,360
not boring yourself.

3064
03:32:07,360 --> 03:32:08,560
No, I think I'm pretty stable.

3065
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:10,160
I don't love them affect me much, but.

3066
03:32:10,160 --> 03:32:11,760
So you don't think they affect your.

3067
03:32:11,760 --> 03:32:13,280
No, if I've said that, I said a joke.

3068
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:14,720
And I think I've like, I've got my stuff

3069
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:15,680
like really well figured out.

3070
03:32:15,680 --> 03:32:17,120
It's what allows me to engage with people

3071
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:19,040
like this so easily because I can engage.

3072
03:32:19,040 --> 03:32:20,320
I can make them feel seen and heard.

3073
03:32:20,320 --> 03:32:21,920
And then if it gets insane, I can cut off

3074
03:32:21,920 --> 03:32:22,960
and I can be chill.

3075
03:32:22,960 --> 03:32:24,960
Like very few things affect me in the long term.

3076
03:32:24,960 --> 03:32:26,320
Do you guys experience jealousy?

3077
03:32:27,440 --> 03:32:30,000
Usually like whenever I feel like he's not spending

3078
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:32,080
the like the amount of time that I'm asking for

3079
03:32:32,080 --> 03:32:35,040
and he spends it on his video games or his stream

3080
03:32:35,120 --> 03:32:37,600
or like he sees someone else like more than

3081
03:32:37,600 --> 03:32:38,800
he sees me or something like that.

3082
03:32:38,800 --> 03:32:40,160
That would like not be good

3083
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:41,840
because then it affects like our relationship.

3084
03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:45,680
Do you have a good sense of like, is it literally time

3085
03:32:45,680 --> 03:32:49,120
or is it the energy put into the.

3086
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:52,240
It's probably like if like if he's with me

3087
03:32:52,240 --> 03:32:53,680
that like the attention in the time

3088
03:32:53,680 --> 03:32:54,720
like when he hangs out with me

3089
03:32:54,720 --> 03:32:56,080
and then there's also probably the time.

3090
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:58,560
So if I feel like something else is distracting too much

3091
03:32:58,560 --> 03:33:00,240
like it could be work or it could be a friend

3092
03:33:00,240 --> 03:33:01,520
or it could be anything.

3093
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:04,720
Like if I feel like it starts to take away from like me

3094
03:33:04,720 --> 03:33:06,320
then I'm having an issue with it.

3095
03:33:06,320 --> 03:33:08,000
I don't think he really cares much.

3096
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:09,760
I guess the only jealousy you experience is probably

3097
03:33:09,760 --> 03:33:15,120
when you feel like if I get upset about him seeing someone too much

3098
03:33:15,680 --> 03:33:17,360
and then I go see someone more

3099
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:19,600
and then he's like why can I go see my friend more

3100
03:33:19,600 --> 03:33:20,480
like as much as you.

3101
03:33:20,480 --> 03:33:22,240
So like that's the sort of like thing

3102
03:33:22,240 --> 03:33:23,680
that we're trying to navigate on I guess.

3103
03:33:25,440 --> 03:33:28,560
I think we are like diametrically opposed sometimes

3104
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:30,480
in terms of how we view like engagement with people

3105
03:33:30,480 --> 03:33:32,160
or engagement with the world sometimes.

3106
03:33:32,160 --> 03:33:34,000
So like on her end of the spectrum

3107
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:38,960
like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin

3108
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:41,520
watching like fireflies at night

3109
03:33:41,520 --> 03:33:42,800
going hiking every morning

3110
03:33:42,800 --> 03:33:44,000
going swimming at the beach

3111
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:46,560
because it's like you're taking in like the grandeur of nature

3112
03:33:46,560 --> 03:33:47,840
you're like connected with yourself

3113
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:48,880
you're like very at peace

3114
03:33:48,880 --> 03:33:50,080
everything is like chill and cool

3115
03:33:50,080 --> 03:33:51,760
there's the wind the feeling of nature everything

3116
03:33:51,760 --> 03:33:53,440
that's like her peak living experience.

3117
03:33:53,440 --> 03:33:54,560
I like being present.

3118
03:33:54,560 --> 03:33:56,960
Yeah and like my peak experiences are like

3119
03:33:56,960 --> 03:33:58,320
people trying to destroy my life

3120
03:33:58,320 --> 03:33:59,680
like the challenge of like navigating

3121
03:33:59,680 --> 03:34:00,880
a really complicated discussion

3122
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:03,680
like you know several different dramatic events

3123
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:04,880
unfolding that might end my career

3124
03:34:04,880 --> 03:34:05,840
like these things are like very

3125
03:34:05,840 --> 03:34:07,440
I like the stress and the action

3126
03:34:07,440 --> 03:34:08,160
and the entertainment

3127
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:09,760
and everything's like very cool for me.

3128
03:34:09,760 --> 03:34:10,880
So when we're together

3129
03:34:10,880 --> 03:34:12,800
she generally wants me to be like more chill

3130
03:34:12,800 --> 03:34:14,160
but if I don't feel like I'm being like

3131
03:34:14,160 --> 03:34:15,120
stimulated a lot

3132
03:34:15,120 --> 03:34:16,720
then it's easy for like my mind to wonder

3133
03:34:16,720 --> 03:34:18,320
to wonder somewhere else or yeah

3134
03:34:18,320 --> 03:34:19,040
that's kind of the issue.

3135
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:20,640
We have a very different way of like engaging with the world.

3136
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:24,000
So how can you find happiness and stillness?

3137
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:26,240
I feel like if we're just like aware of it

3138
03:34:26,240 --> 03:34:27,280
and we're trying our best

3139
03:34:27,280 --> 03:34:29,280
like whenever we like we're supposed to do this one thing

3140
03:34:29,280 --> 03:34:30,880
so let's say that we want to go to New York

3141
03:34:30,880 --> 03:34:32,320
and I'm like we should just like go out

3142
03:34:32,400 --> 03:34:33,680
and do this one specific thing

3143
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:35,840
we try to find something that he enjoys doing

3144
03:34:35,840 --> 03:34:38,480
like now that we're in Texas we can go shooting

3145
03:34:38,480 --> 03:34:40,160
or do something fun that he enjoys

3146
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:40,960
then we can do it.

3147
03:34:42,160 --> 03:34:43,040
And then I think like

3148
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:45,600
just like for me also to be aware

3149
03:34:46,480 --> 03:34:48,560
that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people

3150
03:34:48,560 --> 03:34:49,920
it's not because he like loves them

3151
03:34:49,920 --> 03:34:50,800
or wants to be with them

3152
03:34:50,800 --> 03:34:52,080
it's just because he likes being

3153
03:34:52,080 --> 03:34:53,840
like having his life destroyed.

3154
03:34:54,400 --> 03:34:55,440
Like you said

3155
03:34:55,440 --> 03:34:56,320
which I don't really do

3156
03:34:56,320 --> 03:34:57,520
this is a completely different thing.

3157
03:34:57,520 --> 03:34:59,600
So like for me to like understand more

3158
03:34:59,600 --> 03:35:00,640
like how he's thinking

3159
03:35:00,640 --> 03:35:01,920
because it's so different from mine

3160
03:35:02,320 --> 03:35:03,440
and for him to understand

3161
03:35:03,440 --> 03:35:04,480
how I'm thinking about things

3162
03:35:04,480 --> 03:35:06,720
and like what I prioritize in my life

3163
03:35:06,720 --> 03:35:08,240
I think that's like how we navigate

3164
03:35:08,240 --> 03:35:09,040
but I think it's good

3165
03:35:09,040 --> 03:35:10,640
I think the differences can be good

3166
03:35:10,640 --> 03:35:11,840
like when we're finding a way.

3167
03:35:11,840 --> 03:35:12,400
Yeah.

3168
03:35:12,400 --> 03:35:15,440
Well I think you're relatable.

3169
03:35:17,120 --> 03:35:17,920
I'm more of a human.

3170
03:35:17,920 --> 03:35:19,680
No I'm definitely very difficult to get along with

3171
03:35:19,680 --> 03:35:20,560
like I always tell people that

3172
03:35:20,560 --> 03:35:21,440
that like if you're dating me

3173
03:35:21,440 --> 03:35:22,480
for like more than a few years

3174
03:35:22,480 --> 03:35:23,760
like you get like an award for that.

3175
03:35:23,760 --> 03:35:25,920
It's like a war zone that you've survived.

3176
03:35:25,920 --> 03:35:26,960
Absolutely.

3177
03:35:26,960 --> 03:35:29,280
You're like a veteran you get medals and stuff

3178
03:35:29,280 --> 03:35:30,240
and it's always like I think

3179
03:35:30,240 --> 03:35:31,520
there's probably been like six different

3180
03:35:31,520 --> 03:35:32,640
I don't think she says it anymore

3181
03:35:32,640 --> 03:35:33,600
but there are like six different times

3182
03:35:33,600 --> 03:35:34,560
in our relationship where she's like

3183
03:35:34,560 --> 03:35:35,600
is it always like this?

3184
03:35:35,600 --> 03:35:36,720
Is this actually right?

3185
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:36,880
Yeah.

3186
03:35:36,880 --> 03:35:38,320
And like every next year it's like

3187
03:35:38,320 --> 03:35:39,520
You're lying in the beginning of about like

3188
03:35:39,520 --> 03:35:40,640
you were lying about that.

3189
03:35:40,640 --> 03:35:42,240
Well it got more and more.

3190
03:35:42,240 --> 03:35:43,840
You were like no it's just like right now

3191
03:35:43,840 --> 03:35:46,080
I'm having a huge argument online

3192
03:35:46,080 --> 03:35:47,520
about seeing the end word in private

3193
03:35:47,520 --> 03:35:48,480
and it's just going to be like this

3194
03:35:48,480 --> 03:35:50,320
and I'm going to be streaming 24 hours a day

3195
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:51,920
and I'm like we're like

3196
03:35:51,920 --> 03:35:52,880
when are you going to come to bed?

3197
03:35:52,880 --> 03:35:53,520
It's been a week.

3198
03:35:55,520 --> 03:35:58,400
I did playing League come into this.

3199
03:35:58,400 --> 03:35:59,520
A little bit but I'm clean.

3200
03:35:59,520 --> 03:36:01,120
I'm clean of League like six months right now.

3201
03:36:01,520 --> 03:36:03,360
What do you hate about League of Legends?

3202
03:36:03,360 --> 03:36:03,760
I never got.

3203
03:36:03,760 --> 03:36:04,240
The humans.

3204
03:36:06,240 --> 03:36:07,440
Well speaking of which

3205
03:36:07,440 --> 03:36:09,360
I my participation in League

3206
03:36:09,360 --> 03:36:10,720
involved on the robot side.

3207
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:11,120
Good.

3208
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:13,200
Because that's an improvement.

3209
03:36:13,840 --> 03:36:16,400
Because both the Starcraft 2

3210
03:36:16,400 --> 03:36:18,080
and and League of Legends

3211
03:36:18,080 --> 03:36:19,760
because OpenAI and DeepMind

3212
03:36:20,480 --> 03:36:21,760
both participated in creating bots

3213
03:36:21,760 --> 03:36:22,240
and those.

3214
03:36:22,240 --> 03:36:23,760
I was a professional Starcraft 2 player

3215
03:36:23,760 --> 03:36:25,760
so I remember when the AI started to play

3216
03:36:25,760 --> 03:36:27,600
it's interesting the types of restrictions

3217
03:36:27,600 --> 03:36:28,800
that you would have to put on like a

3218
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:30,640
gaming robot to make it like functional

3219
03:36:30,720 --> 03:36:32,800
and not totally unfair to the other side.

3220
03:36:32,800 --> 03:36:34,560
Yeah to make it human like.

3221
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:35,840
Yeah was that interesting to you

3222
03:36:35,840 --> 03:36:38,560
to see AI be able to play those video games?

3223
03:36:38,560 --> 03:36:39,360
I think in some ways

3224
03:36:39,360 --> 03:36:40,560
people think things are more complicated

3225
03:36:40,560 --> 03:36:41,680
than they actually are

3226
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:43,200
and I think video games is one of those things

3227
03:36:43,200 --> 03:36:44,000
are really oh my god

3228
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:45,520
there's like a million possibilities

3229
03:36:45,520 --> 03:36:46,960
at every second and who knows

3230
03:36:46,960 --> 03:36:47,520
and it's like no

3231
03:36:47,520 --> 03:36:48,480
there's like three or four things

3232
03:36:48,480 --> 03:36:49,520
going at any point in time

3233
03:36:49,520 --> 03:36:50,400
and I'm willing to bet that like

3234
03:36:50,400 --> 03:36:51,760
an AI could probably solve some of these

3235
03:36:51,760 --> 03:36:52,880
games like pretty easily

3236
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:54,960
especially if there are no constraints

3237
03:36:54,960 --> 03:36:55,680
on how they can learn.

3238
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:58,480
Yeah can I talk to you about relationships?

3239
03:36:59,120 --> 03:37:00,160
Yeah you already have so.

3240
03:37:00,160 --> 03:37:02,080
Yeah I know but more generally speaking

3241
03:37:02,080 --> 03:37:04,160
we didn't get a chance to talk about

3242
03:37:04,160 --> 03:37:05,600
the the red pill community.

3243
03:37:05,600 --> 03:37:06,240
Oh sure.

3244
03:37:06,240 --> 03:37:08,240
Well first of all what is the red pill community

3245
03:37:08,240 --> 03:37:09,600
the manosphere in general?

3246
03:37:09,600 --> 03:37:11,680
I'd love to get both your opinions on this.

3247
03:37:11,680 --> 03:37:11,920
Sure.

3248
03:37:12,880 --> 03:37:15,040
I know I know you're probably not as

3249
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:17,920
opinionated on that whole thing.

3250
03:37:17,920 --> 03:37:18,960
Do you think I am that?

3251
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:20,080
Like probably not as you

3252
03:37:20,080 --> 03:37:20,960
like as much as you

3253
03:37:20,960 --> 03:37:22,480
but I do have opinions.

3254
03:37:22,480 --> 03:37:23,200
You do okay.

3255
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:24,880
I usually don't like speak out too much

3256
03:37:24,880 --> 03:37:26,080
on it because I feel like

3257
03:37:26,080 --> 03:37:27,200
there's like a language barrier

3258
03:37:27,920 --> 03:37:29,280
that's why I don't really do politics

3259
03:37:29,280 --> 03:37:30,800
because this is my second language.

3260
03:37:30,800 --> 03:37:31,120
Yeah.

3261
03:37:31,120 --> 03:37:33,200
That's right you have to know the.

3262
03:37:33,200 --> 03:37:33,920
A lot of it like.

3263
03:37:33,920 --> 03:37:34,640
You know how to use

3264
03:37:35,200 --> 03:37:37,040
have to use derogatory terms

3265
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:37,920
every other sentence

3266
03:37:38,640 --> 03:37:39,760
so they understand you right.

3267
03:37:39,760 --> 03:37:40,240
Exactly.

3268
03:37:40,240 --> 03:37:41,600
I don't know anything about that.

3269
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:43,440
But you need like a good like you need

3270
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:45,680
to be able to like speak really well

3271
03:37:45,680 --> 03:37:46,960
for people to take your seriously

3272
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:48,240
I think.

3273
03:37:48,240 --> 03:37:49,760
And like that's a thing like if I

3274
03:37:49,760 --> 03:37:51,120
if I don't have like the words

3275
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:52,080
and I don't have the

3276
03:37:52,080 --> 03:37:53,920
like I can't pronounce things correctly.

3277
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:55,200
Yeah and you're a self person

3278
03:37:55,200 --> 03:37:56,640
searching for words looks stupid

3279
03:37:56,640 --> 03:37:58,160
essentially that's how people view it.

3280
03:37:58,240 --> 03:38:00,160
Tell me about it I have a podcast

3281
03:38:00,160 --> 03:38:01,920
that people listen to

3282
03:38:01,920 --> 03:38:04,160
and I mumble and they yeah.

3283
03:38:04,160 --> 03:38:05,600
Wait is here what's your first language.

3284
03:38:06,160 --> 03:38:06,800
Russian.

3285
03:38:06,800 --> 03:38:07,360
Oh okay.

3286
03:38:07,360 --> 03:38:09,440
But I speak both languages horribly.

3287
03:38:09,440 --> 03:38:12,240
I just not I'm not like

3288
03:38:12,240 --> 03:38:14,320
there is definitely a big disconnect

3289
03:38:14,320 --> 03:38:16,640
between my brain and my mouth module.

3290
03:38:17,200 --> 03:38:19,120
Like I'm not able to generate

3291
03:38:19,120 --> 03:38:20,640
the thoughts efficiently

3292
03:38:20,640 --> 03:38:21,840
like the things you're able to do

3293
03:38:21,840 --> 03:38:23,600
like to like speak like that.

3294
03:38:23,600 --> 03:38:26,080
I'm not it's very very tough.

3295
03:38:26,080 --> 03:38:27,840
Plus there's a huge amount of anxiety

3296
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:29,360
and social interaction that I have

3297
03:38:29,360 --> 03:38:30,800
which makes speaking even harder.

3298
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:34,160
Yeah yeah yeah it's tough.

3299
03:38:34,160 --> 03:38:34,800
I understand I mean.

3300
03:38:34,800 --> 03:38:35,200
Gotcha.

3301
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:37,280
Makes sense.

3302
03:38:37,280 --> 03:38:39,440
Yeah the the gacha is both

3303
03:38:40,320 --> 03:38:41,680
a symbol of compassion

3304
03:38:42,320 --> 03:38:43,840
and derision at once.

3305
03:38:43,840 --> 03:38:44,640
It's I'm just letting you know

3306
03:38:44,640 --> 03:38:45,360
I understand what you say.

3307
03:38:45,360 --> 03:38:46,160
I'm just going to sit there

3308
03:38:46,160 --> 03:38:46,560
and stare at you.

3309
03:38:46,560 --> 03:38:47,040
Confirm.

3310
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:48,720
No you can just say like yeah get it.

3311
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:49,600
Like yeah I get it.

3312
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:50,160
I get it.

3313
03:38:50,160 --> 03:38:50,720
Gotcha.

3314
03:38:50,720 --> 03:38:51,680
I got you.

3315
03:38:51,680 --> 03:38:52,560
Gotcha sounds.

3316
03:38:52,560 --> 03:38:53,200
I got you.

3317
03:38:53,200 --> 03:38:54,960
No it's so it's so short.

3318
03:38:54,960 --> 03:38:55,600
I got you.

3319
03:38:56,080 --> 03:38:57,760
Say it's a longer sentence

3320
03:38:57,760 --> 03:38:59,200
but that means the same thing.

3321
03:38:59,200 --> 03:39:00,480
I understand you.

3322
03:39:00,480 --> 03:39:02,400
Yeah that's good that's like

3323
03:39:02,400 --> 03:39:04,160
not chills you know.

3324
03:39:04,160 --> 03:39:06,240
You get chills all like you understand me.

3325
03:39:06,240 --> 03:39:07,200
Yeah it feels good.

3326
03:39:07,200 --> 03:39:07,600
Yeah.

3327
03:39:07,600 --> 03:39:08,400
I hear you.

3328
03:39:08,400 --> 03:39:09,200
I hear you.

3329
03:39:09,200 --> 03:39:10,160
And like if you just like

3330
03:39:10,160 --> 03:39:11,200
hold the other person's hand

3331
03:39:11,200 --> 03:39:11,760
that's even better.

3332
03:39:11,760 --> 03:39:13,120
Maybe you gotta put in some emotion there

3333
03:39:13,120 --> 03:39:14,320
okay show that you have some.

3334
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:18,400
Gotcha.

3335
03:39:18,400 --> 03:39:19,600
What do you think about Red Pill?

3336
03:39:20,880 --> 03:39:22,240
Sorry what is it first of all

3337
03:39:22,240 --> 03:39:23,360
for people I don't know?

3338
03:39:23,360 --> 03:39:24,960
Yeah the Red Pill community

3339
03:39:24,960 --> 03:39:26,400
obviously it's the matrix reference.

3340
03:39:26,400 --> 03:39:27,440
The Red Pill that you take

3341
03:39:27,440 --> 03:39:28,560
is when you realize

3342
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:30,080
what dating standards and norms

3343
03:39:30,080 --> 03:39:31,440
really are in the world

3344
03:39:31,440 --> 03:39:32,960
that men are providers

3345
03:39:32,960 --> 03:39:34,560
and have to become some great thing

3346
03:39:34,560 --> 03:39:36,240
to hunt and attract you know

3347
03:39:36,240 --> 03:39:37,360
the woman who are just kind of

3348
03:39:37,360 --> 03:39:38,080
there floating around

3349
03:39:38,080 --> 03:39:38,800
looking for people

3350
03:39:38,800 --> 03:39:40,080
to give them the most resources

3351
03:39:40,080 --> 03:39:42,160
and it's like coming to a realization

3352
03:39:42,160 --> 03:39:43,680
of what the world of dating really is

3353
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:45,040
broken away from the Hollywood

3354
03:39:45,040 --> 03:39:46,320
standards and the romantic stuff

3355
03:39:46,320 --> 03:39:47,120
that they try to sell you

3356
03:39:47,120 --> 03:39:48,080
and you know stories.

3357
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:49,040
So there was kind of

3358
03:39:49,840 --> 03:39:51,760
maybe you can kind of educate me on this

3359
03:39:51,760 --> 03:39:53,680
but Red Pill used to be associated with

3360
03:39:54,960 --> 03:39:58,640
just maybe anti-establishment views

3361
03:39:58,640 --> 03:39:59,680
I don't know maybe

3362
03:39:59,680 --> 03:40:01,360
maybe Republican conservative viewpoints

3363
03:40:01,360 --> 03:40:02,240
would be all right.

3364
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:03,680
Yeah they use Red Pill a lot

3365
03:40:03,680 --> 03:40:04,640
in like different communities

3366
03:40:04,640 --> 03:40:06,400
like when you say the Red Pill community

3367
03:40:06,400 --> 03:40:07,840
yeah that usually means dating.

3368
03:40:07,840 --> 03:40:08,400
The dating thing

3369
03:40:08,400 --> 03:40:09,040
but a lot of people say

3370
03:40:09,040 --> 03:40:10,240
oh Trump voters they're Red Pill

3371
03:40:10,240 --> 03:40:11,520
are you Red Pilled on like politics

3372
03:40:11,520 --> 03:40:13,120
or whatever people say stuff like that yeah.

3373
03:40:13,120 --> 03:40:13,760
Okay cool.

3374
03:40:13,760 --> 03:40:15,440
And then there's like the manosphere

3375
03:40:15,440 --> 03:40:17,120
that's all the similar type of stuff

3376
03:40:17,120 --> 03:40:18,720
and Andrew Tate is somebody

3377
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:19,680
that represents kind of

3378
03:40:20,480 --> 03:40:21,520
the figurehead

3379
03:40:21,520 --> 03:40:22,320
of the manosphere

3380
03:40:22,320 --> 03:40:23,280
of like the Red Pill stuff

3381
03:40:23,280 --> 03:40:24,080
yeah I would say so

3382
03:40:24,080 --> 03:40:24,880
I'm pretty sure yeah.

3383
03:40:24,880 --> 03:40:26,160
Okay all right cool.

3384
03:40:26,160 --> 03:40:28,800
So what are some ideas

3385
03:40:28,800 --> 03:40:29,520
that they represent

3386
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:30,640
and what do you think about them?

3387
03:40:30,640 --> 03:40:32,160
I think they do a good job

3388
03:40:32,160 --> 03:40:34,160
at speaking to disaffected young men

3389
03:40:34,160 --> 03:40:35,520
who feel like the rest of the world

3390
03:40:35,520 --> 03:40:36,560
is kind of left them behind

3391
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:38,320
or isn't willing to speak to them

3392
03:40:38,320 --> 03:40:39,600
and they do identify

3393
03:40:39,600 --> 03:40:41,440
some true and real problems.

3394
03:40:41,440 --> 03:40:42,240
Feels like on the left

3395
03:40:42,240 --> 03:40:43,360
we have a really hard time

3396
03:40:43,360 --> 03:40:44,800
doing like self-improvement

3397
03:40:44,800 --> 03:40:46,400
or telling people how to better themselves.

3398
03:40:46,400 --> 03:40:47,200
We focus too much on

3399
03:40:47,200 --> 03:40:48,800
like structural or systemic issues

3400
03:40:48,800 --> 03:40:50,320
rather than what can an individual do

3401
03:40:50,320 --> 03:40:52,080
to uplift or empower themselves

3402
03:40:52,080 --> 03:40:52,960
and it also feels like

3403
03:40:52,960 --> 03:40:53,920
they do a good job

3404
03:40:53,920 --> 03:40:56,160
at speaking to some of the positive aspects

3405
03:40:56,160 --> 03:40:57,040
of masculinity

3406
03:40:57,040 --> 03:40:58,880
that it's okay to be like strong

3407
03:40:58,880 --> 03:41:00,800
and brave and a soldier

3408
03:41:00,800 --> 03:41:01,360
and a warrior

3409
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:02,320
and provide for your family

3410
03:41:02,320 --> 03:41:03,040
and blah blah blah.

3411
03:41:03,680 --> 03:41:04,560
So I would say like those are like

3412
03:41:04,560 --> 03:41:05,360
positive messages

3413
03:41:05,360 --> 03:41:06,160
like self-improvement

3414
03:41:06,160 --> 03:41:06,640
and everything

3415
03:41:06,640 --> 03:41:08,000
that come from the Red Pill community.

3416
03:41:08,640 --> 03:41:09,520
What's the negative?

3417
03:41:10,640 --> 03:41:11,840
I think the analysis

3418
03:41:11,840 --> 03:41:13,920
on how men and women interact

3419
03:41:13,920 --> 03:41:16,000
is a way too transactional.

3420
03:41:16,000 --> 03:41:17,440
All of like the romanticism

3421
03:41:17,440 --> 03:41:18,240
and love and chemistry

3422
03:41:18,240 --> 03:41:19,680
is totally sucked out of it.

3423
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:20,720
Everything is very like

3424
03:41:21,360 --> 03:41:21,920
sex-based

3425
03:41:21,920 --> 03:41:23,360
like how do you basically have sex

3426
03:41:23,360 --> 03:41:24,720
with the most amount of women possible

3427
03:41:24,720 --> 03:41:25,680
and that's going to make you happy.

3428
03:41:26,560 --> 03:41:28,000
And then I think people's motivation

3429
03:41:28,000 --> 03:41:29,680
sometimes are just spoken about

3430
03:41:29,680 --> 03:41:31,440
in such a shallow derogatory way

3431
03:41:31,440 --> 03:41:32,000
that I don't think

3432
03:41:32,000 --> 03:41:33,520
is always reflective of reality.

3433
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:34,720
Like women only wants you

3434
03:41:34,720 --> 03:41:35,760
because you make six figures

3435
03:41:35,760 --> 03:41:36,480
and you're tall

3436
03:41:36,480 --> 03:41:37,280
and a guy only wants you

3437
03:41:37,280 --> 03:41:38,240
because he wants to have sex with you

3438
03:41:38,240 --> 03:41:38,720
and blah blah.

3439
03:41:38,720 --> 03:41:39,200
Like it feels like

3440
03:41:39,200 --> 03:41:40,400
there's a lot of that going on a lot.

3441
03:41:41,280 --> 03:41:42,720
Yeah and that misses

3442
03:41:42,720 --> 03:41:43,840
some fundamental aspect

3443
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:44,880
about relationships

3444
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:46,880
about meaningful relationships and so on.

3445
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:47,920
I don't think I've never heard

3446
03:41:47,920 --> 03:41:49,360
Red Pill people ever ever

3447
03:41:49,360 --> 03:41:50,800
talk about like meaningful relationships.

3448
03:41:50,800 --> 03:41:51,840
It's always just how to get in one

3449
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:52,880
or how to have sex really.

3450
03:41:53,760 --> 03:41:55,360
Mel, what bothers you about

3451
03:41:55,360 --> 03:41:57,200
some of that philosophy?

3452
03:41:57,200 --> 03:41:58,080
I feel like the people

3453
03:41:58,080 --> 03:41:59,520
that are like the Red Pill people

3454
03:41:59,520 --> 03:42:01,040
I feel like their solution

3455
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:03,200
is something that doesn't actually work out.

3456
03:42:04,400 --> 03:42:05,840
Like where it works out

3457
03:42:05,840 --> 03:42:06,560
for some people

3458
03:42:06,560 --> 03:42:07,680
people that makes a lot of money

3459
03:42:07,680 --> 03:42:08,720
is like really successful

3460
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:09,440
in that sort of way.

3461
03:42:10,000 --> 03:42:11,360
But it's not going to help

3462
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:12,880
most men out there

3463
03:42:12,880 --> 03:42:14,320
so I feel like it's just like a pointless

3464
03:42:14,880 --> 03:42:16,080
like speech to give

3465
03:42:16,080 --> 03:42:18,080
to these like really lost guys

3466
03:42:18,080 --> 03:42:18,960
and they really do believe

3467
03:42:18,960 --> 03:42:19,760
that they can like

3468
03:42:19,760 --> 03:42:20,960
they can become successful

3469
03:42:20,960 --> 03:42:22,640
they can get money

3470
03:42:23,200 --> 03:42:24,560
and when they get all these things

3471
03:42:24,560 --> 03:42:25,520
they can get girls

3472
03:42:25,520 --> 03:42:26,400
but most of them

3473
03:42:26,400 --> 03:42:27,840
is not going to achieve that ever.

3474
03:42:28,400 --> 03:42:29,280
To get the money part

3475
03:42:29,280 --> 03:42:30,320
or become successful.

3476
03:42:30,320 --> 03:42:31,280
Just become a billionaire

3477
03:42:31,280 --> 03:42:31,920
you know like

3478
03:42:31,920 --> 03:42:32,880
and you will get all the girls

3479
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:33,520
and which is true

3480
03:42:33,520 --> 03:42:34,640
but not everyone can do that.

3481
03:42:34,640 --> 03:42:36,000
So I feel like

3482
03:42:36,000 --> 03:42:37,200
when these guys are speaking

3483
03:42:37,200 --> 03:42:37,840
to these men

3484
03:42:37,840 --> 03:42:38,240
and there's like

3485
03:42:38,240 --> 03:42:40,080
we just care about these men out there

3486
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:41,520
you know they need to hear this

3487
03:42:41,520 --> 03:42:42,880
it doesn't really help a lot of them.

3488
03:42:43,440 --> 03:42:46,640
And it doesn't inspire them

3489
03:42:46,640 --> 03:42:47,840
to develop compassion

3490
03:42:48,640 --> 03:42:49,760
towards the opposite sex

3491
03:42:49,760 --> 03:42:51,280
which is probably something required

3492
03:42:51,360 --> 03:42:52,800
to have money for relationship.

3493
03:42:52,800 --> 03:42:53,840
And also like

3494
03:42:53,840 --> 03:42:55,680
they seem to complain a lot about women

3495
03:42:56,640 --> 03:42:57,920
like only wanting men

3496
03:42:57,920 --> 03:42:58,640
that have money

3497
03:42:58,640 --> 03:42:59,280
and that's tall

3498
03:42:59,280 --> 03:43:00,080
and that's muscular

3499
03:43:00,080 --> 03:43:00,800
whatever you know

3500
03:43:00,800 --> 03:43:01,440
all those things

3501
03:43:02,880 --> 03:43:04,480
and but they complain about that

3502
03:43:04,480 --> 03:43:05,120
but that's like

3503
03:43:05,120 --> 03:43:06,480
also kind of what they're trying to

3504
03:43:07,520 --> 03:43:10,160
make the men try to do for themselves

3505
03:43:10,160 --> 03:43:11,120
so they kind of like

3506
03:43:11,120 --> 03:43:12,800
fall into the same sort of behavior

3507
03:43:12,800 --> 03:43:13,360
and it seems like

3508
03:43:13,360 --> 03:43:14,720
they're kind of unaware of that as well.

3509
03:43:15,920 --> 03:43:17,280
They're just playing a part of the game

3510
03:43:17,280 --> 03:43:18,640
instead of trying to find

3511
03:43:18,640 --> 03:43:20,800
a woman that doesn't look for those things

3512
03:43:20,800 --> 03:43:21,760
and that are looking for

3513
03:43:22,720 --> 03:43:23,440
not those things.

3514
03:43:23,440 --> 03:43:24,160
Yeah.

3515
03:43:24,160 --> 03:43:25,360
I actually would love to have

3516
03:43:25,360 --> 03:43:26,720
like straight up data

3517
03:43:27,680 --> 03:43:30,720
on people in that world

3518
03:43:30,720 --> 03:43:31,840
versus not in that world

3519
03:43:31,840 --> 03:43:32,880
how often they get laid.

3520
03:43:33,440 --> 03:43:33,680
Yeah.

3521
03:43:34,400 --> 03:43:36,080
Like literally so

3522
03:43:37,040 --> 03:43:38,240
I think for sure

3523
03:43:39,040 --> 03:43:40,080
people in that world

3524
03:43:40,720 --> 03:43:43,760
have fewer meaningful long-term

3525
03:43:43,760 --> 03:43:45,280
relationships that are fulfilling

3526
03:43:45,280 --> 03:43:47,360
that actually helped them succeed in life

3527
03:43:47,360 --> 03:43:48,480
that helped them be happy

3528
03:43:48,480 --> 03:43:49,600
and content and all that kind of stuff

3529
03:43:50,240 --> 03:43:51,840
but just even the straight up

3530
03:43:51,840 --> 03:43:53,360
the shallow goal of getting laid

3531
03:43:54,880 --> 03:43:55,520
I wonder

3532
03:43:56,480 --> 03:43:57,760
because it's very possible

3533
03:43:57,760 --> 03:43:59,360
that like just the roughness

3534
03:43:59,360 --> 03:44:02,560
with which they treat intellectually

3535
03:44:02,560 --> 03:44:04,160
women that might lead to

3536
03:44:04,720 --> 03:44:05,440
lower success

3537
03:44:05,440 --> 03:44:06,560
not higher success.

3538
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:07,920
It's very adversarial

3539
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:09,120
which I think is always disappointing

3540
03:44:09,120 --> 03:44:10,400
anything that talks about men and women

3541
03:44:10,400 --> 03:44:12,160
I think it's good to acknowledge differences

3542
03:44:12,160 --> 03:44:13,920
but when it becomes like adversarial

3543
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:15,280
especially when you talk about sex

3544
03:44:15,280 --> 03:44:16,720
sex is something that men are getting

3545
03:44:16,720 --> 03:44:18,160
and it's something that women are giving

3546
03:44:18,160 --> 03:44:19,200
and that type of like trade-off

3547
03:44:19,200 --> 03:44:20,560
and the way they talk about it is like

3548
03:44:20,560 --> 03:44:22,160
yeah it sets people against each other

3549
03:44:22,160 --> 03:44:23,280
in a really toxic way I think.

3550
03:44:24,960 --> 03:44:27,040
How do you talk to people from that world

3551
03:44:27,040 --> 03:44:28,320
from the red pill world

3552
03:44:28,320 --> 03:44:29,600
like would you would you ever talk to

3553
03:44:29,600 --> 03:44:30,880
like somebody like Andrew Tate?

3554
03:44:30,880 --> 03:44:32,080
Oh yeah if I had the chance to

3555
03:44:32,080 --> 03:44:33,680
I've been on the Fresh and Fit podcast

3556
03:44:33,680 --> 03:44:34,160
a few times

3557
03:44:34,160 --> 03:44:35,440
and then I've got a friend Sneeko

3558
03:44:35,440 --> 03:44:37,440
who's like very red pill that stuff

3559
03:44:39,280 --> 03:44:40,400
if I'm trying to talk to them

3560
03:44:40,400 --> 03:44:41,120
usually the

3561
03:44:42,080 --> 03:44:42,960
it's kind of like approaching it

3562
03:44:42,960 --> 03:44:43,920
like a scared cat

3563
03:44:43,920 --> 03:44:44,960
the first thing you have to do is like

3564
03:44:44,960 --> 03:44:46,160
be very gentle and say like

3565
03:44:46,160 --> 03:44:47,040
I understand your issues

3566
03:44:47,040 --> 03:44:47,920
I understand your complaints

3567
03:44:47,920 --> 03:44:49,040
I know that you're I'm scary

3568
03:44:49,040 --> 03:44:50,080
because you think I'm going to say like

3569
03:44:50,080 --> 03:44:51,760
toxic masculinity and feminism

3570
03:44:51,760 --> 03:44:53,280
and all these scary words at you

3571
03:44:53,840 --> 03:44:55,440
so the first thing is always to recognize it

3572
03:44:55,440 --> 03:44:56,880
like a lot of what they talk about

3573
03:44:56,880 --> 03:44:58,320
there are like true aspects

3574
03:44:58,320 --> 03:44:59,200
to what they're talking about

3575
03:44:59,200 --> 03:45:00,960
that people on the left won't recognize

3576
03:45:00,960 --> 03:45:03,760
so I think it's good to acknowledge those things

3577
03:45:03,760 --> 03:45:05,680
that like men and women are kind of different

3578
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:07,040
we do look for different things in general

3579
03:45:07,040 --> 03:45:08,000
when it comes to relationships

3580
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:08,800
it's okay to say that

3581
03:45:08,800 --> 03:45:10,320
it's not there's nothing bad there

3582
03:45:10,320 --> 03:45:11,280
and then it'll usually be like

3583
03:45:11,280 --> 03:45:12,320
once I've got your trust

3584
03:45:12,320 --> 03:45:13,520
and I'm in your bubble

3585
03:45:13,520 --> 03:45:15,600
like let's talk about the things that you want

3586
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:17,120
and maybe some of the strategies

3587
03:45:17,200 --> 03:45:18,560
that you're employing aren't necessarily

3588
03:45:18,560 --> 03:45:20,160
going to get you some of the things that you want

3589
03:45:20,160 --> 03:45:21,440
so for instance if you're really worried

3590
03:45:21,440 --> 03:45:22,800
about like shallow girls

3591
03:45:22,800 --> 03:45:23,680
like ruining your life

3592
03:45:23,680 --> 03:45:24,400
like Molina said

3593
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:26,960
it's probably not best to build your entire world view

3594
03:45:26,960 --> 03:45:28,160
around trying to get shallow girls

3595
03:45:28,160 --> 03:45:29,360
that are going to ruin your life

3596
03:45:29,360 --> 03:45:30,720
like if your way of attracting a girl

3597
03:45:30,720 --> 03:45:31,440
is to go to the gym

3598
03:45:31,440 --> 03:45:32,400
get a whole bunch of money

3599
03:45:32,400 --> 03:45:33,840
and try to like flaunt your wealth

3600
03:45:33,840 --> 03:45:34,560
as much as possible

3601
03:45:34,560 --> 03:45:36,240
you're going to be attracting the very same type of women

3602
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:37,120
that you're here like

3603
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:38,480
decrying on your stream

3604
03:45:38,480 --> 03:45:40,000
I think we talked about that on the podcast

3605
03:45:40,000 --> 03:45:41,520
like you probably want to have a woman

3606
03:45:41,520 --> 03:45:42,240
that's going to be there

3607
03:45:42,240 --> 03:45:43,200
if you lose your job

3608
03:45:43,200 --> 03:45:44,080
it's still there

3609
03:45:44,080 --> 03:45:45,520
like that cares about the things

3610
03:45:45,520 --> 03:45:46,800
that's not just your job

3611
03:45:47,760 --> 03:45:48,800
it's more stable

3612
03:45:48,800 --> 03:45:51,760
and also I don't help you become a great man

3613
03:45:52,720 --> 03:45:54,160
or a great like grow

3614
03:45:54,160 --> 03:45:55,680
like I feel like a great friendship

3615
03:45:55,680 --> 03:45:56,320
and a partnership

3616
03:45:56,880 --> 03:45:58,800
like it helps you make you a better person

3617
03:45:58,800 --> 03:46:00,240
some of the most successful people I know

3618
03:46:00,240 --> 03:46:01,360
I mean they have families

3619
03:46:01,360 --> 03:46:03,040
and there's clearly a dynamic there

3620
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:04,880
that's like that makes them

3621
03:46:04,880 --> 03:46:06,320
they wouldn't be that without

3622
03:46:06,320 --> 03:46:07,440
they're not an island yeah

3623
03:46:07,440 --> 03:46:10,080
yeah and the kids actually are a big part of that too

3624
03:46:10,080 --> 03:46:11,120
like for most people

3625
03:46:11,120 --> 03:46:12,800
if you're like a good parent

3626
03:46:12,800 --> 03:46:15,120
they make you step up somehow in life

3627
03:46:15,120 --> 03:46:16,720
you have to take responsibility for

3628
03:46:17,360 --> 03:46:18,560
getting your shit together

3629
03:46:18,560 --> 03:46:20,000
and excelling

3630
03:46:20,000 --> 03:46:20,720
in ways that

3631
03:46:22,560 --> 03:46:24,000
I guess the philosophy of the Red Bull

3632
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:25,040
does not quite get to

3633
03:46:25,040 --> 03:46:26,000
that's always an interesting

3634
03:46:26,000 --> 03:46:27,120
I think I've asked that a couple of times

3635
03:46:27,120 --> 03:46:27,920
where it's like

3636
03:46:27,920 --> 03:46:31,680
would you let your daughter date Andrew Tate

3637
03:46:31,680 --> 03:46:32,720
and it's always funny to watch them

3638
03:46:32,720 --> 03:46:34,080
kind of like squirm around

3639
03:46:34,080 --> 03:46:35,200
those answers sometimes

3640
03:46:35,200 --> 03:46:37,120
but see if they if they don't have a daughter

3641
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:39,280
like I you know I don't have a daughter

3642
03:46:39,280 --> 03:46:41,280
I think your whole philosophy changes

3643
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:42,320
once you have a daughter

3644
03:46:42,320 --> 03:46:42,960
sure

3645
03:46:42,960 --> 03:46:44,320
but even at that like they can

3646
03:46:44,320 --> 03:46:45,600
they know that what they're answering

3647
03:46:45,600 --> 03:46:46,720
they feel a little bit weird about it

3648
03:46:46,720 --> 03:46:47,440
it's funny to watch them

3649
03:46:47,440 --> 03:46:48,480
like they even they know it's like

3650
03:46:48,480 --> 03:46:49,760
ah fuck you know

3651
03:46:49,760 --> 03:46:51,040
well they might say like

3652
03:46:51,040 --> 03:46:52,480
I want my daughter to date

3653
03:46:52,480 --> 03:46:53,680
like a high value male

3654
03:46:54,400 --> 03:46:56,240
to the degree that he's a high value male

3655
03:46:56,240 --> 03:46:56,480
yes

3656
03:46:57,120 --> 03:46:58,960
but like I don't think you'll feel that way

3657
03:46:58,960 --> 03:47:00,800
the definition of high value changes

3658
03:47:00,800 --> 03:47:02,240
completely for sure

3659
03:47:02,240 --> 03:47:03,440
certainly the stereotypical

3660
03:47:04,320 --> 03:47:05,840
measures of value contribute to the

3661
03:47:05,840 --> 03:47:06,400
calculation

3662
03:47:06,400 --> 03:47:07,760
but it's so much more than that

3663
03:47:07,760 --> 03:47:09,920
I think the chemistry of the whole thing is

3664
03:47:09,920 --> 03:47:11,040
is bigger

3665
03:47:11,040 --> 03:47:13,680
you've also mentioned about body count

3666
03:47:13,680 --> 03:47:16,560
you guys both have a high body count

3667
03:47:16,560 --> 03:47:17,920
this body count matter

3668
03:47:17,920 --> 03:47:18,960
or it depends

3669
03:47:18,960 --> 03:47:19,680
like like you said

3670
03:47:19,680 --> 03:47:21,520
it's low in some people's eyes

3671
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:23,040
it's high in other people's eyes

3672
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:24,800
does body count matter in relationships

3673
03:47:24,800 --> 03:47:25,760
it's the past matter

3674
03:47:26,560 --> 03:47:27,840
well the past matters

3675
03:47:27,840 --> 03:47:28,800
I don't think body count

3676
03:47:28,800 --> 03:47:29,840
not to me I don't really care

3677
03:47:29,840 --> 03:47:30,960
not just as it is no

3678
03:47:32,240 --> 03:47:33,040
I mean it could be

3679
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:33,760
the past does

3680
03:47:33,760 --> 03:47:34,320
yeah

3681
03:47:34,320 --> 03:47:35,920
well the past is who you are right

3682
03:47:35,920 --> 03:47:36,800
like somebody tells me like

3683
03:47:36,800 --> 03:47:38,160
they have a 200 body count

3684
03:47:38,160 --> 03:47:39,200
and they're 16

3685
03:47:39,200 --> 03:47:40,400
something's probably going on there

3686
03:47:40,400 --> 03:47:41,120
that's not good

3687
03:47:41,120 --> 03:47:42,240
I was thinking about that too like

3688
03:47:42,320 --> 03:47:43,840
because it could be like really young people

3689
03:47:43,840 --> 03:47:45,440
that are having some sort of

3690
03:47:45,440 --> 03:47:47,120
like mental problems going on

3691
03:47:47,120 --> 03:47:48,880
or somebody's like 45

3692
03:47:48,880 --> 03:47:50,240
and they've like never had sex before

3693
03:47:50,240 --> 03:47:51,520
there's probably something going on right

3694
03:47:51,520 --> 03:47:52,320
so it could be indicative

3695
03:47:52,320 --> 03:47:53,520
but if somebody's like in their 20s

3696
03:47:53,520 --> 03:47:54,640
and they've had sex with you know

3697
03:47:54,640 --> 03:47:56,080
100 people or 50 people or whatever

3698
03:47:56,080 --> 03:47:56,960
it's you know whatever

3699
03:47:56,960 --> 03:47:58,320
there's more experience

3700
03:47:58,320 --> 03:47:59,360
which can be good

3701
03:47:59,360 --> 03:48:00,000
sure

3702
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:01,520
okay so that just represents

3703
03:48:01,520 --> 03:48:03,360
your like sexually open

3704
03:48:03,360 --> 03:48:05,760
and so it doesn't really necessarily mean any kind of

3705
03:48:06,320 --> 03:48:07,040
not necessarily

3706
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:07,840
it could though

3707
03:48:07,840 --> 03:48:09,280
the number alone doesn't mean anything

3708
03:48:09,840 --> 03:48:10,400
yeah

3709
03:48:10,400 --> 03:48:11,280
okay

3710
03:48:11,280 --> 03:48:12,720
well you could meet a guy that's like

3711
03:48:12,720 --> 03:48:13,680
I just really really like

3712
03:48:13,680 --> 03:48:14,800
want to fuck a lot of people

3713
03:48:14,800 --> 03:48:16,160
because it makes me so cool

3714
03:48:16,160 --> 03:48:17,680
like you're gonna be someone like that

3715
03:48:17,680 --> 03:48:18,160
which is like

3716
03:48:18,720 --> 03:48:19,760
so the body count doesn't matter

3717
03:48:19,760 --> 03:48:20,880
but like where it comes from

3718
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:21,920
like yeah like why

3719
03:48:21,920 --> 03:48:23,840
why have you slept with the people you slept with

3720
03:48:23,840 --> 03:48:24,480
yes

3721
03:48:24,480 --> 03:48:26,000
does it hurt like the romantic aspect

3722
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:26,800
of the relationship

3723
03:48:26,800 --> 03:48:28,720
knowing that there's a lot of people in the past

3724
03:48:29,280 --> 03:48:29,600
I don't know

3725
03:48:29,600 --> 03:48:30,240
not for us

3726
03:48:30,240 --> 03:48:31,040
no

3727
03:48:31,040 --> 03:48:33,200
is the part of the relationship fundamentally romantic

3728
03:48:33,920 --> 03:48:34,320
for us?

3729
03:48:34,320 --> 03:48:34,960
for us yeah

3730
03:48:34,960 --> 03:48:35,520
yeah

3731
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:36,320
okay

3732
03:48:37,760 --> 03:48:38,080
what?

3733
03:48:39,040 --> 03:48:40,800
you come out for such a cold person

3734
03:48:40,800 --> 03:48:42,080
no I was just in my head thinking

3735
03:48:42,080 --> 03:48:44,080
I wanted to just say gotcha right there

3736
03:48:45,760 --> 03:48:46,960
it's so judgmental

3737
03:48:46,960 --> 03:48:48,320
I think when it comes to the sex thing

3738
03:48:48,320 --> 03:48:49,920
there's always like the way that I explain it is

3739
03:48:49,920 --> 03:48:50,640
and I understand like

3740
03:48:51,680 --> 03:48:52,400
I have to say this

3741
03:48:52,400 --> 03:48:54,640
because I don't advocate for what I do for everybody

3742
03:48:54,640 --> 03:48:55,680
or what she does for everybody

3743
03:48:55,680 --> 03:48:57,360
because obviously there's a whole bunch of

3744
03:48:57,360 --> 03:48:58,480
natural feelings of jealousy

3745
03:48:58,480 --> 03:48:59,680
that pop up for a lot of people

3746
03:49:00,240 --> 03:49:01,040
but when people ask me

3747
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:01,760
you know it's always like

3748
03:49:01,760 --> 03:49:02,960
oh like isn't this like horrible

3749
03:49:02,960 --> 03:49:04,080
that you guys are doing this

3750
03:49:04,080 --> 03:49:04,880
and you don't love each other

3751
03:49:05,440 --> 03:49:06,560
from my perspective

3752
03:49:06,560 --> 03:49:08,480
I can have sex with like any person

3753
03:49:08,480 --> 03:49:09,200
and it can be sex

3754
03:49:09,200 --> 03:49:10,560
like that's not like a special thing

3755
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:11,360
between two people

3756
03:49:11,360 --> 03:49:11,920
in my eyes

3757
03:49:11,920 --> 03:49:13,360
it's like anybody can have sex

3758
03:49:13,360 --> 03:49:15,440
but there are like certain activities

3759
03:49:15,440 --> 03:49:17,280
and ways that you can spend time with each other

3760
03:49:17,280 --> 03:49:18,560
where you're like carving out these like

3761
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:19,680
precious little moments in time

3762
03:49:19,680 --> 03:49:20,480
with a certain person

3763
03:49:20,480 --> 03:49:22,640
that can do things that are special to that person

3764
03:49:22,640 --> 03:49:24,160
and those are the kind of like events

3765
03:49:24,160 --> 03:49:26,320
that I remember more than anything else

3766
03:49:26,320 --> 03:49:28,160
so like the idea of like

3767
03:49:28,160 --> 03:49:29,520
like oh wow I had sex with a person

3768
03:49:29,520 --> 03:49:30,480
that was so special

3769
03:49:30,480 --> 03:49:32,320
doesn't mean as much as like you know

3770
03:49:32,320 --> 03:49:34,160
us traveling to like New Zealand

3771
03:49:34,160 --> 03:49:35,360
or sharing some special moment

3772
03:49:35,360 --> 03:49:36,720
doing like some really fun activity

3773
03:49:36,720 --> 03:49:37,680
or event or whatever

3774
03:49:37,680 --> 03:49:38,800
that's usually how I like it I am

3775
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:41,200
so a shared intimate moment

3776
03:49:41,200 --> 03:49:41,840
yeah

3777
03:49:41,840 --> 03:49:42,720
I kind of agree

3778
03:49:42,720 --> 03:49:44,720
but I can definitely connect the romance with sex

3779
03:49:44,720 --> 03:49:45,120
boring

3780
03:49:46,240 --> 03:49:47,440
I'm curious why you can't do it

3781
03:49:47,440 --> 03:49:48,400
see that's where the red pill's right

3782
03:49:49,600 --> 03:49:50,080
that's exactly

3783
03:49:50,080 --> 03:49:51,840
we've also talked about misogyny

3784
03:49:51,840 --> 03:49:54,400
which is you're clearly the embodiment of that

3785
03:49:54,400 --> 03:49:55,440
what were you saying

3786
03:49:55,440 --> 03:49:57,920
so there's some there's a connection between romance and

3787
03:49:57,920 --> 03:49:59,280
yeah I think it is

3788
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:01,360
because I think sex could be a lot of things

3789
03:50:01,360 --> 03:50:01,600
right

3790
03:50:02,720 --> 03:50:04,640
it's it's some sort of bonding

3791
03:50:04,640 --> 03:50:05,920
I'd say in some way

3792
03:50:06,560 --> 03:50:08,400
they say that you really like BDSM

3793
03:50:08,800 --> 03:50:11,280
you kind of like you become submissive to someone

3794
03:50:11,280 --> 03:50:12,560
or you take control over someone

3795
03:50:12,560 --> 03:50:15,200
it's like a very bonding like intimate moment

3796
03:50:15,200 --> 03:50:15,600
I'd say

3797
03:50:16,240 --> 03:50:17,040
and that's romantic

3798
03:50:17,040 --> 03:50:17,920
the intimacy is romantic

3799
03:50:17,920 --> 03:50:18,960
I think it is

3800
03:50:18,960 --> 03:50:20,880
if you can show yourself as really submissive

3801
03:50:20,880 --> 03:50:21,680
or like weak

3802
03:50:21,680 --> 03:50:23,840
or you have like absolutely no control over yourself

3803
03:50:23,840 --> 03:50:25,280
and you let someone else do it

3804
03:50:25,280 --> 03:50:27,040
or you are the one being that like

3805
03:50:27,040 --> 03:50:28,400
you are the dominant for someone

3806
03:50:28,400 --> 03:50:30,320
I think that's a really like intimate thing

3807
03:50:30,320 --> 03:50:33,040
because you show like the weakest part of yourself

3808
03:50:33,040 --> 03:50:33,920
kind of

3809
03:50:33,920 --> 03:50:35,360
I just feel like I personally

3810
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:39,680
to me some component romantic but to me

3811
03:50:39,680 --> 03:50:40,880
this is not judging to others

3812
03:50:40,880 --> 03:50:41,520
to me

3813
03:50:41,520 --> 03:50:42,720
maybe his haul is brought up

3814
03:50:44,560 --> 03:50:45,840
the romance increases

3815
03:50:46,400 --> 03:50:49,280
if the number of intimate interactions

3816
03:50:50,000 --> 03:50:51,280
are limited to one person

3817
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:54,080
like for me for some reason

3818
03:50:55,040 --> 03:50:56,000
spreading it out

3819
03:50:57,680 --> 03:50:58,480
decreases

3820
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:01,920
like exponentially

3821
03:51:01,920 --> 03:51:03,920
the the feeling of romance you feel

3822
03:51:04,240 --> 03:51:06,240
I don't know what that that could be just like

3823
03:51:06,240 --> 03:51:09,040
sort of having grown up in the Soviet Union

3824
03:51:09,040 --> 03:51:11,520
there's a kind of there's the fairy tale stories

3825
03:51:11,520 --> 03:51:13,680
and you're kind of maybe living through them

3826
03:51:14,640 --> 03:51:16,400
yeah I mean I think what you're saying is like really normal

3827
03:51:16,400 --> 03:51:17,760
like most people probably show that way

3828
03:51:17,760 --> 03:51:18,160
yeah

3829
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:21,120
but but because you guys are able to successfully not do that

3830
03:51:21,120 --> 03:51:24,160
I just want to question my own understanding of it

3831
03:51:24,160 --> 03:51:24,640
you know

3832
03:51:24,640 --> 03:51:25,120
like

3833
03:51:25,120 --> 03:51:26,320
like why is that

3834
03:51:26,320 --> 03:51:26,880
why is that

3835
03:51:26,880 --> 03:51:30,240
like am I being very jealous for no reason

3836
03:51:30,240 --> 03:51:33,760
like maybe you can maximize the number of intimate experiences

3837
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:36,480
if you just open up and let go of the jealousy essentially

3838
03:51:36,480 --> 03:51:38,000
I think I feel like in Sweden

3839
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:38,960
and like in Scandinavia

3840
03:51:38,960 --> 03:51:41,120
we're extremely just sexually open

3841
03:51:41,120 --> 03:51:42,000
like in general

3842
03:51:42,000 --> 03:51:44,080
we're not like super religious either

3843
03:51:44,080 --> 03:51:45,680
we're very like relaxed

3844
03:51:45,680 --> 03:51:48,080
we don't like we don't feel bad about ourselves

3845
03:51:48,080 --> 03:51:49,840
like it's just like a different sort of thing

3846
03:51:49,840 --> 03:51:51,840
and I would say like it's we're more progressive

3847
03:51:51,840 --> 03:51:53,680
when it comes to feminism and stuff

3848
03:51:53,680 --> 03:51:55,040
so it's more common

3849
03:51:55,040 --> 03:51:56,960
they will meet women with a higher body count

3850
03:51:56,960 --> 03:51:58,960
than like when I meet like American girls

3851
03:51:58,960 --> 03:52:00,480
all of them I have like vaginisma

3852
03:52:00,480 --> 03:52:02,480
like super suppressed like sexually and

3853
03:52:03,200 --> 03:52:04,240
where did you just use

3854
03:52:04,240 --> 03:52:06,240
they have like issues to like

3855
03:52:06,240 --> 03:52:07,600
they can't relax during sex

3856
03:52:07,600 --> 03:52:08,560
so it just hurts for them

3857
03:52:08,560 --> 03:52:09,120
vaginismus

3858
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:09,680
so they get really nervous

3859
03:52:09,680 --> 03:52:10,240
vaginismus

3860
03:52:10,240 --> 03:52:11,040
is that what it's called yeah

3861
03:52:12,240 --> 03:52:13,680
so like I meet so many girls

3862
03:52:13,680 --> 03:52:15,760
that are having like a lot of issues

3863
03:52:15,760 --> 03:52:16,640
with sex

3864
03:52:16,640 --> 03:52:18,160
and they have like a very low body count

3865
03:52:18,160 --> 03:52:19,760
because they just can't relax

3866
03:52:19,760 --> 03:52:21,200
or they yeah

3867
03:52:21,200 --> 03:52:21,760
and it's probably

3868
03:52:21,760 --> 03:52:23,920
and usually they come from like a very religious background

3869
03:52:24,560 --> 03:52:25,680
so they have just been told

3870
03:52:25,680 --> 03:52:26,720
like you cannot wear that

3871
03:52:26,720 --> 03:52:27,840
you cannot be like that

3872
03:52:27,840 --> 03:52:29,280
you can't like you know

3873
03:52:29,280 --> 03:52:31,200
and like where I grew up

3874
03:52:31,200 --> 03:52:32,160
it wasn't like that at all

3875
03:52:32,480 --> 03:52:34,160
but you see it as more like a casual thing

3876
03:52:35,040 --> 03:52:36,560
so then you can just maximize

3877
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:39,760
the awesomeness of the experience

3878
03:52:39,760 --> 03:52:41,360
yeah I guess I don't have trouble with it

3879
03:52:41,360 --> 03:52:41,840
exactly

3880
03:52:41,840 --> 03:52:43,600
I think the important thing I think

3881
03:52:43,600 --> 03:52:44,560
for everybody to realize

3882
03:52:44,560 --> 03:52:46,640
is there's always pros and cons to everything

3883
03:52:46,640 --> 03:52:48,640
like my lifestyle like

3884
03:52:48,640 --> 03:52:50,080
obviously I get to have a lot of fun experiences

3885
03:52:50,080 --> 03:52:51,120
that's like a huge pro

3886
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:52,080
and that's super cool

3887
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:53,600
and if you're like a more monogamy

3888
03:52:53,600 --> 03:52:54,160
brain person

3889
03:52:54,160 --> 03:52:55,600
you're not going to get those experiences

3890
03:52:55,600 --> 03:52:57,200
but if you're a monogamy brain person

3891
03:52:57,200 --> 03:52:58,400
like when you're sharing that special

3892
03:52:58,400 --> 03:52:59,680
woman at home with somebody else

3893
03:52:59,680 --> 03:53:01,840
like that moment could be really really really special

3894
03:53:01,840 --> 03:53:03,840
because now it's the thing that you're showing yourself

3895
03:53:03,840 --> 03:53:05,120
and open yourself up to another person

3896
03:53:05,120 --> 03:53:06,640
and they're only trusting you to do that

3897
03:53:06,640 --> 03:53:07,840
and that's like a really special thing

3898
03:53:07,840 --> 03:53:09,840
that only the two of you are showing with each other

3899
03:53:09,840 --> 03:53:11,760
so I mean like there's always like pros and cons to everything

3900
03:53:11,760 --> 03:53:13,440
like I think we both would say like

3901
03:53:13,440 --> 03:53:15,520
like doing an open relationship is probably not

3902
03:53:15,520 --> 03:53:16,960
like we would not recommend it

3903
03:53:17,520 --> 03:53:18,800
yeah I don't think we would no

3904
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:22,160
yeah I recently fasted for three days

3905
03:53:22,160 --> 03:53:24,320
and I ate a chicken breast at the end of that

3906
03:53:24,320 --> 03:53:26,800
and it was like the most delicious food I've ever eaten

3907
03:53:27,920 --> 03:53:29,600
so like there's some aspect of fasting

3908
03:53:29,600 --> 03:53:31,280
and scarcity and so on that

3909
03:53:31,280 --> 03:53:33,600
like you have to figure out what for your own psyche

3910
03:53:33,600 --> 03:53:34,400
what works the best

3911
03:53:34,400 --> 03:53:35,920
it's good to be a little bored or like

3912
03:53:35,920 --> 03:53:37,920
not do something or like work

3913
03:53:37,920 --> 03:53:39,360
because you can just enjoy the time

3914
03:53:39,360 --> 03:53:40,880
when you're doing something really fun

3915
03:53:40,880 --> 03:53:42,880
it's more fun otherwise you're just going to get numb

3916
03:53:42,880 --> 03:53:44,080
in general with everything

3917
03:53:44,080 --> 03:53:44,720
yeah

3918
03:53:44,720 --> 03:53:46,640
yeah I personally just never get bored

3919
03:53:46,640 --> 03:53:48,960
like I guess the the boring thing is exciting to me

3920
03:53:49,680 --> 03:53:50,880
the just like

3921
03:53:50,880 --> 03:53:53,920
you're like me because you say everything I like is boring

3922
03:53:54,800 --> 03:53:56,880
I gotta ask you we talked about misogyny

3923
03:53:56,880 --> 03:53:59,120
in the he's trying to battle it out on the internet

3924
03:53:59,840 --> 03:54:02,880
what's your what's your sense as a woman

3925
03:54:03,680 --> 03:54:06,160
about the level of misogyny on the internet

3926
03:54:06,160 --> 03:54:07,920
in the streaming community and how to fight it

3927
03:54:08,880 --> 03:54:12,080
for me because I get I guess I get it every single day

3928
03:54:12,080 --> 03:54:14,240
somehow like because I haven't online

3929
03:54:14,240 --> 03:54:16,560
like I have a chat that goes that's live right

3930
03:54:16,560 --> 03:54:18,960
and but I have like mods moderating that all the time

3931
03:54:18,960 --> 03:54:20,480
so I don't really need to see much of it

3932
03:54:20,480 --> 03:54:22,000
I think it's just pretty annoying

3933
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:24,720
because you get to like see it all the time

3934
03:54:26,000 --> 03:54:27,520
so it's become like background noise

3935
03:54:28,240 --> 03:54:31,840
yeah a little bit and it's like the same commons over and over again

3936
03:54:31,840 --> 03:54:34,880
but it's usually for me I don't personally care that much

3937
03:54:34,880 --> 03:54:36,080
I understand that other people do

3938
03:54:36,080 --> 03:54:37,760
especially when it comes into like

3939
03:54:37,760 --> 03:54:39,440
when there's like a lot of sexism and stuff

3940
03:54:40,080 --> 03:54:43,360
and when there's a lot of like men not taking women seriously

3941
03:54:43,360 --> 03:54:44,480
like I definitely get that

3942
03:54:44,480 --> 03:54:46,400
and I used to get that even more like a few years ago

3943
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:48,240
with my accent and everything

3944
03:54:48,240 --> 03:54:50,320
and like I used to be blonde as well like a few months ago

3945
03:54:50,320 --> 03:54:52,640
so I feel like people wouldn't take me seriously because of that

3946
03:54:53,280 --> 03:54:54,640
that's a bit annoying

3947
03:54:54,640 --> 03:54:57,760
but I feel like it's pretty easy to like see through

3948
03:54:57,760 --> 03:54:58,960
when someone acts that way

3949
03:54:58,960 --> 03:55:00,560
and for me personally I don't really care

3950
03:55:00,560 --> 03:55:03,600
but it's a bit annoying like being online

3951
03:55:03,600 --> 03:55:05,280
and like getting stuff every single day

3952
03:55:05,840 --> 03:55:07,600
it would say like the probably the worst thing is

3953
03:55:08,480 --> 03:55:11,440
when you feel like you put in a lot of effort into some sort of work

3954
03:55:12,160 --> 03:55:13,520
everyone is just going to say

3955
03:55:13,520 --> 03:55:16,240
you just got that because you're a woman and you're attractive

3956
03:55:16,240 --> 03:55:18,720
and that's that's probably like the worst thing

3957
03:55:18,720 --> 03:55:20,400
is there a way to fight that you think

3958
03:55:20,400 --> 03:55:21,360
yeah I don't think you can

3959
03:55:21,360 --> 03:55:22,800
I think it just comes up all the time

3960
03:55:23,680 --> 03:55:24,800
it is what it is I guess

3961
03:55:24,800 --> 03:55:26,240
you're just gonna keep doing whatever you do

3962
03:55:26,240 --> 03:55:28,800
and like not let it like emotionally control you somehow

3963
03:55:28,800 --> 03:55:30,880
I think having more women in those spaces is always good

3964
03:55:30,880 --> 03:55:31,680
it's probably good yeah

3965
03:55:31,680 --> 03:55:33,760
like a lot of the guys you can tell online that they don't ever

3966
03:55:33,760 --> 03:55:35,360
don't bring on the worst ones then

3967
03:55:35,360 --> 03:55:36,320
see she's being this

3968
03:55:36,320 --> 03:55:37,600
did you see she just did it

3969
03:55:37,600 --> 03:55:38,720
she did the misogyny thing

3970
03:55:39,520 --> 03:55:40,720
by having some bad women on

3971
03:55:40,720 --> 03:55:42,320
she's saying all women see you

3972
03:55:42,320 --> 03:55:44,000
well you you know it's true

3973
03:55:45,280 --> 03:55:46,000
right

3974
03:55:46,000 --> 03:55:47,520
see but I just agree with you

3975
03:55:47,520 --> 03:55:50,320
and I'm older than both of you and therefore wiser right

3976
03:55:50,320 --> 03:55:50,880
so

3977
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:52,000
well combined we're older than you

3978
03:55:52,000 --> 03:55:52,720
I think we're wonderful

3979
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:54,960
we're one fully matronomy

3980
03:55:54,960 --> 03:55:56,160
yeah we've got combined age

3981
03:55:57,280 --> 03:55:58,720
or it could be it could be the same thing

3982
03:55:58,720 --> 03:56:00,240
it was like also the age thing

3983
03:56:00,240 --> 03:56:01,200
and like the woman thing

3984
03:56:01,200 --> 03:56:02,640
a lot of people think that I'm just copying

3985
03:56:02,640 --> 03:56:04,000
every single thing that he says

3986
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:05,280
which I think is a bit annoying as well

3987
03:56:05,280 --> 03:56:06,400
so I can never really like

3988
03:56:06,400 --> 03:56:07,600
a sonic user of that one

3989
03:56:07,600 --> 03:56:09,120
yeah which has been annoying

3990
03:56:09,120 --> 03:56:09,680
so much you know

3991
03:56:10,400 --> 03:56:11,840
it was about the defunding police

3992
03:56:11,840 --> 03:56:12,880
like my dad is a cop

3993
03:56:12,880 --> 03:56:16,160
friendship camaraderie and love and respect

3994
03:56:16,160 --> 03:56:19,280
which you both have had for a time

3995
03:56:19,280 --> 03:56:21,360
and have lost and I would like you to regain it

3996
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:23,120
let's try to increase

3997
03:56:23,120 --> 03:56:25,040
not decrease the amount of love in this space

3998
03:56:25,040 --> 03:56:26,000
what do you think about

3999
03:56:26,000 --> 03:56:27,360
some of the harshness of this

4000
03:56:27,360 --> 03:56:29,120
of his language which we talked about

4001
03:56:30,480 --> 03:56:31,840
our word in the past

4002
03:56:31,840 --> 03:56:32,960
when you used n word

4003
03:56:33,760 --> 03:56:34,720
all of that kind of stuff

4004
03:56:34,720 --> 03:56:36,000
when he what he used to do

4005
03:56:36,000 --> 03:56:36,320
I mean

4006
03:56:36,880 --> 03:56:38,000
no like what do you think about it

4007
03:56:38,000 --> 03:56:39,200
like do you give him advice

4008
03:56:39,200 --> 03:56:41,200
to not speak a certain way

4009
03:56:41,200 --> 03:56:42,960
no like a little more civility

4010
03:56:42,960 --> 03:56:44,880
I'm just trying to get a second opinion on this

4011
03:56:44,880 --> 03:56:45,680
second opinion about

4012
03:56:45,680 --> 03:56:47,120
nor many people not internet people

4013
03:56:47,120 --> 03:56:48,720
are way more extreme than

4014
03:56:48,720 --> 03:56:49,520
yeah

4015
03:56:49,520 --> 03:56:50,560
she's way more extreme

4016
03:56:50,560 --> 03:56:52,000
no that's not true

4017
03:56:52,000 --> 03:56:53,840
okay so okay so here's thing for me okay

4018
03:56:54,400 --> 03:56:57,040
I was not online until three years ago

4019
03:56:57,040 --> 03:56:57,600
at all

4020
03:56:57,600 --> 03:56:58,880
like I would watch youtube

4021
03:56:58,880 --> 03:57:00,480
that's pretty much all I would do

4022
03:57:00,480 --> 03:57:01,680
I wouldn't do anything else

4023
03:57:01,680 --> 03:57:02,720
really I didn't

4024
03:57:02,720 --> 03:57:04,080
grew up playing video games or anything

4025
03:57:04,640 --> 03:57:06,240
so I'm like extremely new to everything

4026
03:57:07,840 --> 03:57:10,240
so when I came into this world

4027
03:57:10,240 --> 03:57:12,640
and I started seeing clips from him in the past

4028
03:57:12,640 --> 03:57:14,320
I don't think I really had much of an opinion

4029
03:57:14,320 --> 03:57:15,360
because it just sounded like

4030
03:57:15,360 --> 03:57:17,200
it was just a different like words that we were using

4031
03:57:17,200 --> 03:57:18,480
but it didn't mean anything

4032
03:57:18,480 --> 03:57:19,120
that's what it feels like

4033
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:19,920
it was just like

4034
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:21,520
if you're saying the R word

4035
03:57:21,520 --> 03:57:23,120
it's because you just want to call someone stupid

4036
03:57:23,120 --> 03:57:24,960
but you want to like do it a little bit more

4037
03:57:24,960 --> 03:57:26,080
like but it's not like

4038
03:57:26,080 --> 03:57:27,200
it didn't feel like it was like a

4039
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:28,960
it's not like racist more like

4040
03:57:28,960 --> 03:57:29,600
yeah I'm not

4041
03:57:29,600 --> 03:57:30,400
you know it's not

4042
03:57:30,400 --> 03:57:32,000
agreement on this side here right

4043
03:57:32,720 --> 03:57:34,400
so like if he was saying the F word

4044
03:57:34,400 --> 03:57:36,640
because it was just like a word to like

4045
03:57:36,640 --> 03:57:37,680
insult someone

4046
03:57:37,680 --> 03:57:39,520
and he was like I don't think he was ever

4047
03:57:39,520 --> 03:57:41,040
I don't think you were ever homophobic

4048
03:57:41,040 --> 03:57:42,080
back in the day or anything like that

4049
03:57:42,080 --> 03:57:43,680
but I think it was just like a way

4050
03:57:43,680 --> 03:57:45,840
to express yourself maybe back then

4051
03:57:45,840 --> 03:57:46,880
I don't know I didn't do it

4052
03:57:46,880 --> 03:57:48,160
there's no videos of me or anything

4053
03:57:48,160 --> 03:57:49,440
because I wasn't even online back then

4054
03:57:49,680 --> 03:57:50,880
yeah so my case was

4055
03:57:50,880 --> 03:57:52,800
I definitely don't think

4056
03:57:52,800 --> 03:57:54,800
Stephen is homophobic or racer

4057
03:57:54,800 --> 03:57:55,680
any of those obviously

4058
03:57:55,680 --> 03:57:56,400
so the

4059
03:57:56,400 --> 03:57:57,520
there's a good heart there

4060
03:57:58,160 --> 03:57:59,200
and a good mind

4061
03:57:59,200 --> 03:58:00,160
I was just saying

4062
03:58:00,160 --> 03:58:01,200
he just likes being mean

4063
03:58:02,080 --> 03:58:03,120
well there is some

4064
03:58:03,120 --> 03:58:04,160
you lose yourself

4065
03:58:04,160 --> 03:58:05,760
and forget the bigger picture that

4066
03:58:06,320 --> 03:58:07,280
he's pushing for

4067
03:58:07,920 --> 03:58:09,680
more effective discourse on the internet

4068
03:58:09,680 --> 03:58:11,280
he's like an inspiration to a lot of people

4069
03:58:11,280 --> 03:58:12,000
especially now

4070
03:58:12,560 --> 03:58:14,160
of like how you can use effective

4071
03:58:14,160 --> 03:58:16,160
conversation to make for a better world

4072
03:58:16,160 --> 03:58:18,080
to derive a variety of glass people

4073
03:58:18,080 --> 03:58:20,320
and so on and then you lose some of that power

4074
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:22,320
by losing yourself

4075
03:58:23,120 --> 03:58:24,880
in like the language

4076
03:58:24,880 --> 03:58:26,400
just more language of emotion

4077
03:58:26,400 --> 03:58:28,400
versus effective communication

4078
03:58:28,400 --> 03:58:28,800
I would say

4079
03:58:28,800 --> 03:58:30,400
but it's a gray area

4080
03:58:30,400 --> 03:58:31,200
I would say like something

4081
03:58:31,200 --> 03:58:32,960
that is probably recently done in that case

4082
03:58:32,960 --> 03:58:34,800
because it's been joking about women a lot

4083
03:58:35,520 --> 03:58:36,880
like it's women's fault they're bad

4084
03:58:36,880 --> 03:58:38,640
like it's just it's been like

4085
03:58:38,640 --> 03:58:40,240
a lot of jokes when it comes to misogyny

4086
03:58:40,240 --> 03:58:41,600
I guess in your community

4087
03:58:41,600 --> 03:58:42,720
and I think it's actually

4088
03:58:42,720 --> 03:58:44,000
turned people a little bit that way

4089
03:58:44,000 --> 03:58:45,280
that's why we've done the recent

4090
03:58:45,280 --> 03:58:45,440
misogyny

4091
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:47,440
yes so that I guess that's actually

4092
03:58:47,440 --> 03:58:49,280
true because I don't think it was pretty

4093
03:58:49,280 --> 03:58:50,800
I don't think it was clear enough

4094
03:58:50,800 --> 03:58:51,760
I don't think it actually was

4095
03:58:51,760 --> 03:58:53,200
I think you did that mistake

4096
03:58:54,400 --> 03:58:55,920
but I think back then I was even saying

4097
03:58:55,920 --> 03:58:57,120
like hey you should probably not

4098
03:58:57,120 --> 03:58:59,200
like you probably should not do that

4099
03:59:00,080 --> 03:59:01,440
because it actually is pretty hard for me

4100
03:59:01,440 --> 03:59:02,960
because whenever I come into his community

4101
03:59:02,960 --> 03:59:04,000
like his chat

4102
03:59:04,000 --> 03:59:04,960
people are just going to spam

4103
03:59:04,960 --> 03:59:05,840
it's like a woman moment

4104
03:59:05,840 --> 03:59:07,440
it's a woman moment whenever I say something

4105
03:59:07,440 --> 03:59:08,400
and it's kind of like

4106
03:59:08,400 --> 03:59:10,400
yeah it's getting pretty annoying as I said

4107
03:59:10,400 --> 03:59:12,320
it's just annoying when you see it every single day

4108
03:59:13,200 --> 03:59:13,600
yeah

4109
03:59:13,600 --> 03:59:14,080
there you go

4110
03:59:14,640 --> 03:59:16,240
wisdom from somebody younger than you

4111
03:59:16,960 --> 03:59:17,760
wisdom can come from

4112
03:59:18,400 --> 03:59:19,200
all kind of people

4113
03:59:19,200 --> 03:59:19,840
yeah of course

4114
03:59:19,840 --> 03:59:21,440
just sometimes at very limited quantities

4115
03:59:21,440 --> 03:59:22,240
depends on the age

4116
03:59:23,600 --> 03:59:25,120
and learn something from anybody

4117
03:59:25,120 --> 03:59:27,360
what advice would you give to young people

4118
03:59:27,360 --> 03:59:28,160
the both of you

4119
03:59:29,280 --> 03:59:31,440
that you have both audiences

4120
03:59:31,440 --> 03:59:32,800
where young people look up to you

4121
03:59:33,360 --> 03:59:34,080
in general

4122
03:59:34,080 --> 03:59:36,320
if you were to give advice to somebody in high school

4123
03:59:36,320 --> 03:59:37,360
like how to

4124
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:40,480
create a life that can be proud of

4125
03:59:40,480 --> 03:59:41,120
what would you say

4126
03:59:42,720 --> 03:59:44,800
the most important thing that I've learned

4127
03:59:44,880 --> 03:59:47,120
is to view people as different

4128
03:59:47,120 --> 03:59:48,560
and not better or worse

4129
03:59:48,560 --> 03:59:49,680
and when you view people as different

4130
03:59:49,680 --> 03:59:50,880
instead of better or worse

4131
03:59:50,880 --> 03:59:52,800
you learn that there's almost something

4132
03:59:52,800 --> 03:59:53,920
that you can learn from anybody

4133
03:59:54,640 --> 03:59:55,760
like be open and empathetic

4134
03:59:55,760 --> 03:59:57,440
towards other people's experiences

4135
03:59:57,440 --> 03:59:59,920
nobody does anything by random choice

4136
03:59:59,920 --> 04:00:02,240
like there's always reasons why people act the way they do

4137
04:00:02,240 --> 04:00:04,000
and as long as you're willing to kind of like

4138
04:00:04,000 --> 04:00:07,200
be open and receptive to the lived experiences of other people

4139
04:00:07,200 --> 04:00:08,960
you're going to be able to gather information

4140
04:00:08,960 --> 04:00:11,360
and create like a more cohesive and better view of the world

4141
04:00:11,360 --> 04:00:12,400
than any of your peers will

4142
04:00:13,360 --> 04:00:16,080
Do you have any kind of advice you can give to young folks?

4143
04:00:16,080 --> 04:00:18,080
I feel like something that I see

4144
04:00:18,080 --> 04:00:19,520
especially in America a lot

4145
04:00:19,520 --> 04:00:21,120
is that a lot of people

4146
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:23,440
kind of get told what to do early on

4147
04:00:23,440 --> 04:00:24,480
like in high school

4148
04:00:24,480 --> 04:00:25,920
they're supposed to become this thing

4149
04:00:26,800 --> 04:00:27,760
like education wise

4150
04:00:27,760 --> 04:00:29,360
like they're supposed to like become a doctor

4151
04:00:29,360 --> 04:00:30,480
or this thing or whatever

4152
04:00:30,480 --> 04:00:31,840
and then they kind of just like give up on things

4153
04:00:31,840 --> 04:00:33,280
that they're actually passionate about

4154
04:00:33,280 --> 04:00:35,760
so I think a lot of teenagers get really confused

4155
04:00:35,760 --> 04:00:37,120
they get an education

4156
04:00:37,120 --> 04:00:38,240
and then they get that job

4157
04:00:38,240 --> 04:00:39,200
and they hate everything

4158
04:00:39,200 --> 04:00:40,080
and they think that

4159
04:00:40,640 --> 04:00:42,080
when they're reaching the job

4160
04:00:42,160 --> 04:00:43,280
when they're reaching like the journey

4161
04:00:43,280 --> 04:00:44,160
they're going to get happy

4162
04:00:44,160 --> 04:00:45,600
that's like where the happiness is going to be

4163
04:00:45,600 --> 04:00:47,440
but then when they get to there

4164
04:00:47,440 --> 04:00:48,640
they just hate everything

4165
04:00:48,640 --> 04:00:50,400
and then they become really depressed

4166
04:00:50,400 --> 04:00:51,840
and I've seen this so much

4167
04:00:51,840 --> 04:00:53,440
like I see this all the time

4168
04:00:53,440 --> 04:00:56,320
and it's pretty sad to me to see

4169
04:00:56,320 --> 04:00:58,160
so many people that are just wasting time

4170
04:00:58,160 --> 04:01:00,000
and then they just get really confused

4171
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:01,680
and I don't know

4172
04:01:01,680 --> 04:01:03,200
it's the same thing with relationships too

4173
04:01:03,200 --> 04:01:04,960
no one really knows what they want anymore

4174
04:01:04,960 --> 04:01:07,040
I feel like everyone is just kind of doing whatever

4175
04:01:07,040 --> 04:01:07,920
like society is saying

4176
04:01:07,920 --> 04:01:08,720
or the parents are saying

4177
04:01:08,720 --> 04:01:09,600
or their friends are saying

4178
04:01:10,560 --> 04:01:12,960
and they're never really doing anything

4179
04:01:12,960 --> 04:01:14,480
that's super meaningful anymore

4180
04:01:14,480 --> 04:01:16,000
and like they don't

4181
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:16,960
so what I would say is

4182
04:01:16,960 --> 04:01:18,160
like try to find something

4183
04:01:18,160 --> 04:01:19,840
that is important to you

4184
04:01:19,840 --> 04:01:20,880
it could be anything really

4185
04:01:20,880 --> 04:01:22,560
like some sort of passion

4186
04:01:22,560 --> 04:01:23,840
maybe like your friends

4187
04:01:23,840 --> 04:01:25,920
maybe like what matters to you

4188
04:01:25,920 --> 04:01:27,360
like figuring those things out

4189
04:01:27,360 --> 04:01:28,400
I think is really important

4190
04:01:28,400 --> 04:01:30,240
and that comes from being able to listen to

4191
04:01:30,240 --> 04:01:31,360
like some inner voice

4192
04:01:31,360 --> 04:01:32,640
so it's not gonna come from elsewhere

4193
04:01:32,640 --> 04:01:34,000
it's really hard because

4194
04:01:34,000 --> 04:01:34,960
you're living the life

4195
04:01:34,960 --> 04:01:36,480
and like there's things happening around you

4196
04:01:36,480 --> 04:01:37,360
and people tell you what to do

4197
04:01:37,360 --> 04:01:39,040
and what not to do and all you know

4198
04:01:39,040 --> 04:01:40,640
no one really has like their own opinions

4199
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:41,600
everyone is just kind of like

4200
04:01:42,320 --> 04:01:44,320
listening to the cooler thing

4201
04:01:44,320 --> 04:01:45,280
or you know

4202
04:01:45,280 --> 04:01:46,080
except Steven

4203
04:01:46,080 --> 04:01:47,440
he seems to stand on his own

4204
04:01:47,440 --> 04:01:47,920
travel

4205
04:01:47,920 --> 04:01:48,400
if we think

4206
04:01:48,400 --> 04:01:49,280
yeah I'd say so

4207
04:01:49,280 --> 04:01:49,600
and like

4208
04:01:49,600 --> 04:01:50,240
on hashtag

4209
04:01:50,240 --> 04:01:51,360
like something I realized too

4210
04:01:51,360 --> 04:01:52,880
like because we just went to TwitchCon

4211
04:01:52,880 --> 04:01:54,640
and we were talking to a lot of streamers

4212
04:01:54,640 --> 04:01:55,040
what was that

4213
04:01:56,000 --> 04:01:56,720
it was interesting

4214
04:01:56,720 --> 04:01:57,840
I thought it was interesting

4215
04:01:57,840 --> 04:02:00,960
because the few people that I feel like I

4216
04:02:00,960 --> 04:02:01,840
that seem really cool

4217
04:02:01,840 --> 04:02:04,240
and that I look up to like in the streaming world

4218
04:02:04,240 --> 04:02:05,680
all of them wants to quit streaming

4219
04:02:06,320 --> 04:02:07,280
all of them wants to do it

4220
04:02:07,280 --> 04:02:07,760
no one wants

4221
04:02:07,760 --> 04:02:08,960
like no one likes it

4222
04:02:08,960 --> 04:02:10,640
and they're so successful

4223
04:02:10,640 --> 04:02:13,200
like they are around successful people

4224
04:02:13,200 --> 04:02:15,280
they they're working every single day

4225
04:02:15,280 --> 04:02:15,840
they're working hard

4226
04:02:15,840 --> 04:02:17,520
they're making so much money

4227
04:02:17,520 --> 04:02:19,520
and everyone is just complaining

4228
04:02:19,520 --> 04:02:20,960
and like they're complaining about

4229
04:02:22,240 --> 04:02:25,040
like not being able to see their partner

4230
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:25,760
or you know

4231
04:02:25,760 --> 04:02:27,200
because they need to live somewhere else

4232
04:02:27,200 --> 04:02:28,880
because I see these things

4233
04:02:28,880 --> 04:02:30,720
and they seem extremely unhappy

4234
04:02:30,720 --> 04:02:33,040
and but it's so hard for them to just cut

4235
04:02:33,040 --> 04:02:35,040
all this successful stuff off

4236
04:02:35,040 --> 04:02:36,320
because that's like what you

4237
04:02:36,320 --> 04:02:37,840
you know learn to do

4238
04:02:38,480 --> 04:02:40,400
and that's like supposed to be like your happiness

4239
04:02:40,400 --> 04:02:40,880
but it isn't

4240
04:02:40,880 --> 04:02:42,240
everyone is really unhappy

4241
04:02:42,240 --> 04:02:43,520
yeah there's something about

4242
04:02:43,520 --> 04:02:44,880
maybe streaming is different

4243
04:02:44,880 --> 04:02:46,320
but YouTube folks too

4244
04:02:46,320 --> 04:02:47,680
I've interacted with a few and

4245
04:02:49,200 --> 04:02:50,400
even in podcasting space

4246
04:02:50,960 --> 04:02:52,960
people become obsessed about the views

4247
04:02:52,960 --> 04:02:53,520
and numbers

4248
04:02:53,520 --> 04:02:55,040
and subscribers and stuff like that

4249
04:02:56,400 --> 04:02:57,280
so I turn

4250
04:02:57,280 --> 04:02:58,960
I never talk about that

4251
04:02:58,960 --> 04:03:00,480
I don't pay attention to that

4252
04:03:01,920 --> 04:03:04,720
I feel like that's a drug that destroys

4253
04:03:05,520 --> 04:03:06,160
your mind

4254
04:03:06,880 --> 04:03:08,400
your your mind is an artist

4255
04:03:08,400 --> 04:03:09,600
ability to create

4256
04:03:09,600 --> 04:03:10,880
surely unique things

4257
04:03:11,920 --> 04:03:12,960
also your mind

4258
04:03:12,960 --> 04:03:13,920
in terms of the anxiety

4259
04:03:13,920 --> 04:03:15,280
the ups and downs of the

4260
04:03:16,640 --> 04:03:17,760
attention mechanism

4261
04:03:18,800 --> 04:03:19,680
and then also being

4262
04:03:20,240 --> 04:03:22,560
just if something that you make

4263
04:03:22,560 --> 04:03:23,440
is not popular

4264
04:03:23,440 --> 04:03:24,880
but it meant a lot to you

4265
04:03:24,880 --> 04:03:26,000
you will think of it less

4266
04:03:26,800 --> 04:03:28,000
because it's not popular

4267
04:03:28,000 --> 04:03:29,520
yeah that's a really dangerous thing

4268
04:03:29,520 --> 04:03:31,440
and because everyone around you

4269
04:03:31,440 --> 04:03:32,640
is reinforcing

4270
04:03:32,640 --> 04:03:34,080
like I'll get messages like

4271
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:35,520
wow

4272
04:03:35,520 --> 04:03:37,360
this thing got this many views

4273
04:03:37,360 --> 04:03:37,920
or something

4274
04:03:38,480 --> 04:03:39,600
great job

4275
04:03:39,600 --> 04:03:40,880
it's like no

4276
04:03:40,880 --> 04:03:41,920
you don't get it

4277
04:03:41,920 --> 04:03:42,640
like that's not

4278
04:03:42,640 --> 04:03:43,120
that's not

4279
04:03:44,080 --> 04:03:45,520
everyone is enforcing this

4280
04:03:45,520 --> 04:03:46,800
like this language

4281
04:03:46,800 --> 04:03:48,960
of views and likes and so on

4282
04:03:48,960 --> 04:03:49,760
and it's

4283
04:03:49,760 --> 04:03:50,960
it's correlated of course

4284
04:03:50,960 --> 04:03:52,240
because truly impactful things

4285
04:03:52,240 --> 04:03:53,360
will get a lot of attention

4286
04:03:53,920 --> 04:03:54,240
often

4287
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:55,280
but

4288
04:03:56,000 --> 04:03:56,560
it's not

4289
04:03:57,280 --> 04:03:59,200
on the individual local scale

4290
04:03:59,200 --> 04:04:00,480
like temporarily is

4291
04:04:01,760 --> 04:04:02,400
it's uh

4292
04:04:02,400 --> 04:04:03,600
it can really fuck with your mind

4293
04:04:03,600 --> 04:04:04,800
and I see that

4294
04:04:04,880 --> 04:04:05,600
in the creators

4295
04:04:05,600 --> 04:04:06,080
they become

4296
04:04:07,920 --> 04:04:09,600
addicts to the algorithm

4297
04:04:09,600 --> 04:04:10,800
lost in chasing views

4298
04:04:10,800 --> 04:04:11,840
like we know friends that

4299
04:04:11,840 --> 04:04:12,080
yes

4300
04:04:12,080 --> 04:04:12,800
we know cool people

4301
04:04:12,800 --> 04:04:13,760
and then they start streaming

4302
04:04:13,760 --> 04:04:14,480
and eventually they got

4303
04:04:14,480 --> 04:04:16,000
they're like chasing the dragon of like

4304
04:04:16,800 --> 04:04:17,760
and they change like

4305
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:18,400
they're

4306
04:04:18,400 --> 04:04:18,880
yeah

4307
04:04:18,880 --> 04:04:19,200
it's like

4308
04:04:21,200 --> 04:04:22,000
this is something I've always said

4309
04:04:22,000 --> 04:04:22,480
that like

4310
04:04:22,480 --> 04:04:23,920
one of the biggest blessings

4311
04:04:23,920 --> 04:04:25,280
and biggest curses of humanity

4312
04:04:25,280 --> 04:04:26,960
is we are very good at acclimating

4313
04:04:26,960 --> 04:04:28,240
like you can become paralyzed

4314
04:04:28,240 --> 04:04:29,200
you can have all sorts of horrible

4315
04:04:29,200 --> 04:04:29,680
things happen to you

4316
04:04:29,680 --> 04:04:30,400
and you'll get used to it

4317
04:04:30,400 --> 04:04:31,040
and you'll be okay

4318
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:32,400
you're gonna have like a good baseline

4319
04:04:32,400 --> 04:04:33,440
but it works the other way too

4320
04:04:33,440 --> 04:04:34,400
and that you can get more and more

4321
04:04:35,200 --> 04:04:36,080
and you acclimate to it

4322
04:04:36,080 --> 04:04:37,200
almost immediately

4323
04:04:37,200 --> 04:04:37,840
there's like

4324
04:04:37,840 --> 04:04:38,880
this is a phenomenon that

4325
04:04:38,880 --> 04:04:40,000
I bet it happens in the youtube world

4326
04:04:40,000 --> 04:04:41,200
but I know it happens in the streaming world

4327
04:04:41,200 --> 04:04:42,400
where you're streaming

4328
04:04:42,400 --> 04:04:44,160
1,000 viewers every day

4329
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:44,960
huge event happens

4330
04:04:44,960 --> 04:04:45,760
and you blow up

4331
04:04:45,760 --> 04:04:47,440
and you got like 15,000 viewers

4332
04:04:47,440 --> 04:04:48,400
for a day or two

4333
04:04:48,400 --> 04:04:49,520
and then it starts to go down

4334
04:04:49,520 --> 04:04:50,720
and down and down and down and down

4335
04:04:50,720 --> 04:04:52,400
and then after all the drama started off

4336
04:04:52,400 --> 04:04:53,120
you're at like

4337
04:04:53,120 --> 04:04:54,800
3,000 concurrent viewers

4338
04:04:54,800 --> 04:04:55,920
now in the macro

4339
04:04:55,920 --> 04:04:57,520
you went from 1,000 to 3,000

4340
04:04:57,520 --> 04:04:58,560
that feels awesome

4341
04:04:58,560 --> 04:04:59,600
but you actually feel like

4342
04:04:59,600 --> 04:05:00,240
shit the whole time

4343
04:05:00,240 --> 04:05:00,880
because you're remembering

4344
04:05:00,880 --> 04:05:02,160
when you had 10 or 15,000

4345
04:05:02,160 --> 04:05:03,680
and now everything feels horrible

4346
04:05:03,680 --> 04:05:05,280
and you'll see people climb over time

4347
04:05:05,280 --> 04:05:05,680
and like

4348
04:05:05,680 --> 04:05:05,920
fuck

4349
04:05:05,920 --> 04:05:07,120
like but whatever that one huge stream

4350
04:05:07,120 --> 04:05:07,360
I had like

4351
04:05:07,360 --> 04:05:08,640
I've never like been able to

4352
04:05:08,640 --> 04:05:09,040
and it's like

4353
04:05:09,040 --> 04:05:09,920
dude you're doing great

4354
04:05:09,920 --> 04:05:10,640
what's yeah

4355
04:05:10,640 --> 04:05:11,520
that happens a lot

4356
04:05:11,520 --> 04:05:12,640
there's so many people that we know

4357
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:14,160
that we find super super cool

4358
04:05:14,160 --> 04:05:15,520
they're passionate about things

4359
04:05:15,520 --> 04:05:17,120
they have so much interest

4360
04:05:17,120 --> 04:05:18,080
and then they just get like

4361
04:05:18,080 --> 04:05:19,440
so addicted to these numbers

4362
04:05:19,440 --> 04:05:20,240
and like all the

4363
04:05:20,800 --> 04:05:21,760
everything is just ruined

4364
04:05:21,760 --> 04:05:22,960
like all the cool things about them

4365
04:05:22,960 --> 04:05:23,280
is ruined

4366
04:05:23,280 --> 04:05:24,480
because they stop doing the things

4367
04:05:24,480 --> 04:05:25,360
that they actually like

4368
04:05:26,320 --> 04:05:27,120
to do something else

4369
04:05:27,120 --> 04:05:28,000
that gives them more viewers

4370
04:05:28,000 --> 04:05:28,720
and more money

4371
04:05:28,720 --> 04:05:30,560
and it's really sad to see

4372
04:05:30,560 --> 04:05:31,200
you know that

4373
04:05:31,200 --> 04:05:32,640
that temporary sacrifice

4374
04:05:32,640 --> 04:05:35,600
that seems temporary is

4375
04:05:35,600 --> 04:05:36,560
that it

4376
04:05:36,560 --> 04:05:37,600
it actually destroys you

4377
04:05:37,600 --> 04:05:38,480
like for one time

4378
04:05:38,480 --> 04:05:39,360
making a choice

4379
04:05:39,360 --> 04:05:41,360
because I come across those choices often

4380
04:05:41,360 --> 04:05:42,480
like I can do this

4381
04:05:42,480 --> 04:05:43,680
you can kind of know

4382
04:05:43,680 --> 04:05:45,360
what's going to be popular and not

4383
04:05:46,240 --> 04:05:47,680
and you have to ask yourself the question

4384
04:05:47,680 --> 04:05:49,040
like is this going to sacrifice

4385
04:05:49,680 --> 04:05:51,360
because if people are sacrificing

4386
04:05:51,360 --> 04:05:53,200
like intimate relationships

4387
04:05:53,200 --> 04:05:54,480
they're sacrificing time

4388
04:05:54,480 --> 04:05:55,120
with their family

4389
04:05:55,120 --> 04:05:56,000
they're like

4390
04:05:56,000 --> 04:05:56,880
sacrificing time

4391
04:05:56,880 --> 04:05:57,840
with the things that they

4392
04:05:57,840 --> 04:05:58,480
feel good about

4393
04:05:58,480 --> 04:05:59,200
and that they like

4394
04:06:00,160 --> 04:06:01,760
and that's something I kind of

4395
04:06:01,760 --> 04:06:02,960
realized last year

4396
04:06:02,960 --> 04:06:04,320
because I was working so much

4397
04:06:04,320 --> 04:06:05,120
and I was just grinding

4398
04:06:05,120 --> 04:06:05,840
and grinding and grinding

4399
04:06:05,840 --> 04:06:07,200
because it was kind of new for me

4400
04:06:07,200 --> 04:06:08,960
and then new years came by

4401
04:06:08,960 --> 04:06:09,440
and I was like

4402
04:06:09,440 --> 04:06:10,560
wait what did I even do

4403
04:06:10,560 --> 04:06:11,760
like the entire year

4404
04:06:11,760 --> 04:06:13,680
like I traveled to a bunch of places

4405
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:14,480
but nothing actually

4406
04:06:14,480 --> 04:06:15,440
really meant anything to me

4407
04:06:15,440 --> 04:06:16,400
because I felt like I was just

4408
04:06:16,400 --> 04:06:17,440
working the entire time

4409
04:06:17,440 --> 04:06:18,400
I felt like I was just numb

4410
04:06:18,400 --> 04:06:18,880
through the

4411
04:06:18,880 --> 04:06:19,600
through the entire year

4412
04:06:19,600 --> 04:06:20,560
and I was really scary

4413
04:06:22,640 --> 04:06:23,760
like I rented a

4414
04:06:24,320 --> 04:06:25,520
like a super pretty house

4415
04:06:25,520 --> 04:06:26,320
like for a week

4416
04:06:26,320 --> 04:06:27,600
with my dad and my sister

4417
04:06:27,600 --> 04:06:29,440
because I wanted to spend time with them

4418
04:06:29,440 --> 04:06:30,800
but the entire time

4419
04:06:30,800 --> 04:06:32,400
I was just streaming

4420
04:06:32,400 --> 04:06:33,520
and I actually

4421
04:06:33,520 --> 04:06:34,640
didn't ever like calm down

4422
04:06:34,640 --> 04:06:35,360
and just like

4423
04:06:35,360 --> 04:06:36,080
chill with them

4424
04:06:36,080 --> 04:06:36,640
and I

4425
04:06:36,640 --> 04:06:37,440
like that's like time

4426
04:06:37,440 --> 04:06:38,640
I'll never get back

4427
04:06:38,640 --> 04:06:39,040
I don't

4428
04:06:39,040 --> 04:06:40,240
I don't give a shit about the money

4429
04:06:40,240 --> 04:06:41,040
that I made that week

4430
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:42,240
but I lost the time

4431
04:06:43,040 --> 04:06:43,920
and like

4432
04:06:43,920 --> 04:06:45,360
that is really important to me

4433
04:06:45,360 --> 04:06:45,760
and I

4434
04:06:45,760 --> 04:06:47,200
yeah and a lot of people are doing that

4435
04:06:47,760 --> 04:06:48,480
and I feel like

4436
04:06:48,480 --> 04:06:48,960
as you said

4437
04:06:48,960 --> 04:06:49,920
like you can definitely see that

4438
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:50,640
in like artists

4439
04:06:51,280 --> 04:06:51,760
for sure

4440
04:06:51,760 --> 04:06:52,240
I feel like

4441
04:06:52,240 --> 04:06:53,440
if you look at like artists

4442
04:06:53,440 --> 04:06:55,360
like back in the 60s or 70s

4443
04:06:55,360 --> 04:06:56,400
I feel like things were just

4444
04:06:56,400 --> 04:06:57,680
so much better back then

4445
04:06:57,680 --> 04:06:58,240
and it feels like

4446
04:06:58,240 --> 04:07:00,160
they were actually making music

4447
04:07:00,240 --> 04:07:01,600
that meant something to them

4448
04:07:01,600 --> 04:07:02,800
they were actually making art

4449
04:07:03,360 --> 04:07:04,320
and I feel like today

4450
04:07:04,320 --> 04:07:05,680
everything is just kind of like

4451
04:07:05,680 --> 04:07:06,480
whatever is cool

4452
04:07:06,480 --> 04:07:07,280
whatever sells

4453
04:07:07,280 --> 04:07:08,000
whatever you know

4454
04:07:08,000 --> 04:07:08,960
sounds in a certain way

4455
04:07:08,960 --> 04:07:09,920
everything is kind of

4456
04:07:09,920 --> 04:07:10,960
the same thing

4457
04:07:10,960 --> 04:07:12,640
and everything that is very artistic

4458
04:07:12,640 --> 04:07:13,360
and very cool

4459
04:07:13,360 --> 04:07:15,040
is actually not that popular

4460
04:07:15,040 --> 04:07:15,440
at all

4461
04:07:16,080 --> 04:07:17,200
and that's kind of sad

4462
04:07:18,000 --> 04:07:19,040
yeah of course there's now

4463
04:07:19,040 --> 04:07:20,720
bigger mechanisms and platforms

4464
04:07:20,720 --> 04:07:21,200
to spread

4465
04:07:21,920 --> 04:07:22,480
stuff

4466
04:07:22,480 --> 04:07:22,880
music

4467
04:07:23,760 --> 04:07:25,600
so as long as you could be content

4468
04:07:25,600 --> 04:07:27,120
with not being popular

4469
04:07:27,120 --> 04:07:28,560
I think you can still create good art

4470
04:07:28,560 --> 04:07:29,360
but not like

4471
04:07:29,360 --> 04:07:30,560
when people get a little popular

4472
04:07:30,560 --> 04:07:32,080
they get addicted to that so fast

4473
04:07:32,080 --> 04:07:33,200
yeah it's weird

4474
04:07:33,200 --> 04:07:33,680
yeah

4475
04:07:33,680 --> 04:07:35,760
you have been somewhat good

4476
04:07:35,760 --> 04:07:37,120
at least from my outside of perspective

4477
04:07:37,680 --> 04:07:38,800
because I think you

4478
04:07:39,600 --> 04:07:40,960
I can at least imagine

4479
04:07:40,960 --> 04:07:41,760
you making choices

4480
04:07:41,760 --> 04:07:43,520
that could make you more popular

4481
04:07:43,520 --> 04:07:45,520
and you don't seem to make those choices

4482
04:07:46,960 --> 04:07:48,080
sabotage my career

4483
04:07:49,520 --> 04:07:50,640
but it is very intentional

4484
04:07:50,640 --> 04:07:51,120
like you said

4485
04:07:51,120 --> 04:07:52,160
like and I made that choice

4486
04:07:52,160 --> 04:07:54,400
at every single stage of my life

4487
04:07:54,400 --> 04:07:55,200
one is because

4488
04:07:55,200 --> 04:07:55,920
from the perspective

4489
04:07:55,920 --> 04:07:56,720
of being a carpet cleaner

4490
04:07:56,720 --> 04:07:57,840
my life is way better

4491
04:07:57,840 --> 04:07:58,560
than that

4492
04:07:58,560 --> 04:07:59,840
was or ever would have been

4493
04:07:59,840 --> 04:08:01,440
so I'm already doing way better than I ever thought

4494
04:08:01,440 --> 04:08:02,560
somebody like me ever could be

4495
04:08:03,200 --> 04:08:04,320
but then two

4496
04:08:04,320 --> 04:08:06,240
I super love my job

4497
04:08:06,240 --> 04:08:07,120
every time I wake up

4498
04:08:07,120 --> 04:08:08,720
every time I fly to a place to do a podcast

4499
04:08:08,720 --> 04:08:09,840
every time I get to talk to really cool people

4500
04:08:09,840 --> 04:08:11,280
like every single part of my job

4501
04:08:11,280 --> 04:08:11,840
I super like

4502
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:12,880
if there's something I don't like

4503
04:08:12,880 --> 04:08:13,520
I just cut it off

4504
04:08:13,520 --> 04:08:14,080
because I don't care

4505
04:08:14,080 --> 04:08:15,120
because I'm already making plenty of money

4506
04:08:15,120 --> 04:08:15,920
doing what I do

4507
04:08:15,920 --> 04:08:17,040
and why would I ever wake up

4508
04:08:17,040 --> 04:08:18,080
and not like what I'm doing

4509
04:08:18,080 --> 04:08:19,440
when I can't like what I'm doing

4510
04:08:19,440 --> 04:08:20,480
how do you guys find

4511
04:08:20,480 --> 04:08:21,200
through that

4512
04:08:21,200 --> 04:08:21,680
given that

4513
04:08:22,720 --> 04:08:23,520
you love it

4514
04:08:23,520 --> 04:08:25,920
and sometimes maybe lose yourself in the drug of it

4515
04:08:25,920 --> 04:08:27,520
how do you find

4516
04:08:27,600 --> 04:08:28,720
like work-life balance

4517
04:08:28,720 --> 04:08:30,080
together inside a relationship

4518
04:08:30,800 --> 04:08:31,760
like time for each other

4519
04:08:32,560 --> 04:08:33,520
I don't at all so

4520
04:08:33,520 --> 04:08:34,880
I'm not a good person to ask

4521
04:08:34,880 --> 04:08:35,760
what do you love more

4522
04:08:36,320 --> 04:08:37,920
Mel or Faktor

4523
04:08:38,960 --> 04:08:40,400
Faktor is a really good game

4524
04:08:40,400 --> 04:08:41,680
that's like not a fair comparison

4525
04:08:41,680 --> 04:08:42,320
okay you're talking about

4526
04:08:42,320 --> 04:08:43,920
one of the best cleanest games

4527
04:08:43,920 --> 04:08:45,600
best support ever made

4528
04:08:45,600 --> 04:08:46,800
cleanest code base

4529
04:08:46,800 --> 04:08:47,520
like this is

4530
04:08:47,520 --> 04:08:48,640
I think it's Thanos brother

4531
04:08:48,640 --> 04:08:50,400
yeah it's more Faktor time for me

4532
04:08:51,920 --> 04:08:52,560
starting to understand

4533
04:08:52,560 --> 04:08:53,760
where the massaging comes from

4534
04:08:53,760 --> 04:08:54,160
by the way

4535
04:08:54,720 --> 04:08:57,120
is Faktor a legit really good game

4536
04:08:57,120 --> 04:08:57,840
yeah of course yeah

4537
04:08:57,840 --> 04:08:58,320
I'm cool

4538
04:08:58,320 --> 04:08:59,040
if you're like

4539
04:08:59,040 --> 04:09:00,160
do you enjoy programming

4540
04:09:00,800 --> 04:09:01,680
of course that's all I do

4541
04:09:01,680 --> 04:09:02,960
that's all that's okay

4542
04:09:02,960 --> 04:09:04,560
to me programming is

4543
04:09:05,120 --> 04:09:06,080
is the game in itself

4544
04:09:06,080 --> 04:09:07,760
that I enjoy probably more than anything else

4545
04:09:07,760 --> 04:09:08,240
but yeah

4546
04:09:08,240 --> 04:09:09,520
it's very much a game like that

4547
04:09:09,520 --> 04:09:10,720
of like if you're into stuff like that

4548
04:09:10,720 --> 04:09:12,240
like you can lose hundreds of hours

4549
04:09:12,240 --> 04:09:13,760
like very quickly to

4550
04:09:13,760 --> 04:09:14,880
like you have a problem

4551
04:09:14,880 --> 04:09:16,160
and then you think of a solution

4552
04:09:16,160 --> 04:09:17,040
and then you iterate on that

4553
04:09:17,040 --> 04:09:18,080
over and over and over again

4554
04:09:18,080 --> 04:09:19,120
in larger larger schemes

4555
04:09:19,120 --> 04:09:20,320
sometimes you got to redesign stuff

4556
04:09:20,320 --> 04:09:20,880
sometimes you got like

4557
04:09:20,880 --> 04:09:22,000
it's a very much like that kind of game

4558
04:09:22,000 --> 04:09:23,520
this year essentially building a factory

4559
04:09:23,520 --> 04:09:24,800
like what on a foreign planet

4560
04:09:24,800 --> 04:09:25,520
or something like that

4561
04:09:25,520 --> 04:09:26,720
it's basically it's like

4562
04:09:26,720 --> 04:09:27,920
a bunch of you're trying to automate

4563
04:09:27,920 --> 04:09:28,720
different problems

4564
04:09:28,720 --> 04:09:30,160
so that you can build bigger things

4565
04:09:30,160 --> 04:09:31,600
so that you can automate bigger problems

4566
04:09:31,600 --> 04:09:32,400
so you can build bigger things

4567
04:09:32,400 --> 04:09:33,360
and automate bigger problems

4568
04:09:33,360 --> 04:09:34,480
so it's more complicated

4569
04:09:34,480 --> 04:09:36,240
than like a city building game

4570
04:09:36,240 --> 04:09:37,600
like some city type of thing

4571
04:09:38,160 --> 04:09:39,600
I wouldn't say it's more complicated

4572
04:09:39,600 --> 04:09:40,960
it's more it's like

4573
04:09:40,960 --> 04:09:43,040
Faktor is like a game of like logic

4574
04:09:43,040 --> 04:09:44,560
like strictly like logic

4575
04:09:44,560 --> 04:09:45,760
like it's almost like a building

4576
04:09:45,760 --> 04:09:46,720
a circuit or something

4577
04:09:46,720 --> 04:09:47,280
yes yeah

4578
04:09:47,280 --> 04:09:48,320
there's like their circuitry

4579
04:09:48,320 --> 04:09:49,280
and you've got your and orgs

4580
04:09:49,280 --> 04:09:49,840
or against you

4581
04:09:49,840 --> 04:09:50,800
like there's stuff like that

4582
04:09:50,800 --> 04:09:51,520
it's very much like that

4583
04:09:51,520 --> 04:09:53,120
like what are the enemies in the game

4584
04:09:53,120 --> 04:09:54,240
like what they're like

4585
04:09:54,240 --> 04:09:55,920
so I try to bite you

4586
04:09:55,920 --> 04:09:57,440
and you can get guns and shoot and kill them

4587
04:09:57,440 --> 04:09:59,440
but I saw there's like shooting going on

4588
04:09:59,440 --> 04:09:59,680
yeah

4589
04:09:59,680 --> 04:10:00,320
but that's like a mind

4590
04:10:00,320 --> 04:10:01,040
it's just like another problem

4591
04:10:01,040 --> 04:10:02,080
to solve in the game basically

4592
04:10:02,080 --> 04:10:02,400
yeah

4593
04:10:02,400 --> 04:10:02,960
okay

4594
04:10:02,960 --> 04:10:03,680
all right

4595
04:10:03,680 --> 04:10:04,720
see see what we did there

4596
04:10:04,720 --> 04:10:06,320
we just started talking about the game

4597
04:10:06,320 --> 04:10:07,520
as we're trying

4598
04:10:07,520 --> 04:10:08,560
oh my god that's like

4599
04:10:08,560 --> 04:10:09,040
like a game

4600
04:10:09,040 --> 04:10:09,680
okay

4601
04:10:09,680 --> 04:10:10,560
that's horrible

4602
04:10:10,560 --> 04:10:11,840
anyway is there

4603
04:10:11,840 --> 04:10:13,360
is that basically the struggle

4604
04:10:13,360 --> 04:10:14,240
not stop struggle

4605
04:10:14,240 --> 04:10:15,760
how to get human

4606
04:10:16,880 --> 04:10:18,320
like intimate human time

4607
04:10:19,200 --> 04:10:20,080
I feel like it was like that

4608
04:10:20,080 --> 04:10:21,680
a little bit more in the past

4609
04:10:21,680 --> 04:10:22,800
I feel like it's been better

4610
04:10:23,760 --> 04:10:24,640
lately

4611
04:10:24,720 --> 04:10:25,760
but I think it's because

4612
04:10:26,480 --> 04:10:27,520
when we started dating

4613
04:10:27,520 --> 04:10:28,560
I wasn't streaming

4614
04:10:28,560 --> 04:10:29,840
and I kind of just like

4615
04:10:29,840 --> 04:10:32,080
gave up like my trip in New Zealand

4616
04:10:32,080 --> 04:10:33,120
I give up like

4617
04:10:33,120 --> 04:10:35,440
like I left Sweden

4618
04:10:35,440 --> 04:10:36,640
so I was just like

4619
04:10:36,640 --> 04:10:37,600
in LA

4620
04:10:37,600 --> 04:10:38,240
which I hate

4621
04:10:38,240 --> 04:10:38,720
I hate LA

4622
04:10:38,720 --> 04:10:39,680
I don't like LA at all

4623
04:10:40,480 --> 04:10:42,480
it's hard to make friends

4624
04:10:42,480 --> 04:10:43,440
that are like real

4625
04:10:43,440 --> 04:10:45,120
that are into the same stuff as you

4626
04:10:45,120 --> 04:10:46,400
it was just really hard for me

4627
04:10:46,400 --> 04:10:47,520
to connect with anyone

4628
04:10:47,520 --> 04:10:49,680
especially also like being a European

4629
04:10:49,680 --> 04:10:50,880
and like being around Americans

4630
04:10:50,880 --> 04:10:52,160
was very strange

4631
04:10:52,160 --> 04:10:53,680
so the only thing I had

4632
04:10:53,680 --> 04:10:54,800
when I came here

4633
04:10:54,800 --> 04:10:55,280
was him

4634
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:58,240
and I didn't expect

4635
04:10:58,240 --> 04:10:58,960
that situation

4636
04:10:58,960 --> 04:10:59,600
because yeah

4637
04:10:59,600 --> 04:11:00,560
because we had

4638
04:11:00,560 --> 04:11:02,480
we had like two weeks of hanging out

4639
04:11:02,480 --> 04:11:03,520
and like he would be on his computer

4640
04:11:03,520 --> 04:11:04,080
sometimes

4641
04:11:04,080 --> 04:11:05,120
and like do emails and stuff

4642
04:11:05,120 --> 04:11:06,400
but I wasn't thinking

4643
04:11:06,400 --> 04:11:07,920
that he would stream like 12 hours a day

4644
04:11:07,920 --> 04:11:08,560
and it was pretty

4645
04:11:08,560 --> 04:11:09,440
like it was pretty intense

4646
04:11:09,440 --> 04:11:10,640
like in the beginning of it as well

4647
04:11:10,640 --> 04:11:12,480
and I realized it was really hard

4648
04:11:12,480 --> 04:11:13,600
to like get attention

4649
04:11:13,600 --> 04:11:14,160
and get time

4650
04:11:14,160 --> 04:11:16,480
because his like love meter

4651
04:11:16,480 --> 04:11:17,840
would be like full

4652
04:11:17,840 --> 04:11:19,120
if I was just in the house

4653
04:11:19,120 --> 04:11:20,000
and that's just kind of like

4654
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:20,720
the way he is

4655
04:11:20,720 --> 04:11:21,680
and for me back then

4656
04:11:21,680 --> 04:11:23,120
when I didn't have anything else to do

4657
04:11:23,840 --> 04:11:26,000
it was kind of like a

4658
04:11:26,000 --> 04:11:28,000
it was kind of crazy for me

4659
04:11:28,000 --> 04:11:28,880
I feel like right now

4660
04:11:28,880 --> 04:11:30,400
because I do work as well

4661
04:11:30,400 --> 04:11:32,800
and I have things going for me

4662
04:11:32,800 --> 04:11:34,000
and I have other friends

4663
04:11:34,640 --> 04:11:35,680
now that I made

4664
04:11:35,680 --> 04:11:37,120
I feel like it's a lot easier

4665
04:11:37,120 --> 04:11:38,480
because and I can definitely like

4666
04:11:38,480 --> 04:11:40,560
enjoy just like being in separate rooms

4667
04:11:40,560 --> 04:11:41,840
and just like hear him in the background

4668
04:11:41,840 --> 04:11:42,400
is really nice

4669
04:11:42,400 --> 04:11:42,960
so I can like

4670
04:11:42,960 --> 04:11:44,240
I can sit in paint

4671
04:11:44,240 --> 04:11:45,200
and like in my room

4672
04:11:45,200 --> 04:11:46,240
and I will do that for hours

4673
04:11:46,240 --> 04:11:47,360
while I'm just like hearing a scream

4674
04:11:47,360 --> 04:11:47,840
in the background

4675
04:11:47,840 --> 04:11:49,280
it's kind of like comforting

4676
04:11:49,280 --> 04:11:50,400
that he's he's just there

4677
04:11:50,400 --> 04:11:51,120
it feels nice

4678
04:11:51,120 --> 04:11:51,440
I like it

4679
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:53,680
to you that's the sound of happiness

4680
04:11:53,680 --> 04:11:55,200
yes because I know he's right there

4681
04:11:55,200 --> 04:11:55,760
yeah it's nice

4682
04:11:55,760 --> 04:11:56,320
and they will come in

4683
04:11:56,320 --> 04:11:57,280
and check on me sometimes

4684
04:11:57,280 --> 04:11:58,240
and it's it's kind of like

4685
04:11:58,240 --> 04:11:59,280
it's actually very comforting

4686
04:11:59,280 --> 04:11:59,840
it's very nice

4687
04:11:59,840 --> 04:12:00,320
I like it

4688
04:12:01,120 --> 04:12:01,760
yeah

4689
04:12:01,760 --> 04:12:03,520
I think that's kind of what a relationship is

4690
04:12:03,520 --> 04:12:04,880
like you do fun things together

4691
04:12:04,880 --> 04:12:06,560
you know you share moments together

4692
04:12:06,560 --> 04:12:07,440
but also just like

4693
04:12:07,440 --> 04:12:08,640
having someone like around

4694
04:12:08,640 --> 04:12:09,680
you's really really nice

4695
04:12:10,640 --> 04:12:11,680
and I think that's probably

4696
04:12:12,240 --> 04:12:13,440
maybe it's me growing up

4697
04:12:14,640 --> 04:12:15,680
maybe that's what it is

4698
04:12:15,680 --> 04:12:17,680
and like I start liking like the kind of

4699
04:12:17,680 --> 04:12:19,040
I feel like we're like an old couple

4700
04:12:19,040 --> 04:12:19,920
like we're like 80

4701
04:12:19,920 --> 04:12:20,800
and we're just like around

4702
04:12:21,200 --> 04:12:22,720
we don't really have to talk much

4703
04:12:22,720 --> 04:12:24,160
it's it's nice to just do that

4704
04:12:24,160 --> 04:12:26,080
that fills your love meter

4705
04:12:26,080 --> 04:12:27,040
that person

4706
04:12:27,040 --> 04:12:28,400
I like this terminology

4707
04:12:28,400 --> 04:12:28,720
love me

4708
04:12:28,720 --> 04:12:29,360
I need both

4709
04:12:29,360 --> 04:12:30,080
I mean okay

4710
04:12:30,640 --> 04:12:32,320
you're making it sound like

4711
04:12:32,320 --> 04:12:33,520
that I'm like craving like

4712
04:12:33,520 --> 04:12:34,480
I haven't said anything

4713
04:12:34,480 --> 04:12:35,280
I'm not saying anything

4714
04:12:35,280 --> 04:12:36,160
I haven't said a single thing at all

4715
04:12:36,160 --> 04:12:37,200
you're making face right now

4716
04:12:37,200 --> 04:12:38,480
I know exactly what you're thinking so

4717
04:12:38,480 --> 04:12:39,840
there's so much judging going on

4718
04:12:39,840 --> 04:12:41,040
there's no judging at all

4719
04:12:41,040 --> 04:12:41,760
no but like we

4720
04:12:41,760 --> 04:12:42,320
I think

4721
04:12:42,320 --> 04:12:44,480
I think whenever we do plan something out

4722
04:12:44,480 --> 04:12:46,080
like if we if we go on a trip

4723
04:12:46,080 --> 04:12:47,600
like every other month or once a month

4724
04:12:48,240 --> 04:12:49,520
I feel like usually like

4725
04:12:49,520 --> 04:12:50,320
that's enough

4726
04:12:51,040 --> 04:12:52,640
as long as he's not playing

4727
04:12:52,640 --> 04:12:54,000
factorial the entire time

4728
04:12:54,000 --> 04:12:55,360
like if he if I feel like

4729
04:12:55,360 --> 04:12:56,480
he's going on these trips with me

4730
04:12:56,480 --> 04:12:56,960
and he's not

4731
04:12:57,840 --> 04:12:58,800
like doing things with me

4732
04:12:58,800 --> 04:13:00,160
or he's not he's not interested

4733
04:13:00,160 --> 04:13:01,120
in like spending time

4734
04:13:01,120 --> 04:13:02,560
or like being present with me

4735
04:13:02,560 --> 04:13:03,280
then I'll feel like

4736
04:13:03,280 --> 04:13:04,640
I just feel like I'm just wasting time

4737
04:13:04,640 --> 04:13:04,960
right now

4738
04:13:04,960 --> 04:13:06,480
and then I get kind of disappointed

4739
04:13:06,480 --> 04:13:08,160
but otherwise I think this

4740
04:13:08,160 --> 04:13:08,880
like this is fun

4741
04:13:08,880 --> 04:13:09,840
I think this is like spending time

4742
04:13:09,840 --> 04:13:10,640
together

4743
04:13:10,640 --> 04:13:11,840
because we're like doing something together

4744
04:13:11,840 --> 04:13:13,280
yeah it's fun yeah

4745
04:13:14,160 --> 04:13:15,360
my love meter is

4746
04:13:15,760 --> 04:13:17,280
your love meter is full

4747
04:13:17,280 --> 04:13:18,320
it's my social life

4748
04:13:18,320 --> 04:13:19,200
otherwise we like to

4749
04:13:19,200 --> 04:13:20,560
we like to think about it that way

4750
04:13:20,800 --> 04:13:22,160
like I need like a little bit more of

4751
04:13:22,160 --> 04:13:23,120
like this one thing

4752
04:13:23,120 --> 04:13:24,160
like quality time

4753
04:13:24,160 --> 04:13:24,960
and he needs like

4754
04:13:24,960 --> 04:13:26,160
almost zero quality time

4755
04:13:26,880 --> 04:13:27,760
but like let's say that I

4756
04:13:27,760 --> 04:13:29,200
we took away like physical touch

4757
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:30,400
you would probably not be very happy

4758
04:13:31,520 --> 04:13:32,720
so you need physical touch

4759
04:13:32,720 --> 04:13:34,080
so it's not just back to me huh

4760
04:13:34,080 --> 04:13:35,200
no I'm a very cuddly person

4761
04:13:35,200 --> 04:13:36,400
yeah like cuddly

4762
04:13:36,400 --> 04:13:37,120
and then you're like

4763
04:13:37,120 --> 04:13:38,320
I guess like acts of service

4764
04:13:38,320 --> 04:13:39,440
like if I do something for you

4765
04:13:39,440 --> 04:13:40,160
get really happy

4766
04:13:40,160 --> 04:13:40,960
like hot chocolate

4767
04:13:40,960 --> 04:13:41,680
yeah

4768
04:13:41,680 --> 04:13:42,800
like if I give him hot chocolate

4769
04:13:42,800 --> 04:13:44,080
in the morning he gets really happy

4770
04:13:44,080 --> 04:13:44,640
so

4771
04:13:44,640 --> 04:13:45,600
the actual

4772
04:13:45,600 --> 04:13:46,640
it's not the hot chocolate

4773
04:13:46,640 --> 04:13:48,000
it's the giving of the hot chocolate

4774
04:13:48,000 --> 04:13:48,960
no it's just the hot chocolate

4775
04:13:49,520 --> 04:13:50,400
but if she gives it to me

4776
04:13:50,560 --> 04:13:51,520
I didn't have to get it myself

4777
04:13:51,520 --> 04:13:52,000
it was just physical touch

4778
04:13:52,000 --> 04:13:53,040
that's really nice

4779
04:13:54,240 --> 04:13:55,440
all right well if you have to choose

4780
04:13:55,440 --> 04:13:57,200
between Factorio and the drama

4781
04:13:58,080 --> 04:13:59,200
or political discourse

4782
04:13:59,920 --> 04:14:01,200
which probably political discourse

4783
04:14:01,200 --> 04:14:02,320
probably my calling

4784
04:14:02,320 --> 04:14:04,000
but I am a good Factorio player

4785
04:14:05,360 --> 04:14:07,840
like what role exactly does Factorio play

4786
04:14:07,840 --> 04:14:09,280
in your streaming life

4787
04:14:09,840 --> 04:14:11,040
oh well right now it's just

4788
04:14:11,040 --> 04:14:12,240
usually there are like these games

4789
04:14:12,240 --> 04:14:13,040
that I play in the background

4790
04:14:13,040 --> 04:14:13,920
as I have conversation

4791
04:14:13,920 --> 04:14:15,280
because it's hard for me to just sit on the computer

4792
04:14:15,280 --> 04:14:15,760
just talk

4793
04:14:16,320 --> 04:14:17,840
and not like be playing a game at the same time

4794
04:14:17,840 --> 04:14:19,760
so it's just something to keep me kind of like occupied

4795
04:14:19,760 --> 04:14:20,960
you know I was going to buy like those little like

4796
04:14:20,960 --> 04:14:21,840
widget things I guess

4797
04:14:21,840 --> 04:14:22,720
yeah that's what yours is

4798
04:14:22,720 --> 04:14:23,440
yeah basically yeah

4799
04:14:23,440 --> 04:14:25,040
it's like minecraft or Factorio for me

4800
04:14:25,920 --> 04:14:26,240
all right

4801
04:14:27,120 --> 04:14:29,360
well my love meter is full from this

4802
04:14:30,320 --> 04:14:31,920
