0	6240	The following is a conversation with Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Harvard.
6240	11040	Her work involves improving our understanding of particle physics, supersymmetry,
11040	17360	bariogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
17360	22240	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,
22240	28320	here's Lisa Randall. One of the things you work on and write about is dark matter.
28880	34320	We can't see it, but there's a lot of it in the universe. You also end one of your books with
34320	41920	a Beatles song quote, got to be good looking because he's so hard to see. What is dark matter?
42560	46800	How should we think about it, given that we can't see it? How should we visualize it in our mind
46800	51680	and die? I think one of the really important things that physics teaches you is just our
51680	57760	limitations, but also our abilities. So the fact that we can deduce the existence of something
57760	63760	that we don't directly see is really a tribute to people that we can do that. But it's also
64400	71440	something that tells you you can't overly rely on your direct senses. If you just relied on
71440	75440	just what you see directly, you would miss so much of what's happening in the world.
75440	79200	And we can generalize this, but we're just for now to focus on dark matter.
80000	84320	It's something we know is there, and it's not just one way we know it's there. In my book,
84320	89200	Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs, I talk about the many different ways, there's eight or nine,
89200	95600	that we deduce not just the existence of dark matter, but how much is there? And they all agree.
96320	103120	Now, how do we know it's there? Because of its gravitational force. And individually,
103120	107840	a particle doesn't have such a big gravitational force. In fact, gravity is an extremely weak
107840	113520	force compared to other forces we know about in nature. But there's a lot of dark matter out there.
113520	117760	It carries a lot of energy, five times the amount of energy, as the matter we know that's
117760	124720	in atoms, etc. So you can ask, how should we think about it? Well, it's just another form of matter
124720	130080	that doesn't interact with light, or at least as far as we know. So it interacts gravitationally,
130080	136400	it clumps, it forms galaxies, but it doesn't interact with light, which means we just don't
136400	141520	see it. And most of our detection, before gravitational wave detectors, we only saw
141520	147440	things because of their interactions with light in some sense. So in theory, it behaves just like
147440	152560	any other matter, it just doesn't interact with light. So when we say it interacts just like
152560	157120	any other form of matter, we have to be careful. Because gravitationally, it interacts like other
157120	163280	forms of matter, but it doesn't experience electromagnetism, which is why it has a different
163280	169360	distribution. So in our galaxy, it's roughly spherical, unless it has its own interactions,
169440	175200	that's another story. But we know that it's roughly spherical. Whereas ordinary matter
175840	180720	can radiate and clumps into a desk. And that's why we see the Milky Way desk.
181520	187360	So on large scales in some sense, yes, all the matter is similar in some sense. In fact,
187360	194400	dark matter is in some sense more important, because it can collapse more readily than ordinary
194400	200720	matter, because ordinary matter has radiative forces, which makes it hard to collapse on small
200720	207280	scales. So actually, it's dark matter that sort of drives galaxy formation. And then ordinary
207280	212000	matter kind of comes along with that. And there's also just more of it. And because there's more
212000	218240	of it, it can start collapsing sooner. That is to say the energy density in dark matter dominates
218240	222960	over radiation earlier than you would if you just had ordinary matter.
223040	226560	So it's part of the story of the origin of a galaxy, part of the story of the end of the
226560	230000	galaxy, and part of the story of all the various interactions throughout.
230000	234880	Exactly. I mean, in my book, I make kind of sort of jokes about, you know, it's like
234880	238160	when we think about a building, we think about the architect, we think about, you know, the high
238160	242400	level, but we forget about all the workers that did all the grunt work. And in fact,
242400	247600	dark matter was really important in the formation of our universe. And we forget that sometimes.
247600	255840	That's a metaphor on top of a metaphor. Okay. The unheard voices that do the actual work.
256720	260400	Exactly. No, but it is a metaphor, but it also captures something because
260400	265920	the fact is we don't directly see it. So we forget it's there, or we don't understand it's there,
265920	271200	or we think it's not. The fact that we don't see it makes it no less legitimate. It just means that
271200	274560	we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is.
275280	278960	Yeah, but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have
280160	282480	gravitational interaction with the things we can't see is
284080	290560	at the layman level is just mind blowing, you know?
290560	296880	It is and it isn't because I think what it's teaching us is that we're human. The universe is
296880	301680	what it is. And we're trying to interact with that universe and discover what it is. We've
301760	308240	discovered amazing things. In fact, I would say it's more surprising that the matter that we know
308240	314640	about constitutes as big a fraction of the universe as it does. I mean, we're limited, we're human.
314640	318800	And the fact that we see 5% of the energy density of the universe,
319760	323920	you know, about one-sixth of the energy density in matter, that's kind of remarkable. I mean,
323920	328240	why should that be? There could be anything. Anything could be out there, yet the universe
328240	332560	that we see is a significant fraction. Yeah, but a lot of our intuition, I think,
333120	338320	operates using visualizations in the mind. That's absolutely true. And it's certainly
338320	342640	writing books. I realized also how many of our words are based on how we see the world.
343840	349200	And that's true. And that's actually one of the fantastic things about physics is that it teaches
349200	355040	you how to go beyond your median intuition to develop intuitions that apply at different
355120	359440	distances, different scales, different ways of thinking about things. Yeah, how do you anthropomorphize
359440	365200	dark matter? I just did, I think. I made it the grant workers. Oh yeah, that's good.
366800	373920	That's why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books. Okay, so you also write in that
373920	380960	book about dark matter having to do something with the extinction events, the extinction of the
380960	388320	dinosaurs, which is kind of a fascinating presentation of how everything is connected.
388320	395120	So I guess the disturbances from the dark matter, they create gravitational disturbances in the
395120	400880	ore cloud at the edge of our solar system. And then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting
400880	408080	Earth. So I want to be really clear, this was a speculative theory. I love it though. I mean,
408080	415600	and I liked it too. And we still don't know for sure, but we can, what we liked about it,
415600	421280	so let me take a step back. So we usually assume that dark matter is what we, being physicists,
421280	427520	that it's just one thing. It's just basically not interacting, aside from gravity,
427520	434080	or very weakly interacting matter. But again, we have to get outside the mindset of just humans
434080	440160	and ask what else could be there. And so what we suggested is that there's a fraction of dark
440160	444720	matter, not all the dark matter, but some of the dark matter, maybe it has interactions of its own.
445440	450560	Just the same way in our universe, we have lots of different types of matter. We have nuclei,
450560	457840	we have electrons, we have forces. We have lots of, it's not a simple model, the standard model,
457840	462800	but it does have some basic ingredients. So maybe dark matter also has some interesting
463760	468560	structure to it. So maybe there's some small fraction. And the interesting thing is that
469280	474880	if some of the dark matter does radiate, and I like to call it dark light, because it's
474880	480160	light that we don't see, but dark matter would see, it could radiate that, and then it could
480160	486000	perhaps collapse into a disc the same way ordinary matter collapsed into the Milky Way disc.
486000	491760	So it's not all the dark matter, it's a fraction. But it could conceivably be a very thin disc of
491760	496720	dark matter, thin dense disc of dark matter. And so then the question is, do they exist?
496720	501680	And people have done studies now to think about whether they can find them. I mean,
501680	506080	it's an interesting target. It's something you can measure by measuring the positions and velocities
506080	513120	of stars. You can find out what the structure of the Milky Way is. But the fun proposal was that
513680	519120	the solar system orbits around the galaxy. And as it does so, it goes a little bit up and down,
519120	523040	kind of like horses on a carousel. And the suggestion was every time it goes through,
523040	528480	you have an enhanced probability that you would dislodge something from the edge of the solar
528480	533280	system in something called the Oort cloud. So the idea was that at those times, you're more
533280	539440	likely to have these cataclysmic events, such as the amazing one that actually caused the last
539440	543520	extinction that we know of for sure. It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs.
544160	548080	Or for two thirds of the species on the planet. Yeah, but as it gets amazing for humans,
548640	553200	what really is amazing, I mean, I talk about this in Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs,
553200	558640	it's just an amazing scientific story, because it really is one of the real stories that combine
558640	564960	together different fields of science. Geologists at the time, people thought that things happen
564960	570000	slowly and this would be a cataclysmic event. And also, I have to say, if you think about it,
570000	574000	it sounds like a story like a five-year-old would make up. Maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some
574000	580240	big rock that came and hit the earth, but then there really was a scientific story behind it.
580240	583600	And that's also why I like the dark disk, because there's a scientific story behind it.
583600	588000	So as far-fetched as it might sound, you could actually go and look for the experimental
588000	591840	consequences or the observational consequences to test whether it's true.
591840	597840	I wish you could know high-resolution details of where that asteroid came from,
598640	603120	like where in the Oort cloud, why it happened, is it in fact because of Dark Matter? Just
603200	608880	like the full tracing back to the origin of the universe? Because humans seem to be somewhat special,
608880	615280	but it just seems like so many fascinating events at all scales of physics had to happen.
615920	620320	So I'm really, really glad you mentioned that, because actually, that was one of the main points
620320	625440	of my book, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs. One of the reasons I wrote it was because I really think
625440	629760	we are abusing the planet. We're changing the planet way too quickly. And just like anything else,
629840	633120	when you alter things, it's good to think about the history of what it took to get here.
634320	640320	And as you point out, it took many operations on many different scales. We had to have the
640320	644320	formation of structure, the formation of galaxies, the formation of the solar system,
644320	648400	the formation of our planet, the formation of humans. I mean, there's so many steps that go
648400	654160	into this. And humans, in some part, were the result of the fact that this big object hit the
654160	659120	earth, made the dinosaurs go extinct, and mammals developed. I mean, it is an incredible story.
659120	664800	And yes, something else might come of it, but it won't be us if we mess with it too much.
665440	670560	But it is on a grand scale. Earth is a pretty resilient system.
673040	680320	Can you just clarify? It's fascinating. The shape of things, so the shape of the Milky Way
680320	687680	of the observable stuff is mostly flat. And you said Dark Matter tends to be spherical,
687760	693120	but a subset of that might be a flat disk. So you wanted to hear about the shape of things?
694160	701040	Yes, please. So structure formed early on, and now our structure that we live in is,
701040	706960	so we know about the Milky Way Galaxy. So the Milky Way Galaxy has the disk you can see in a
706960	715840	dry, dark place. That's where stars and light is. But you can also measure, in some ways,
715920	721280	that dark matter. And we believe that dark matter is more or less spherically distributed.
722880	727360	And like we said, there's a lot of it, not necessarily in the disk, but just because
727360	733120	it's a sphere, there's a lot of it sitting there. And the reason it doesn't collapse,
733120	737680	as far as we know, is that it doesn't really, it can't radiate the same way. So because it can
737680	742160	radiate ordinary matter collapses, and it's actually because of conservation of angular momentum,
742800	748880	it stays a disk and it doesn't just collapse to the center. So our suggestion was that maybe
748880	753280	there are some components of dark matter that also radiate. Like I said, that's far from proven.
753280	757920	People have looked for a disk. They see some evidence of some disks of certain densities. But
758880	762880	these are all questions that are worth asking. Basically, if we can figure it out from existing
762880	768160	measurements, why not try? Okay, so there's not all dark matters made the same? Well,
768160	772560	that's a possibility. We actually don't know what dark matter is. In the first place,
772560	776320	we don't know what most of it is. We don't know what a fraction is. I mean, it's hard to measure.
776320	779920	Why is it hard to measure? For exactly the reason you said earlier, we don't see it.
780480	786800	So we want to think of possibilities for what it can be, especially if those give rise to some
786800	792400	observational consequences. I mean, it's a tough game because it's not something that's just
792400	796080	there for the taking. You have to think about what it could be and how you might find it.
796160	801840	And the way you detect it is gravitational effects on things we can see.
801840	805440	That would be the way you detect the type of dark matter I've been talking about.
805440	810320	People have suggestions for other forms of dark matter. They could be particles called axions.
810320	814320	They could be other types of particles. And then there are different ways of detecting it. I mean,
814320	818400	the most popular candidate for dark matter, probably until pretty recently because they
818400	822560	haven't found it, is something called WIMPs, weekly interacting mass of particles.
823280	826400	Particles that have mass about the same as the Higgs boson mass.
827520	831200	And it turns out that you would get about the right density of dark matter.
831200	836400	But then people really like that, of course, because it is connected to the standard model,
836400	839760	the particles that we know about. And if it's connected to that,
839760	842960	we have a better chance of actually seeing it. Fortunately or unfortunately,
842960	845760	it's also a better chance that you can rule it out because you can look for it.
845760	848240	And so far, no one has found it. We're still looking for it.
848240	851680	Is that one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider?
851760	854720	That was originally one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider.
854720	859200	I'd say at this point, it would be very unlikely given what they've already
859760	866560	accomplished. But there are these underground detectors, xenon detectors that look for
866560	873840	dark matter coming in. And they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound
873840	875040	than it exists today.
875040	880720	Just take that tangent. Looking back now, what's the biggest to you in sight?
882560	886800	To humanity that the LHC has been able to provide?
887600	894080	It's interesting. It's both a major victory. The Higgs boson was proposed 50 years ago,
894080	898720	and it was discovered. The Higgs mechanism seemed to be the only way to explain elementary
898720	902240	particle masses, and it was right. So on the one hand, it was a major victory.
902880	905440	On the other hand, I've been in physics long enough to know it was also
906400	910400	a cautionary tale in some sense, because at the time I started out in physics,
911040	914640	we had some proposed something in the United States called the superconducting supercollider.
915520	920160	A lot of physicists, I'll say particularly in Europe, but I'd say a lot of physicists
920160	924560	were saying when that the Large Hadron Collider would have the energy reach necessary
925200	928880	to discover what underlies the standard model. We don't want to just discover the standard model,
928880	934080	we want to know what the next step is. And I think here, people were more cautious about that.
934080	937920	They wanted to have a more comprehensive search that could get to higher energies,
938560	942960	more events, so that we could really more definitively rule it out.
942960	946720	But in that case, many people thought they knew what would be there. It happened to be
946720	950400	a theory called supersymmetry. So a lot of physicists thought it would be supersymmetry.
950960	954400	I mean, it's one of the many factors, I think, that went into the fact that
954400	959920	the Large Hadron Collider became the only machine in town, and the superconducting supercollider
959920	963440	would have just been a much, if it really had achieved what it was supposed to,
963520	968560	would have been a much more robust test of the space. So I'd say for humanity,
968560	974640	it's both a tribute to the ability to discover and the ability of really believing in things,
974640	978240	so they have the confidence to go look for them. But it's also a cautionary tale that
978880	985040	you don't want to assume things before they've been actually found. So you want to do things in,
986080	989680	you want to believe in your theories, but you also want to question them at the same time
989680	991840	in ways that you're more likely to discover the truth.
992240	997280	But it's also an illustration of grand engineering efforts that humanity can take on,
998160	1001520	and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger.
1003280	1007120	I'm really glad you said that, though, too, because that's absolutely true. I mean,
1007680	1012320	it really is an impressive, it's impressive in so many ways. It's impressive
1012320	1017120	technologically, it's impressive at an engineering level. It's also impressive that so many countries
1017120	1023760	work together to do this. It wasn't just one country, and how it was, it was also impressive
1023760	1031360	in that it was a long-term project that people committed to and made it happen. So it is a
1031360	1036640	demonstration that when people set their minds to things and they commit to it, that they can do
1036640	1042560	something amazing. But also in the United States, maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things
1042560	1051120	down. Bureaucracy and politics, and economics, many things can make them faster and make them
1051120	1057600	slower. So science is the way to make progress. Politics is the way to slow that progress down.
1058640	1063280	Well, I don't want to overstate that because without politics, you know, the LEC won't happen
1063280	1073120	either. You need broccoli. But sometimes I do think, I mean, you're not asking this question,
1073120	1077440	but sometimes I do think when I think about some of these conflicts,
1079440	1085200	sometimes it's just good to have a project that people work on together. And there were some
1085200	1090000	efforts to do that in science, too, to have Palestinians and Israelis work together,
1090640	1095760	project called Sesame. I think it's not a bad idea when you can do that, when you can get,
1096400	1103600	you know, sort of forget the politics and just focus on some particular project,
1103600	1107840	sometimes that can work. Some kind of forcing function, some kind of deadline that gets people
1107840	1113680	to sit in a room together. And you're working on a thing, but as part of that, you realize
1113680	1118800	the common humanity, that you all have the same concerns, the same hopes, the same fears,
1118800	1123840	the same that you are all human. And that's an accidental side effect of working together
1123840	1128320	on a thing. That's absolutely true. And it's one of the reasons CERN was formed, actually.
1128320	1133600	It was post World War II. And a lot of European physicists had actually left Europe. And they
1133600	1140560	wanted to see Europeans work together and sort of rebuild. And it worked. I mean, they did.
1140560	1145440	And it's true. And I often think that, you know, one of the major problems is we just
1145440	1149520	don't meet enough people so that everyone thinks when they seem like the other,
1149520	1154800	it's more easy to forget their humanity. So I think it is important to have these connections.
1156240	1162160	Given the complexity, all cosmological scales involved here that led to the extension of
1162160	1168640	the dinosaurs, when you look out at the future of Earth, do you worry about future extinction
1168640	1173840	events? I do think that we might be in the middle of an extinction right now, if you
1173840	1179200	define it by the number of species that are getting killed off. And it's subtle, but it's
1179200	1186160	a complex system. The way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve. Sometimes
1186160	1192080	animals just move to another place. And the way we've developed the Earth, it's very hard for
1192080	1198080	species just to move somewhere else. And we're seeing that with people now too. I mean, I know
1198080	1202720	people are worried just about AI taking over. And that's a totally different story. We just
1202720	1207280	don't think about the future very much. We think about what we're doing now. And we certainly don't
1207280	1211600	think enough about all the animals that we're destroying, all the things that are precursors
1211600	1219360	to humans that we sort of rely on. It's interesting just to think whether the things that threaten us
1220480	1225440	is the stuff we see that's happening gradually, or the stuff we don't really see that's going to
1225440	1232000	happen all of a sudden. And sometimes I think about what should we be more worried about?
1232080	1237600	Because it seems like with the asteroids or nuclear war, it could be stuff that just happens
1237600	1246320	one day. When I say one day, meaning over a span of a few days or a few months, but not on a scale
1246320	1253760	of decades and centuries. Because we sometimes mostly talk about stuff that's happening gradually,
1254560	1259600	but we can be really surprised. It's actually really interesting. And that was actually one of
1259600	1265120	the reasons it took a while to determine what it was that it caused the last extinction. Because
1265120	1269920	people did think at the time, many people thought that things were more gradual. And the idea of
1269920	1276320	extinction was actually a novel concept at some point. I mean, these aren't predictable events
1276320	1283280	necessarily. They're only predictable on a grand scale. But sometimes they are. And I think
1283440	1290800	people were pretty aware that nuclear weapons were dangerous. I'm not sure people are as aware now
1290800	1298880	as they were, say, 20 or 30 years ago. And that certainly worries me. I have to say I was not as
1298880	1305520	worried about AI as other people, but now I understand. And it's more that as soon as you
1305520	1311440	create things that we lose control over, it's scary. And the other thing that we're learning from
1312000	1318160	the events today is that it takes a few bad actors. It takes everyone to make things work well.
1319040	1323920	It takes not that many things to make things go wrong. It's the issue with disease. We can find
1323920	1329440	out what causes a disease. But to make things better is not necessarily that simple. Sometimes it is.
1330000	1334720	But for things to be healthy, a lot of things have to work. For things to go wrong,
1334720	1340080	only one thing has to go wrong. And so it's amazing that we do it. And the same is true for
1340080	1345040	democracy, for democracy to work. A lot of people have to believe in it. A few bad actors can
1345040	1352480	destroy things sometimes. So a lot of the things that we really rely on are delicate
1352480	1357600	equilibrium situations. And there is some robustness in the systems. We try to build in robustness.
1358240	1364880	But a few extreme events can sometimes alter things. And I think that's what people are
1364880	1369120	scared of today in many ways. They're scared of it for democracy. They're scared of it for peace.
1369200	1373600	They're scared of it for AI. I think they're not as scared as they should be about nuclear weapons,
1373600	1379920	to be honest. I think that's a more serious danger than people realize. I think people are a little
1379920	1385360	bit more scared about pandemics than they were before. But I still say they're not super scared
1385360	1392160	about it. So you're right. There are these major events that can happen. And we are setting things
1392160	1396960	up so that they might happen. And we should be thinking about them. The question is who should
1396960	1400880	be thinking about them? How should we be thinking about them? How do you make things happen on a
1400880	1405200	global scale? Because that's really what we need. It certainly shouldn't be a source of division.
1405200	1411200	It should be a source of grand collaboration, probably. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah. I just
1411200	1416800	wonder what it would be like to be a dinosaur. It must have been beautiful to look at that
1416800	1424880	asteroid, just enter the atmosphere. Until everything just... Man, that would be one of the
1424880	1429600	things I would travel back in time to. That's just to watch it. That's also one of the things
1429600	1433680	that I think you probably could do with virtual reality. I don't think you have to be there and
1433680	1437440	get extinct. So you just explain that. I think there's something... It's an event. You're just
1437440	1441600	watching. You're not doing anything. You're just looking at it. So maybe you could just recreate it.
1441600	1448160	I actually heard that there's a nuclear weapon explosion experience in virtual reality that's
1448800	1456400	good to remind you about what it would feel like. I have to say, I got an award from the Museum of
1456400	1463040	Nuclear History and Technology in the Southwest. I went to visit the museum, which turned out to
1463040	1470560	be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons. The scary thing is that they look really cool. It's true
1470560	1475760	that you have that, yes, this is scary, but you also have this, this is cool feeling. I think
1475760	1481120	we have to get around that because I kind of think that, yes, you can be in that, but I'm not
1481120	1486640	sure that's going to make people scared. Have they actually asked afterwards, are you more or less
1486640	1493680	scared? That's a good... That's a really good point. I mean, that's a good summary of just humanity in
1493680	1501360	general. We're attracted to creating cool stuff even though it can be dangerous. Actually,
1501360	1504960	that was the really interesting thing about visiting that museum actually. It was very nice
1504960	1508800	because I had a tour from people who had been working there on the Cold War and actually
1508800	1513600	one or two people from the Manhattan Project. It was a very cool tour. You just realized just how
1514640	1518160	just the thing itself gets you so excited. I think that's something that sometimes these
1518160	1522880	movies miss. Just the thing itself, you're not thinking about the overall consequences.
1524400	1528400	In some ways, it was like the early Silicon Valley. People were just thinking, what if we did
1528400	1534320	this? What if we did that? Not keeping track of what the peripheral consequences are.
1535600	1539040	You definitely see that happening with AI now. I think that was the moral of the
1539040	1542560	battle that just happened, that it's just full speed ahead.
1543280	1550000	Which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book. You write about
1550000	1555840	the experience of facing the sublime in physics and you quote Ryan Arilke.
1557600	1563520	For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure,
1563600	1569680	and we're so odd because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. It's pretty intense.
1570480	1572400	I think it applies to nuclear weapons.
1574080	1580560	At a more mundane perhaps level, I think it applies. It's really interesting. One of the
1580560	1588720	things I found when I wrote these books is some people love certainty. Scientists many
1588720	1592240	revel in uncertainty. It's not that you want to be uncertain. You want to solve it.
1593200	1597280	You're at this edge where it's really frustrating because you don't really want to not know the
1597280	1602560	answer. Of course, if you knew the answer, that would be done. You're always at this
1602560	1608240	edge where you're trying to sort things out. There is something scary. You don't know if
1608240	1611440	there's going to be a solution. You don't know if you're going to find it. It's not something
1611440	1615760	that can destroy the Earth. It's just something that you do on your individual level. Then,
1615760	1619760	of course, there are much bigger things like the ones you're talking about where they could
1619760	1624080	actually be dangerous. The stuff I do, I just want to be clear. I'm doing theoretical physics,
1624080	1629520	not very dangerous, but sometimes things end up having bigger consequences than you think.
1630240	1637920	Yeah, but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense, but isn't it still in part terrifying when you
1638560	1647040	think of just the size of things? The power of this thing in terms of
1648000	1654160	its potential gravitational effects, just the cosmological objects of a black hole at the
1654160	1659680	center of our galaxy. This might be why I'm a physicist or why I differ from other people,
1659680	1666400	because I'm not such a big fan of humanity in some ways. Some ways I am. The idea that we were
1666400	1670560	everything would be really boring to me. I love the idea that there's so much more out there,
1670560	1674560	that there's a bigger universe and there's lots to discover and that we're not all there is.
1675120	1676880	I'm going to be disappointing if we were all there is.
1677840	1683440	Yeah, and the full diversity of other stuff is pretty interesting.
1684080	1689760	We have no idea how much there is. We know what we can observe so far. The idea that there's other
1689760	1695360	stuff out there that we yet have to figure out, it's exciting. Let me ask you an out-there question.
1695440	1701840	Uh-oh. Okay. So if you think of humans on earth, life on earth,
1702720	1709600	as this pocket of complexity that emerged, and there's a bunch of conditions that came to be,
1709600	1717280	and there's Darwinian evolution, however life originated, do you think it's possible there's
1717280	1722480	some pockets of complexity of that sort inside dark matter that we can't see?
1722480	1729440	So that's possible. Chemistry and biology evolving in different ways.
1729440	1733760	And that's one of the reasons we suggest. I mean, it's not the reason, but it would be true if
1733760	1738400	there were that type of interactions we'd suggest. I mean, it would need more complex ones.
1739040	1745760	And we don't know. I will say that the conditions that give rise to life and complexity,
1746480	1752080	they're complex, they're unlikely. So it's not like there's great odds that would happen.
1752880	1756720	But there's no reason to know that it doesn't happen. It's worth investigating,
1756720	1760160	are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector? That's exactly it.
1760160	1766000	So the dark matter sector doesn't have all the forces of the standard model of physics?
1766000	1769680	Right. As far as we know, it doesn't have any. It might have it at some low level,
1769680	1774640	but it could have its own forces, just like the dark matter might not experience our light.
1774640	1778080	Maybe it has its light that we don't experience.
1778080	1779920	So there could be other kinds of forces?
1780560	1785120	I mean, there could be other kinds of forces even within our sector that are too weak for us
1785120	1788880	to have discovered so far, or that exist at different scales than we know about.
1789520	1794720	I mean, we detect what interacts strongly enough with our detectors to detect.
1795440	1800320	So it's worth asking. And that's one of the reasons we build big colliders to see, are there
1801600	1807360	other forces, other particles that exist, say, at higher energies at shorter distance scales
1807360	1812800	than we've explored so far? So it's not just in the dark matter sector, even in our sector.
1813360	1815440	There could be a whole bunch of stuff we don't yet know.
1816640	1820960	So maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard model of particle physics.
1821600	1826720	How does dark matter fit into it? First of all, what is it? Can you explain what the standard model is?
1827680	1834960	So the standard model of particle physics is basically tells us about nature's most basic
1834960	1840400	elements and their interactions. And so it's the substructure as far as we understand it.
1841040	1843840	So if you look at atoms, we know they have nuclei and electrons.
1844720	1850320	Nuclei have protons and neutrons in them. Protons and neutrons have particles called quarks
1850960	1853280	that are held together by something called the strong force.
1854160	1859120	They interact through the strong force, the strong nuclear force,
1859120	1861840	with something called the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism.
1862720	1868000	So basically all those particles and their interactions describe many, many things we
1868000	1872320	understand. That's the standard model. We now know about the Higgs boson,
1873200	1878640	which is associated with how elementary particles get their mass. So that piece of the puzzle has
1878640	1884480	also been completed. We also know that there are kind of a weird array of masses of elementary
1884480	1889440	particles. There's not just the up and down quark, but there are heavier versions of the up and down
1889440	1894640	quark, charm and strange top and bottom. There's not just the electron, there's a muon and a tau.
1895200	1898320	There are particles called neutrinos, which are under intense study now,
1898880	1903360	which are partnered with the leptons through the weak interactions. So we really do know
1903360	1909040	these basic elements. And we know the forces, we know, I mean, when we're doing particle
1909040	1914080	physics experiments, we can usually even ignore gravity, except in exceptional cases that we
1914080	1920320	can talk about. So those are the basic elements in their interactions. Dark matter stands outside
1920320	1926160	that it's not interacting through those forces. So when we look at the world around us, we don't
1926160	1930400	usually see the effects of dark matter. It's because there's so much of it that we do,
1930400	1936080	and it doesn't have those forces that we know about. But the standard model has worked spectacularly
1936080	1941120	while it's been tested to a high degree of precision. People are still testing it. And
1941120	1946000	one of the things we do as physicists is we actually wanted to break down on some of it.
1946000	1951360	We're looking for the precision measurement or the energy or whatever it will take,
1951360	1956800	where the standard model is no longer working. Not that it's not working
1956800	1961360	approximately, but we're looking for the deviations. And those deviations are critical
1961360	1965840	because they can tell us what underlies the standard model, which is what we really want to see next.
1965840	1968640	Where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down?
1968960	1972320	Like what are the places you can see those tiny little deviations?
1972880	1977120	So we don't know yet, but we know the kinds of things you wouldn't want to look for.
1977120	1982480	So one obvious place to look is at higher energy. We're looking at the large hadron collider,
1982480	1987680	but we'd love to go beyond that. Higher energy means shorter distances, and it means things
1987680	1992160	that we just couldn't produce before. I mean, E equals mc squared. So if you have a heavy
1992160	1996800	particle and you don't have enough energy to make it, you'll never see it. So that's one place.
1996880	2001280	The other place is precision measurements. You know, the standard model has been tested
2001280	2006480	exquisitely. So if it's been tested at 1%, you want to look at a tenth of a percent.
2007040	2010800	And there are some processes that we know shouldn't even happen at all in the standard model or happen
2010800	2016480	at a very suppressed level. And those are other things that we look for. So all of those things
2016480	2021200	could indicate there's something beyond what we know about, which of course would be very exciting.
2021440	2027520	When you just step back and look at the standard model, the quarks and all the different particles
2027520	2038080	and neutrinos, isn't it wild how this little system came to being creates, underpins everything we see?
2039040	2042400	Absolutely. And that's why we'd like to understand it better. We want to know,
2042960	2047440	is it part of some bigger sector? Why are these particles, why do they have the masses they do?
2048400	2051440	Why is it exposed and so light compared to the mass it could have had,
2051440	2056720	which we might have even expected based on the principles of special relativity and quantum
2056720	2062000	mechanics? So that's a really big question. Why are they what they are? And they originate,
2062000	2065920	there's like some mechanism that created the whole thing? That's one of the things we're trying to
2065920	2073440	study. Why is it what it is? I mean, even just like the mechanism that creates stuff, like the way a
2073520	2080560	human being is created from a single cell to embryogenesis, like the whole thing,
2080560	2087200	like you build up this thing, all of it, this whole thing comes to be from just like a tiny little-
2087200	2088960	Don't forget, it is interacting with the environment.
2089600	2092720	Sure. Okay, right, right, right. It's not, it's not, right.
2092720	2093440	It's important.
2093440	2096960	Well, that's a really good question is how much of it is the environment? Is it just
2097920	2101120	the environment acting on a set of constraints and
2102880	2107040	like how much of it is just the information in the DNA or the information?
2107040	2114560	How much is it in the initial conditions of the universe versus the some other thing acting on it?
2114560	2117920	These are big questions. These are big questions in pretty much every field.
2119280	2124000	You know, we, for the universe, we do consider it, you know, it's everything there is
2124000	2130240	by definition, but people now think about it as one of many universes in, of course,
2130240	2134800	it's a misnomer, but could there be other places where there are self-contained gravitational
2134800	2139920	systems that we don't even interact with? So, but those are really important questions.
2139920	2143440	And the only way we're going to answer them is, you know, we go back as far as we can.
2143440	2147840	We try to think theoretically and we try to think about observational consequences.
2147840	2149120	That's all we can do.
2149120	2152320	One interesting way to explore the standard model is to look at your
2153520	2158400	fun, nuanced disagreement with Carlo Revelli.
2160160	2164640	When you talked about him writing in his book, electrons don't always exist.
2164640	2169120	They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else.
2169120	2173200	And you wrote that, well, I'll just read the whole thing because it's kind of interesting.
2173200	2176720	Stocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded,
2176720	2180880	but that doesn't mean we can't approximate their worth until they change hands.
2180880	2186000	Similarly, electrons might not have definite properties, but they do exist.
2186640	2191680	It's true that the electron doesn't exist as a classical object with definite
2191680	2196960	position until the position is measured, but something was there which physicists
2196960	2201520	use a wave function to describe. It's a fascinating nuanced disagreement.
2202000	2208160	Do electrons always exist or not? Does a tree fall in the forest if nobody's there to see it?
2208160	2211440	So I like to think of the universe as being out there whether or not.
2211440	2215440	I mean, it would be really weird if the only time things came into existence was when I
2215440	2218000	saw them or I measured them. There's a lot of weird stuff.
2218000	2221600	I mean, I could believe that the Middle East doesn't exist because I'm not there now.
2221600	2224880	I mean, that would be kind of ridiculous. I think we would all agree on that.
2225440	2230000	So I think there's only so much that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing.
2230560	2234960	So and the whole system doesn't come into being because I'm measuring it.
2235520	2239520	And so what is weird, and this isn't even a disagreement about the standard model.
2239520	2242240	This is a disagreement about how you interpret quantum mechanics.
2242240	2245040	I mean, I would say that those wave functions are real.
2245040	2248960	I mean, one of the things that don't forget that particle physics does that
2248960	2252560	quantum field theory says is that electrons can be created and destroyed.
2252560	2254640	It's not that every electron has to be in the universe.
2254640	2257120	I mean, that can be, I mean, that's what happens at colliders.
2257200	2258880	Particles get created and destroyed.
2260160	2263760	But that doesn't mean that if I have an electron in an atom, it's not there.
2263760	2266240	It's really there. And we know about it. It's charge is there.
2267120	2269760	So physics is a kind of way to see the world.
2271280	2274800	So at the bottom, what's the bottom turtle?
2275840	2278160	Do you have a sense that there's a bottom reality
2278800	2281120	that we're trying to approximate with physics?
2281120	2284560	I think we always have in our head, maybe, that we'd like to find that.
2284560	2287680	But I have to, I mean, I might not seem so,
2287680	2289520	but I think I'm kind of more humble than a lot of physicists.
2289520	2292720	I'm not sure that we're ever going to get to that bottom level.
2292720	2296240	But I do think we're going to keep penetrating different layers and get further.
2296240	2299360	I just wonder how far away we are, you know?
2300080	2300880	We all wonder that.
2301600	2304640	It's not even like, what's even the measure of how far away we are?
2304640	2307360	I mean, one way you can measure it is just by our everyday lives.
2307360	2309360	In terms of our everyday lives, we've measured everything.
2309920	2313280	In terms of what underlies it, there's a lot more to see.
2313280	2316720	And so part of it has to do with how far we think we can go.
2316720	2320960	I mean, it might be that the nature of reality changes so much that
2320960	2322720	even these terms are different.
2322720	2327760	Maybe we'll measure, you know, the notion of distance itself might break down at some point.
2328800	2331120	But also to push back on that we've measured everything,
2331120	2333920	maybe there's stuff we haven't even considered as measurable.
2333920	2336720	For example, consciousness or there's,
2338320	2342720	there might be stuff just like you said, forces unseen undetected.
2342720	2343840	So it's an interesting thing.
2343840	2347360	So one, and this is often a confusion that happens.
2347360	2349920	So there's sort of the fundamental stuff underlying it.
2350480	2352400	And then there's sort of the higher levels, what, you know,
2352400	2355680	what we'll call like an effective theory at some level, you know?
2355680	2357280	So we're not always working.
2357280	2360400	I mean, when I throw a ball, I don't tell you where every atom is.
2360400	2361440	I tell you there's a ball.
2362080	2366240	And so there might be different layers of reality that are built on terms,
2366240	2370400	on terms of the matter that we know about in terms of the stuff we know about that.
2370400	2374800	And when I say we've measured everything, I say that with a grain of salt.
2374800	2377440	I mean, I measure everything about the standard mom.
2377440	2382160	So, so there's lots of phenomena that we don't understand that we,
2382160	2385520	but often there are complex phenomena that will be given in terms
2385520	2387600	of the fundamental ingredients that we know about.
2387600	2391600	But that is an interesting question because yes, there's phenomena that are
2391600	2394160	at the higher level of abstractions that emerge.
2394160	2398400	But maybe like with consciousness, there is far out people that,
2398400	2402240	you know, think that consciousness is panpsychist, right?
2402240	2407520	That there's going to be almost like a fundamental force of physics
2407520	2409840	that's consciousness that permeates all matter, right?
2409840	2414080	I mean, usually when you have a crazy, sorry, okay, when you have a far out theory,
2414080	2418800	the thing you do is you test all the possibilities within the constructs that exist.
2419520	2422320	So you don't just jump to the most far out possibility.
2422320	2423440	I mean, you can do that.
2423440	2426720	But then to see if it's true, you either have to find evidence of it,
2426720	2429280	or you have to show that it's not possible without that.
2430800	2432400	And we're very far from that.
2432400	2436800	I think one of the criticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that
2436800	2441120	it requires, if I remember correctly, for dark matter to be weirder than it already is.
2442320	2444800	And then I think you had a clever response to that.
2444800	2446320	Can you remind?
2446320	2448240	I'm not sure I remember why I said them, but I mean,
2448240	2450320	we have no idea how weird dark matter is.
2450320	2453440	I mean, it's based on everyone thinking they know what dark matter is.
2453440	2455040	I mean, so weirder than it already is.
2455040	2456480	I mean, it's not already anything.
2456480	2457680	We don't know what it is.
2457680	2459200	So there's no normalization here.
2460560	2465040	So dark matter, do we know that if dark matter varies in density?
2465040	2466480	It definitely does in the universe.
2466480	2470720	Just like, I mean, so for example, there's more dark matter in galaxies
2470720	2472640	than there is between galaxies.
2472640	2473920	So it clumps.
2473920	2475520	I mean, so it's matter.
2475520	2477200	So it's distributed like matter.
2477200	2477840	It is matter.
2478720	2479920	It does clump.
2479920	2485520	But the full details of how it clumps and the complexity of the clumping.
2485600	2487920	It's understood pretty well.
2487920	2489040	People do simulations.
2489040	2492720	I mean, where people are always looking for things,
2492720	2496000	including us as particle physics, it's sort of at small scales.
2496000	2497680	Are the deviations on small scales?
2497680	2501040	So that indicating other interactions or other processes
2501040	2504640	or interactions with variants that is to say normal matter
2504640	2506080	that we don't understand.
2506080	2508480	But on large scales, we have a pretty good understanding
2508480	2509680	of dark matter distribution.
2510400	2513440	You were part of a recent debate on, quote,
2513520	2515120	can science uncover reality?
2516000	2517200	Let me ask you this question then.
2518000	2519600	What do you think is the limits of science?
2520800	2522640	I'm smart enough to know I have no idea.
2523440	2526400	And also, it's not even clear what science means, right?
2526400	2530240	Because there's the science that we do, which is particle physics.
2530240	2534080	We try to find fundamental things and figure out what their effects are.
2534080	2537760	There's science like biology where, you know, it's at a higher level.
2537760	2539360	The kind of questions you ask are different.
2539360	2540640	The kind of measurements are different.
2541600	2545760	The kind of science that's going to happen in the sort of more numerical age,
2545760	2550080	I mean, or even AI, or like, what does it mean to answer a question?
2550080	2551680	Does it mean that we can predict it?
2551680	2553120	Does it mean that we can reproduce it?
2553680	2556720	So I think we're coming up against sort of the definition
2556720	2559040	of what we mean by science as human beings.
2559840	2563440	So in terms of the science that we can do,
2563440	2565840	I don't think we'll know it until we get there.
2565840	2568160	I'm, you know, we're trying to solve hard problems.
2568160	2570080	And, you know, we've made progress.
2570080	2574480	I mean, if you think of how much science has advanced in the last century or century and a half,
2574480	2575280	it's incredible.
2575280	2578320	I mean, you know, we didn't even know the universe was expanding
2578320	2580080	at the beginning of the 20th century.
2580080	2582000	We didn't know about quantum mechanics in the beginning of the century.
2582000	2583520	We didn't know about special relativity.
2583520	2586720	That's a lot in a relatively short time on,
2587600	2589040	depending on how you think of time.
2590480	2594400	So I think it would be premature to say we know the limitations.
2594400	2597600	And at various points throughout that history, we thought we solved everything
2597600	2599520	or declared or at least various people.
2599520	2600800	Where we was various people.
2600800	2601200	Exactly.
2601200	2601600	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2601600	2603600	Declared that we've solved everything.
2603600	2608480	So this is also a good place to, maybe could you describe the difference between top down
2608480	2612000	and bottom up approaches to theoretical physics that you talked about in the book?
2612800	2618320	So you could try to jump in and say, I have a theory that I think is so perfect
2620160	2626080	that I can predict everything from it or at least predict some salient features from it.
2626080	2627120	That's top down.
2627120	2628560	That would be top down.
2628560	2632480	Bottom up is more like the questions we just asked.
2632480	2633600	Why are masses what they are?
2633600	2634800	We measure things.
2634800	2635920	We want to put them together.
2636480	2638720	And usually a good approach is to combine the two.
2638720	2643040	If you ask a very specific question, but combine it with the methods of
2643840	2647040	knowing that there could be a fundamental theory and denying it.
2647040	2648160	Sometimes you make progress.
2649280	2654480	The community tends to get segmented or fragmented into people who do one or the other.
2654480	2658000	But there are definitely times, I mean, some of my best collaborations have been
2658000	2660000	with people who were more top down than I am.
2660000	2663760	So that we come up with interesting ideas that we went to thought of if either one
2663760	2665440	of us was working individually.
2665440	2669520	Would you say the truly big leaps happened top down like Einstein?
2670240	2673360	Einstein was not a top down person in the beginning.
2673360	2675760	He was special relativity.
2675760	2678960	It was very much him thinking about, you know, they were thought experiments,
2678960	2682480	but he was very much, you know, the original theory about relativity
2682480	2687120	is something like on the nature of electromagnetism, he was trying to understand
2687120	2692560	how Maxwell's laws could make sense when they were, you know, seem to have different
2692560	2694480	symmetries than what we had thought they were.
2694480	2696640	So he was very much a bottom up person.
2696640	2699440	In fact, he resisted top down for a long time.
2699440	2703120	Then when he tried to do the theory of general relativity or the general theory of relativity,
2703120	2708080	whichever you want to call it, incorporating gravity into the system where you need some
2708080	2713840	feedback, then he was helped by a mathematician who had developed some differential geometry
2713840	2716080	and helped him figure out how to write down that.
2716080	2718320	And after that, he thought top down was the way to go,
2718320	2720240	but he actually didn't make that much progress.
2721120	2725520	But certainly, so I think it's, you know, naive to think it was just one or the other.
2726160	2730400	In fact, a lot of people who made real progress were rooted in actual measurements.
2731040	2734800	Well, speaking of mathematicians, what do you use a difference?
2735520	2738960	Because you've had a bit of a foot in both between physics and mathematics
2738960	2740640	in the way it helps us understand the world.
2741120	2746000	Well, to be frank, there's a lot more overlap in physics and math, I think, than has been.
2746000	2748720	I mean, well, maybe not more, but there's certainly a lot.
2748720	2753440	But I think, again, the kinds of questions you're asking are usually different.
2754080	2759200	Mathematicians like the structure itself, physicists are trying to concentrate on,
2759200	2761360	to some extent, on the consequences for the world.
2762480	2763840	But there is a lot of overlap.
2764800	2766160	The string theory is an example.
2766160	2771680	There's certain theories where there's a certain kind of mathematical beauty to it.
2772320	2776640	There's also, you know, there's also some really cool ideas that you get in particle physics
2776640	2779440	where you can describe what's going on and connect it to other ideas.
2779440	2780640	That's also really beautiful.
2781920	2784720	You know, I think, I think basically insights can be beautiful.
2785760	2790000	You know, they might seem simple, but sometimes and sometimes they genuinely are.
2790000	2794640	And sometimes they're built on a whole system that you have to understand before.
2794640	2797680	I mean, if you actually saw Einstein's equations written out in components,
2798400	2799680	you wouldn't think it's so beautiful.
2799680	2801200	You write in a compact way.
2801200	2801760	It looks nice.
2803280	2807040	What do you think about the successes and the failures of string theory?
2807840	2810320	To what degree do you think it succeeded?
2810320	2813600	To what degree is it not succeeded yet or has failed?
2814400	2819600	I think to talk about any science in terms of success and failure often misses the point,
2819600	2821760	because there's not some absolute thing.
2821760	2827280	And I think I do think that string theorists were a bit overly ambitious,
2827280	2830800	not overly ambitious, but a little bit overly arrogant in the beginning,
2830800	2833840	thinking they could solve many problems that they weren't going to solve.
2833840	2838000	That's not to say the methods and advances in string theory don't exist.
2839840	2843760	But they certainly weren't able to immediately solve all the problems I thought they could solve.
2844480	2846880	But it has given us tools.
2846880	2848480	It has given us some insights.
2850320	2855040	But it becomes almost a sociological question of how much it should be one or the other.
2855040	2857840	I do think that you can get caught up in the problems themselves.
2858800	2862640	And sometimes you can get caught up in the methods and just do other examples.
2863280	2867520	So the real physics insights often come from people who are thinking about physics as well as
2868400	2869360	the math.
2869360	2875440	Because you mentioned AI, is there hope that AI might be able to help
2875840	2879680	find some interesting insights?
2879680	2882800	I mean, another question, another way to ask this question is,
2882800	2887520	how special are humans that we're able to discover novel insights about the world?
2888960	2889920	That's a great question.
2891680	2894560	And it depends on what kind of insights and we're going to find that out.
2894560	2900560	I mean, you know, it's because it's hard to think about something that doesn't quite exist yet.
2900560	2903840	I mean, I could just think about something, take a step back.
2903840	2906640	You know, it's a little bit like trying to understand three, four dimensions,
2906640	2910160	you go back to three dimensions, you know, so to go to something you can imagine.
2910720	2916160	So you can sort of say a lot of the things in a very different level about the internet.
2916160	2920320	You could say, you know, has the internet helped do things?
2920320	2923600	And that's, you know, it definitely took on a life of its own in some sense.
2923600	2926480	But it's also something that we're able to tame.
2926480	2930720	You know, I know that I myself wouldn't have been able to write books if the internet didn't exist
2930720	2933280	because I wouldn't have had the time to go to the library and look everything up.
2933840	2936880	And it helped me enormously.
2936880	2941360	And in some sense, AI could be that in a very nice world.
2941360	2948320	It could be a tool that helps us go a step further than we would and a lot more efficiently.
2948320	2950400	And it's already done that to some extent.
2951120	2955040	Or it could be like the parts of the internet that we can control that are
2955040	2957360	ruining politics or whatever.
2957360	2960000	So and there's certainly a lot of indications that can do that.
2960560	2964720	Then there are even bigger things that, you know, people speculate about,
2964720	2967040	about AI being able to do its own things.
2967040	2972080	But in terms of actually figuring things out, you know, we're in the early stages.
2973440	2974800	Yeah, there's several directions here.
2974800	2976480	One is like on the theorem proof side.
2976480	2979440	So Wolfram Alpha where everything is much more precise.
2979440	2982640	And we have large language model type of stuff.
2984000	2988960	One of the limitations of those is it seems to come up with convincing looking things,
2989520	2991200	which we don't know if it's true or not.
2992160	2994000	And that's a big problem for physics.
2994000	2998560	So large language models are more or less like generalizations of stuff that we have.
2998560	3004320	So the question is, so there's still breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen.
3004320	3006640	And maybe they are happening and maybe they'll be good.
3006640	3007200	Maybe not.
3007200	3009760	But that's not quite the same.
3009760	3014960	I mean, maybe to some in some cases, it's just pattern recognition that leads to important things.
3015600	3020080	But sometimes it could be something more insightful than that that I can't even put my finger on.
3020800	3025120	So it forces us to, I mean, we don't really understand how smart we are.
3025120	3028240	We don't understand how we think about things all that well, actually.
3028240	3032560	But one thing is true that we are a lot more efficient right now than computers.
3032560	3035200	And coming up with things, we require a lot less energy to do that.
3035760	3041520	So if computers figure out how to do that, then it's going to be a totally different ball game.
3042080	3045280	And so there are clearly kinds of connections that we don't know how we're making,
3045280	3046640	but we are making them.
3047200	3050000	And so that's going to be interesting.
3050000	3054640	So I say we're in early stages, but this is changing very rapidly.
3055600	3062880	But right now, I don't think that it's actually discovered new laws of physics.
3062880	3064640	But could it in the future?
3064640	3065360	Maybe it can.
3066080	3073440	It will raise big questions about what is special about humans that we don't quite appreciate.
3074880	3081120	There could be things that are like that leap of insight that happens, truly novel ideas.
3081920	3084800	That could potentially be very difficult to do.
3086240	3088720	So there are sort of abstract questions like that.
3088720	3093520	There's also questions of how is it that we can address to some extent,
3094320	3097200	how will AI be used in the context of the world we live in?
3099200	3102400	At least our country is based on capitalism and a certain political system.
3102960	3105680	And how will global politics deal with it?
3105680	3108320	How will our capitalist system deal with it?
3108320	3111360	What will be the things that we focus on doing with it?
3111360	3117360	How much will researchers get control of it to be able to ask different sorts of questions?
3117360	3121840	I mean, while it was starting out, people were doing these kind of toy problems.
3121840	3123920	But what will it actually be applied to?
3123920	3126000	And what will it be optimized to do?
3126000	3130000	There's a lot of questions out there that it's really important we start addressing.
3131840	3140400	What to you is the most beautiful and solved problem in physics and cosmology?
3140400	3146880	What to you is really exciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades.
3146960	3151520	So is it what's the most beautiful and solved problem?
3151520	3153120	Or what is the most beautiful and solved problem?
3153120	3154320	I think we can make progress on.
3155760	3160400	Oh boy, we make progress on in the next few centuries.
3163360	3166960	Most of the questions, the big questions have to do with what underlies things,
3166960	3169360	how things started, what's at the base of it.
3169360	3172240	There's also just basic questions like that you asked earlier,
3172240	3173920	how far will science take us?
3173920	3175280	How much can we understand?
3176160	3182240	There are questions like how we got here, what underlies it, are there, you know,
3182240	3187200	but also, I mean, there's really deep questions like, you know, what fraction
3187200	3188320	are we actually seeing?
3188320	3191280	If there are these other forces, if there is another way of seeing the world,
3192000	3196400	are there galaxies, you know, universes beyond their own that if there's so totally different,
3196400	3197760	how do we even comprehend them?
3197760	3200800	I mean, how do we detect like, what would we even think about them?
3201360	3205760	So there's a lot about trying to get beyond.
3206400	3211360	It's always just getting beyond our limited vision and limited experience
3211360	3215360	and trying to see what underlies it, both at small scales and at large scales.
3215360	3217040	We just don't know the answers.
3217040	3220720	I mean, I'd like to think that we understand more about dark matter,
3220720	3224560	about dark energy, about are there extra dimensions, things that we actually work on.
3224560	3227760	Because there's probably a lot beyond what we work on that's yet to be discovered.
3228640	3231840	Yeah, understanding the extra dimensions piece
3234080	3235280	will be really interesting.
3235840	3236320	Totally.
3237040	3241440	I mean, if it is, you know, how the universe went from higher dimensions to what we see,
3244000	3246000	are the extra dimensions present everywhere?
3246000	3249680	I mean, you know, one of the really interesting pieces of physics we did,
3249680	3254560	that I talked about in my first book, War Procedures, is finding out that there can be
3255520	3259200	a higher dimension, but only locally do you think there's a gravity of a lower dimension.
3259760	3262880	So it could be like, only locally do we think we live in three dimensions,
3262880	3264880	that could be higher dimensions is different.
3264880	3268640	That's not actually the gravity we have, but there's all sorts of phenomena that might be
3268640	3270080	out there that we don't know about.
3270080	3273040	All sorts of evolution things, time dependence that we don't know about.
3274160	3276000	And of course, that's from the point of view of particle physics,
3276000	3278800	from the point of view of other kinds of physics, we're just beginning.
3278800	3279360	So who knows?
3280320	3285440	Yeah, if the physics changes throughout, is not homogeneous throughout the universe, that's,
3286720	3287520	that'll be weird.
3288240	3293120	I mean, you know, for the observable universe, it's the same, but beyond the observable universe,
3293120	3293520	who knows?
3294560	3296160	What advice would you give?
3298640	3300320	You've had an exceptional career.
3300320	3303440	What advice would you give to young people, maybe high school, college,
3304640	3309200	on how to have a career that can be proud of and a life that can be proud of?
3309840	3314080	I think the weird thing about being a scientist or an academic in general is,
3314080	3317120	you have to believe really strongly in what you do while questioning it all the time.
3317840	3320640	You can't, you know, and that's, that's a hard balance to have.
3320640	3324800	Sometimes it helps to collaborate with people, but to really believe that you could have good
3324800	3326960	ideas at the same time, knowing they could all be wrong.
3326960	3332560	That's, that's, that's a tough tightrope to walk sometimes, but to really test them out.
3334160	3338080	The other thing is sometimes, you know, if you get too far buried,
3338080	3342480	you look out and you think, oh, there's so much out there, and sometimes it's just good to
3342480	3346160	bring it back home and just think, okay, can I have as good ideas as the person next to me,
3346160	3348720	rather than, you know, the greatest physicist who ever lived.
3349360	3354320	But right now, like you said, I think there's lots of big issues out there and it's hard to
3354320	3354880	balance that.
3354880	3360320	And sometimes it's hard to forget the role of physics, but I think, you know, Wilson said it
3360320	3364640	really well when he said, you know, when they were building Fermilab, it was like,
3364640	3367600	this won't defend the country, but it'll make it worth defending.
3367600	3371600	You know, there's just the idea that, you know, in all this chaos, it's still important that we
3371600	3372880	still make progress in these things.
3372880	3376720	And sometimes, you know, when major world events are happening, it's easy to forget that.
3377280	3378480	And I think those are important too.
3378480	3382080	You don't want to forget those, but to try to keep that balance because we don't want to
3382080	3383760	lose what it is that makes humans special.
3384480	3385520	So that's the big picture.
3385520	3389040	Would you also lose yourself in the simple joy of puzzle solving?
3389040	3390000	Yeah. Yeah.
3390560	3393840	I mean, that's, we all like solving puzzles.
3394480	3398400	And actually one of the things that drives me in my research is inconsistencies.
3398400	3400720	When things don't make sense, it really bugs me.
3400720	3405360	And it just will go in, you know, different directions to see how could these things fit
3405360	3406080	together.
3406080	3408720	So it bugs you, but that motivates you.
3408720	3409520	Yeah, totally.
3409520	3410640	Until it doesn't.
3410640	3414000	Because I think, because I have this underlying belief that it should make sense,
3414000	3418320	even though the world comes at you in many ways and tells you nothing should make sense.
3418320	3421920	But if you believe that it makes sense, then you look for underlying logic.
3422000	3424800	And I think that's just good advice for everything to try to find like,
3424800	3425920	why is it the way it is?
3426720	3429760	I think, you know, we talk, I talk about effective theory in my second book,
3429760	3431360	not going to have his door a lot.
3431360	3433840	You know, it's sort of rather than ask the big questions.
3433840	3437920	Sometimes we just ask the questions about the immediate things that we can measure.
3437920	3441040	And we can, like I said, we can sometimes tell one that will fail,
3441040	3442640	but we can have these effective theories.
3442640	3445920	And sometimes I think, you know, when we approach these big questions,
3445920	3448160	it's good to do an effective theory point.
3448160	3449840	You know, why do I find this satisfying?
3449840	3451840	Why is the world we have the way it is?
3451840	3454160	We think things are beautiful that we live in.
3454160	3457440	I mean, you know, I'm not sure if we had different senses
3457440	3460000	or different ways of looking at things, we wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful.
3460640	3465120	But I have to say, you know, it is kind of fantastic that no matter how many times I
3465120	3467280	see a sunset, I will always find it beautiful.
3467280	3470640	It's like, I don't think I ever see a sunset as a whatever.
3470640	3471920	You know, it's just always beautiful.
3471920	3475360	You'll always, you know, and so there's, there are things as humans, you know,
3475360	3478880	clearly resonate with us, but, you know, we were maybe evolved that way.
3478880	3479680	That's about us.
3480640	3482640	But in terms of figuring out the universe,
3482640	3484800	it's kind of amazing how far we've gotten.
3484800	3487760	You know, we have discovered many, many wonderful things,
3488560	3489760	but there's a lot more out there.
3490320	3492960	And I hope, I hope we have the opportunity to keep going.
3493760	3496960	And with effective theories, one small step at a time,
3497600	3499040	just keep unraveling the mystery.
3499040	3500880	But also having in mind the big questions,
3500880	3503120	but doing one small step at a time, exactly.
3503120	3506160	Yeah, looking out to the stars, you said the sunset.
3506160	3510800	For me, it's the sunset, the sunrise, and just looking at the stars.
3511600	3518880	It's wondering what's all out there and having a lot of hope that humans will figure it out.
3519520	3520720	Right. I like it.
3522080	3529120	Lisa, thank you for being one of the humans in the world for that are pushing it forward and
3529120	3531280	figuring out this beautiful puzzle of ours.
3531280	3532480	And thank you for talking today.
3532480	3533360	This is amazing.
3533360	3533760	Thank you.
3534720	3537600	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lisa Randall.
3537600	3540800	To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
3541360	3544400	And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.
3545040	3547920	The important thing is to not stop questioning.
3548560	3551760	Curiosity has its own reason for existence.
3552720	3555200	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
