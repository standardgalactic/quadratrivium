00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
The universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.240
You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.640
It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.320
And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.160
That's mortality.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.520
Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

00:22.760 --> 00:28.880
It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

00:29.320 --> 00:36.280
So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever all the projects

00:36.280 --> 00:41.160
and the plans you make come up against the fact that the universe can just roll over them.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.360
The following is a conversation with John Rovaki, a psychologist and

00:47.360 --> 00:49.640
cognitive scientist at the University of Toronto.

00:50.200 --> 00:55.400
I highly recommend his lecture series called Awakening from the Meaning Crisis,

00:55.760 --> 01:00.160
which covers the history and future of humanity's search for meaning.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.560
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.840
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.400
And now, dear friends, here's John Rovaki.

01:10.440 --> 01:15.360
You have an excellent 50 part lecture series online on the Meaning Crisis.

01:15.960 --> 01:21.880
And I think you describe in the modern times an increase in depression, loneliness,

01:21.920 --> 01:26.080
cynicism and wait for it bullshit.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.680
The term used technically by Harry Frankfurt and adopted by you.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.160
So let me ask, what is meaning?

01:33.800 --> 01:40.000
What are we looking for when we engage in the search for meaning?

01:40.200 --> 01:43.440
So when I'm talking about meaning, I'm talking about what's called meaning in life,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.040
not the meaning of life.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.760
That's some sort of metaphysical claim.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.960
Meaning in life are those factors that make people rate their lives as more

01:51.960 --> 01:55.080
meaningful, worth living, worth the suffering that they have to endure.

01:55.880 --> 02:01.880
And when you study that, what you see is it's a sense of connectedness,

02:03.160 --> 02:07.880
connectedness to yourself, to other people, to the world and a particular

02:07.880 --> 02:09.280
kind of connectedness.

02:09.880 --> 02:14.960
You want to be connected to things that have a value and an existence

02:14.960 --> 02:19.080
independent of your egocentric sort of preferences and concerns.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.240
This is why, for example, having a child is considered very meaningful because

02:22.240 --> 02:26.040
you're connecting to something that's going to have a life and a value

02:26.040 --> 02:27.880
independent of you.

02:28.960 --> 02:33.360
Now, the question that comes up for me, well, there's two questions.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.960
One is, why is that at risk right now?

02:36.520 --> 02:41.080
And then secondly, and I think you have to answer the second question first,

02:41.080 --> 02:44.040
which is, well, yeah, but why is meaning so important?

02:44.040 --> 02:46.600
Why is this sense of connectedness so important to human beings?

02:46.600 --> 02:51.040
Why, when it is lacking, do they typically fall into depression,

02:51.040 --> 02:54.520
potentially mental illness, addiction, self-destructive behavior?

02:55.040 --> 02:59.200
And so the first answer I give you is, well, it's that sense of connectedness.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.200
And people often express it metaphorically.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.760
They want to be connected to something larger than themselves.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.600
They want to matter.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.200
They don't mean it literally.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.240
I mean, if I chained you to a mountain, you wouldn't thereby say, oh, now my life

03:10.240 --> 03:11.560
is so fulfilling, right?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.040
So what they're trying to convey, they're using this metaphor to try and say,

03:15.560 --> 03:16.600
they want to be connected.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.760
They want to be connected to something real.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.480
They want to make a difference and matter to it.

03:22.160 --> 03:27.920
And one way of asking them, well, you know, what's meaningful is tell me what

03:27.920 --> 03:31.600
you would like to continue to exist, even if you weren't around anymore.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.080
And how are you connected to it and how do you matter to it?

03:36.080 --> 03:44.360
That's one way of trying to get at what is the source of meaning for you is if

03:44.360 --> 03:47.720
you were no longer there, you would like it to continue existing.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.520
That's not the only part of the definition, probably, because there's

03:52.520 --> 03:58.480
probably many things that aren't a source of meaning for me that maybe I find

03:58.480 --> 04:01.800
beautiful, that I would like to continue existing.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.320
Yes.

04:02.760 --> 04:07.400
If it contributes to your life being meaningful, you're connected to it in

04:07.400 --> 04:14.560
some way, and it matters to you, and you matter to it in that you make some

04:14.560 --> 04:15.280
difference to it.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.240
That's when it goes from being just sort of true, good, and beautiful to being

04:19.240 --> 04:20.960
a source of meaning for you in your life.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.080
Is the meaning crisis a new thing, or has it always been with us?

04:26.080 --> 04:28.280
Is it part of the human condition in general?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.240
That's an excellent question.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.920
And part of the argument I made in Awakening for the Meaning Crisis is there's

04:33.920 --> 04:35.200
two aspects to it.

04:36.040 --> 04:41.040
One is that there are perennial problems, perennial threats to meaning.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.240
And in that sense, human beings are always vulnerable to despair.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.160
You know, the book of Ecclesiastes is, it's all vanity, it's all meaningless.

04:51.600 --> 04:57.440
But there's also historical forces that have made those perennial problems

04:58.000 --> 05:03.200
more pertinent, more pressing, more difficult for people to deal with.

05:03.200 --> 05:08.200
And so the meaning crisis is actually the intersection of perennial problems,

05:08.200 --> 05:12.960
finding existing, existence absurd, experiencing existential anxiety,

05:12.960 --> 05:17.680
feeling alienated, and then pressing historical factors, which have to do

05:17.680 --> 05:22.320
with the loss of the resources that human beings have typically crossed

05:22.320 --> 05:24.880
historically and cross-culturally made use of.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.960
Is there something potentially deeper than just a lack of meaning

05:30.960 --> 05:35.360
that speaks to the fact that we're vulnerable to despair?

05:35.360 --> 05:40.240
You know, Ernest Becker talked about the, in his book, The Nile of Death,

05:40.240 --> 05:44.880
about the fear of death and being an important motivator in our life.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.640
As William James said, death is the warm at the heart of life.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.120
Death is the warm at the heart of life.

05:51.120 --> 05:56.880
In our life, as William James said, death is the warm at the core of the human condition.

05:56.880 --> 06:06.240
Is it possible that this kind of search for meaning is coupled or can be seen

06:06.240 --> 06:13.920
from the perspective of trying to escape the reality, the thought of one's own mortality?

06:15.440 --> 06:19.040
Yeah, Becker and the terror management theory that have come out of it.

06:19.040 --> 06:24.000
There's been some good work around sort of providing empirical support for that claim.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.920
Some of the work, not so good.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.280
So which aspects do you find convincing?

06:31.280 --> 06:34.400
Can you steelman that case and then can you argue against it?

06:35.040 --> 06:41.840
So what aspects I find convincing is that human finitude, being finite,

06:42.560 --> 06:46.720
being inherently limited is very problematic for us.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.000
Given the extensive use of the word problematic, I like that you use that word

06:54.000 --> 06:57.200
to describe one's own mortality as problematic.

06:57.200 --> 07:01.760
Because people sort of on Twitter use the word problematic when they disagree with somebody.

07:01.760 --> 07:06.320
But this to me seems to be the ultimate problematic aspect of the human condition

07:06.320 --> 07:08.480
is that we die and it ends.

07:08.480 --> 07:14.320
I think I'm not just agreeing with you, but I'm trying to get you to consider

07:14.320 --> 07:16.800
that your mortality is not an event in the future.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.240
It's a state you're in right now.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.000
That's what I'm trying to shift.

07:23.360 --> 07:29.120
So your mortality is just a, we talk about something that causes mortality fatal.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.440
But what we actually mean is it's full of fate.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.480
And I don't mean in the sense of things that are pre-written.

07:36.480 --> 07:44.320
What I mean is the sense of the universe doesn't care about your personal narrative.

07:44.320 --> 07:49.280
You can just have met the person that is going to be the love of your life.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.840
It's the culmination of your whole project for happiness.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.120
And you step into the street and a truck hits you and you die.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.280
That's mortality.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.640
Mortality isn't just some far flung event.

08:02.640 --> 08:08.640
It's that every moment we are subject to fate in that way.

08:09.200 --> 08:14.480
So you can think of lots of little deaths you experience whenever

08:15.360 --> 08:19.120
all the projects and the plans you make come up against the fact

08:19.120 --> 08:21.040
that the universe can just roll over them.

08:22.240 --> 08:28.640
The death is the indifference of nature of the universe to your existence.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.120
And so in that sense, it is always here with us.

08:31.920 --> 08:36.880
Yeah, but you're vulnerable in so many ways other than just the ending of your biological life.

08:37.840 --> 08:43.520
Because it's interesting if you rate what people fear most, death is not number one.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.400
They often put public speaking as number one.

08:47.120 --> 08:54.080
Because the death of status or reputation can also be a profound loss for human beings.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.280
You can drive them into despair.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.560
So as the terror management folks would say, as Ernest Becker would say that

09:01.680 --> 09:05.920
a self-report on a survey is not an accurate way to capture what is actually

09:06.000 --> 09:10.640
at the core of the motivation of a human being, that we could be terrified of death.

09:10.640 --> 09:18.480
And from childhood, since we realized the absurdity of the fact that the right ends,

09:18.480 --> 09:22.400
we've learned to really try to forget about it.

09:22.400 --> 09:28.000
Try to construct illusions that allow us to escape momentarily

09:28.000 --> 09:32.080
over prolonged periods of time the realization that we die.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.840
So first, I took it seriously, but now I want to say why there's some empirical work

09:37.840 --> 09:39.680
that makes me want to reconsider.

09:39.680 --> 09:45.680
So terror management theory is you do things like you give people a list of words to read,

09:45.680 --> 09:50.880
and in those words, in those lists are words associated with death, cough and funeral.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.560
And then you see what happens to people.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.600
And generally, they start to become more rigid in their thinking.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.600
They tend to identify with their worldview.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.320
They lose cognitive flexibility.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.440
That's if you present it to them in that third person perspective.

10:03.440 --> 10:09.040
But if you get them to go in the first person perspective and imagine that they're dying

10:09.600 --> 10:16.320
and that the people that they care about are there with them, they don't show those responses.

10:16.320 --> 10:21.760
In fact, they show us an increase in cognitive flexibility, an increase in openness.

10:21.760 --> 10:25.840
See, so I'm trying to say we might be putting the cart before the horse.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.160
The cart before the horse, it might not be death per se, but the kind of meaning that

10:30.160 --> 10:32.400
is present or absent in depth.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.840
That is the crucial thing for us.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.360
By the way, to push back, I don't think you took it seriously.

10:37.360 --> 10:43.120
I don't think you truly steelman the case because you're saying that death is always

10:43.120 --> 10:43.920
present with us.

10:43.920 --> 10:49.280
Yes, but isn't there a case to be made that it is one of the major motivators?

10:49.280 --> 10:53.680
Nietzsche, Will to Power, Freud wanting to have sex with your mother,

10:54.480 --> 10:58.560
all the different explanations of what is truly motivating us human beings.

10:58.560 --> 11:04.880
Isn't there a strong case to be made that this death thing is a really damn good,

11:06.320 --> 11:11.280
if not anything, a tool to motivate the behavior of humans?

11:12.000 --> 11:18.320
I'm not saying that the avoidance of death is not significant for human beings, but I'm

11:18.320 --> 11:24.480
proposing to you that human beings have a capacity for considering certain deaths

11:24.480 --> 11:26.720
meaningful and certain deaths meaningless.

11:28.400 --> 11:33.280
We have lots of evidence that people are willing to sacrifice their biological existence

11:33.840 --> 11:36.000
for a death they consider meaningful.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.400
Are you personally afraid of your death?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.760
Do you think about it?

11:39.760 --> 11:46.000
As somebody who produces a lot of ideas, records them, writes them down,

11:46.800 --> 11:52.400
is a deep thinker, admired thinker, and as the years go on, become more and more admired.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.400
Does it scare you that the ride ends?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.480
No, I mean, you have to talk to me on all my levels.

12:00.480 --> 12:05.120
I'm a biological organism, so something's thrown at my head all duck and things like that.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.880
But if you're asking me, do I long to live forever?

12:11.760 --> 12:12.080
No.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.880
In the Buddhist tradition, there are practices that are designed to make you

12:17.440 --> 12:21.920
aware of simultaneously the horror of mortality and the horror of immortality.

12:22.640 --> 12:27.280
The thought of living forever is actually horrific to me.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.400
Are those the only two options?

12:34.080 --> 12:40.800
When you're sitting with a loved one or watching a movie you just really love or a book you really

12:40.800 --> 12:42.320
love, you don't want it to end.

12:43.280 --> 12:48.480
You don't necessarily always flip it to the other aspect, the complete opposite of the

12:48.480 --> 12:49.440
thought experiment.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.600
What happens if the book lasts forever?

12:52.400 --> 12:54.800
There's got to be a middle ground, like the snooze button.

12:54.800 --> 12:59.520
Sure, you don't want to sleep forever, but maybe press the snooze button and get an extra 15 minutes.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.280
There's surely some kind of balance.

13:03.520 --> 13:11.680
That fear seems to be a source of an intense appreciation of the moment, in part.

13:12.480 --> 13:17.360
That's what the Stoics talked about, to meditate on once mortality.

13:17.360 --> 13:17.600
Sure.

13:17.600 --> 13:26.480
It seems to be a nice wake-up call to that life is full of moments that are beautiful,

13:26.480 --> 13:28.480
and then you don't get an infinite number of them.

13:29.200 --> 13:35.440
Right, and the Stoic response was not the project of trying to extend the duration of your life,

13:35.440 --> 13:44.160
but to deepen those moments so they become as satisfying as possible so that when death comes,

13:44.160 --> 13:46.640
it does not strike you as any kind of calamity.

13:46.640 --> 13:49.520
Does that project ring true for your own personal feelings?

13:50.720 --> 13:51.760
I think so.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.600
Do you think about your mortality?

13:53.600 --> 13:54.480
I used to.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.760
I don't so much anymore.

13:59.280 --> 14:05.280
Part of it, as I'm older, and your temporal horizon flips somewhere in your 30s or 40s,

14:05.280 --> 14:08.240
you don't live from your birth, you live towards your death.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.400
That's such a beautiful phrase.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.400
The temporal horizon flips.

14:12.960 --> 14:13.760
That's so true.

14:14.640 --> 14:15.360
That's so true.

14:15.920 --> 14:25.120
At what point is that, the point before which the world of opportunity and possibility is infinite

14:25.120 --> 14:25.680
before you?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.200
Yeah, it's like Peter Pan.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.520
There's all these golden possibilities, and you fly around between them.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.480
Yes, very much.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.280
And then when it flips, you start to look for a different model.

14:38.480 --> 14:43.760
The Socratic, the Stoic model, Buddhism has also influenced me, which is more about,

14:44.480 --> 14:50.000
wait, when I look at my desires, I seem to have two meta-desires.

14:50.560 --> 14:56.480
In addition to satisfying a particular desire, I want whatever satisfies my desire to be real.

14:57.600 --> 15:03.920
And whatever is satisfying my desire to not cause internal conflict, but bring something

15:03.920 --> 15:04.800
like peace of mind.

15:05.360 --> 15:11.440
And so, I more and more move towards how can I live such that those two meta-desires

15:12.000 --> 15:17.680
are a constant frame within which I'm trying to satisfy my specific desires.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.360
What do you think happens after we die?

15:22.080 --> 15:26.480
I think mind and life go away completely.

15:27.200 --> 15:34.960
When we die, and I think that's actually significantly important for the kind of

15:34.960 --> 15:35.920
beings that we are.

15:37.440 --> 15:42.880
We are the kinds of beings that can come to that awareness, and then we have a responsibility

15:44.080 --> 15:46.880
to decide how we're going to comport ourselves towards it.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.000
Can you linger on what that means?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.040
The mind goes away.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.560
Like when you're playing music and the last instrument is put down, the song is over.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.920
It doesn't mean the song wasn't beautiful.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.080
It doesn't mean the song wasn't complex.

16:04.080 --> 16:09.200
It doesn't mean the song didn't add to the value of the universe in its existence,

16:09.200 --> 16:10.320
but it came to an end.

16:10.880 --> 16:16.720
Is there some aspect in which some part of mind was there before the human

16:17.680 --> 16:19.120
and remains after?

16:19.680 --> 16:25.200
Something like panpsychism, or is it too much for us limited cognitive beings to understand?

16:25.920 --> 16:29.360
Something like panpsychism, I take it seriously.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.800
I don't think it's a ridiculous proposal, but I think it has insoluble problems that make me doubt it.

16:36.800 --> 16:42.160
Any idea that the mind is some kind of ultimately immaterial substance also has,

16:42.720 --> 16:46.320
for me, just devastating problems.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.080
Those are the two kinds of framework that people usually propose

16:50.960 --> 16:53.840
in order to support some kind of idea of immortality.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.280
I find both very problematic.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.720
The fact that we participate in distributed cognition,

17:00.720 --> 17:03.360
that most of our problem solving is not done as individuals,

17:03.360 --> 17:05.760
but in groups, this is something I've worked on.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.040
I've published on that.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.000
I think that's important.

17:09.280 --> 17:15.680
But most of the people who do work on systems of distributed cognition think that while there's

17:15.680 --> 17:21.280
such a thing as collective intelligence, there's no good evidence that there's collective consciousness.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.640
In fact, it's often called zombie agency for that reason.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.560
While I think it's very clear that no one person runs an airline,

17:31.360 --> 17:33.840
and there's a collective intelligence that solves that problem,

17:33.840 --> 17:37.840
I do not think that collective intelligence supports any kind of consciousness.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.400
Therefore, I don't think the fact that I participate,

17:42.400 --> 17:45.360
which I regularly and reliably do in distributed cognition,

17:45.920 --> 17:50.800
gives me any reason to believe that that participation grounds some kind of consciousness.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.400
Okay, there's so many things to mention there.

17:54.400 --> 17:59.600
First of all, distributed cognition, maybe that's a synonym for collective intelligence,

17:59.600 --> 18:06.720
so that means a bunch of humans individually are able to think, have cognitive machines,

18:07.680 --> 18:12.240
and are somehow able to interact with a process of dialogue, as you talk about,

18:13.120 --> 18:19.280
to morph different ideas together, like this idea landscape together.

18:20.080 --> 18:25.520
It's so interesting to think about, okay, well, you do have these fascinating

18:26.320 --> 18:34.480
distributed cognition systems, but consciousness does not propagate in the same way as intelligence.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.920
But isn't there a case, if we just look at intelligence,

18:39.920 --> 18:44.480
if we look at us humans as a collection of smaller organisms, which we are,

18:45.920 --> 18:53.200
and so there's like a hierarchy of organisms, tiny ones work together to form

18:54.320 --> 19:00.320
tiny villages that you can then start to see as individual organisms that are then also forming

19:00.880 --> 19:05.920
bigger villages and interacting different ways, and function becomes more and more complex,

19:05.920 --> 19:10.240
and eventually we get to us humans to where we start to think, well, we're an individual,

19:10.240 --> 19:16.720
but really we're not. There's billions of organisms inside us, both domestic and foreign.

19:18.400 --> 19:27.600
So isn't that building up consciousnesses, like turtles all the way up to us, our consciousness?

19:27.600 --> 19:33.680
Why does it have to stop with us humans? Is this the face transition when it becomes

19:34.400 --> 19:43.840
a zombie-like giant hierarchical village that first, there's like singing angels and

19:43.840 --> 19:50.080
it's consciousness is born in just us humans? Do bacteria have consciousness? Not bacteria,

19:50.080 --> 19:55.600
but maybe you could say bacteria does, but the interesting complicated organisms that are within

19:55.600 --> 20:02.640
us have consciousness. I think it's proper to argue, and I have, that like a paramecium or

20:02.640 --> 20:10.080
bacteria has a kind of agency and even a kind of intelligence, kind of sense-making ability,

20:10.080 --> 20:15.040
but I do not think that we can attribute consciousness, at least what we mean by

20:15.040 --> 20:20.880
consciousness, this kind of self-awareness, this ability to introspect, et cetera, et cetera,

20:21.600 --> 20:28.320
to bacteria. Now, the reason why distributed cognition doesn't have consciousness, I think

20:28.320 --> 20:37.360
is a little bit more tricky. And I think there's no reason in principle why there couldn't be a

20:37.360 --> 20:44.960
consciousness for distributed cognition, collective intelligence. In fact, many philosophers would

20:44.960 --> 20:50.720
agree with me on that point. I think it's more an issue of certain empirical facts,

20:51.440 --> 20:59.440
bandwidth, density of connections, speed of information transfer, et cetera. It's conceivable

20:59.440 --> 21:05.600
that if we got some horrible Frankensteinian neural link and we linked our brains and we had

21:05.600 --> 21:12.480
the right density and dynamics and bandwidth and speed, that a group consciousness could take shape.

21:12.560 --> 21:17.680
I don't have any argument in principle against that. I'm just saying those contingent facts do

21:17.680 --> 21:23.760
not yet exist, and therefore, it is implausible that consciousness exists at the level of collective

21:23.760 --> 21:28.960
intelligence. So you talk about consciousness quite a bit, so let's step back and try to sneak up

21:29.520 --> 21:38.480
to a definition. What is consciousness? For me, there are two aspects to answering that question.

21:38.480 --> 21:42.960
One is, what's the nature of consciousness? How does something like consciousness exist

21:42.960 --> 21:48.160
in an otherwise apparently non-conscious universe? And then there's a function question, which is

21:48.160 --> 21:53.280
equally important, which is, what does consciousness do? The first one is obviously

21:55.120 --> 21:59.360
problematic for most people, like, yeah, consciousness seems to be so different from

21:59.360 --> 22:04.480
the rest of the non-conscious universe. But I put it to you that the function question is also very

22:04.480 --> 22:13.920
hard because you are clearly capable of very sophisticated, intelligent behavior without

22:13.920 --> 22:20.880
consciousness. You are turning the noises coming out of my face hole into ideas in your mind and

22:20.880 --> 22:28.800
you have no conscious awareness of how that process is occurring. So why do we have consciousness

22:28.800 --> 22:35.040
at all? Now, here's the thing. There's an extra question you need to ask. Should we attempt to

22:35.040 --> 22:40.080
answer those questions separately or should we attempt to answer them in an integrated fashion?

22:41.120 --> 22:45.440
I make the case that you actually have to answer them in an integrated fashion,

22:46.560 --> 22:52.560
what consciousness does and what it is. We should be able to give a unified answer to

22:52.560 --> 23:00.400
both of those. Can you try to elucidate the difference between what consciousness is and what

23:00.400 --> 23:09.360
it does, both of which are mysteries, as you say, state versus action? Can you try to explain the

23:09.360 --> 23:14.480
difference that's interesting, that that's useful, that's important to understand? So that's putting

23:14.480 --> 23:19.600
me in a bit of a difficult position because I actually argue that trying to answer them separately

23:19.600 --> 23:27.840
is ultimately incoherent. But what I can point to are many published articles in which only one of

23:27.840 --> 23:32.720
these problems is addressed and the other is left unaddressed. So people will try and explain what

23:32.720 --> 23:39.040
qualia are, how they potentially emerge without saying, what do they do? What problems do they

23:39.040 --> 23:43.840
help to solve? How do they make the organism more adaptive? And then you'll have other people who

23:43.840 --> 23:48.800
say, no, no, this is what the function of consciousness is. But I can't tell you, I can't

23:48.880 --> 23:55.120
solve the hard problem. I don't know how qualia exist. So what I'm saying is many people treat

23:55.120 --> 24:00.880
these problems separately, although I think that's ultimately an incoherent way to approach the problem.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.040
So the hard problem is focusing on what it is? Yes. So the qualia, that it feels like something

24:09.040 --> 24:14.640
to experience a thing, that's what consciousness is, and does is more about the functional usefulness

24:14.640 --> 24:22.960
of the thing. Yes. Yes. To the whole beautiful mix of cognition and just function in everyday life.

24:23.680 --> 24:30.560
Okay. You've also said that you can do very intelligent things

24:32.320 --> 24:37.200
without consciousness. Yes. Clearly. Is that obvious to you? Yes.

24:37.440 --> 24:46.480
Yes. I don't know what I'm doing to access my memory. It just comes up. And it comes up really

24:46.480 --> 24:54.960
intelligently. But the mechanisms that create consciousness could be deeply interlinked with

24:54.960 --> 25:03.360
whatever is doing the memory access that's doing the cognition. Oh, I think so. Yes. Yes. So I guess

25:03.360 --> 25:09.920
what I'm trying to say in this will probably sneak up to this question a few times, which is

25:09.920 --> 25:18.560
whether we can build machines that are conscious or machines that are intelligent, human level

25:18.560 --> 25:23.120
intelligence or beyond without building the consciousness. I mean, ultimately, that's one

25:23.120 --> 25:29.360
of the ways to understand what consciousness is, is to is to build the thing. We can either sort of

25:29.360 --> 25:34.880
from the Chomsky way, try to construct models like he thinks about language in this way,

25:34.880 --> 25:39.120
try to construct models and theories of how the thing works, or we can just build the damn thing.

25:39.840 --> 25:46.800
Exactly. And that's a methodological principle in cognitive science. In fact, one of the things

25:46.800 --> 25:54.400
that sort of distinguishes cognitive science from other disciplines dealing with the nature of

25:54.400 --> 26:01.440
cognition in the mind is that cognitive science takes the design stance. It asks, well, could we

26:01.440 --> 26:08.720
build a machine that would not only simulate it, but serve as a bona fide explanation of the phenomena?

26:10.080 --> 26:14.320
Do you find any efforts in cognitive science compelling in this direction?

26:15.200 --> 26:20.080
In terms of how far we are, there's there's on the computational side of things,

26:21.040 --> 26:24.560
something called cognitive modeling. There's all these kinds of packages that you can

26:25.360 --> 26:31.200
construct simplified models of how the brain does things and see if complex behaviors emerge.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.880
Do you find any efforts in cognitive or what efforts in cognitive science do you find

26:37.600 --> 26:44.800
most inspiring and productive? I think the project of trying to create AGI,

26:44.880 --> 26:50.880
artificial general intelligence, is where I place my hope of artificial intelligence

26:50.880 --> 26:56.640
being of scientific significance. This is independent of technological socioeconomic

26:56.640 --> 27:03.680
significance, which is already well, well established. But being able to say because

27:03.680 --> 27:10.400
of the work in AI, we now have a good theory of cognition, intelligence, perhaps consciousness.

27:10.400 --> 27:14.800
I think that's where I place my bets is in the current endeavors around

27:15.520 --> 27:21.760
artificial general intelligence. And so tackling that problem head on, which has now

27:23.280 --> 27:28.320
become central, at least to a group of cognitive scientists, is I think what needs to be done.

27:31.360 --> 27:36.000
And when you think about AGI, do you think about systems that have consciousness?

27:36.800 --> 27:42.400
Let's go back to what I think is at the core of your general intelligence.

27:43.920 --> 27:49.280
So right now, compared to even our best machines, you are a general problem solver.

27:49.280 --> 27:54.080
You can solve a wide variety of problems and a wide variety of domains. And some of our best

27:54.080 --> 27:58.320
machines have a little bit of transfer. They can learn this game and play a few other

27:58.320 --> 28:01.760
well designed rule bound games, but they couldn't learn how to swim,

28:02.720 --> 28:10.960
ride or et cetera, things like that. And so what's interesting is what seems to come up,

28:10.960 --> 28:14.960
and this is some of my published work, in all these different domains of cognition

28:16.000 --> 28:23.200
across all these different problem types is a central problem. And since we do have good

28:23.200 --> 28:28.000
sort of psychometric evidence that we do have some general ability that's a significant component

28:28.000 --> 28:33.760
of our intelligence, I made an argument as to what I think that general ability is.

28:35.280 --> 28:42.000
And so it's happening right now. The amount of information in this room that you could actually

28:42.000 --> 28:48.160
pay attention to is combinatorial explosive. The amount of information you have in your memory,

28:48.160 --> 28:54.400
long term memory and all the ways you could combine it, combinatorial explosive. The number

28:54.400 --> 28:59.600
of possibilities you can consider also combinatorial explosive. The sequences of behavior you can

28:59.600 --> 29:07.280
generate also combinatorial explosive. And yet somehow you're zeroing in. The right memories

29:07.280 --> 29:10.960
are coming up. The right possibilities are opening up. The right sequences of behavior,

29:10.960 --> 29:17.680
you're paying attention to the right thing, not infallibly so, but so much so that you reliably

29:17.680 --> 29:23.360
find obvious what you should interact with in order to solve the problem at hand. That's an

29:23.360 --> 29:34.640
ability that is still not well understood within AGI. It's a filtering out the gigantic waterfall

29:34.640 --> 29:41.600
of data. Right. It's almost like a Zen Cohen. What makes you intelligent is your ability to ignore

29:42.240 --> 29:49.440
so much information and do it in such a way that it's somewhere between arbitrary guessing

29:49.520 --> 29:57.920
and algorithmic search. And to a fault sometimes, of course, that you, based on the models you

29:57.920 --> 30:04.560
construct, you forget. You ignore things that you should probably not ignore. And that hopefully we

30:04.560 --> 30:12.080
can circle back to it, Lex, is related to the meaning issue because the very processes that

30:12.080 --> 30:18.080
make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially susceptible to self-deceptive,

30:18.080 --> 30:23.920
self-destructive behavior because of the way we miss frame the environment in fundamental ways.

30:24.720 --> 30:28.880
So to you, meaning is also

30:31.680 --> 30:39.440
connected to ideas of wisdom and truth and how we interpret and understand

30:39.520 --> 30:46.080
and interact intellectually with the environment. Yes. So what is wisdom? Why do we long for it?

30:46.720 --> 30:51.840
How do we, and where do we find it? What is it? Intelligence is what you use to solve your problems

30:51.840 --> 31:00.080
as I was just describing. Rationality is how you use your intelligence to overcome the problems

31:00.880 --> 31:05.280
of self-deception that emerge when you're trying to solve your problems. So it's that matter problem.

31:06.240 --> 31:13.600
And then the issue is, do you have just one kind of knowing? I think you have multiple ways of

31:13.600 --> 31:19.920
knowing, and therefore you have multiple rationalities. And so wisdom is to coordinate

31:19.920 --> 31:25.600
those rationalities so that they are optimally constraining and affording each other. So in

31:25.600 --> 31:34.160
that way, wisdom is rationally self-transcending rationality. Right. So life is a kind of process

31:34.160 --> 31:41.760
where you jump from rationality to rationality and pick up a village of rationalities along

31:41.760 --> 31:47.600
the way that then turns into wisdom. Yes, it's properly coordinated. You mentioned framing.

31:47.600 --> 31:55.120
Yes. So what is framing? Is it a set of assumptions you bring to the table in

31:56.000 --> 32:02.880
how you see the world, how you reason about the world, how you understand the world?

32:03.520 --> 32:08.080
So it depends what you mean by assumptions. If it by assumption you mean a proposition,

32:08.640 --> 32:14.560
representational, or rule, I think that's much more downstream from relevance realization.

32:14.560 --> 32:24.320
I think relevance realization refers to, again, constraints on how you are paying attention.

32:25.040 --> 32:32.960
And so for me, talking about framing is talking about this process you're doing right now of

32:32.960 --> 32:40.720
salience landscaping. What's salient to you? And how is what salient constantly shifting

32:40.720 --> 32:50.080
in a sort of a dynamic tapestry? And how are you shaping yourself to the way that salience

32:50.080 --> 32:55.760
landscaping is aspectualizing the world, shaping it into aspects for interaction?

32:55.760 --> 33:03.120
For me, that is a much more primordial process than any sort of belief we have. And here's why.

33:04.640 --> 33:12.560
If we mean by beliefs, you know, representational proposition, then we're in this very problematic

33:12.560 --> 33:18.400
position because then we're trying to say that propositions are ultimately responsible for how

33:18.400 --> 33:24.720
we do relevance realization. And that's problematic because representations presuppose

33:24.720 --> 33:32.720
relevance realization. So I represent this as a cup. The number of properties it actually has

33:32.720 --> 33:38.240
and that I even have epistemic access to is combinatorial explosive. I select from those a

33:38.240 --> 33:43.840
subset and how they are relevant to each other insofar as they are relevant for me. This doesn't

33:43.840 --> 33:48.240
have to be a cup. I could be using it as a hat. I can use it to stand for the letter V.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.560
All kinds of different things. I could say this was the 10th billion object made in North America.

33:56.320 --> 34:03.680
Representations presuppose relevance realization. They are therefore dependent on it,

34:03.680 --> 34:09.440
which means relevance realization isn't bound to our representational structures. It can be

34:09.520 --> 34:14.400
influenced by them, but they are ultimately dependent on relevance realization.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.960
Let's define stuff. Relevance realization. Yes.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.960
What are the inputs and the outputs of this thing? What is it? What are we talking about?

34:23.840 --> 34:30.560
What we're talking about is how you are doing something very analogous to evolution.

34:31.680 --> 34:37.600
So if you think about that adaptivity isn't in the organism or in the environment,

34:37.600 --> 34:43.680
but in a dynamical relation and then what does evolution do? It creates variation and then it

34:43.680 --> 34:48.400
puts selective pressure and what that does is that changes the niche constructions that are

34:48.400 --> 34:55.040
available to a species. It changes the morphology. You also have a loop. It's your sensory motor loop

34:55.680 --> 35:01.760
and what's constantly happening is there are processes within you that are opening up variation

35:01.760 --> 35:06.160
and also processes that are putting selection on it and you're constantly evolving that

35:06.160 --> 35:12.320
sensory motor loop. So you might call your cognitive fittedness, which is how you're framing

35:12.320 --> 35:17.120
the world is constantly evolving and changing. I can give you two clear examples of that.

35:17.120 --> 35:24.320
One, your autonomic nervous system, parasympathetic and sympathetic. The sympathetic system is biased

35:24.960 --> 35:31.440
to trying to interpret as much of reality as threat or opportunity. The parasympathetic is

35:32.320 --> 35:38.560
biased to trying to interpret as much of the environment as safe and relaxing and they are

35:38.560 --> 35:46.720
constantly doing opponent processing. There's no little man in you calculating your level of arousal.

35:46.720 --> 35:51.760
There's this dynamic coupling opponent processing between them that is constantly evolving your

35:51.760 --> 35:57.680
arousal. Similarly, your attention, you have the default mode network, task network. The default

35:57.680 --> 36:04.240
mode network is putting pressure on you right now to mind wander, to go off, to drift and then

36:04.240 --> 36:10.640
the task focus network is selecting out of those possibilities the ones that will survive and go

36:10.640 --> 36:15.920
into and so you're constantly evolving your attention. Okay, so there's a natural selection

36:15.920 --> 36:22.240
of ideas that a bunch of systems within you are generating and then you use the natural selection.

36:22.240 --> 36:27.600
What is the selector, the object that you're interacting with, the glass? Relevance realization

36:28.320 --> 36:34.000
once again, you just describe how it happens. Yes. You can describe what the hell it is.

36:34.640 --> 36:41.440
So what are we talking about? So relevance realization is how you interact with things

36:41.440 --> 36:48.080
in the world to make sense of why they matter, what they mean to you, to your life.

36:48.080 --> 36:51.600
Yes, and notice the language you just used. You're starting to use the meaning in life language.

36:52.560 --> 37:00.160
That's good. Okay. That's good. So what does that evolution of your sensory motor loop do?

37:02.640 --> 37:09.360
It gives you, and here I'll use the term for Marla Ponty, it gives you an optimal grip on

37:09.360 --> 37:18.240
the world. So let's use your visual attention again. Okay, here's an object. How close should I be to

37:18.240 --> 37:26.880
it? Is there a right? That's what you want to do with it. Exactly. Exactly. So you have to evolve

37:27.520 --> 37:33.200
your sensory motor loop in order to get the optimal grip that actually creates the affordance

37:33.200 --> 37:38.240
of you getting to a goal that you're trying to get to. Yeah, but you're describing physical goals

37:39.040 --> 37:47.040
of manipulating objects. So this applies, the task, the process of relevance realization

37:47.040 --> 37:53.840
is not just about getting a glass of water and taking a drink. No. It's about falling in love.

37:54.720 --> 38:02.400
Yeah, of course. What else is there? Well, there's obvious between those two options. I can show you

38:02.400 --> 38:09.680
how you're optimally gripping in an abstract cognitive domain. Okay, so a mammal goes by

38:09.680 --> 38:16.480
and most people will say there's a dog. Now, why don't they say they might, but typically,

38:16.960 --> 38:21.040
probabilistically, they'll say there's a dog. They could say there's a German Shepherd,

38:21.040 --> 38:27.120
there's a mammal, there's a living organism, there's a police dog. Why that, why there?

38:27.120 --> 38:32.320
Why did they stop Eleanor Rush called these basic level? Well, what you find is that's an

38:32.320 --> 38:37.920
optimal grip because it's getting you the best overall balance between similarity within your

38:37.920 --> 38:43.920
category and difference between the other categories. It's allowing you to properly fit

38:43.920 --> 38:49.600
to that object insofar as you're setting yourself up to, well, I'm getting so, as many of the

38:49.600 --> 38:54.400
similarities and differences I can on balance because they're in a trade-off relationship

38:54.400 --> 39:01.200
that I need in order to probably interact with this mammal. That's optimal grip, not right?

39:01.200 --> 39:09.760
It's at the level of your categorization. You evolve these models of the world around you

39:10.480 --> 39:15.120
and on top of them, you do stuff like you build representations, like you said.

39:15.120 --> 39:22.080
Yes. What's the salience landscape? Salience meaning attention landscape.

39:22.800 --> 39:30.000
So, salience is what grabs your attention or what results from you directing your attention.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.600
So, I clap my hands that salient, it grabs your attention, your attention is drawn to it,

39:35.600 --> 39:41.200
that's bottom up, but I can also say you left big toe and now it's salient to you because you

39:41.200 --> 39:46.800
directed your attention towards it, that's top down. And again, opponent processing going on there.

39:46.800 --> 39:52.240
So, whatever stands out to you, what grabs your attention, what arouses you, what triggers at

39:52.240 --> 39:58.160
least momentarily some affect towards it, that's how things are salient. What salience, I would

39:58.160 --> 40:04.320
argue, is how a lot of unconscious relevance realization makes information relevant to

40:05.600 --> 40:13.040
working memory. That's when it now becomes online for direct sensory motor interaction with the

40:13.040 --> 40:19.440
world. So, you think the salience landscape, the ocean of salience extends into the subconscious

40:19.440 --> 40:26.400
mind? I think relevance does, but I think when relevance is recursively processed,

40:26.400 --> 40:34.320
relevance realization such that it passes through sort of this higher filter of working memory and

40:34.320 --> 40:40.560
has these properties of being globally accessible and globally broadcast, then it becomes the thing

40:40.560 --> 40:45.280
we call salience. Look, that's really good evidence, there's really good evidence from my

40:45.280 --> 40:50.880
colleague at U of T, University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher, that that's what working memory is. It's

40:50.880 --> 40:56.480
a higher order relevance filter. That's why things like chunking will get way more information

40:56.480 --> 41:03.360
through working memory because it's basically basically monitoring how much relevance realization

41:03.360 --> 41:09.040
has gone into this information. Usually, you have to do an additional kind of recursive processing

41:09.040 --> 41:14.160
and that tells you, by the way, when do you need consciousness? When do you need

41:15.200 --> 41:20.960
that working memory and that salience landscaping? It's when you're facing situations that are highly

41:20.960 --> 41:27.280
novel, highly complex and very old defined, that require you to engage working memory.

41:28.240 --> 41:34.080
Okay, got it. So, relevance realization is in part the thing that constructs that basic level

41:34.080 --> 41:39.840
thing of a dog. When you see it, when you see a dog, you call it a dog, not a German Shepherd,

41:39.840 --> 41:48.480
not a mammal, not a biological meat bag, it's a dog. Wisdom. So, what is wisdom?

41:48.800 --> 41:54.480
If we return, I think it's part of that, we got to relevance realization.

41:55.360 --> 42:06.160
And then wisdom is a accumulation of rationalities. He described the rationality as a kind of

42:06.960 --> 42:11.440
starting from intelligence, much of puzzle solving. And then rationality is like the

42:11.440 --> 42:16.720
meta problem of puzzle solving. And then what wisdom is the meta-meta problem of puzzle solving?

42:16.720 --> 42:23.360
Yes, in the sense that the meta problem you have when you're solving your puzzles is that you can

42:23.920 --> 42:27.760
often fall into self-deception. You can mis-freind. Self-deception, right.

42:27.760 --> 42:35.360
So, whereas knowledge overcomes ignorance, wisdom is about overcoming foolishness. If what we mean

42:35.360 --> 42:40.720
by foolishness is self-deceptive, self-destructive behavior, which I think is a good definition

42:40.720 --> 42:49.520
of foolishness. And so, what you're doing is you're doing this recursive relevance realization.

42:49.520 --> 42:53.920
You're using your intelligence to improve the use of your intelligence. And then you're using

42:53.920 --> 42:58.480
your rationality to improve the use of your rationality. That's that recursive relevance

42:58.480 --> 43:04.240
realization I was talking about a few minutes ago. Think about a wise person. They come into highly

43:05.120 --> 43:11.440
often messy, ill-defined, complex situations, usually where there's some significant novelty.

43:11.440 --> 43:17.360
And what can they do? They can zero in on what really matters, what's relevant, and then they

43:17.360 --> 43:24.720
can shape themselves, salience landscaping, to intervene most appropriately to that situation

43:24.720 --> 43:30.000
as they have framed it. That's what we mean by a wise person. And that's how it follows out of

43:30.080 --> 43:33.520
the model I've been presenting to you. So, when you say self-deception, I mean,

43:33.520 --> 43:38.640
part of that implies that it's intentional. Part of the mechanism of cognition,

43:39.920 --> 43:48.080
you're modifying what you should know for some purpose. Is that how you see the word self-deception?

43:48.080 --> 43:53.840
No, because I belong to a group of people that think the model of self-deception as lying to

43:53.840 --> 44:00.560
oneself ultimately makes no sense. Because in order to lie to you, I have to know something you

44:00.560 --> 44:05.840
don't, and I have to depend on your commitment to the truth in order to modify your behavior.

44:06.560 --> 44:11.680
I don't think that's what we do to ourselves. I think, and I'm going to use it in the technical

44:11.680 --> 44:16.400
term, and thank you for making space for that earlier on, I think we can bullshit ourselves,

44:16.400 --> 44:18.480
which is a very different thing than lying.

44:19.360 --> 44:27.040
So, what is bullshit? And how do we bullshit ourselves, technically speaking?

44:27.040 --> 44:30.960
Yeah, Frankfurt, and this is inspired by Frankfurt and other people's work

44:31.600 --> 44:33.520
based on Frankfurt's work. On bullshit.

44:33.520 --> 44:37.280
Yeah, classic essay. It's a pretty good title.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.400
I think it's one of the best things he wrote. He wrote a lot of good things.

44:40.400 --> 44:47.120
The title or the essay? The essay. Title's good too. It's always an icebreaker in certain academic

44:47.120 --> 44:56.720
settings. So, let's contrast the bullshit artist from the liar. The liar depends on your commitment

44:56.720 --> 45:04.640
to the truth. The bullshit artist is actually trying to make you indifferent to the question of truth

45:04.640 --> 45:11.600
and modify your behavior by making things salient to you so that they are catchy to you.

45:12.560 --> 45:20.320
So, a prototypical example of bullshit is a commercial, a television commercial.

45:21.200 --> 45:27.920
You watch these people at a bar getting some particular kind of alcohol, and they're

45:27.920 --> 45:32.320
gorgeous, and they're laughing, and they're smiling, and they're clear-eyed.

45:34.080 --> 45:38.880
You know that's not true, and they know you know it's not true, but here's the point.

45:39.600 --> 45:45.760
You don't care because there's gorgeous people smiling, and they're happy, and that's salient to

45:45.760 --> 45:51.280
you, and that catches your attention. And so, you know, go into a bar. You know that won't happen

45:51.280 --> 45:58.560
when you drink this alcohol. You know it, but you buy the product because it was made salient to you.

45:59.600 --> 46:05.680
Now, you can't lie to yourself, Lex. Salience can catch attention, but attention can drive

46:05.680 --> 46:12.320
salience. So, this is what I can do. I can make something salient by paying attention to it,

46:12.880 --> 46:18.400
and then that will tend to draw me back to it again, which, and you see what happens, which

46:18.400 --> 46:23.680
means it tends to catch my attention more so that when I go into the store, that bottle of liquor

46:23.680 --> 46:30.480
catches my attention, and I buy it. And that's, why is that bullshit?

46:31.360 --> 46:38.320
Because what you're doing is being caught up in the salience of things

46:38.880 --> 46:43.360
independent from whether or not that salience is tracking reality.

46:44.320 --> 46:50.480
Is it independent or is it loosely connected? Because it's not so obvious to me when I see

46:50.480 --> 46:57.120
happy people at a bar that I don't in part believe that, well, my experience has been

46:57.120 --> 47:02.640
may be different. Logically, I can understand, but maybe there is a bar out there

47:04.080 --> 47:09.200
where it's all happy people dancing. In fact, most of the bars I go to these days in Texas

47:09.200 --> 47:14.960
is pretty, lots of happy people. I think you can, I mean, there's probably variation,

47:14.960 --> 47:20.240
although I think it's very, the truth-seeking in there. Let's say the intent is at least to try

47:20.240 --> 47:25.520
and shut off your truth-seeking. It might not completely succeed, but that's the intent.

47:25.600 --> 47:32.240
At times, it can completely succeed because I can give you pretty much gibberish and you

47:32.240 --> 47:37.360
never let it will motivate your behavior. There's an episode from the classic Simpsons,

47:37.360 --> 47:42.080
not the modern Simpsons, the classic Simpsons, where there's aliens and they're running for

47:42.720 --> 47:46.240
office in the United States. Now, I'm a Canadian, so this doesn't quite work for me,

47:47.280 --> 47:52.000
and this speech goes like this. My fellow Americans, when I was young, I dreamt of being a

47:52.000 --> 47:58.320
baseball, but we must move forward, not backward, upward, not forward, twirling, twirling towards

47:58.320 --> 48:06.400
freedom, and people go, and there's a rush. There's nothing there, and yet it's great satire

48:06.400 --> 48:11.040
because a lot of political speech is exactly like that. There's nothing there.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.400
I'm not saying all political speech, I said a lot.

48:16.880 --> 48:20.640
No, but there is a fundamental difference between, and it's so hilarious, I remember

48:20.640 --> 48:27.520
that episode, there is a fundamental difference between that absurd sort of non-secular speech

48:27.520 --> 48:34.880
and political speech because one of the things is political speech is grounded in some sense of truth.

48:35.440 --> 48:44.160
And so, if that requires you talking about alternative facts and weird self-destructive

48:44.240 --> 48:49.840
oxymoronic phrases, isn't that approaching pure bullshit?

48:51.520 --> 49:01.600
No, I think pure bullshit like the vacuum is very difficult to get to, but I get the point.

49:01.600 --> 49:08.640
So, what exactly is truth? Is it possible to know?

49:09.280 --> 49:14.480
I think Spinoza is right about truth, that truth is only known by its own standard,

49:14.480 --> 49:18.400
which sounds circular. There's a way in which he didn't mean that circularly,

49:18.400 --> 49:22.880
and I think this is also converges with Plato. These are two huge influences on me.

49:24.400 --> 49:32.080
I think we only know the truth retrospectively when we go through some process of self-transcendence,

49:32.080 --> 49:37.760
when we move from a frame to a more encompassing frame so that we can see the limitations and

49:37.760 --> 49:42.800
the distortions of the earlier frame. You have this when you have a moment of insight.

49:42.800 --> 49:52.960
Insight is you doing, you are realising what is relevant. You go, oh, oh, I thought she was

49:52.960 --> 50:01.840
aggressive and angry. She's actually really afraid. I was misframing this. And you change

50:01.920 --> 50:06.880
what you find relevant. You have those aha moments. So, do you think it's possible

50:08.480 --> 50:18.560
to get a sense of objective reality? So, is it possible to have to get to the ground level of

50:18.560 --> 50:24.320
what something that you can call objective truth? Or is it, are we always on shaky ground?

50:24.320 --> 50:33.120
I think those moments of transcendence can never get us to an absolute view from nowhere.

50:35.040 --> 50:40.160
So, this is Drew Highland's notion of finite transcendence. We are capable of self-transcendence,

50:40.720 --> 50:45.840
and therefore we are creatures who can actually raise the question of truth or goodness or beauty,

50:45.840 --> 50:51.840
because I think they all share this feature. But that doesn't mean we can transcend to a

50:51.840 --> 50:58.000
godhood, to some absolute view from nowhere that takes in all information

50:58.800 --> 51:04.640
and organizes it in a comprehensive whole. But that doesn't mean that truth is thereby

51:04.640 --> 51:18.400
rendered valueless. I think a better term is real. And real and illusory are comparative terms.

51:18.400 --> 51:24.960
You only know that something's an illusion by taking something else to be real. And so,

51:24.960 --> 51:30.800
we're always in a comparative task. But that doesn't mean that we can somehow jump outside

51:31.440 --> 51:38.960
of our framing in some final manner and say, this is how it is from a god's eye point of view.

51:38.960 --> 51:45.840
So, what do you think, if I may ask, of somebody like Ayn Rand and her philosophy of objectivism?

51:46.800 --> 51:51.200
So, where the core principle is that reality exists independently of consciousness and that

51:51.840 --> 51:57.440
human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception. So, you do have that

51:57.440 --> 52:03.680
ability to know reality. There's two things. Knowing that there's an independent reality

52:03.680 --> 52:08.400
is not knowing that independent reality. Those are not the same thing.

52:08.400 --> 52:15.680
Yeah, but I think objectivism would probably say that our human reason is able to have contact

52:15.680 --> 52:24.240
with that. Then I would respond and say, I believe, in fact, ultimately, in a conformity

52:24.240 --> 52:32.640
theory of knowing that the deepest kind of knowing is when there's a contact, a conformity

52:32.640 --> 52:39.520
between the mind, with the embodied mind and reality. And here's where I guess I'd push back

52:40.240 --> 52:46.800
on Rand. I would say, you have to acknowledge partial knowledge as real knowledge,

52:46.800 --> 52:49.760
because if you don't, you're going to fall prey to Mino's paradox.

52:50.480 --> 52:58.640
Mino's paradox is, you know, this is in Plato, right? To know P. Well, if I don't know P,

52:58.640 --> 53:03.360
I'm going to go looking for it. But if I don't know P, how could I possibly recognize it when I

53:03.360 --> 53:08.080
found it? I have no way of recognizing it. I have no way of knowing that I found it.

53:08.960 --> 53:14.240
So I must know P. But if I know P, then I don't need to learn about it. I don't need to go searching.

53:15.920 --> 53:21.760
So learning doesn't exist. Knowledge is impossible. The way you break out of that paradox is saying,

53:21.760 --> 53:27.680
no, no, no, it is partial. It is possible to partially know something. I can know it enough

53:28.400 --> 53:33.280
that it will guide me to recognizing it, but that's not the same as having a complete grasp of it,

53:33.280 --> 53:37.600
because I still have to search and find what I don't yet possess in my knowledge.

53:40.480 --> 53:45.200
Partial knowledge has to be real knowledge. Right. Partial knowledge is still knowledge.

53:45.200 --> 53:52.000
Yes. What do you think about somebody like Donald Hoffman, who thinks the reality is an illusion,

53:52.640 --> 53:59.760
so complete illusion, that we're given this actually really nice definition or idea that

53:59.760 --> 54:04.400
you talked about, that there's a tension between the illusory and the, and what is real.

54:05.280 --> 54:13.360
He says that basically we taken that and we ran with the real to the point where the real is

54:14.320 --> 54:17.760
not at all connected to some kind of physical reality.

54:18.480 --> 54:21.360
Well, I hope to talk to him at some point. We were supposed to talk at one point,

54:21.360 --> 54:28.560
and so I have to talk in his absence. I think that, first of all, I think

54:28.560 --> 54:32.560
saying that everything in his illusion is saying everything is tall. It doesn't make any sense.

54:32.560 --> 54:40.880
It's a comparative term. You have to say, against this standard of realness, this is an illusion.

54:44.720 --> 54:51.280
He uses arguments from evolution, which are problematic to me, because it's like, well,

54:52.240 --> 55:02.480
you seem to be saying that evolution is true, that it really exists, and then some of our

55:02.480 --> 55:09.200
cognition and a perception has access to reality, math, and presumably some science has access to

55:09.200 --> 55:18.080
reality. Then what he seems to be saying is, well, a lot of your everyday experience is illusory,

55:18.080 --> 55:25.200
but we do have some contact with reality whereby we can make the arguments as to why most of your

55:25.200 --> 55:30.960
experience, most of your everyday experience is an illusion. To me, that's not a novel thing.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.640
That's Descartes. That's the idea that most of our sense experience is untrustworthy,

55:36.640 --> 55:41.920
but the math is what connects us to reality. That's how he interpreted the Copernican revolution.

55:41.920 --> 55:46.480
Oh, look, we're all seeing the sun rise and move over and set, and it's all an illusion,

55:46.480 --> 55:52.800
but the math, the math gets us to the reality. Well, I think he makes a deeper point that most

55:52.800 --> 56:00.480
of cognition is just evolved and operates in the illusory world. How does he know that things

56:00.480 --> 56:07.200
like cognition and evolution exist? I think there's an important distinction between evolution

56:07.760 --> 56:13.520
and cognition. That's not the point I'm making. I'm making a point that he's claiming that there

56:13.520 --> 56:23.120
are two things that really exist. Why are they privileged? He basically says that, look, the

56:23.120 --> 56:29.360
process of evolution makes sense. Yes. It makes sense that you get complex organisms from simple

56:29.360 --> 56:34.560
organisms through the natural selection process. Here's how you get to transfer information from

56:34.560 --> 56:42.560
generation to generation. It makes sense. Then he says that there's no requirement for the cognition

56:42.560 --> 56:48.960
to evolve in a way that it would actually perceive and have direct contact with the physical reality.

56:49.520 --> 56:54.240
Accept that cognition evolved in such a way that it could perceive the truth of evolution,

56:54.240 --> 57:00.320
and you can't treat evolution like an isolated thing. Evolution depends on Darwinian theory,

57:00.320 --> 57:05.120
genetics. It depends on understanding plate tectonics, the way the environment changes.

57:05.120 --> 57:10.160
It depends on how chromosomes are structured. Actually, that's an interesting question to him

57:10.880 --> 57:17.520
where I don't know if he actually would push back on this, is how do you know evolution is real?

57:17.520 --> 57:25.600
Yes. I think he would be open to the idea that it is part of the illusion that we constructed,

57:25.600 --> 57:33.600
that in some sense it is connected to reality, but we don't have a clear picture of it.

57:34.480 --> 57:43.520
That's an intellectually honest statement then. If most of our cognition as thinking beings is

57:43.520 --> 57:51.840
operating at every level in an illusory world, then it makes sense that one of the main theories

57:51.840 --> 57:58.240
of science that's evolution is also a complete part of this illusory world.

57:58.240 --> 58:03.360
Right. But then what happens to the premise for his argument leading to the conclusion

58:03.360 --> 58:08.160
that cognition is illusory? I think he makes a very specific argument about evolution as an

58:08.160 --> 58:15.600
explanation of why the world is of our cognition operating in an illusory world, but that's just

58:15.600 --> 58:22.160
one of the explanations. I think the deeper question is why do we think we have contact with

58:22.160 --> 58:31.440
reality, with physical reality? We could be very well living in a virtual world constructed by

58:32.400 --> 58:38.320
our minds in a way that makes that world deeply interesting in some ways, whether it's somebody

58:38.320 --> 58:44.720
playing a video game or we're trying to, through the process of distributed cognition, construct

58:45.920 --> 58:51.440
more and more complex objects. Why does it have to be connected to

58:53.040 --> 58:58.320
physics and planets and all that kind of stuff? If we're going to say we're now

58:58.320 --> 59:02.560
considering it as a possibility rather than it's a conclusion based on arguments,

59:02.560 --> 59:07.840
because the arguments, again, will always rely on stipulating that there is something that is known.

59:08.480 --> 59:13.600
These are the features of cognition. Cognition is capable of illusion. That's a true statement.

59:13.600 --> 59:18.000
You're somehow in contact with the mind. Why does the mind have this privileged contact

59:18.000 --> 59:24.240
and other aspects like my body do not? Let's put that aside and now let's just consider it.

59:25.200 --> 59:30.400
Now, when we put it that way, it's not an epistemic question anymore. It's an existential question,

59:30.400 --> 59:37.680
and here's my reply to you. There's two possibilities. Either the illusion is one that I cannot discover,

59:38.320 --> 59:45.360
sort of the matrix on steroids or something. There's no way, no matter what I do, I can't find out

59:45.360 --> 59:52.160
that it's an illusion. Or it's an illusion, but I can find out that it's an illusion.

59:54.560 --> 59:59.040
Those are the two possibilities. Nothing changes for me if those are the two possibilities,

59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.360
because if I could not possibly find out, it is irrational for me to pay any attention

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:13.040
to that possibility. I should keep doing the science as I'm doing it. If there's a way of

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:20.240
finding out, science is my best bet, I believe, for finding out what's true and what's an illusion.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.920
So I keep doing what I'm doing. So it's an argument, if you move it to that,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:31.200
that makes no existential difference to me. Oh, man, that is such a deeply philosophical argument.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:40.160
No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody's saying science doesn't work. It's an interesting question,

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.000
just like before humans were able to fly, they would ask a question, can we build a machine

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.120
that makes us fly? In that same way, we're asking a question to which we don't know an answer,

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.960
but we may know in the future how much of this whole thing is an illusion. And I think in a

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.760
second category, the first guy, I forgot which one, yes, science will be able to help us discover

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.000
this. Otherwise, yes, for sure, it doesn't matter. If we're living in a simulation and we can't find

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.440
out at all, then it doesn't matter. But yes, the whole point is, as we get deeper and deeper

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:23.440
understanding of our mind of cognition, we might be able to discover like how much of this is a

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.280
big charade constructed by our mind to keep us fed or something like that. Some weird,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.360
some weird, very simplistic explanation that will ultimately in its simplicity be beautiful.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:44.640
Or as we try to build robots and instill them, instill them with consciousness,

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:54.560
with ability to feel those kinds of things. We'll discover, well, let's just trick them

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.520
into thinking they feel and have consciousness and they'll believe it. And then they'll have a

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.480
deeply fulfilling and meaningful lives. And on top of that, they will interact with us in a way

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.800
they'll make our lives more meaningful. And then all of a sudden, it's like at the end of Animal

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.080
Farm, you look at pigs and humans, you look at robots and humans, you can't tell the difference

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:20.800
between either. And we in that way start to understand that that so much of this existence

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:27.200
could be an illusion. Okay, well, I have two responses to that. First is the progress that's

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:38.560
being made on like AGI is about making whatever the system is that's going to be the source of

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:45.760
intelligent, more and more dynamically and recursively self-correcting. That's part of what's

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:52.320
happening. Extrapolating from that, you get a system that gets better and better at self-correcting,

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:56.560
but that's exactly what I was describing before as the transformative theory of truth.

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:07.280
The other response to that is science, like people think of science just as, right,

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.520
sort of end proposition. Let me just use the evolutionary example again.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.480
If I'm gathering the evidence, I need to know a lot of geology. I need to know plate tectonics.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.680
I need to know about radioactive decay. I need to know about genetics. And then in order to

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:30.240
measure all those things, I need to know how microscopes work. I need to know how pencils

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:37.200
and paper work. I need to know how rulers work. I need to know how English, like you can't isolate

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:42.800
knowledge that way. And if you say, well, most of that's an illusion, then you're in a weird position

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:50.400
of saying somehow all of these illusions get to this truth claim. I think it goes in reverse.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:55.920
If you think this is the truth claim, right, the measuring and all the things that scientists

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.840
would do to gather on all the ways the theories are converging together, that also has to be

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.600
fundamentally right. Because it's not like Lego. It is an interwoven whole.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.040
Yes, it definitely is interwoven. But I love how I play that. I'm playing the devil advocate for

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:20.800
the illusion world. But there's an aspect to truth that has to be consistent, deeply consistent

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:28.240
across an entire system. But inside a video game, that's some kind of consistency evolves.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.920
There's rules about interactions. There's game theoretic patterns about what's good and bad and

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:40.160
so on. And there's sources of joy and fear and anger and then understanding about a world,

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.800
what happens in different dynamics of a video game, even simple video games. So there's no,

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:52.640
you know, even inside an illusion, you can have consistency and develop truths inside

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:59.440
that illusion and iteratively evolve your truth with the illusion.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.720
Okay, but that comes back. Is that process genuinely self-correcting or are you in the

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:10.880
simulation in which there is no possible doorway out? Because if my argument is, if you find one

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.480
or two doorways, that feeds back. In fact, you can't just say, this is the little tiny island

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.720
where we have the truth. That's the point I'm making.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:25.440
Right. But what if you find that, I think there is doorways, if that's the case. And what if you

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:31.600
find a doorway and you step out, but you're yet in another simulation. I mean, that's the point.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:38.720
That's so self-correcting. When you fix the self-deception, you don't know if there's other

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.920
bigger self-deceptions you're operating on. Of course, in one sense, that's right. But again,

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:49.920
we're back to, when I step into the second simulation, is it, can I get the doorway out of

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:54.960
that or right? Because if you just make the infinite regressive simulations, you've basically said,

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.040
I have a simulation that I can never get out of. Yeah, I think there's always a bigger pile

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:09.200
of bullshit is the claim I'm trying to make here. Okay. Let me dance around meaning once more.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:16.720
I often ask people on this podcast or at a bar or to imaginary people I talk to in a room when

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:24.720
I'm all by myself, the question of the meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful question?

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:30.960
You drew a line between meaning in life and meaning of life. Do you think this is a useful

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:35.840
question? No, I think it's like the question, what's north of the North Pole or what time is it on

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.560
the sun? It sounds like a question, but it's actually not really a question because it has a

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:47.520
presupposition in it that I think is fundamentally flawed. If I understand what people mean by it,

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.680
and it's actually often not that clear, but when they talk about the meaning of life,

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:58.480
they are talking about there are some feature of the universe in and of itself that I have to

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:04.560
discover and enter into a relationship with. And there's, in that sense, a plan for me or

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:10.480
something. And so that's a property of the universe. That's a very deep,

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.800
serious metaphysical ontological claim. You're claiming to know something fundamental

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.440
about the structure of reality. There were times when people thought they had a worldview that

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:26.400
legitimated it, like God is running the universe and therefore, and God cares about you and there's

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:33.360
a plan, et cetera. But I think a better way of understanding meaning is not,

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.200
meaning is like the graspability. I remember I talked about optimal grip. It's like the

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:46.880
graspability of that cup. Is that in me? No. Is it in the cup? No, because the fly can't grasp it.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.240
Well, graspability is in my hand. Well, I can't grasp Africa. No, no. There is a real relation

01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:00.240
fittedness between me and this cup. Same thing with the adaptivity of an organism.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.640
Is the adaptivity of a great white shark in the great white shark? Drop it in the sohara, dies.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:15.280
Meaning isn't in me. I think that's romantic bullshit. And it isn't in the universe. It is

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:20.800
a proper relationship. I've coined the phrase transjective. It is the binding relationship

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:27.120
between this objective and the objective. And therefore, when you're asking the question

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:33.680
about the meaning of life, you are, I think, misrepresenting the nature of meaning. Just

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:39.520
like when you ask what time is it on the sun, you're misrepresenting how we derive clock time.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.200
At the risk of disagreeing with a man who did 50 lectures on the meaning crisis,

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.400
let me hard disagree. But I think we'll probably agree. But it's just like a dance,

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:58.720
like any dialogue. I think meaning of life gets at the same kind of relationship between you and

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:11.600
the glass of water, between whatever the forces of the universe that created the planets, the proteins,

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:21.760
the multicell organisms, the intelligent early humans, the beautiful human civilizations and

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:33.680
the technologies that will overtake them. It's trying to understand the relevance realization

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:40.480
of the big bang to the feeling of love you have for another human being.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:47.440
It's reaching for that even though it's hopeless to understand. It's the question,

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:56.000
the asking of the question is the reaching. Now, it is, in fact, romantic bullshit, technically

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:07.840
speaking. But it could be that romantic bullshit is actually the essence of life and the source of

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:15.440
its deepest meaning. Well, I hope not. But technically speaking, romantic bullshit, meaning

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:24.640
romantic. In the philosophical sense, yes. So I mean, what is poetry? What is music? What is the

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.760
magic you feel when you hear a beautiful piece of music? What is that? Oh, but that's exactly to my

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:37.040
point. Is music inside you? Or is it outside you? It's both and neither. And that's precisely why

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.080
you find it so meaningful. In fact, it can be so meaningful, you can regard it as sacred.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.760
What you said, I don't think, and you preface that we might not be in disagreement,

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:54.560
right? What you said is, no, no, no, there is a way in which reality is realizing itself.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:04.400
And I want my relevance realization to be in the best possible relationship that, the sort of

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:10.000
meta-optimal grip to what is most real. I totally agree. I totally think that's one of the things

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.360
I said this earlier. One of our meta-desires is whatever is satisfying our desires is also real.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.160
I do this with my students. I'll say, you know, because romantic relationships sort of take the

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.320
role of God and religion and history and culture for us right now. We put everything on them,

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:33.200
and that's why they break. But, right? Strong words. Got it. But I'll say to them,

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.200
okay, how many of you are in really satisfying romantic relationships? Put up your hands. Then

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:42.160
I'll say, okay, I'm not only talking to these people. Of those people, how many of you would

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.080
want to know your partner's cheating on you even if it means the destruction of the relationship?

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:53.120
95% of them put up their hands. And I say, but why? And here's my students who are usually all

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.680
sort of bitten with cynicism and postmodernism, and they'll just say spontaneously, well,

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:05.920
because it's not real. Because it's not real. Right? So I think what you're pointing to is actually

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:15.200
you're pointing not to an objective or a subjective thing. Romanticism says it's subjective.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.920
There's some sort of, I guess, like positivism or Lockean empiricism says it's objective,

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.560
but you're saying, no, no, no, there's reality realization. And can I get relevance realization

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:30.640
to be optimally gripping in the best right relationship with it? And there's good reason

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:36.080
you can because think about it. Your relevance realization isn't just representing properties

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.880
of the world. It's instantiating it. There's something very similar to biological evolution,

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.840
which is that the guts of life, if I'm right, running your cognition is not just that you

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:52.480
have ideas, you actually instantiate. That's what I mean by conformity. The same principles,

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:56.400
they're within and without. They don't belong to you subjectively. They're not just out there.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.240
They're both at the same time. And they help to explain how you're actually bound to the

01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.400
evolutionary world. Yeah, so it comes from both inside and from the outside. But that's still

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:15.600
the question of the meaning of life. First of all, the big benefit of that question is that it shakes

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:23.360
you out of your hamster in a wheel that is daily life, the mundane process of daily life,

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:27.920
where you have a schedule, you wake up, you have kids, you have to take them to school,

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:32.400
then you go to work and repeats over and over and over and over, and then you get

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.480
increased salary, and then you upgrade the home and that whole process.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:45.360
Meaning, asking about the meaning of life is so full of romantic bullshit

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.960
that if you take it, if you just allow yourself to take it seriously for a second,

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.360
it forces you to pause and think, like, what's going on here? And then it ultimately,

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.560
I think, does return to the question of meaning in those mundane things. What gives

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:13.760
what gives my life joy? What gives it lasting deliciousness? Where do I notice the magic and

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:20.000
how can I have that magic return again and again? Beauty. And that ultimately what it returns to.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.480
But it's the same thing you do when you look up to the sky. You spend most of your day hurrying

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.040
around looking at things on the surface. But when you look up to the sky and you see the stars,

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:37.120
it fills you with the feeling of awe that forces you to pause and think in full context of, like,

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.880
what the hell is going on here? That, but also I think there is a,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.960
when you think too much about the meaning of a glass and a relevance realization of a glass,

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.440
you don't necessarily get at the core of what makes music beautiful.

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:03.680
So sometimes you have to start at the biggest picture first. And I think meaning of life forces

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:11.120
you to really go to the big bang and go, go, go to the, go to the universe and the whole thing,

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:17.520
the origin of life. And I think sometimes you have to start there to discover the meaning in

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.960
the day to day, I think. But perhaps you would disagree.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:31.760
Insofar as the question makes you ask about the, the, the whole of your life and how much

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:38.400
meaning is in the whole of your life. And insofar as it asks how much that is connected to reality,

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:45.360
it's a good question. But it's a bad question in that it also makes you look for the answers

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.200
in the wrong way. Now you said, and I agree with what you said, what, how we really answer

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.760
this question is we come back to the meaning in life and we see how much that meaning in life

01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:04.560
is connected to reality. We pursue wisdom. And so for me, the, I don't need that question in

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:11.120
order to provoke me into that stance. So let's return to the meaning crisis. Yes.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:18.480
What is the nature of the meaning crisis in modern times? What's its origin? What's the

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.360
explanation? Well, remember what I said, what I argued that the very processes that make us

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:28.560
adaptively intelligent subject us to perennial problems of self deception, self destruction,

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.360
creating bullshit for ourselves, for other people, all of that. And that can cause all,

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:43.360
you know, anxiety, existential anxiety. It can cause despair. It can cause a sense of absurdity.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:51.760
These are perennial problems. And across cultures and across historical periods,

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.560
human beings have come up with ecologies of practices. There's no one practice. There's

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.520
no panacea practice. They've come up with ecologies of practices for ameliorating

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.360
that self deception and enhancing that fittedness, that connectedness that's at the core of meaning

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:17.040
in life. That's prototypically what we call wisdom. And here's how I can show you one clear instance

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:25.280
of the meaning crisis is it's a wisdom famine. I can, I do this regularly with my students

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.680
in the classroom. I'll say, where do you go for information? They hold up their phone.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.640
Where do you go for knowledge? They're a little bit slower and probably because they're in my

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.040
class, they'll say, well, science, the university. I'll say, where do you go for wisdom?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.960
There's a silence. Wisdom isn't optional. That's why it is perennial, cross-cultural,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:56.560
cross-historical, because of the perennial problems. But we do not have homes for ecologies of

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.840
practices that fit into our scientific technological worldview so that they are

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.960
considered legitimate. The fastest growing demographic group are the nuns, NONESs. They

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:14.000
have no religious allegiance, but they are not primarily atheistic. They most frequently describe

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.680
themselves with this very, this has become almost everybody now describe, I'm spiritual,

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:26.960
but not religious, which means they are trying to find a way of reducing the bullshit

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:32.880
and enhancing the connectedness, but they don't want to turn to any of the legacy established

01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:43.920
religions by and large. Well, isn't both religion and the nuns, isn't wisdom a process, not a

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:51.120
destination? So trying to find, if you're a deeply faithful religious person, you're also

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:59.440
trying to find. So just because you have a place where you're looking or a set of traditions around

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:06.880
which you're constructing the search, it's nevertheless a search. So I guess, is there a

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:13.360
case to be made that this is just the usual human condition? How do you answer? If you asked

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:20.000
five centuries ago, where do you look for wisdom? I mean, I suppose people would be more inclined to

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:27.840
answer while the Bible or a religious text. Right. And they had a worldview that was considered

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:34.160
not just religious, but also rational. So we now have these two things,

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.480
orthogonal or often oppositional, spirituality and rationality. But if you go before a particular

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.560
historical period, you look back in the Neoplatonic tradition, like before the

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.920
the scientific revolution, those two are not in opposition. They are deeply interwoven

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:57.680
so that you can have a sense of legitimacy and deep realness and grounding in your practices.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:03.360
We don't have that anymore. And I'm not advocating for religion. Neither am I an enemy of religion.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:11.840
I'll strengthen your case, by the way. So one of my RAs did research and you get people who are,

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:17.120
have committed themselves to cultivating wisdom and you can look at people within religious

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:22.960
traditions and people who are doing it in a purely secular framework. By many of the measures we

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:29.920
used to try to study wisdom scientifically, the people in the religious paths do better

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:36.560
than the secular. But here's the important point. There's no significant difference between

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:42.080
the religious paths. So it's not like if you're, you know, following the path of Judaism, you're

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.640
more likely to end up wiser than if you follow Buddhism. By the way, I don't know if that's

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:50.880
my case. I was making the case that you don't need to have a religious affiliation to search for

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:57.920
wisdom. It's that I thought along to the point you just made that it doesn't matter which religious

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.440
affiliation or none. But that's what I'm saying. Okay, so this is the tricky thing we're in.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:09.520
Yeah. It does matter if you're in one, but it doesn't matter sort of the propositional creeds

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.080
of that. There's something else at work. There's a, if you allow me this, there's a

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.640
functionality to religion that we lost when we rejected all the propositional dogma. But there's

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.080
a functionality there that we don't know how to recreate. Yeah, what is that? Can you try to

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:32.080
speak to that? What is that functionality? What is that? Why is that so useful? A bunch of stories,

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:40.240
a bunch of myths, a bunch of narratives that are drenched in like deep lessons about morality and

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:44.960
all those kinds of things. What is the, what's the, what's the functional thing there that can't be

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:51.920
replaced without a religious text by non religious text? This is for me the golden question. So thank

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:59.360
you. Do you have an answer? Yeah, I have, I think I have a significant answer. I don't think it's

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:07.200
complete, but I think it's important. And this is to step before the Cartesian revolution and

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:13.280
think about many different kinds of knowing. And this is now something that is prominent within

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:17.600
what's called 4e cognitive science, the kind of cognitive science I practice. And there's a lot

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.280
of converging evidence for, okay, these different ways of knowing. There's propositional knowing.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.640
This is what we are most familiar with. In fact, it's almost, it's almost has a tyrannical status,

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:33.760
right? So this is knowing that something is the case, like the cats or mammals and it's stored

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:39.200
in semantic memory. And we have tests of coherence and correspondence and conviction, right?

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:43.440
There's procedural knowing. This is knowing how to do something.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.960
This is, skills are not theories. They're not beliefs. They're not true or false. They engage

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:56.640
the world or they don't. And they are stored in a different kind of memory, procedural memory.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.040
Semantic memory can be damaged without any damage to procedural memory. That's why, you know, you

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:07.600
have the prototypical story of somebody suffering Alzheimer's and they're losing all kinds of facts,

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.640
but they can still sit down and play the piano flawlessly. Same kind of argument.

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:18.880
There's perspectival knowing. This is knowing what it's like to be you here now in this situation,

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:23.600
in this state of mind, the whole field of your salience landscaping, what it's like to be you

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:30.000
here now. And you have a specific kind of memory around that episodic memory. And you have a different

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.800
sense, you have a different criterion of realness. So you can, you can get this by, well, my friend

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.280
Dan Chiapia and I, we studied the, the scientists using moving the rovers around, or you can take

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.720
a look at people who are doing VR. People talk about, you know, they want, they want to really

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:53.440
be in the game. That makes it real. They don't mean verisimilitude. You can get that, right?

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.320
Sense of being in the game with something like Tetris, which has, isn't like, it doesn't look

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:04.400
like the real world. And you can fail to have it in a video game that is, has a lot of verisimilitude.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:09.200
It's something else. It's about, again, this, this kind of connectedness that we're talking about.

01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.280
If I may interrupt, is that connected to the heart problem of consciousness,

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:18.160
the subject, the qualia, or is that a different, that kind of knowing is that different from the

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.760
qualia of consciousness? I think it has to do with, well, I make a distinction between the

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:26.080
adjuctival and the adverbial qualia. So I think it has to do with the adverbial qualia much more

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.440
with the, than with the adjuctival. So the adjuctival qualia are like the greenness of green and

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:40.080
the loonness of bloom. The adverbial qualia are the hereness, the nowness, the togetherness.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:44.720
And I think the perspective of knowing has a lot to do with the adverbial qualia.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.400
Adjuctival qualia and adverbial qualia. I'm learning so many new things today.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.600
Okay. So that's another way of knowing. Right. The perspective. And then there's a deeper one.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:00.480
And this is a philosophical point. I don't want to, we can go through the argument.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:05.360
But you don't have to know that you know in order to know, because if you start doing that,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.880
you get an infinite regress. There has to be kinds of knowing that doesn't mean you know that you

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:17.440
know that. Yeah. Okay. Of course. Okay. Great. Okay. Good. Well, there was a lot of ink spilled

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.160
over that over a 40-year period. So by philosophers, they spilled, this is what they do. They spill

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:29.120
ink. Yeah. But I want to talk about. I want to talk about what I call participatory knowing.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:36.400
This is the idea that you and the world are co-participating in things and such that real

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:42.880
affordances exist between you. So both me and this environment are shaped by gravity. So the

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:50.240
affordance of walking becomes available to me. Both me and a lot of this environment are shaped

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:58.240
by my biology. And so affordances for that are here. Look at this cup. Shared physics.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.840
Shared sort of biological factors. Look at my hand. I'm bipedal. Yeah. Also, culture is shaping

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:12.480
me and shaping this. I had to learn how to use that and treat it as a cup. So this is an agent

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:19.840
arena relationship, right? There's identities being created in your agency. Identities being

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:26.160
created in the world as an arena. So you and the world fit together. You know when that's missing

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:32.160
when you're really lonely or you're homesick or you're suffering culture shock. So this is

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.200
participatory knowing and it's the sense of, it comes with a sense of belonging.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:46.320
At every level. So the ability to walk is a kind of knowing. Yes. Yes. Yes. That there's a dance

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:53.440
between the physics that enables this process and just participating in the process is the

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:58.640
act of knowing. Right. And there's a really weird form of memory you have for this kind

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:07.520
of knowing. It's called yourself. What? Can you elaborate? So we talked about how all the

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.160
different other kinds of knowing had specific kinds of memory, semantic memory for propositional

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.920
procedural, right? Episodic for perspectival. What's the kind of memory that is the coordinated

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.040
storehouse of all of your agent arena relationships, all the roles you can take,

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.600
all the identities you can assume, all the identities you can assign. What's the self?

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:35.920
Do you mean like consciousness or like? No, I mean your sense of self. Sense of self in this world

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:43.120
that's not consciousness. That's like an agency or something. Right. It's an agent arena relationship.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.760
And so in an agent arena relationship, it's the sense of the agent.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:54.720
And that the agent belongs in that arena. Whatever the agent is, whatever the arena is,

01:27:54.720 --> 01:28:01.600
because it's probably a bunch of different framings of how you experience that.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.680
Yeah. And you do. Within your identity as a self, you have all kinds of roles

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:12.160
that are somehow contributing to that identity, but are not equivalent to that identity.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:16.320
Yeah. I wonder if like my two hands have different,

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:21.680
because there's a different experience of me picking up something with my right hand

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:29.920
and then my left hand. So are those like? That's a really cool question, Lex.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.320
Are they certainly feel like their own things?

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:39.360
And that could be just anthropomorphization based on cultural narratives and so on.

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.200
It could, but I think it's a legitimate empirical question, because it also could be

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.920
sort of Ian McGilchrist stuff. It could be you're using different hemispheres

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.840
and they sort of have different agent arena relationships to the environment.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.480
This is a really important question in the cognitive science of the self. Does that hemispheric

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.080
difference mean you're multiple or you actually have a singular self?

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.760
Oh, so it's important to understand how many cells are there.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.120
Yes, I think so.

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:11.840
But that's just like a quirk of evolution. It surely can't be fundamental to cognition,

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.760
having multiple cells or a singular self.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:22.800
It depends, again, because we're getting far from the answer to the question you originally asked

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.040
me. Do you want me to go back to that first or answer this one?

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.800
Which question? I already forgot everything.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.640
What's the functionality of religion?

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.120
Yes, let us return.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:37.040
Okay, and then we can return to the self. Okay, so you said you have all these propositions

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.240
and et cetera, et cetera, and they differ from the religions and they're not,

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.160
they don't seem to be considered legitimate by many people.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.160
But yet there's something functioning in the religions that is transforming people

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.640
and making them wiser. I put it to you that the transformations are largely occurring at

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:03.840
those non-propositional levels, the procedural, the perspectival, and the participatory.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.480
And those are the ones, by the way, that are more fundamentally connected to meaning making,

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.640
because remember, the propositions are representational and they're dependent on the

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.600
non-propositional, non-representational processes of connectedness and relevance

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.160
realization. So religion goes down deep to the non-propositional and works there.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.000
That's the functionality we need to grasp.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:31.040
Well, you talk about tools, essentially, that humans are able to incorporate into their cognition.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.600
Psycho technologies, like language is one, I suppose.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:39.680
Isn't religion then a psychotechnology?

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.280
It would be a, yeah, an ecology of psychotechnologies, yes.

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:48.160
And the question is that Nietzsche ruined everything by saying God is dead.

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:55.120
Do we have to invent the new thing? Go from the old phone, create the iPhone,

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.880
invent the new psychotechnology. It takes place of religion.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:04.480
And so when the madman in Nietzsche's text goes into the marketplace, who's he talking to?

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:08.960
He's not talking to the believers. He's talking to the atheists. And he says,

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:14.880
do you not realize what we have done? We have taken a sponge and wiped away the sky.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.920
We are now forever falling. We are unchained from the sun. We have to become worthy of this.

01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:23.280
Yeah. Well, Nietzsche is full of romantic bullshit.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.800
No, no, no. But there's a point there. The point is, right, there's one thing to

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:36.400
rejecting the proposition. There's another project of replacing the functionality that we lost

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.760
when we reject the religion.

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:45.200
So his worry that as nihilism takes hold, you don't ever replace the thing that religion,

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.280
the role that religion played in our world.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:55.840
Maybe it's hard to tell what he actually, because he's so multi-vocal. I'll speak for me,

01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:03.520
rather than for Nietzsche. I think it is possible to using the best cognitive science and respectfully

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:10.000
exapting what we can from the best religion and philosophical traditions, because there's

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.720
things like stoicism that are in the gray line between philosophy and religion. Buddhism is the

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:24.320
same. Doing that best cocci, that best exaptation, we can come up with that functionality without

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:31.600
having to buy into the particular propositional sets of the legacy religions. That's my proposal.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.640
I call that the religion that's not a religion. So things like stoicism or modern stoicism,

01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:44.960
those things, don't you think in some sense they naturally emerge? Don't you think there's a longing

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:52.240
for meaning? So stoicism arises during the Hellenistic period when there was a significant

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:59.120
meaning crisis in the ancient world because of what had happened after the breakup of Alexander

01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:06.880
the Great's empire. So if you compare Aristotle to people who are living after Alexander, so

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:12.960
Aristotle grows up in a place where everybody speaks the same language, has the same religion,

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:19.040
his ancestors have been there for years, he knows everybody. After Alexander the Great's empire is

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:25.040
broken up, people are now thousands of miles away from the government. They're surrounded by people

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:30.080
because of the dysporas, the diasporas I should say. They're surrounded by people that don't speak

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:34.240
their language, don't share their religion. That's why you get all these mother religions emerging,

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:41.520
universal mother religions like ISIS, etc. So there is what's called domicite. There's the

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:47.040
killing of home. There's a loss of a sense of home and belonging and fittedness during the

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:54.240
Hellenistic period and stoicism arose specifically to address that. And because it was designed to

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:59.840
address a meaning crisis, it is no coincidence that it is coming back into prominence right now.

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:07.040
Well, there could be a lot of other variations and it feels like I think when you speak of the

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:13.920
meaning crisis, you're in part describing, not prescribing, you're describing something that

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:22.480
is happening. But I would venture to say that if we just leave things be, the meaning crisis

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:30.480
dissipates because we long to create institutions, to create collective ideas of this distributed

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.400
cognition process that give us meaning. So if religion loses power, we'll find other

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.360
institutions that are sources of meaning. Is that your intuition as well?

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:52.080
I think we are already doing that. I am involved with and do participant observation

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.600
of many of these emerging communities that are creating ecologies of practice that are

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.480
specifically about trying to address the meaning crisis. I just, in late July, I went to Washington

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:10.560
State and did Rafe Kelly's Evolve Move Play return to the source and wow, one of the most

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.480
challenging things I've ever done. That guy is awesome, by the way. I've gotten to interact with

01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:20.000
him a long, long time ago. He said to say hi to you, by the way. Yeah, it's from another world.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:27.360
I feel like a different world because I interacted with him, not directly. This is somebody,

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:35.360
maybe you can speak to what he works on, but he makes movement and play. He encourages people to

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:40.400
make that a part of their life. How you move about the world, whether that's as part of

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:48.960
sort of athletic endeavors or actually just walking around a city. I think the reason I ran

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:54.080
into him is because there was a lot of interest in that, in the athletic world, in the grappling

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:58.400
world, in the Brazilian jiu-jitsu world, people who study movement, who make movement part of

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:06.560
their lives to see how can we do great play and fun and just the basic humanness that's natural

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:14.560
to our movement. How do we integrate that into our daily practice? This is yet another way to find

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:19.440
meaning. I think it's actually an exemplar of what I was talking about because what's going on

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:28.480
with Rafe's integration of parkour in nature and martial arts and mindfulness practices

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:36.000
and dialogical practices is exactly and explicitly so, by the way. He will tell you he's been very

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.240
influenced by my work. He's trying to get at the non-propositional kinds of knowing that make meaning

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.920
by evolving our sensory motor loop and enhancing our relevance realization because that gives people

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.400
profound, improved sense of connectedness to themselves, to each other and the world. I'll

01:36:54.400 --> 01:37:01.200
tell you, Lex, I don't want to say too specifically the final thing that people did because it's part

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:07.840
of his secret sauce. What I can say is when it was done, I said to them all, I said,

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:13.120
as far as I can tell, none of you are religious, right? And they go, yeah, yeah. But what you just

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:20.240
did was a religious act, wasn't it? And they all went, yeah, it was. Yeah. So that same magic was

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:33.360
there. Yes. Bathroom break? Sure. What's your take on atheism in general? Is it closer to truth

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:38.640
than maybe is an atheist closer to truth than a person who believes in God?

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.440
So I'm a non-theist, which means I think the shared set of presuppositions between the

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.560
theist and the atheist are actually what needs to be rejected.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:57.600
Can you explain that further? Yes, I can. And I want to point out, by the way, that there

01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:07.520
are lots of non-theistic religious traditions. So I'm not coming up with a sort of airy fairy

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:13.840
category. Yeah. And what's the difference in non-theism, agnosticism, and atheism?

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:21.760
So non-theists think that the theist and the atheist share a bunch of presuppositions. For

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:31.440
example, it's that sacredness is to be understood in terms of a personal being that is, in some

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:37.280
sense, the supreme being, and that the right relationship to that being is to have a correct

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:43.360
set of beliefs. I reject all of those claims. So both the theist and the atheist?

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:51.520
In their modern version. Yes. In which do you reject it in the sense that you don't know

01:38:51.600 --> 01:39:00.800
or do you reject it in the sense that you believe that each one of those presuppositions is likely

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:09.600
to be not true? The latter. Both on reflection, argument, and personal experimentation and

01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:16.240
experience, I've come to the conclusion that those shared propositions are probably not true.

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:23.440
Which one is the most troublesome to you? The personal being, the kind of accumulation of

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:28.800
everything into one being that ultimately created stuff? So for me, there's two and

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.520
they're interlocked together. I'm not trying to dodge your question. It's that the idea that

01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:40.560
the ground of being is some kind of being, I think, is a fundamental mistake.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:46.960
It's void of being? No, no, no. The ground of being is some kind of being.

01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:50.640
No, no, no. The turtle's all the way down. The ground of being is not itself any kind of being.

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:58.800
Being is not a being. It is the ability for things to be, which is not the same thing as a being.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:04.800
Are humans beings? We are beings. This glass is a being. This table is a being.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:12.480
But when I ask you, how are they all in being, you don't say by being a glass,

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.880
or by being a table, or by being a human. You want to say, no, no, there's something underneath

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.920
it all. And then you realize it can't be anything. This is why many mystical traditions converge on

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:32.480
the idea that the ground of being is no thingness, which is normally pronounced as nothingness.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:37.040
But if you put the hyphen back in, you get the original intent, no thingness.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:46.160
And that is bound up with, okay, what I need to do in order to be in relationship with,

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:52.400
so it's a misconstruing of ultimate reality as a supreme being, which is a category mistake to my

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.400
mind, and then that my relationship to it, that sacredness is a function of belief.

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:02.880
And I have been presenting you an argument through most of our discussion that meaning

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:10.320
is at a deeper level than beliefs and propositions. And so that is a misunderstanding of sacredness,

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:16.480
because I take sacredness to be that which is most meaningful and connected to what is most real.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.880
And theists think of what? Of sacredness as what?

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:33.600
They think of sacredness as a property of a particular being, God, and that the way that

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:40.960
is meaningful to them is by asserting a set of propositions or beliefs. Now, I want to point

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:49.200
out that this is what I would now call modern or common theism. You go back into the classical

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.760
periods of Christianity, you get a view that's really radically different from how most people

01:41:53.760 --> 01:42:00.240
understand theism today. Okay, so let me, this is an interesting question that I usually think about

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:06.720
in the form of mathematics, but so in that case, if meaning is sacred in your nontheist view,

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:16.720
is meaning created or is it discovered? There's a Latin word that doesn't separate

01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:23.840
them called inventio. And I would say that, and before you say, oh, well, give me a chance,

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:30.320
because you participate in it. You've experienced an insight, yes? Did you make it happen?

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:39.920
The insight? Did you make it happen? Or did you do, like, can you do that? I need an insight.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.480
This is what I do to make an insight. Oh, I see. Yeah, in some sense, it came from elsewhere.

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:50.800
Right, but you didn't just passively receive it either. You're engaged and involved in it.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.360
That's why you get, right? So that's what I mean by you participate in it. You participate in

01:42:55.360 --> 01:43:01.360
meaning. So you do think that it's both? Yes. You do think it's both. I mean, that's not a trivial

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:10.320
thing to understand, because a lot of time we think, when you think about a search for meaning,

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.600
you think it's like you're going through a big house and you open each door and look if it's

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:25.360
there and so on, as if there is going to be a glowing orb that you discover. But at the same time,

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:35.280
I'm somebody that, based on the chemistry of my brain, have been extremely fortunate to be able

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:41.760
to discover beauty in everything in the most mundane and boring of things. I am, as David

01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:50.480
Foster Wallace said, unboreable. I could just sit in a room, just like playing with a tennis ball

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:58.160
or something and be excited. Basically, like a dog, I think, endlessly. So to me, meaning is

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:07.280
created, because I could create meaning out of everything. But of course, it doesn't require a

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:14.240
partner. It does require dance partners, whatever. It does require the tennis ball. But honestly,

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.680
that's what a lot of people that I don't necessarily, we'll talk about. I don't practice

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:27.200
meditation, but people who meditate very seriously, like the entire days for months kind of thing.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:36.400
They talk about being able to discover meaning in just the wind or something. The breath and

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:45.920
everything, just subtle sensory experiences give you deep fulfillment. So that's again,

01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:50.320
this interaction. Actually, I do want to say because the interesting

01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.000
difference that you've drawn between nontheism, theism and atheism,

01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:02.400
where's the agreement or disagreement between you and Jordan Peterson on this? I just talked to

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:09.440
Jordan about this, because you're very clear. It's kind of beautiful in the clarity in which

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:16.400
you laid this out. I wonder if Jordan has arrived at a similar kind of clarity. Have you been able

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.000
to draw any kind of lies between the way the two of you see religion?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:28.720
Yeah. So there was a video released, I think like two or three weeks ago, with Jordan and myself and

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:33.040
Jonathan Peugeot. Oh, I haven't watched that one yet. Yeah. And it's around this question, Lux.

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:39.920
He's basically sort of making, he's putting together an argument for God. I mean, I think

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.320
that's a fair way. I don't think he would object to me saying that. And Jonathan Peugeot is also

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:51.040
a, well, Jonathan is a Christian. It's unclear what Jordan is.

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.960
And Jonathan's work is on symbolism and different mythologies and Christianity.

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.640
Yes, especially Neoplatonic Christianity, which is very important. I have a lot of respect,

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:05.760
well, I have a lot of respect for both of them, but I have a lot of respect for Jonathan.

01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:13.440
But in my participation in that dialogue, you can see me, well, repeatedly,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.840
but I think everybody, including Jordan thought constructively, challenging sort of the attempt

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:24.640
to build a theistic model. And I was challenging it from a non-theistic perspective. So I think

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:35.520
we don't agree on certain sets of propositions, but there was a lot of, there was also a lot of

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:41.920
acknowledgement. And I think genuine appreciation on his part and Jonathan's part of the arguments I

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:49.200
was making. So they believe in maybe the presupposition of like a supreme being. Not believe,

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:57.520
but not believe, but they see the power of that particular presupposition in being a source of

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:02.480
meaning. I think that's relatively clear for me with Jordan. Jordan's a really complex guy,

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:10.160
so it's very hard to just like pin. To my best sort of understanding, yes, I think that's clearly

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:15.920
the case for Jordan. It's not the case for Jonathan. Jonathan is, remember I said,

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:23.600
I was talking about modern atheism and theism? Jonathan is a guy who somehow went into icon

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.360
carving and Maximus the Confessor and Eastern Orthodoxy and has come out of it the other end

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:37.120
as a fifth century church father that is nevertheless being rightfully so, to be increasingly relevant

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:43.680
to many people. So he's deeply old school. Yeah, I think he has, he and I, especially because

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.800
Neoplatonism is a non-theistic philosophical spirituality and it's a big part of Eastern

01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:56.720
Orthodoxy, he and I, I think he would say things like, God doesn't exist. What? You're a Christian,

01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.160
right? And then, and he's being quite, but he'll say, well, God doesn't exist the way the cup exists

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:07.120
or the table exists, the same kind of move I was making a few minutes ago. He'll say things like

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:13.840
that. He will emphasize the no-thingness of ultimate reality, the no-thingness of God,

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:20.800
because he is, he's from that version of Christianity, what you might call classical

01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:26.240
theism. But classical theism looks a lot more like non-theism than it looks like modern theism.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:33.360
That's so interesting. Yeah, that's really interesting. What about, is there a line to be

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:41.040
drawn between myth and religion in terms of its usefulness in man's search for meaning?

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.480
So here's where Jordan and I are much more, actually all three of us are in significant

01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:54.800
agreement. I said this in my series, but I want to say it again here. Myths aren't stories about

01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:00.640
things that happened in the deep past that are largely irrelevant. Myths are stories about perennial

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:07.040
or pertinent patterns that need to be brought into awareness. And they need to be brought into an

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:13.840
awareness not just or primarily at the propositional level, but at those non-propositional levels.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:19.680
And I think that is what good mythos does. I prefer to use the Greek word because we've now

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:26.560
turned the English word into a synonym for a widely believed falsehood. And I don't think,

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:31.920
again, if you go back even to the church fathers, I'm not a Christian, I'm not advocating for

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:39.840
Christianity, but neither am I here to attack it. But when they talk about reading these stories,

01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.760
they think the literal interpretation is the weakest and the least important. You move to the

01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:56.160
allegorical or the symbolic to the moral, to the spiritual, the mystical, and that's where, right?

01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:03.680
So they would say to you, oh, you know, but how is the story of Adam and Eve true for you

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:09.360
now? And I don't mean true for you in that relativistic sense, I mean, how is it pointing to

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:14.960
a pattern in your life right now? So there is some sense in which the telling of this mythos

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:23.760
becomes real in connecting to the patterns that kind of captivate the public today.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:28.640
So you just keep telling the story. I mean, there's something about some of these stories,

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:36.080
they're just really good at being sticky to the patterns of each generation. And they'll stick

01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.280
to different patterns throughout time. They're just sticky in powerful ways.

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:50.800
Yes. And so we keep returning back to them again and again and again. And it's important to see

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:58.800
that some of these stories are recursive. They're myths about one particular set of patterns.

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:06.560
They're myths about, right, not just the important pattern. Like you get Jordan's stuff about

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:15.840
there's heroes and myths are trying to make us understand the need for being heroic in our own

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:20.320
lives. One of the things I like to put in counterbalance that is the Greek also have myths of

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:31.280
hubris, right? The counterbalance, the heroic, right? But then there are myths that are not about

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:38.400
those deeply important patterns, but they're myths about religio itself, that the way we're,

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:43.440
religio means to bind, to connect, the way relevance realization connects us. And so the

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:47.840
point of the myth is not notice that pattern or notice that pattern and notice that pattern. It's

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:57.280
notice how all of these patterns are emerging. And what does that say about us and reality?

01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:03.440
And those myths, I think, are genuinely profound.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:11.360
And how much of the myths, how much of the power of those myths is about the dialogues? You talk

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.240
about this quite a bit. I think in the first conversation with Jordan, you guys, I'm not sure

01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:21.920
you've gotten really into it. You scratched the surface a little bit. But the role of, as you say,

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.080
dialogue in distributed cognition. What is that? The thing we're doing right now, talking

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:33.440
with our mouth holes. What is that? And actually, can I ask you this question?

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:41.440
If aliens came to Earth and were observing humans, would they notice our

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:49.040
distributed cognition first or our individual cognition first? What is the most notable thing

01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:54.400
about us humans? Is it our ability to individually do well in IQ tests or whatever?

01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:58.880
Or puzzle solve? Or is it this thing we're doing together?

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:03.040
I think most of our problem solving is done in distributed cognition.

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:09.120
Like look around. You didn't make this equipment. You didn't build this place. You didn't invent

01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:15.440
this language that we're both sharing, et cetera, et cetera. And now there's more specific and precise

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:21.840
experimental evidence coming out. Let's take a standard task that people,

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:26.640
reasoning task. I wanted to do the details. It's called the Wayson Selection Task.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:32.000
And you give it to people, highly educated psychology students,

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.800
premier universities across the world. We've been doing it since the 60s. It's

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:40.400
replicates and replicates. And only 10% of the people get it right.

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:46.960
You put them in a group of four and you allow them to talk to each other.

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:54.880
The success rate goes to 80%. That's just one example of a phenomenon that's coming to the four.

01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:59.600
By the way, do you know if a similar experiment has been done on a group of engineering students

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:04.480
for psychology students? Is there a major group differences in IQ between those two?

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:11.520
Just kidding. Let's move on. There is a lot of evidence that there's power to this

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:15.840
distributed cognition. Now, what about this mechanism, this fascinating mechanism

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.880
of the ants interacting with each other, the dialogue?

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.520
I use the word discourse or dialogue for just people having a conversation.

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:31.920
And this is deeply inspired by Socrates and Plato, especially the Platonic dialogues.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.040
And I'm sure we've all had this. And so give me a moment because I want to build on to something here.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.760
We've participated in conversations that took on a life of their own and took us both in

01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.040
directions we did not anticipate, afforded us insights that we could not have had on our own.

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:54.240
And we don't have to have come to an agreement, but we were both moved and we both drawn into

01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:59.600
insight and we feel like, wow, that was one of the best moments of my life because we feel

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:08.480
how that introduced us to a capacity for tapping into a flow state within distributed cognition

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:15.360
that puts us into a deeper relationship with ourselves, with another person, and potentially

01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:22.240
with the world. That's what I mean by Deologos. And so for me, I think Deologos is

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:31.840
more important. Boy, I can just hear, I'm sorry, I can hear Jordan and Jonathan in my head right

01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.800
now, but I think it's more... I hear them all the time. I just wish they would shut up in my head

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:43.520
sometimes. So what are they saying to you in your head? What they're saying, well, see,

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:47.040
that's what the most recent conversation was about. I was trying to say

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:56.000
that I don't think mythos is... I think mythos is really important. I think these kinds of narratives

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:03.840
are really important, but I think this ability to connect together in distributed cognition,

01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:10.320
collective intelligence, and cultivate a shared flow state within that collective

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:16.000
intelligence so it starts to ramp up perhaps towards collective wisdom. I think that's

01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:22.080
more important because I think that's the basin within which the myths and the rituals are

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:28.800
ultimately created and when they function. A myth is like a public dream. It depends

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:34.640
on distributed cognition and it depends on people enacting it and getting into mutual flow states.

01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:43.680
So the highest form of dialogue of conversation is this flow state and that it forms the

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:50.640
foundation for myth building. I think so. I think so. So that communitas, that's Victor Turner's

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:57.680
phrase, specifically linked it to flow and I study flow scientifically, that within distributed

01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:06.640
cognition as the home, as the generator of mythos and ritual and those are bound together as well,

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.040
I think that's fundamentally correct. You know what's the cool thing here? Because I'm a huge

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:17.200
fan of podcasts and audiobooks, but podcasts in particular is relevant here is there's a

01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:26.480
third person in this room listening now and they're also in the flow state. Yes, yes. I'm close

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:32.080
friends with a lot of podcasts. They don't know I exist. I just listen to them because I've been

01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:37.840
in so many flow states with them. I was like, yes, yes, this is good, but they don't know I exist,

01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:44.560
but they are in conversation with me ultimately. And think of what that's doing. You've got dialogues

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:50.400
and then you've got this meta dialogue like you're describing and think about how things like podcasts

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:57.200
and YouTube, they break down old boundaries between the private and the public, between writing

01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.880
and oral speech. So we have the dynamics of living oral speech, but it has the permanency

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:12.240
of writing. We're in the midst of creating a vehicle and a medium for distributed cognition

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:18.000
that breaks down a lot of the categories by which we organized our cognition.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.400
I mean, because of the tools of YouTube and so on, just the network, the graph of how quickly

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:29.040
the distributed cognition can spread is really powerful. You just a huge amount of people have

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:34.480
listened to your lectures. I've listened to your lectures, but I've experienced them, at least in

01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:41.360
your style, there's something about your style. It felt like a conversation. It felt like at

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:45.760
any point moment I could interrupt you and say something. And I was just listening.

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:53.120
Thank you for saying that because I aspire to being genuinely as Socratic as I can when I'm

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:58.320
doing this. Yeah, there was that sense actually as I'm saying it now. Why was that? It didn't feel

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:05.680
like sometimes lectures, you come down with the commandments and you just want to listen.

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:10.160
But there was a sense like, I mean, I think it was the excitement that you have to understand.

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:15.920
And also the fact that you were kind of, I think, thinking off the top of your head sometimes.

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.320
You were interrupting yourself with thoughts. You're playing with thoughts. You're reasoning

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:29.920
through things often. You referenced a lot of books, so surely you're extremely well prepared

01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:33.440
and you're referencing a lot of ideas, but then you're also struggling in the way to present

01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:41.040
those ideas. Yes. And so the jazz, the jazz and getting into the flow state and trying to

01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:46.960
share in a participatory and perspectival fashion the learning with the people

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:51.200
rather than just pronouncing at them. Yes. What's mindfulness?

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:58.400
So published on that as well. And I practice. I've been practicing many forms of mindfulness

01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:04.960
and ecology of practices since 1991. So I both have practitioners' knowledge and I also study

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:10.960
it scientifically. I think I'm pretty sure I was the first person to academically talk about

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:15.520
mindfulness at the University of Toronto within a classroom setting, like lecturing on it.

02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:21.040
So this is a topic that a lot of people have recently become very interested in, think about.

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:26.560
So from that, from the early days, how do you think about what it is?

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:33.280
I've critiqued the sort of standard definitions being aware of the present moment without judgment

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.400
because I think they're flawed. And if you want to get into the detail of why we can,

02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:44.240
but this is how I want to explain it to you. And it also points to the fact of why you need

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:49.680
an ecology of mindfulness practices. You shouldn't equate mindfulness with meditation. I think that's

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:53.920
a primary mistake. When you say ecology, what do you mean by the way? So lots of many different

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.480
variants? No, so what I mean by an ecology is exactly what you have in an ecology. You have a

02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.240
dynamical system in which there are checks and balances on each other. And I'll get to that

02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:09.040
with this about mindfulness. I'll make that connection if you allow me. So we're always

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:14.160
framing. We've been talking about that. And for those of you who are not on YouTube,

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:20.880
this podcast, I wear glasses and I'm now sort of putting my fingers and thumb around the

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:28.400
frames of my glasses. So this is my frame. And my lenses and that frame, the frame holds a lens

02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:34.560
and I'm seeing through it in both senses, beyond and by means of it. So right now,

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:40.000
my glasses are transparent to me. I want to use that as a strong analogy for my mental framing.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:47.280
Now, this is what you do in meditation, I would argue. You step back from looking through your

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:52.080
frame and you look at it. I'm taking my glasses off right now and I'm looking at them. Why might I

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:59.440
do that? To see if there's something in the lenses that is distorting, causing me to, right?

02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:05.600
Now, if I just did that, that could be helpful, but how do I know if I've actually corrected

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:12.880
the change I made to my lenses? What do I need to do? I need to put my glasses on and see if I

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:19.040
can now see more clearly and deeply than I could before. Meditation is this, stepping back and

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:26.000
looking at. Contemplation is that looking through and there are different kinds of practices. The

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.960
fact that we treat them as synonyms is a deep mistake. The word contemplation has temple in it,

02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:37.600
in Latin. Contemplario means to look up to the sky. It's a translation of the Greek word theoria,

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:42.400
which we get our word theory from. It's to look deeply into things. Meditation is more about

02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:49.680
having to do with reflecting upon, standing back and looking at. Mindfulness includes both.

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:54.400
It includes your ability to break away from an inappropriate frame

02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:02.160
and the ability to make a new frame. That's what actually happens in insight. You have to both break

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:10.000
an inappropriate frame and make, see, realize a new frame. This is why mindfulness enhances insight.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.680
Both ways, by the way. Meditative practices and also contemplative practices.

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:24.800
So, mindfulness is frame awareness that can be appropriated in order to improve your

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:31.840
capacities for insight and self-regulation. Now, I am inexperienced with meditation,

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.640
the rigorous practice and the science of meditation. I've talked to people who

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:47.120
seriously as a science study psychedelics, and they often talk about the really important thing

02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:55.040
is the integration back, so the contemplation step. It's not just the actual things you see

02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:00.320
on psychedelics or the actual journey of where your mind goes on psychedelics. It's also the

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:08.080
integrating that into the new perspective that you take on life. You really nicely describe

02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:15.280
so meditation in that metaphor is the psychedelic journey to a different mind state. Contemplation

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:21.840
is the return back to reality, how you integrate that into a new world view. Mindfulness is the

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:29.680
whole process. So, if you just did contemplation, you could suffer from inflation and projective

02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:35.440
fantasy. If you just do meditation, you can suffer from withdrawal, spiritual bypassing,

02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:41.280
avoiding reality. They act. They need each other. You have to cycle between them. It's like

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:45.920
what I talked about earlier when I talked about the opponent processing within the autonomic

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.720
nervous system or the opponent processing at work and attention, and that's what I mean by an

02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:56.800
ecology of practices. You need both. Neither one is a panacea. You need them in this opponent

02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:02.720
processing acting as checks and balance on each other. Is there sort of practical advice you can

02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:10.880
give to people on how to meditate or how to be mindful in this full way? Yes. I would tell them

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:19.120
to do at least three things, and I was, I lucked into this. When I started meditation, I went down

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:24.480
the street and there was a place that taught vipassana meditation, metacontemplation and tai chi

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:29.840
chuan for flow induction, and you should get, you should have a meditative practice.

02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:35.920
You should find a contemplative practice, and you should find a moving mindfulness practice,

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:40.480
especially one that is conducive to the flow state and practice them in an integrated fashion.

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:47.920
Can you elaborate what those practices might look like? Generally speaking.

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:56.560
Meditative practice like vipassana. What's the primary thing I look through rather than look

02:05:56.720 --> 02:06:02.240
at? It's my sensations. What I'm going to do is I'm going to focus on my sensations rather than

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:08.960
focusing on the world through my sensations. I'm going to follow, for example, the sensations in

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:16.160
this area of my abdomen, where my breathing is. I can feel as my abdomen is expanding,

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:21.200
I can feel those sensations, and then I can feel the sensations as it's contracting.

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:28.400
What will happen is my mind will leap back to try to look through and look at the world again.

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:33.760
I'll start thinking about, I need to do my laundry, or what was that noise? What do I do?

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:39.120
I don't get involved with the content. I step back and label the process with an

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:46.240
ING word, listening, imagining, planning, and then I return my attention to the breath. I have to

02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:51.200
return my attention in the correct way. Part of your mind that jumps around in the Buddhist

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:55.040
tradition, this is called your monkey mind. It's like a monkey leaping for branches and chattering.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:02.640
If I was trying to train that monkey mind to stay, or as Jack Hornfield said, train a puppy dog,

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:09.840
stay puppy dog, and if it goes and I get really angry, and I bring it back and I'm yelling at it,

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:15.760
I'm going to train it to fight and fear me. But if I just indulge it, if I just feed its

02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:21.600
whims, oh, look, the puppy dog went there. Oh, now it's there. The puppy dog never learns to stay.

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:26.560
What do I need to do? I have to neither fight it nor feed it. I have to have this centered

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:34.480
attitude. I have to befriend it. You step back and look at your sensations. You step back and look

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:39.840
at your distracting processes. You return your attention to the breath and you do it with the

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.680
right attitude. That's the core of a good meditative practice.

02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:46.800
Okay, then what's a good contemplative practice?

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:56.560
A good contemplative practice is to try and meta. It's actually apropos, because we talked about

02:07:56.560 --> 02:08:02.560
that participatory knowing the way you're situated in the world. This is a long thing,

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:06.960
because there's different interpretations of meta. I go for what's called an existential

02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:13.760
interpretation over an emotional one. What I'm doing in meta is I'm trying to

02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:23.200
awaken in two ways. I'm trying to awaken to the fact that I am constantly assuming an identity

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:30.000
and assigning an identity. I'm looking at that. I'm trying to awaken to that. Then I'm trying

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:38.720
to awake from the modal confusion that I can get into around that. I'm looking out onto the world

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:46.160
and I'm trying to see you in a fundamentally different way than I have before.

02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:52.160
You go to the gym and you do bicep curls. Yes, yes.

02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:56.400
Is it possible to reduce it to those things? I mean, you don't need to speak to the specifics,

02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:00.480
but is there actual practice you can do or is it really personal?

02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:04.880
No, I teach people how to do the meta practice. I also teach them how to do a neoplatonic

02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.760
contemplative practice, how to do a stoic. Another one you can do is the view from above.

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:14.800
This is classic stoicism. I get you to imagine that you're in this room and then imagine that

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:21.040
you're floating above the room, then above Austin, then above Texas, then above the United States,

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:26.160
then the earth. You have to really imagine it. Don't just think it, but really imagine it.

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:32.960
What you notice is as you're pulling out to a wider and wider contemplation of reality,

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:38.000
your sense of self and what you find relevant and important also changes. For all of these,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.120
there is a specific step-by-step methodology. In that one, you could just literally imagine

02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.560
yourself floating farther and farther out. You have to go through the steps because the

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:52.320
stepping matters because if you just jump, it doesn't work.

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.160
Do you have any of the stuff online, by the way?

02:09:54.720 --> 02:10:03.760
I do because during COVID, I decided at the advice of a good friend to do a daily course.

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:07.760
I taught meditating with John Rovaki. I did all the way through meditation,

02:10:07.760 --> 02:10:12.000
contemplation, even some of the movement practices. That's all there. It's all available.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.440
That was largely inspired by Buddhism and Taoism. Then I went into the Western tradition and went

02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:21.760
through things like stoicism and neoplatonism, cultivating wisdom with John Rovaki. That's

02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:26.320
all there. All free. On your website. Yeah, it's on my YouTube channel.

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:33.680
On your YouTube channel? Okay. That's exciting. I mean, your meaning crisis lectures are just

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:37.200
incredible. Everything around it, including the notes and the notes that people talk.

02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.440
It created this tree of conversations that's really, really, really well done.

02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:49.760
What about flow induction? You want to flow wisely. First of all,

02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:55.280
you need to understand what flow is, and then you need to confront a particular

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:59.680
issue around a practical problem around flow. Let's go there because a lot of those words

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:07.200
seem like synonyms to people sometimes. The state of flow, what is it?

02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:11.440
All right. He just died last year. Chik Samp Mahai.

02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:17.200
I admire him very much. We've exchanged a bunch of messages over the past few years.

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:21.440
He wanted to do the podcast several times. That would have been wonderful.

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:30.480
But he said he struggled with his health. I never knew in those situations. I deeply regret

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:42.080
several cases like this that I had with Conway that I should have pushed him on it.

02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:48.640
Because, yeah, as you get later in life, the simple things become more difficult,

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.600
but a voice, especially one that hasn't been really heard, is important to hear.

02:11:54.960 --> 02:12:00.480
Anyway, I apologize. I share that. I can tell you that within

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:08.800
my area, he is important, and he's famous in an academics sense. The flow state,

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.680
two important sets of conditions, and very often people only talk about one, and that's

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:20.080
a little bit of a misrepresentation. The flow state is in situations in which

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:27.200
the demand of the situation is slightly beyond your skills. You both have to apply all the

02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:34.000
skills you can with as much attention and concentration as you possibly can, and you

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:41.520
have to actually be stretching your skills. In this circumstance, people report optimal

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:46.240
experience, optimal in two ways, optimal in that this is one of the best experiences I've

02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:50.960
had in my life. It's distinct from pleasure, and yet it explains why people do very bizarre

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:56.320
things like rock climbing because it's a good flow induction. But they also mean optimal in a

02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:01.520
second sense, my best performance. It's both the best experience and the best performance.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:08.160
Chicksat Mahay also talked about the information flow conditions you need

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:13.280
in order for there to be this state of flow, and then I'll talk about what it's like to be in

02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:17.840
flow in a sec. What you need is three things. You need the information that you're getting

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:22.640
to be clear. It can't be ambiguous or vague. Think about a rock climber. It's ambiguous and vague.

02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:30.320
There has to be tightly coupled feedback between what you do and how the environment responds.

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:35.040
So when you act, there's an immediate response. There isn't a big time lag

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.520
between your action and your ability to detect the response from the environment.

02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:44.160
Third, failure has to matter. Error really matters.

02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:49.360
So there should be some anxiety about failure. And failure matters.

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:56.480
Like to you, the person that persists. Yes, yes, yes. Now when you're in the flow state,

02:13:56.480 --> 02:14:02.240
and notice how this sits on the boundary between the secular and the sacred,

02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:09.840
when you're in the flow state, people report a tremendous sense of at one mit with the environment.

02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:15.520
They report a loss of a particular kind of self-consciousness, that narrative,

02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:20.640
nurturing nanny in your head that, how do I look? Do people like me? How do I look?

02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.080
How's my hair? Do people like me? Should I have said that? That all goes away.

02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.520
You're free from that. You're free from the most sadistic, super ego self-critic you could

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:35.920
possibly have, at least for a while. The world is vivid. It's super salient to you. There's

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:42.240
an ongoing sense of discovery. Although often you know you're exerting a lot of

02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:50.320
metabolical effort, it feels effortless. So in the flow state when you're sparring,

02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:56.000
your hand just goes up for the block, and your strike just goes through the empty space.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Or if you're a goalie in hockey, I've got to mention hockey once I'm a Canadian,

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:09.520
right? You put out your glove hand in the pucks there, right? So there's this tremendous sense

02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:19.920
of grace, atonement, super salience, discovery, and realness. People don't, well, people don't,

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:22.400
when they're in the flow state, they don't go, I bet this is an illusion.

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:30.080
The interesting question for me and my co-authors in the book, in the article we published,

02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:35.760
in the Oxford Handbook, A Spontaneous Thought with Arian, Harry Bennett, and Leo Ferraro,

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.280
is that's a descriptive account of flow. We wanted an explanatory account, one of the causal

02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:50.960
mechanisms at work in flow. And so we actually proposed two interlocking cognitive processes.

02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:57.520
The first thing we said is, well, what's going on in flow? Well, think about it. Think about the

02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:04.160
rock climber. The rock climber, and I talked about this earlier, they're constantly restructuring

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:08.960
how they're seeing the rock face. They're constantly doing something like insight.

02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:14.800
And if they fail to do it, they impasse, and that starts to get dangerous. So they got to do it

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:20.160
in insight, that primes in insight, that primes in insight. So imagine the aha experience,

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:26.560
that flash in that moment, and imagine it cascading, so you're getting the extended aha.

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:31.120
That's why things are super salient. There's a sense of discovery. There's a sense of atonement,

02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:35.760
of deep participation, of grace. But there's something else going on too.

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:42.320
So there's a phenomena called implicit learning. Also, very well replicated,

02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:49.360
starts way back in the 60s with Reber. You can give people complex patterns, like number and

02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:58.240
letter strings, right? And they can learn about those patterns outside of deliberate

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.120
focal awareness. That's what's called implicit learning. And what's interesting is if you try

02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:11.360
and change that task into, you know, tell me the pattern, but explicitly try to figure out

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:17.280
the performance degrades. So here's the idea. You have this adaptive capacity for implicit

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:23.760
learning. And what it does is it results in you being able to track complex variables in a way,

02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:28.960
but you don't know how you came up with that knowledge. And this is Hogarth's proposal in

02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:33.920
educating intuition. Intuition is actually the result of implicit learning. So an example I use

02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:43.360
is, how far do you stand away from somebody at a funeral? There's a lot of complex variables.

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:48.960
There's status, closeness to the person, your relationship to them, past history,

02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:54.000
all kinds of stuff. And yet you know how to do it. And you didn't have to go to funeral school.

02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:00.000
I'm just using that as an example. So you have these powerful intuitions. Now here's Hogarth's

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.080
great point. Implicit learning, and remember I said before, the things that make it adaptive make

02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:11.760
a subject to self-deception. Here's another example. Implicit learning is powerful at picking up on

02:18:11.760 --> 02:18:18.080
complex patterns, but it doesn't care what kind of pattern it is. It doesn't distinguish causal

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:24.800
patterns from merely correlational patterns. So when we like it, it's intuition. When it's picking

02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:29.520
up on stuff that's bogus, we call it prejudice, or all kinds of other names for intuition that's

02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:35.440
going wrong. Now he said, okay, what do we do? What do we do about this? And this will get back to

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:39.600
flow. What do we do about this? Well, we can't try to replace implicit learning with explicit

02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:44.960
learning because we'll lose all the adaptiveness to it. So what can we do explicitly? What we can

02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:50.960
do is take care of the environment in which we're doing the implicit learning. How do we do that?

02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:56.880
We try to make sure the environment has features that help us distinguish causation from correlation.

02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.880
What kind of environments have we created that are good at distinguishing causation from correlation?

02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:09.280
Experimental environments. What do you do in an experiment? You make sure that the variables

02:19:09.280 --> 02:19:14.080
are clear. No confound, no ambiguity, no vagueness. You make sure there's a tight coupling between

02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:19.120
the independent and the dependent variable, and your hypothesis can be falsified. Error

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:25.120
matters. Now look at those three legs. Those are exactly the three conditions that you need for

02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:33.360
flow. Clear information, tightly coupled feedback, and error matters. So flow is not only an

02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:41.520
insight cascade, improving your insight capacity. It's also a marker that you're cultivating the

02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:48.160
best kind of intuitions, the ones that fit you best to the causal patterns in your environment.

02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:54.240
But it's hard to achieve that kind of environment where there's a clear distinction between

02:19:54.240 --> 02:20:01.200
causality and correlation, and it has the rigor of a scientific experiment.

02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:06.880
Fair enough. And I don't think Hogarth was saying it's going to be epistemically as rigorous as a

02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:13.920
scientific experiment. But he's saying, if you structure that, it will tend to do what that

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:18.320
scientific method does, which is find causal. Think of the rock climber. All of those things are

02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:24.560
the case. They need clear information. It's tightly coupled, and error matters. And they think what

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:31.760
they're doing is very real, because if they're not conforming to the real causal patterns of the

02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:40.720
rock face and the physiology of their body, they will fall. Is there something to be said about

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:46.320
the power of discovering meaning and having this deep relationship with the moment?

02:20:48.160 --> 02:20:55.280
There's something about flow that really forgets the past and the future, and is really focused on

02:20:55.280 --> 02:21:00.160
the moment. I think that's part of the phenomenology. But I think the functionality has to do with the

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:08.320
fact that what's happening in flow is that dynamic non-propositional connectedness that is so central

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:18.320
to meaning is being optimized. This is why flow is a good predictor of how well you rate your life,

02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:24.240
how much well-being you think you have, which of course is itself also predictive and interrelated

02:21:24.240 --> 02:21:29.280
with how meaningful you find your life. One of the things that you can do, but there's an important

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:35.600
caveat, to increase your sense of meaning in life is to get into the flow state more frequently.

02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:40.800
That's why I said you want a moving practice that's conducive to the flow state. But there's one

02:21:40.800 --> 02:21:49.040
important caveat, which is we of course have figured out, and I'm playing with words here,

02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:55.360
how to game this and how to hijack it by creating things like video games. I'm not saying this is

02:21:55.440 --> 02:22:01.760
the case for all video games or this is the case for all people, but the WHO now acknowledges this

02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:09.840
as a real thing that you can get into the flow state within the video game world to the detriment

02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:15.280
of your ability to get into the flow state in the real world. What's the opposite of flow?

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.360
Depression. In fact, depression has been called anti-flow.

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:28.160
You get these people that are flowing in this non-real world, and they can't transfer it to the

02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:33.760
real world, and it's actually costing them flow in the real world. They tend to suffer depression

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:41.440
and all kinds of things. Your ability, your habit, and just skill at attaining flow in the

02:22:42.080 --> 02:22:51.600
video game world basically makes you less effective or maybe shocks you at how difficult

02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:58.960
it is to achieve flow in the physical world. I don't want to push back against the implied

02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:08.080
challenge of transferability because I have a lot of friends that play video games,

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:17.040
a very large percent of young folks play video games. I'm hesitant to build up models

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:24.160
of how that affects behavior. My intuition is weak there. Oftentimes, people that have

02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:30.320
PhDs are of a certain age that they came up when video games weren't a deep part of their life

02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:37.760
development. I would venture to say people who have developed their brain with video games being

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:45.040
a large part of that world are in some sense different humans, and it's possible that they

02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:53.440
can transfer more effectively some of the lessons, some of the ability to attain flow from the

02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:58.800
virtual world to the physical world. They're also more, I would venture to say, resilient

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:07.040
to the negative effects of, for example, social media or video games they have that may be the

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:12.880
objectification or the over sexualized or violent aspect of video games. They're able to

02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:16.800
turn that off when they go to the physical world and turn it back on when they're playing

02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:25.360
the video games probably more effectively than the old timers. I just want to say that I'm not

02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:31.120
sure it's a really interesting question how transferable the flow state is. If you want to

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:35.680
comment on that. I do. First of all, I did qualify and I'm saying it's not the case for all video

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:40.000
games or for all people. I'm holding out the possibility and I know this possibility because

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:47.440
I've had students who actually suffer from this and have done work around it with me.

02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:52.240
Oh, the ability to achieve. They couldn't transfer, yeah.

02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:58.800
And then they were able to step back from that and then take up the cognitive science

02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:05.120
and write about it and work on it. Also, I'm not so sure about the resiliency claim

02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:14.480
because there seems to be mounting evidence. It's not consensus, but it's certainly not

02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:20.720
regarded as fringe that the increase in social media is pretty strongly correlated with increase

02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:26.000
in depression, self-destructive behavior, things like this. I would like to see that evidence.

02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:29.440
No, no, no. Let me.

02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:42.000
I'm always hesitant to too eagerly kind of agree with things that I want to agree with.

02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:50.320
There's a public perception. Everyone seems to hate on social media. I wonder, as always with

02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:57.120
these things, does it reveal depression or does it create depression? Sure. This is always the

02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:03.120
question. It's like whenever you talk about any political or ideological movement, does it create

02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:08.960
hate or does it reveal hate? And that's a good thing to ask and you should always challenge the

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:16.640
things that you intuitively want to believe. I agree with that. Like aliens. So one of the ways

02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:23.200
you address this, and it's not sufficient, and I did say the work is preliminary, but if I can

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:30.160
give you a plausible mechanism that's new and then that lends credence and part of what happens

02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:36.880
is a losery social comparison. Think of Instagram. People are posting things that are not accurate

02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:43.360
representation of their life or life events. In fact, they will stage things, but the people

02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:50.880
that are looking at these, they take it often as real and so they get downward social comparison.

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:58.960
Compared to how you and I probably live, where we may get one or two of those events

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:05.200
a week, they're getting them moment by moment and so it's a plausible mechanism that why it might

02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:12.160
be driving people into a more depressed state. The flip side of that is because there's a greater

02:27:12.480 --> 02:27:18.320
gap going from real world to Instagram world. You start to be able to laugh at it and realize

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:23.920
that it's artificial. So for example, even just artificial filters, people start to realize like

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:31.280
there's like, it's the same kind of gap as there is between the video game world and the real world.

02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:33.680
In the video game world, you can do all kinds of wild things,

02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:38.480
grant that thought or you can shoot people up, you can do whatever the heck you want,

02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.520
in the real world you can't and you start to develop an understanding of how to have fun in

02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:48.800
the virtual world and in the physical world. And I think it's just a pushback. I'm not saying

02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:54.000
either is true though. Those are very interesting claims. The more ridiculously out of touch Instagram

02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:00.400
becomes the easier you can laugh it off potentially in terms of the effect it has on your psyche.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:03.840
I'll respond to that, but at some point we should get back to flow.

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:07.280
As we engage in flow.

02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:12.400
You laugh at the shampoo commercial and you buy the shampoo.

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:16.000
Yeah.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.360
There's a capacity for tremendous bullshitting because of the way these machines are designed

02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:26.880
to trigger salience without triggering reflective truth seeking.

02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:37.280
I'm thinking of common examples because sometimes you're

02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:44.640
can laugh all the way to the bank. So you can laugh and not buy the shampoo.

02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:44.960
Right.

02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:48.960
There's many cases. So I think you have to laugh hard enough.

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:54.320
You do have to laugh hard enough, but the advertisers get millions of dollars

02:28:54.320 --> 02:29:00.000
precisely because for many, many people it does make you buy the shampoo and that's the concern.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:04.720
And maybe the machine of social media is such that it optimizes the shampoo buying.

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:13.600
Yes. The point I was trying to make is whether or not that particular example is ultimately right,

02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:21.520
the possibility of transfer failure is a real thing. And I want to contrast that to an experience

02:29:21.520 --> 02:29:25.520
I had when I was in grad school. I've been doing Tai Chi Chuan about three or four years

02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:30.240
very religiously in both senses of the word, like three or four hours a day and reading all

02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:36.880
the literature and I was having all the weird experiences, cold as ice, hot as lava, all that

02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:45.760
stuff. But my friends in grad school, they said to me, what's going on? You're different.

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:52.800
And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, you're a lot more balanced in your interactions

02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:58.560
and you're a lot more flowing and you're a lot more sort of flexible and you adjust more.

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:05.040
And I realized, oh, you know, and this was the sort of Taoist claim around Tai Chi Chuan

02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:11.520
that it actually transfers in ways that you might not expect. You start to be able,

02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:17.200
and I've now noticed that. I now notice how I'm doing Tai Chi even in this interaction

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:22.800
and how it can facilitate and afford. And so there's a powerful transfer. And that's what I

02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:30.160
meant by flow wisely, not only flow in a way that's making sure that your distinguishing

02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:36.400
causation from correlation, which flow can do, but find how to situate it, home it,

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:40.480
so that it will percolate through your psyche and permeate through many domains of your life.

02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:48.080
Is there something you could say similar to our discussion about mindfulness and meditation

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:57.920
and contemplation about the world that psychedelics take our mind? Where does the mind go

02:31:00.720 --> 02:31:09.520
when it's on psychedelics? I want to remind you of something you said which is a gem.

02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:14.240
It's not so much the experience, but the degree to which it can be integrated back.

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:21.280
So here's a proposal. It comes from Woodward and others. A lot of converges around this.

02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:25.840
Carrot Harris is talking about it similarly in the entropic brain. But I'm not going to talk

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:29.840
first about psychedelics. I'm going to talk about neural networks. And I'm going to talk about

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:35.360
a classic problem in neural networks. So neural networks like us with intuition and implicit

02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:41.040
learning are fantastic at picking up on complex patterns. Which neural networks are we talking

02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:48.080
about? I'm talking about a general part. Both artificial and biological? Yes. Yes. Yes. I think

02:31:48.080 --> 02:31:54.320
at this point there is no relevant difference. So one of the classic problems, because of their

02:31:54.320 --> 02:32:01.840
power, is they suffer from overfitting to the data. Or for those of you with statistical orientation,

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:07.920
they pick up patterns in the sample that aren't actually present in the population.

02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:17.120
And so what you do, there's various strategies. You can do dropout. You periodically turn off

02:32:17.120 --> 02:32:24.080
half of the nodes in a network. You can drop noise into the network. And what that does is

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:29.280
it prevents overfitting to the data and allows the network to generalize more powerfully to the

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:39.520
environment. I proposed to you that that's basically what psychedelics do. They do that.

02:32:39.520 --> 02:32:47.360
They basically do significant constraint reduction. And so you get areas of the brain

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:51.920
talking to each other that don't normally talk to each other. Areas that do talk to each other,

02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:56.400
not talking to each other, down regulation of areas that are very dominant, like the default

02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:01.680
mode network, et cetera. And what that does is exactly something strongly analogous, sorry,

02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:07.440
to what's happening in dropout or putting noise into the data. It opens up. By the way,

02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:12.000
if you give people, if you give human beings an insight problem that they're trying to solve

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.040
and you throw in some noise, like literally static on the screen, you can trigger an insight in them.

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:23.200
So like literally a very simplistic kind of noise to the perception system.

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:29.440
It can break it out of overfitting to the data and open you up. Now, that means though

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:41.280
that just doing that in and of itself is not the answer because you also have to make sure

02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:47.120
that the system can go back to exploring that new space properly. This isn't a problem with

02:33:47.120 --> 02:33:51.600
neural networks. You turn off dropout and they just go back to being powerful neural networks.

02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:54.400
And now they explore the state space that they couldn't explore before.

02:33:55.040 --> 02:34:00.560
Human beings are a little bit more messy around this and this is where the analogy does get a

02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:09.680
little bit strained. So they need practices that help them integrate that opening up to the new

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:17.520
state space so they can properly integrate it. So beyond Leary's state set and setting,

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:25.840
I think you need another S. I think you need sacred. Psychedelics need to be practiced

02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:32.560
within a sapiential framework, a framework in which people are independently and beforehand

02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:38.960
improving their abilities to deal with self-deception and afford insight and self-regulate. This is,

02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:43.760
of course, the overwhelming way in which psychedelics are used by indigenous cultures.

02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:51.760
And I think if we put them into that context, then they can help the project of people

02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:58.480
self-transcending, cultivating, meaning, and increasing wisdom. But I think we remove them

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:05.280
out of that context and put them in the context of commodities taken just to have

02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:09.840
certain phenomenological changes. We run certain important risks.

02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:17.680
So using the term of higher states of consciousness, is consciousness an important

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:29.120
part of that word? Why higher? Is it a higher state or is it a detour, a side road on the main

02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:37.440
road of consciousness? Where do we go here? I think the psychedelic state is on a continuum.

02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:42.640
There's insight, and then if flow is an insight cascade, there's flow, and then you can have

02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:48.640
sort of psychedelic experiences, mind-revealing experiences, but they overlap with mystical

02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:55.200
experiences, and they aren't the same. So, for example, in the Griffiths lab, they gave people

02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:01.840
psilocybin, and they taught them ahead of time how sort of the features of a mystical experience,

02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:06.800
and only a certain proportion of the people that took the psilocybin went from a psychedelic

02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:11.600
into a mystical experience. What was interesting is the people that had the mystical experience

02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:16.800
had measurable and long-standing change to one of the big five factors of personality.

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:20.720
They had increased openness. Openness is supposed to actually go down over time,

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:25.760
and these traits aren't supposed to be that malleable, and it was significantly altered.

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:35.120
But imagine if you just created more openness in a person, and they're now open to a lot more,

02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:38.640
and they want to explore a lot more, but you don't give them the tools of discernment,

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.920
that could be problematic for them in important ways. That could be very problematic.

02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:54.160
Yes, I got it. So, you have to land the plane in a productive way somehow, integrated back into

02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:58.080
your life and how you see the world and how you frame your perception of that world.

02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:02.400
And when people do that, that's when I call it a transformative experience.

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:06.960
Now, the higher states of consciousness are really interesting because they tend to move

02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:12.160
people from a mystical experience into a transformative experience. Because what happens

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:17.200
in these experiences is something really, really interesting. They get to a state that's ineffable,

02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:23.360
they can't put it into words, they can't describe it, but they do this, they're in this state

02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:28.400
temporarily, and then they come back and they do this. They say, that was really real, and this

02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:34.080
in comparison is less real. So, I remember that platonic meta-desire, I want to change my life

02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:40.160
myself so that I'm more in conformity with that really real. And that is really odd, Lex, because

02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:47.280
normally when we go outside of our consensus intelligibility, like a dream state, when we

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:51.760
come back from it, we say, that doesn't fit into everything, therefore, it's unreal. They do the

02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:57.600
exact opposite. They come out of these states and they say, that doesn't fit into this, right?

02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:03.120
Consensus intelligibility, and that means this is less real. They do the exact opposite,

02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:11.200
and that fascinates me. Why do they flip our normal procedure about evaluating alternative

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:15.840
states? And the thing is, those higher states of consciousness, precisely because they have that

02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:22.000
ontonormativity, the realness that demands that you make a change in your life, they serve to

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:26.560
bridge between mystical experiences and genuine transformative experiences.

02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:31.120
So, you do think seeing those as more real is productive because then you reach for them?

02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:38.640
So, Jaden's done work on it. Again, all of this stuff isn't recent, so we have to take it with

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:44.640
a grain of salt, but by a lot of objective measure, people who do this, who have these

02:38:44.640 --> 02:38:49.840
higher states of consciousness and undertake the transformative process, their lives get better,

02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:55.920
their relationships improve, their sense of self improves, their anxieties go down, depression,

02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:01.440
like all of these other measures, the needles are moved on these measures by people undergoing

02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:06.560
this transformative experience. Their lives, by many of the criteria that we judge our lives to

02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:15.760
be good, get better. I have to ask you about this fascinating distributed cognition process that

02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:23.280
leads to mass formation of ideologies that have had an impact on our world. So, you spoke about

02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:30.960
the clash of the two great pseudo-religious ideologies of Marxism and Nazism, especially their

02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:40.400
clash on the Eastern Front. Can you explain the origin of each of these? Marxism and Nazism

02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:45.360
in a kind of way that we have been talking about the formation of ideas.

02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:53.520
Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas is to Catholicism. He was the philosopher who took

02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:02.400
German Protestantism and also Kant and Fichte and Schelling, and he built

02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:09.920
a philosophical system. He explicitly said this, by the way. He wanted to bridge

02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:15.040
between philosophy and religion. He explicitly said that. I'm not voicing that on him. He said it

02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:20.960
repeatedly in many different places. So, he's trying to create a philosophical system that

02:40:21.920 --> 02:40:29.120
gathered to it, I think, the core mythos of Christianity. The core mythos of Christianity

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:35.200
is this idea of a narrative structure to reality in which progress is real,

02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:41.280
in which our actions now can change the future. We can co-participate with God

02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:45.680
in the creation of the future, and that future can be better. It can reach something like a

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:51.520
utopia or the promised land or whatever. He created a philosophical system of brilliance,

02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:57.440
by the way. He's a genius, but basically what it did was it took that religious vision

02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.560
and gave it the air of philosophical intelligibility and respect.

02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:10.480
Then Marx takes that and says, you know that process by which the narrative is working itself

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:15.280
out that Hegel called dialectic? I don't think it's primarily happening in ideas. I think it's

02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:20.800
happening primarily in between classes within socioeconomic factors, but it's the same story.

02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:27.120
Here's this mechanism of history. It's teleological. It's going to move this way. It can move towards

02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:33.920
a utopia. We can either participate in furthering it, like participating in the work of God,

02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:41.440
or we can thwart it and be against it. You have a pseudo-religious vision. It's all

02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:46.560
encompassing. Think about how Marxism is not just a philosophical position. It's not just

02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:55.840
an economic position. It's an entire worldview, an entire account of history and a demanding

02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:02.480
account of what human excellence is. It has all these things about participating, belonging,

02:42:02.480 --> 02:42:13.440
fitting to. In Marx's case, it's very pragmatic or directly applicable to society

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:18.640
to where it more naturally leads to political ideologies.

02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:25.280
It does, but I think Marx to a very significant degree inherits one of Hegel's main flaws.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:33.520
Hegel is talking about all this, and he's trying to fit it into post-Contian philosophy. For him,

02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:41.520
it's ultimately propositional, conceptual. He, like everybody after Descartes, is very focused

02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:48.320
on the propositional level, and he's not paying deep attention to the non-propositional. This

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:54.560
is why the two great critics of Hegel, Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, they're trying to put their finger

02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:00.000
on the non-propositional, the non-conceptual, the will to power or faith in Kierkegaard,

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:04.400
and they're trying to bring out all these other kinds of knowing as being inadequate.

02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:08.720
That's why Kierkegaard met when he said, Hegel made a system and then he sat down beside it.

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:19.600
Right. Marxism is very much, it is activist. It's about reorganizing society, but the

02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:25.280
transformation in individuals is largely ideological, meaning it's largely about

02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:31.200
these significant propositional changes and adopting a set of beliefs.

02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:37.600
When it came in contact with the Soviet Union or with what became the Soviet Union, why do you

02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:44.560
think it had such a powerful hold on such a large number of people? Not Marxism, but implementation

02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:54.400
of Marxism in the name of communism. Because it offered people, I mean, it offered people

02:43:54.400 --> 02:44:03.280
something that typically only religions had offered, and it offered people the hope of making a new

02:44:03.280 --> 02:44:09.520
man, a new kind of human being in a new world. And when you've been living in Russia,

02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:17.840
in which things seem to be locked in a system that is crushing most people,

02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:27.040
getting the promise in the air of scientific legitimacy that we can make new human beings

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:34.000
and a new world and in which happiness will ensue. That's an intoxicating proposal.

02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:43.280
You get all of the intoxication of religious utopia, but you get all the seeming legitimacy

02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:48.720
of claiming that it's a scientific understanding of history and economics.

02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:56.480
It's very popular to criticize communism, Marxism these days. And I often put myself in the place

02:44:57.040 --> 02:45:04.400
before any of the implementations came to be, I tried to think if I would be able to predict

02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:12.160
what the implementations of Marxism and communism would result in in the 20th century.

02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:18.640
And I'm not sure I'm smart enough to make that prediction, because at the core of the ideas are

02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:27.120
respecting, with Marx, it's very economics type theory. So it's basically respecting the value

02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:35.200
of the worker and the regular man in society for making a contribution to that society.

02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:42.640
And to me, that seems like a powerful idea. And it's not clear to me how it goes wrong.

02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:50.400
In fact, it's still not clear to me why the hell did this like with Stalin happen

02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:56.240
or Mao happen. It's there's something very interesting and complex about human nature

02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:01.760
in hierarchies about distributed cognition that results in that. And it's not trivial to understand.

02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:08.640
No, no. So I mean, I wonder if you can put a finger on it. Why like why did it go so wrong?

02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:15.040
So I think, you know, what Ohana talks about in the intellectual history of modernity

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:28.400
talks about the Promethean spirit, the idea, the really radical proposal and think about how it's

02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:35.440
not so radical to us. And in that sense, Marxism has succeeded the radical proposal that you see

02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:40.400
even in the French Revolution, and don't forget the terror comes in the French Revolution too,

02:46:41.680 --> 02:46:47.440
that we can make ourselves into Godlike beings. Think of the hubris in that.

02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:54.400
Right. And think of the overconfidence to think that we so understand human nature and all of

02:46:54.400 --> 02:47:01.200
its complexities and human history, right, and how religion functioned and every that we can just

02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:09.680
come in with a plan and make it run. It's to my mind, that Promethean spirit is part of why

02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:16.320
it's doomed to fail. And it's doomed to fail in a kind of terrorizing way, because the Promethean

02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:25.120
spirit really licenses you to do anything because the ends justify the means.

02:47:25.440 --> 02:47:31.520
This the end justify the means really free you to do some of basically,

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:35.840
well, commit atrocities at any scale.

02:47:36.480 --> 02:47:43.040
Ground zero with Pol Pot and the Cameroosh, right? Exactly. And you only, you can only believe

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:48.960
in an ends that can justify any means if you believe in a utopia, and you can only believe

02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:52.400
in the utopia if you really buy into the Promethean spirit.

02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:55.200
So is that what explains Nazism?

02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:01.600
So Nazism is part of that too, the Promethean spirit that we can make ourselves into

02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:14.880
Superman, Ubermench, right? And Nazism is fueled very much by appropriating and twisting

02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:23.840
sort of Gnostic themes that are very prevalent. Gnosticism tends to come to the fore when people

02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:29.440
are experiencing, you know, increased meaning crisis. And don't forget, the Weimar Republic is like,

02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:35.440
a meaning crisis gone crazy on all levels. Everybody's suffering domicite. Everybody's

02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:40.960
home and way of life and identity and culture and relationship to religion and science. All of that,

02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:50.240
right? And so Nazism comes along and offers a kind of Gnosticism, again, twisted, perverted.

02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:57.440
I'm not saying all nots, I'm not, not saying that all Gnostics are Nazis, but there is this Gnostic

02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:04.000
mythology, mythos, and it comes to the fore. I remember, and this stuck with me,

02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:11.360
undergrad, I was taking political science, and the professor extended lecture on this,

02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:16.240
and it still rings true for me, says, if you understand Nazism as just a political movement,

02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:24.640
you have misunderstood it. It is much more a religious phenomena in many ways.

02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:32.640
Is it religious in that the loss of religion? So is it a meaning crisis? Or is it out of a

02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:38.480
meaning crisis, every discovery of religion in a Promethean type of...

02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:42.880
I think it's the latter. I think there's this vacuum created.

02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:48.240
In that context is Hitler, the central religious figure.

02:49:48.240 --> 02:49:48.800
Yes.

02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:56.880
And also, did Nazi Germany create Hitler, or did Hitler create Nazi Germany? So in this

02:49:56.880 --> 02:50:01.920
distributed cognition, where everyone's having a dialogue, what's the role of the charismatic

02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:10.160
leader? Is it an emergent phenomena, or do you need one of those to kind of guide the populace?

02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:15.760
I hope it's not a necessary requirement. I hope that the next Buddha can be the Sangha,

02:50:15.760 --> 02:50:20.640
rather than a specific individual. But I think in that situation,

02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:28.240
Hitler's charisma allowed him to take on a mythological, in the proper sense, archetypal.

02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:33.760
He became deeply symbolic, and he instituted all kinds of rituals,

02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:41.520
all kinds of rituals, and all kinds of mythos. There's all this mythos about the master race,

02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:46.880
and there's all these rituals. The swastika is, of course, itself a religious symbol.

02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:57.840
There's all of this going on because he was tapping into the fact that when you put people

02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:04.720
into deeper and deeper meaning scarcity, they will fall back on more and more mythological ways

02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:11.120
of thinking in order to try and come up with a generative source to give them new meaning-making,

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:14.000
I should say, meaning-participating behavior.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:20.560
What is evil? Is this a word you avoid?

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:31.520
No, I don't, because I think part of what we're wrestling with here is resisting the enlightenment,

02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:38.320
I mean the historical period in Europe, the idea that evil and sin can just be reduced to

02:51:38.320 --> 02:51:47.840
immorality, individual human immorality. I think there's something deeper in the idea of sin than

02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:55.840
just immoral. I think sin is a much more comprehensive category. I think sin is a failure to love

02:51:55.840 --> 02:52:03.200
wisely so that you ultimately engage in a kind of idolatry. You take something as ultimate,

02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:13.280
which is not, and that can tend to constolate these collective agents, I call them hyperagents,

02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:20.960
within distributed cognition, that have a capacity to wreak havoc on the world that is not just due

02:52:20.960 --> 02:52:29.040
to a sum total of immoral decisions. This goes to Hannah Arendt's thing, and the banality of

02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:34.480
Eichmann, and she was really wrestling with it. I think she's close to something, but I think she's

02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:39.840
slightly off. Eichmann is just making a whole bunch of immoral decisions, but it doesn't seem to

02:52:39.840 --> 02:52:47.280
capture the gravity of what the Nazis did, the genocide and the warfare. She's right,

02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:53.680
because you're not going to get just the summation of a lot of individual, rather banal, immoral choices

02:52:53.680 --> 02:53:01.040
adding up to what was going on. You're getting a comprehensive parasitic process within massive

02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:08.480
distributed cognition that has the power to confront the world and confront aspects of the

02:53:08.480 --> 02:53:13.760
world that individuals can't. I think when we're talking about evil, that's what we're trying to

02:53:13.760 --> 02:53:18.960
point to. This is a point of convergence between me and Jonathan Peugeot. We've been talking about

02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:24.960
this. The word sin is interesting. Are you comfortable using the word sin? Because it's so

02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:30.880
deeply rooted in the religious text. It is. In part, and I struggle around this

02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:38.080
because I was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian, and so that is still there within

02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:44.960
me. There's trauma associated with that. Probably layers of self-deception mechanisms.

02:53:45.760 --> 02:53:52.800
No doubt. No doubt. You're slowly escaping. Trying to, and trying to come into a proper,

02:53:52.800 --> 02:54:00.000
respectful relationship with Christianity via a detour through Buddhism, Taoism,

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:04.080
and pagan Neoplatonism. Trying to find a way how to love wisely.

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:14.160
Yes, exactly. I think the term sin is good because somebody may not be doing something

02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:20.640
that we would prototypically call immoral, but if they're failing to love wisely,

02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:29.520
they are disconnecting themselves in some important way from the structures of reality.

02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:38.560
I think it was Hume. I may be wrong. Hume says, people don't do things because they think it's

02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:44.560
wrong. They do a lesser good in place of a greater good. That's a different thing than

02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:49.280
being immoral. We're saying, you're doing something that's wrong. It's like, well, no, no.

02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:56.080
I'm loving my wife. That's a great thing, isn't it? But if you love your wife at the expense of

02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:04.560
your kids, maybe something's going awry here. Well, I love my country. Great. But should you

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:11.520
love your country at the expense of your commitment to the religion you belong to? People should

02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:16.560
wrestle with these questions, and I think sin is a failure to wrestle with these questions

02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:21.600
properly. To be content with the choices you've made without considering,

02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:29.440
is there a greater good that could be done? Your lecture series on the meaning crisis

02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:36.000
puts us in dialogue in the same way as with the podcast, with a bunch of fascinating

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:43.120
thinkers throughout history, Heidegger, Corbyn, the man Carl Jung, Tillage, Barfield.

02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:49.360
Is there, can you describe, this might be challenging, but one powerful idea from each

02:55:50.000 --> 02:56:00.000
that jumps the mind, maybe Heidegger. So for Heidegger, one real powerful idea that has had

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:05.440
a huge influence on me. He's had a huge influence on me in many ways. He's a big influence on what's

02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:10.160
called 4e cognitive science. And this whole idea about the non-propositional, that was deeply

02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:16.800
afforded by Heidegger and Marla Ponti. But I guess maybe the one idea, if I had to pick one,

02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:23.120
is his critique of ontotheology, his critique of the attempt to understand being in terms of a

02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:28.720
supreme being, something like that, and how that gets us fundamentally messed up, and we get

02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:34.000
disconnected from being because we are over focused on particular beings. We're failing to love

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:39.680
wisely. We're loving the individual things, and we're not loving the ground from which they spring.

02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:43.760
Can you explain that a little more? What's the difference between the being and the supreme

02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:48.400
being and why that gets us into trouble? Okay. So like, well, we talked about this before,

02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:53.920
the supreme being is a particular being, whereas being is no thing. It's not any particular kind

02:56:53.920 --> 02:57:00.160
of thing. And so if you're thinking of being as a being, you're thinking of it in a thingy way

02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:06.000
about something that is fundamentally no thingness. And so then you're disconnecting yourself from

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:12.400
presumably ultimate reality. This takes me to Tillich. Tillich's great idea is understanding

02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:19.520
faith as ultimate concern rather than a set of propositions that you're asserting.

02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:28.960
So what are you ultimately concerned about? What do you want to be in right relationship to?

02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:36.240
Ratio relicchio? And is that ultimate? Is that the ultimate reality that you conceive of?

02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:42.960
Are those two things in sync? This has had a profound influence on me, and I think it's a

02:57:42.960 --> 02:57:50.320
brilliant idea. So some of the others, how do they integrate? Maybe the second, so they're

02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:58.240
called Young and Freud. Which team are you on? I'm on Young. Freud is the better writer.

02:57:58.960 --> 02:58:04.560
But Young has, I think, a model of the psyche that is closer to where cognitive science is heading.

02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:09.120
He's more prescient. Which aspect of his model is the psyche?

02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:13.440
Directly. So Freud has a hydraulic model. The psyche is like a steam engine. Things are under

02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:18.800
pressure, and there's a fluid that's moving around. It's like, shh, like this is a record

02:58:18.800 --> 02:58:24.720
noted this. Young has an organic model. The psyche is like a living being. It's doing all this

02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:31.520
opponent processing. It's doing all of this self-transcending and growing. And I think that's

02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:36.880
a much better model of the psyche than the sort of steam engine model.

02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:41.840
What do you think about their view of the subconscious mind? What do you think their

02:58:41.840 --> 02:58:50.000
view and your own view of what's going on there in the shadow? So all that stuff, some good stuff?

02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:58.800
Any stuff at all? Well, I mean, both Freud and Young are only talking about the psychodynamic

02:58:58.800 --> 02:59:03.120
unconscious, which is only a small part of the unconscious. Can you elaborate?

02:59:04.960 --> 02:59:10.480
They're talking about the aspects of the unconscious that have to do with your

02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:16.800
sort of ego development and how you are understanding and interpreting yourself.

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:21.840
Yeah, but what else is there? There's the unconscious that allows you to turn the

02:59:21.840 --> 02:59:26.720
noise coming out of my face hole into ideas. Also, there's the unconscious that's, yeah.

02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:33.520
All that stuff, which is huge and powerful. And they didn't think about that. They're focused

02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:38.320
on the big romantic stuff that you have to deal with through psychotherapy, that kind of stuff.

02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:41.440
Which is relevant and important. I'm not dismissing. I'm not saying it doesn't exist,

02:59:41.440 --> 02:59:46.000
but it's certainly not all of the unconscious. A lot of work that's going on,

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:51.840
my colleague and deep friend, Anderson Todd, is about, can we take the Jungian stuff

02:59:51.840 --> 02:59:55.200
and the cognitive science stuff and can we integrate it together theoretically?

02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:57.920
And so he's working on that, exactly that project.

02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:02.160
But nevertheless, your sense is there is a subconscious.

03:00:02.160 --> 03:00:07.040
Or at least an unconscious. I like the term unconscious. And Young continually reminded

03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:11.840
people that the unconscious is unconscious, that we're not conscious of it. And that's

03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:20.160
its fundamental property. Yeah. And then isn't the task of therapy then to make the unconscious

03:00:20.160 --> 03:00:29.040
conscious? Yeah, to a degree, right? But also, I mean, yeah, to bring consciousness where there

03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:36.400
was unconscious is part of Young's mythos. But it's also not the thought that that can be completed.

03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:41.840
Part of the why you're extending the reach of the conscious mind is that so it can enter into

03:00:41.840 --> 03:00:48.880
more proper dialogical relationship with the self-organizing system of the unconscious mind.

03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:55.840
What do they have to say about the motivations of humans? So, for Freud joking, I said,

03:00:55.840 --> 03:01:02.640
sex, there's so much of our mind is developing our young age, sexual interactions with the world

03:01:02.720 --> 03:01:09.760
or whatever. Hence, the thing about the edible complex and all, I wanted to have sex with your

03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:16.720
mother. What do you think about their description about what motivates humans? And what do you

03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:25.200
think about the will to power from Nietzsche? Which camp are you in there? What motivates humans?

03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:33.760
Sex or power? I think Plato's right. And I think there's a connection for me. Plato's my first

03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:37.440
philosopher. Young's my first psychologist. And Young is very much the Plato of the psyche.

03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:42.640
You never forget your first. Yeah, you never do. You never do. And I think we have,

03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:51.600
I reject the monological mind. I reject the monophasic mind model. I think we are multi-centered.

03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:56.480
I think we have different centers of motivation that operate according to different principles

03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:05.760
to satisfy different problems. And that part of the task of our humanity is to get those

03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:14.560
different centers into some internal culture by which they are optimally cooperating rather than

03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:23.200
in conflict with each other. What advice would you give to young people? Today, they're in high

03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:26.640
school trying to figure out what they're going to do with their life. Maybe they're in college.

03:02:27.840 --> 03:02:32.720
What advice would you give how to have a career they can be proud of or how to have a life they

03:02:32.720 --> 03:02:46.640
can be proud of? So the first thing is find an ecology of practices and a community that supports

03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:52.800
them without involving you in believing things that contravene our best understood science

03:02:54.000 --> 03:03:01.200
so that wisdom and virtue, especially how they show up in relationships, are primary to you.

03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:09.680
This will sound ridiculous, but if you take care of that, the other things you want are more

03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:17.760
likely to occur because what you most want is you, what you want at when you're approaching your death

03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:26.240
is what were the relationships you cultivated to yourself, to other people, to the world. And

03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:32.640
what did you do to improve the chance of them being deep and profound relationships?

03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:38.720
That's an interesting ecology of practice. Finding a place where a lot of people are doing

03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:44.640
different things that are interesting, interplay with each other, but at the same time is not a

03:03:44.640 --> 03:03:55.920
cult where ideas can flourish. Now, how the hell do you know? In a place where people are really

03:03:55.920 --> 03:04:02.000
excited about doing stuff, that's very ripe for cult formation. Especially if they're a wash

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:09.120
in a culture in which we have ever expanding waves of bullshit. Yes, precisely. Try to keep

03:04:09.120 --> 03:04:15.200
away from the bullshit is the advice. I take this very seriously and I was with a bunch of

03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:20.960
people in Vermont at the respond retreat, people, Rafe Kelly was there, a bunch of people who have

03:04:20.960 --> 03:04:30.400
set up colleges of practices and created communities. And I have good reason to find all of these

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:36.800
people trustworthy. And so we gather together to try and generate real diologos, flow in distributed

03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:44.720
cognition, exercise the collective intelligence and try and address that problem, both in terms of

03:04:45.680 --> 03:04:50.960
you know, meta-curriculum that we can offer emerging communities in terms of practices of

03:04:50.960 --> 03:04:57.040
vetting, how we will self-govern the federation we're forming so that we can resist gurification.

03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:03.680
Gurification of people or ideas. Both. Yeah. Both. Some of us just get unlucky. Some of us get

03:05:03.680 --> 03:05:11.520
unlucky and we all at respond, we all had a tremendous sense of urgency around this,

03:05:12.400 --> 03:05:18.000
but we were trying to balance it about not being premature, but there it was going to,

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:22.480
I mean, there's, we're going to produce a meta-curriculum that's coming in months. There's

03:05:22.480 --> 03:05:27.920
going to be a scientific paper about integrating the scientific work on wisdom with this practitioner

03:05:27.920 --> 03:05:34.800
based ideas about the cultivation of wisdom. There's going to be projects about how we can

03:05:34.800 --> 03:05:41.840
create a self-correcting vetted vetting system. So we can say to people, we think this ecology

03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:47.600
is legit. It's in good fellowship with all these other legit ecologies. We don't know about that

03:05:47.600 --> 03:05:52.720
one. We're hesitant about that one. It's not in good fellowship. We have concerns. Here's why we

03:05:52.720 --> 03:05:58.320
have our concerns, et cetera. And you may say, well, who are you to do that? It's like nobody,

03:05:58.320 --> 03:06:02.480
but somebody's got to do it, right? And that's what it comes down to. And so we're going to give it

03:06:02.480 --> 03:06:12.560
our best effort. It's worth a try. You talked about the meaning crisis in human civilization,

03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:19.840
but in your own personal life, what has been a dark place you've ever gone in your mind?

03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:27.040
Has there been difficult times in your life where you really struggled? Yes. So when I left,

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:35.760
I was left fundamentalist Christianity. And for a while, I was just sort of a hard-bitten atheist.

03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:45.680
The problem with leaving the belief structure was that I didn't deal with all the non-propositional

03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:51.680
things that had gotten into me, all the procedures and habits and all the perspectives and all the

03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:58.560
identities and the trauma associated with that. So I required therapy. It required years of

03:06:58.560 --> 03:07:06.080
meditation and Tai Chi. And I'm still wrestling with it. But for the first four or five years,

03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:14.160
I described it like this. I called it the black burning. I felt like there was a

03:07:15.200 --> 03:07:21.280
blackness that was on fire inside of me, precisely because the religion had left a taste

03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:27.200
for the transcendent in my mouth, but the food it had given me, food in square quotes had soured

03:07:27.200 --> 03:07:33.280
in my stomach and made me nauseous. And the juxtaposition of those seemed like an

03:07:33.280 --> 03:07:41.440
irresolvable problem for me. That was a very, very dark time for me. Did it feel lonely?

03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:47.520
When it was very bad, it felt extremely lonely. And deeply alienating,

03:07:48.480 --> 03:07:54.560
the universe seemed absurd. And there was also existential anxiety. I talk about these things

03:07:54.560 --> 03:07:58.640
for a reason. I don't just talk about them as things I'm pointing to. I'm talking about them

03:07:58.640 --> 03:08:07.760
as seeing in myself and in people I care, having undergone them and how they can bring you close

03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:13.280
to self-destructive. I started engaging in kinds of self-destructive behavior.

03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:20.480
So the meaning crisis to you is not just the thing you look outside and see many people

03:08:20.480 --> 03:08:27.040
struggling. You yourself have struggled. That's, in fact, the narrative is I struggled with it,

03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:33.680
thinking it was a purely personal, idiosyncratic thing. I started learning the kogsai. I started

03:08:33.680 --> 03:08:38.320
doing the tai chi and the meditation. I started doing all this, right? Socratic philosophy.

03:08:39.040 --> 03:08:46.800
And when I started to talk about these pieces, I saw my students' eyes light up. And I realized,

03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:54.400
oh, wait, maybe this isn't just something I'm going through. And then talking to them and

03:08:54.400 --> 03:09:01.520
then doing the research and expanding it out. It's like, oh, many people in a shared fashion

03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:05.680
and also in an individual lonely fashion are going through a meaning crisis.

03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:12.240
Well, we talked a lot about wisdom and meaning. And you said that the goal is to love wisely.

03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:17.040
So let me ask about love. What's the role of love in the human condition?

03:09:17.840 --> 03:09:25.600
It's central. I mean, it's even central to reason and rationality. This is Plato, but Spinoza,

03:09:26.240 --> 03:09:33.200
the most logical of the rationalists. The ethics is written like Euclid's geometry.

03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:38.960
But he calls it the ethics for a reason because he wants to talk about the blessed life. And what

03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:47.280
does he say? He says that ultimately, reason needs love because love is what brings reason out of

03:09:47.280 --> 03:09:54.720
being entrapped in the gravity well of egocentrism. And Murdoch, Iris Murdoch said, I think really

03:09:54.720 --> 03:09:59.440
beautifully, love is when you painfully realize that something other than yourself is real.

03:10:00.320 --> 03:10:08.560
Escaping the gravity well of egocentrism. Beautifully put, a beautiful way to end it,

03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:13.200
John. You're a beautiful human being. Thank you for struggling in your own mind with the

03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:21.200
search for meaning and encouraging others to do the same. And ultimately, to learn how to love

03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:25.600
wisely. Thank you so much for talking today. It's been a great pleasure, Lex. I really enjoyed it

03:10:25.600 --> 03:10:30.960
a lot. Thank you so much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with John Rovecchi. To support

this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you

03:10:35.520 --> 03:10:41.440
with some words from Herman Hessay and Siddhartha. I've always believed, and I still believe, that

03:10:41.440 --> 03:10:46.960
whatever good or bad fortune may come our way, we can always give it meaning and transform it

03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:52.160
into something of value. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
