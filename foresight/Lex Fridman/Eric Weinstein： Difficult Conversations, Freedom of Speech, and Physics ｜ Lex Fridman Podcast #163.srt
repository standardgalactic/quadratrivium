00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, his fourth time on the podcast,

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,160
both sadness and hope run through his heart and his mind, and the result is a complicated,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,760
brilliant human being who I am fortunate to call a friend.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,080
topics in this or other conversations that you listen with an open mind and forgive me or the

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,240
guest for a misstep in an imperfectly thought out statement. To have any chance at truth,

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,160
I think we have to take risks and make mistakes in conversation and then learn from those mistakes.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,200
Please try not to close your mind and heart to others because of a single sentence or an

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,160
expression of an idea. Try to assume that the people in this conversation are just people in

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,800
general are good, but not perfect and far from it, but always striving to add a bit more love

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,960
into the world in whatever way we know how. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

at Lex Freedman. And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein. You often talk about

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:39,600
getting off this planet and I think you don't often talk about extra terrestrial life, intelligent

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,960
life out there. Do you wonder about this kind of thing, about intelligent civilizations out there?

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,840
I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way. In a certain sense, I do find

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,040
that speculating about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and Space Aliens is kind of a recreation

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,800
for when things aren't going very well. At least it gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,520
So I worry about, for example, the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion. You

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,640
can't quite believe enough to go to church or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend. So then

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,880
you just take up an interest in the simulation theory because that's something like what you

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,880
do for your job coding. I do think that in some sense, the issue of aliens is a really

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,280
interesting one, but has been spoiled by too much sort of recreational escapism.

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,080
The key question that I find is, let's assume that it is possible to look out at the night sky

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,040
and see all of these distant worlds and then go visit them. If that is possible, it's almost

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:54,320
certainly possible through some as yet unknown or not accepted theory of physics beyond Einstein.

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,200
It doesn't have to be that way, but probably is. If that theory exists, there would be a

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,240
percentage of the worlds that have life in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way that would have

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:17,360
encountered the ability to escape soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom at a

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,840
minimum and whatever they have that is probably analogous to the cell on that world. So assuming

33
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,960
that life is a fairly generic thing that arises, probably not carbon-based, probably doesn't have

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:42,160
DNA, but that something that fits the pattern of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation,

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,200
differential success. And thereby constantly improving and so on that through time, there'll

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,400
be a trajectory where there'll be something increasingly complex and fascinating and beautiful

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,080
like us humans, but much more. That can also off-gas whatever entropy it creates to give an

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
illusion that you're defeating thermodynamics. So whatever these things are, probably has an

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,280
analog of the bilipid layer so that cells can get rid of the chaos on one side of the barrier and

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,480
keep order on the other. Whatever these things are that create life, assuming that there is a

41
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:24,080
theory to be found that allows that civilization to diversify, we would have to imagine that

42
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,960
such a civilization might have taken an interest in its concept of the universe and have come here.

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,600
They would come here. They would have a deep understanding of the physics of the universe

44
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,120
sufficient to have arrived here. Well, there's two questions, whether they could arrive physically

45
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,400
and whether their information could be sent here and whether they could gain information from us.

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,360
It's possible that they would have a way of looking into our world without actually reaching it. I

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:06,560
don't know. But yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world, can be realized if that's

48
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,760
feasible, then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true and that somebody else should be

49
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,800
here. First of all, I want to say this. My purpose when I come on to your show and I reframe the

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,280
questions is not to challenge you. I can sit inside all of those. It's to give you better audio and

51
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,880
video because I think we've been on an incredible role. I really love what you do. I am trying to

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,520
honor you by being as disagreeable about frame breaking as possible. I think some of your listeners

53
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,720
don't understand that it's actually a sign of respect as opposed to some sort of a complex

54
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,680
dynamic, which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames and that these are sort of

55
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
offerings to get the conversation started. So let me try to break that frame and give you something

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:06:00,880
different. Beautiful. I think what's going on here is that I can prove effectively that we're

57
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,760
not thinking about this in very deep terms. As soon as I say we've got to get off this planet,

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,680
the number of people who assume that I'm talking about faster than light travel

59
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,400
is very high. Faster than light travel assumes some sort of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken

60
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,880
by some small adjustment. I think that that's fascinating. It shows me that our failure to

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,400
imagine what could be being said is profound. We don't have an idea of all of the different

62
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:41,840
different ways in which we might be able to visit distant worlds. All we think about is,

63
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,200
okay, it must be, it must be Einsteinian space times and then some means of exceeding the

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,960
speed limit. And it's just, it's fascinating to me that we don't really have, we've lost

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,520
the ability to just realize we don't know the framework. And what does it even mean? So one

66
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,440
of the things I think about a lot is worlds with more than one temporal dimension.

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,920
It's very hard to think about more than one temporal dimension.

68
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,200
So that's a really strong mental exercise of breaking the framework in which we think,

69
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,880
because most of the frameworks would have a single temporal dimension, right?

70
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Well, first of all, most of the frameworks in which we think would have no temporal dimension,

71
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,240
would have pure, like in mathematics, the differential geometry that Riemann came up with

72
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,120
in the 1800s. We don't usually talk about what we would call split signature metrics,

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,440
or Lorentzian signature. In fact, if it weren't for relativity, this would be the most obscure

74
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,880
topic out there. Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature, and then there's this

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,880
one freakish case of relativity theory in physics that uses this one time and the rest spatial

76
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,640
dimensions. Fascinating. So it's usually momentary and just looking at space?

77
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Yes. We have these three kinds of equations that are very important to us. We have

78
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:16,560
elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic. And so the idea is if I'm chewing gum after eating garlic bread,

79
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,200
when I open my mouth and I've got chewing gum between my lips,

80
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,400
maybe it's going to form an elliptic object called a minimal surface. Then when I pop that and

81
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,400
blow through it, you're going to hear a noise that's going to travel to you by a wave equation,

82
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,880
which is going to be hyperbolic. But then the garlic breath is going to diffuse towards you,

83
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,480
and you're eventually going to be very upset with me, according to a heat equation,

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,160
which will be parabolic. So those are the three basic paradigms for most of the work that we do.

85
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,600
And a lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic, whereas the physicists are in the

86
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,440
hyperbolic case. And I don't even know what to do about more than one temporal dimension,

87
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,600
because I think almost no one studies that. I can't believe you just captured

88
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,600
much of modern physics in the example of chewing gum.

89
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
Well, I have an off-color one, which I chose not to share, but hopefully the kids at home...

90
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Can imagine.

91
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay, so that is the place where we come from. Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility of

92
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,560
breaking the frameworks with two versus zero temporal dimensions, how do we even begin to

93
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,400
think about that? Well, let's think about it as you and I getting together in New York City.

94
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:37,440
So if you tell me, Eric, I want to meet you in New York City, go to the corner

95
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,200
of, I don't know, 34th Street and 3rd Avenue, and you'll find a building on the northwest corner

96
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,440
and go up to the 17th floor, right? So when we have 3rd Avenue, that's one coordinate,

97
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,240
34th Street, that's the second coordinate, and go up to the 17th. And what time is that? Oh,

98
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,120
12 noon. All right. Well, now imagine that we traded the ability to get up to a particular

99
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,440
height in a building that's all flatland, but I'm going to give you two temporal coordinates. So

100
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,040
meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon at the corner of 34th and 3rd. That gets to be too mind-blowing.

101
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,880
I've got two separate watches. And presumably that's just specifying a single point in those

102
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,080
two different dimensions, but then being able to travel along those dimensions. Let me see your

103
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:34,000
right hand. You have no watch on that. I'm very concerned, Lex, that you're going through life

104
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,800
without a wristwatch. That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch. I want you to wear it.

105
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,680
This guy's funnier than basically any human on earth. That has been in my family for months.

106
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,760
It's a Fitbit. Now, what I want you to understand is Lex Fridman is now in a position to live

107
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,160
in two spatial and two temporal dimensions unlike the rest of us. I clearly am only fit for four

108
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,840
spatial dimensions. So I'm frozen, whereas you can double move.

109
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:15,120
I can double move, which is funny because this is set in Austin time. So it's 4 p.m. and this is set

110
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,200
in Los Angeles time. Well, but that's just with an affine shift in mod 12. But my point is,

111
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,480
wouldn't that be interesting if there were two separate time scales and you had to coordinate

112
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,240
both of those, but you didn't have to worry about what floor of the building because everything

113
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,200
was on the ground floor. That is the confusion that we're having. And if you do one more show,

114
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,080
then they're going to put a watch on your ankle and you're only going to have one spatial dimension

115
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,480
that you can move around. But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors of my theory,

116
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,960
in case we're interested in that, which is geometric unity. There is a 2-2 sector and a 3-1

117
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,960
and a 1-3 and a 0-4 and a 4-0. And all of these sectors have some physical reality. We happen

118
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,680
to live in a 1-3 sector. But that's the kind of thinking that we don't do. When I say we have

119
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,840
to get off this planet, people imagine, oh, okay, it's just Einstein plus some ability to break the

120
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,960
law. By the way, even though you did this for humor's sake, I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin.

121
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Am I going to get whacked? No, not quite. But he was given a Super Bowl ring

122
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,760
to look at. And he, instead of just looking at it, put it on his finger and walked away with it.

123
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,080
Robert Kraft? Robert Kraft, that's right. In the same way, I will, if you don't mind,

124
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,320
walk away with this Fitbit and taking the entirety of your life story with it because

125
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,120
there's all these steps on it. Boy, have you lost a lot of weight.

126
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
And where have I been? Exactly.

127
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,680
Right. That's what we're talking about. We're talking about, you want to get into aliens.

128
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,800
Let's have an interesting alien conversation. Let's stop having the typical free will conversation,

129
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,080
the typical alien conversation, the typical AGI morality conversation. It's like, we have to

130
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,400
recognize that we're amusing ourselves because we're not making progress. Time to have better

131
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,280
versions of all these conversations. Is there some version of the alien conversation that could

132
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,840
incorporate the breaking of frameworks? Well, I think so. I mean, the key question would be,

133
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,960
we've had the Pentagon release multiple videos of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us.

134
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,080
I just think it's also really fascinating to talk about the fact that those of us who were

135
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,280
trained to call BS on all of this stuff just had the rug pulled out from under us by the

136
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,840
Pentagon choosing to do this. And you know what the effect of that is? You've opened the door

137
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:48,880
for every stupid theory known to man. My aunt saw a ghost. Okay. Now we're going to have to listen to,

138
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,560
well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it. Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude.

139
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,880
Whoever is in charge of lying to the public, they need a cost function that incorporates

140
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,080
the damage and trust because I held this line that this was all garbage and all BS.

141
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,360
Now I don't know what to think. There's a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion,

142
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,760
the breaking of frameworks that involves the release of videos from the Pentagon,

143
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,040
which is almost like another dimension that trust in itself or the nature of truth and

144
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,880
information is a kind of dimension along which we're traveling constantly that is

145
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:35,440
messing with my head to think about because it almost feels like you need to incorporate

146
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:43,040
that into your study of the nature of reality is like the constant shifting of the notation,

147
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,000
the tools we use to communicate that reality. And so what am I supposed to think about these

148
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,480
videos? Is it a complete distraction? Is it a kind of cosmic joke? I don't know, but you know what,

149
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,360
I'm tired of these people just completely tired of these people on the Pentagon side or the people

150
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,760
who are interpreting this stuff on the Pentagon side. I'm tired of the authorities playing games

151
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,560
with what we can know. The fact that you and I don't, do you have a security clearance?

152
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,040
Some level of it for because I was funded for DARPA for a while.

153
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,280
I don't have a security clearance. You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have

154
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,960
my guess is that there is zero interest from our own government.

155
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
And so the Chinese will find out about it at the same time our government does

156
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,560
because Lord knows what they do in these buildings. I watch crazy people walk in and out of the

157
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,040
intelligence community, walk in and out of DARPA. And I think, wow, you're talking to that person?

158
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,960
That's really fascinating to me. We don't seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball.

159
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,040
Complete lack of transparency. Do you think it's possible there is the government is in

160
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,120
possession of something deeply fundamental to understanding of the world that they're not

161
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,840
releasing? So this is one, one thing is, this is one of the famous distractions that people

162
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:13,280
play with the narrative of alien life forms and spacecraft and possession that the government

163
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,480
is in possession of alien spacecraft. That's the narrative. Yeah.

164
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,280
I don't think the government really exists at the moment. I believe, and this is not an idea

165
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,680
that was original to me. There was a guy named Michael Tidalbaum who used to be at the Sloan

166
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,960
Foundation. And at some point I pointed out that the US government had completely contradictory

167
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,600
objectives when it came to the military and science. And one branch said this,

168
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,040
one branch said that. I said, you know, I don't understand which is true. What is the

169
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,280
government want? He said, do you think there's a government? And I said, what do you mean?

170
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,080
He said, what makes you think that the people in those two offices have ever coordinated?

171
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,600
What is it that allows each office to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office?

172
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
And that's when I first started to understand that there are periods where the government coheres

173
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,840
and then there are periods where the coherence just decays. And I think that that's been going

174
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,120
on since 1945, that there have been a few places where there's been increased coherence, but in

175
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,160
general, everything is just getting less and less coherent. And that what war did was focus us on

176
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,120
the need to have a government of people, a mission, capacity, technology, commitment, ideology.

177
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,520
And then as soon as that was gone, you know, different people, those who'd been through

178
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,680
World War II had one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s, you know, or late 40s by the time

179
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,040
they got to Woodstock, they didn't buy any of that. So coherence is the complete opposite of like

180
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,400
bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy. So coherence is efficient functional government,

181
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,720
because when you say there's no government, meaning there's no emergent function from a

182
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,840
collection of individuals, it's just a bunch of individuals stuck in their offices without

183
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,440
any kind of efficient communication with each other on a single mission. And so a government

184
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,440
that is truly at the epitome of what a government is supposed to be is when a bunch of people working

185
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,800
together. What are we about? Are we about freedom? Are we about growth? Are we about decency and

186
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,880
fairness? Are we about the absence of a national culture so that we can all just do our own thing?

187
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,160
I've called this thing the USAN, the United States of Absolutely Nothing. These are all

188
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:39,520
different visions for our country. So it's possible that there's an alien spacecraft somewhere, and

189
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,680
there's like 20 people that know about it, and then they're kind of, as you communicate further and

190
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,720
further into the offices, that information dissipates, it gets distorted in some kind of way, and then

191
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,400
it's completely lost. The power, the possibility of that information is lost.

192
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,600
We bought a house, and I had this idea that I wanted to find out what all the switches did.

193
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:07,280
And I quickly found out that your house doesn't keep updating its plans. As people do modifications,

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,360
they just do the modifications, and they don't actually record why they were doing what they

195
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,680
were doing or what things lead to. So they're all sorts of bizarre, like there's a switch in my

196
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,160
house that says privacy. I don't know what privacy is. Does it turn on an electromagnetic field?

197
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,600
Does some lead shielding go over the house? That's what we have. We have a system in which

198
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,000
the people who've inherited these structures have no idea why their grandparents built them.

199
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,560
I'd be funny if there's a freedom of speech switch that you could also control,

200
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,960
and there would be perfect metaphor for our current state of things.

201
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,560
Because what they figured out is that if they can just make sure that we don't have any public

202
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,960
options for communication, then, hey, every thing that we say to each other goes through a

203
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,520
private company. Private companies can do whatever they want. And this is one of the greatest moves

204
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,120
that we didn't really notice. Electronic and digital speech makes every other kind of speech

205
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,800
irrelevant. And because there is no public option, guess what? There's always somebody named Sundar

206
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,040
or Jack or Mark who controls whether or not you could speak and what it appears to be that is

207
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,480
being said and who stuff is weighted more highly than others. It's an absolute nightmare. And by

208
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:29,040
the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite, Lord knows what is going on. People are so busy

209
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,600
making money that they are not actually upholding any of the values. So Silicon Valley is sort of

210
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:43,680
maximally against it. It has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen to it when it goes to

211
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,000
Burning Man. And then it quickly just imposes rules on all of the rest of us as to what we

212
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,200
could say to each other if we're not part of the inner elite. So what do you think the ideal

213
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,480
of the freedom of speech means? Well, this is very interesting. I keep getting lectured on

214
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,760
social media by people who have no idea how much power the Supreme Court has to abstract things.

215
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,920
Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. And the spirit

216
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,080
of the law would have to say that our speech that matters is free, at least at the level of ideas.

217
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,040
I don't claim that I have the right to endanger your life with speech or to reveal your private

218
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:27,280
information. So I really am not opining about directed speech intended to smear you. And

219
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
that's a different kettle of fish. And maybe I have some rights to do that,

220
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:38,080
but I don't think that they're infinite. What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas

221
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,040
is essential that the court abstract it and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook,

222
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Twitter, Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are, because it really matters which

223
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:01,040
abstraction use. The case that I really like is search and seizure. If I have private data

224
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,840
that I entered in my house that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house,

225
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,800
but is the abstraction that it's only the perimeter of my house that I have the right to

226
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:20,400
protect? Or does my password extend the perimeter of my house to the data on the server that is

227
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,360
located outside of my house? These are choices for the court. And the court is supposed to pretend

228
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,040
that they can divine the true intent of the framers. But all of the sort of, and I've taken

229
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,560
the calling this the problem of internet hyenas, people with ready-made answers and LOLs and you're

230
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,920
such a moron. These folks love to remind you, it's a private company, dude, it can do whatever it wants.

231
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,840
No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are. And just the way, for example,

232
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,600
the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra because there was too little in the

233
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,760
constitution. Therefore, there were all sorts of things implied that couldn't be in the document.

234
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,720
Somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now that says,

235
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,480
Jack, cannot do it over your wants. It's really, so you say the courts, but it's also us,

236
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,640
people who think about the world, it's you. No, no, no. It's the courts. But the courts don't do this.

237
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,440
We're toast. But we can still think about it. I mean, I don't feel like going down the drain.

238
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,240
Here's what I'm thinking about it because it's tricky how far it should extend. I mean, that's

239
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,720
an ongoing conversation. Don't you think the interpretation of the law? I think I'm trying

240
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,640
to say something very simple and it's just not going to be popular for a while.

241
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication. Print or shouting in a public park. And so,

242
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,680
you know, I can go to a public park and I can shout if I get a permit. Even there,

243
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,480
I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta. We came up with free speech zones where you

244
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,600
can't protest at a convention. You bet you can go to a park 23 miles out and they'll fence off

245
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,400
a little area where you can have your free speech. No, speech is dangerous. Ideas are dangerous.

246
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:17,280
We are a country about danger and risk. And yes, I agree that targeted speech at individuals trying

247
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,440
to reveal their private stuff and all that kind of, that is very different. So forget a lot of

248
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,320
that stuff. But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous and people will die as a result of

249
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,720
free speech. The idea that one life is too much is preposterous. Like why did we send,

250
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,400
if one life is preposterous, why did we send anyone to the beaches of Normandy? I just don't

251
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,840
get this. So one thing that I was clearly bothered by, and maybe you can be my therapist as well,

252
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,480
I thought you were mine. This is, this is a little bit of a miscommunication on both of our

253
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:05,440
parts then. Because who's paying who for this? I was really bothered by Amazon banning parlor

254
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,480
from AWS because my assumption was that the infrastructure, I drew a distinction between

255
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:22,080
AWS, the infrastructure on which competing platforms could be created is different than the

256
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,360
actual platforms. So the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech, I in my mind, in a shallow way

257
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:39,520
perhaps applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter. It felt that we've created a more

258
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,880
dangerous world, that freedoms were violated by banning parlor from AWS, which I saw as the

259
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,760
computing infrastructure which enables the competition of tools, the competition of

260
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,840
frameworks of communication. What do you think about this? First of all, let me give you the

261
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,200
internet hyena answer. I don't understand dude, just build your own Amazon. Yeah, right? Yes.

262
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Well, so that's a very shallow statement, but it's also one that has some legitimacy. We can't

263
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,080
completely dismiss it because there's levels to this game. Yes and no, but if you really wanted

264
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,280
to chase that down, one of the great things about a person-to-person conversation is opposed to like,

265
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,520
let's have 30 of our closest friends. Whenever we have a conversation with 30 of our closest

266
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,040
friends, you know what happens? It's like passing light through a prism. Every person says something

267
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:40,160
interesting and as a result, it's always muddled. Nothing ever resolves. Well, one of my

268
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,880
conversational techniques you mentioned, you pushed back, is first this childlike naivety and

269
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,120
curiosity, but also- Real or simulated? Real, I'm afraid. I would say 8% real.

270
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,840
So in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming? I mean, I did a show with

271
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,840
Ashley Matthews, who's the woman behind Riley Reed, and specifically about this. It was about

272
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,120
the idea that if I move away from politics and go towards sex, I know that there's always a move

273
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:21,120
to use the infrastructure to shut down sex workers. And in this case, we had Operation

274
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,800
Choke Point under the Obama administration. We have a positive passion for people who want

275
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,880
to solve problems that they don't like. This company, they don't like. That company,

276
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,560
Payday Loans would be another one. And so you have legal companies that are harassed by our

277
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:46,400
financial system that you can't, you know, as Riley Reed, Ashley couldn't get a mailchimp

278
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:52,080
account according to her, if I understand her correctly. And this idea that you charge these

279
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,840
people higher rates because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards, even if they're chargebacks are

280
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,240
low. Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment. There's something about everybody

281
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,480
who shows up at Davos. They get drunk in the Swiss Alps, and then they come back home,

282
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,080
and they coordinate. And they coordinate things like build back better. We don't really understand

283
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,800
what build back better is, but my guess is is that build back better has to do with extremism

284
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:27,120
in America. How do we shut down the Republican Party as the source of extremism? Now, I do think

285
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,400
the Republican Party has got very extreme under Trump. And I do believe that that was responsive

286
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:42,080
to how extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first, and then Obama, and then Hillary.

287
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,080
And in all of these circumstances, it's amazing how much we want to wield these things as weapons.

288
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,600
Well, our extremism is fine because we pretend that Tifa doesn't exist and we don't report

289
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,800
what goes on in Portland, but your extremism, my God, that's disgusting. This is the completely

290
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:08,800
ridiculous place that we're in. And by the way, our friends in part are coked up on tech money,

291
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,720
and they don't appear to hold the courage of their convictions at a political level because

292
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,800
it's not in keeping with shareholder value. At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate

293
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:29,840
shield with which everyone can cloak themselves. Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned from

294
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,680
Twitter, and I'm not sure it was a good financial decision for Twitter. Perhaps you can correct

295
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,240
me if I'm wrong. Well, are you thinking locally, or are you thinking if Twitter refused to ban

296
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,960
Donald Trump, what is the odds that the full force of the antitrust division might find them?

297
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,320
I don't know. Oh, I see. I see. So there's a complicated thing. Well, look, these guys are

298
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,640
all having a discussion in very practical terms. You can imagine the sorts of conversation.

299
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,120
Jack, Mark, Senator, we're really glad you're all here. We're all trying to

300
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,000
sing from the same hymnal and row in the same direction. We understand free speech. We're

301
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,960
completely committed to it, but we have to draw on with extremism, guys. We just need,

302
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,280
we need to make sure we're all on the same page. Well, they use the term violence too,

303
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,040
and they, I think, overapply it. So basically anybody...

304
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,240
I'm telling you, I say dumb things to incentivize thoughtful conversation.

305
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace... Like, how old are you, Lex? You're in

306
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,480
your mid-thirties? Yeah, to late-forties.

307
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,400
Mid... Late-twenties to late-forties, somewhere in there.

308
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,600
That's the demographic.

309
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I do think that partially what's happened is that your group has never seen functional

310
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,200
institutions. These institutions have been so compromised for so long,

311
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,520
you've probably never seen an adult. Sometimes I think Elon looks like an adult.

312
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,760
Well, I know that he has a wild lifestyle, but I also see him looking like an adult.

313
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,280
What does an adult look like, exactly?

314
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,080
Oh, you know, somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully, thinks about the future

315
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,560
beyond their own lifespan. Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done,

316
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,960
isn't wildly caught up in punitive actions, is more focused on breaking new ground than

317
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,120
playing rent-seeking games. I mean, I really had a positive... I was so completely chastised

318
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,080
when Elon must end up as the world's richest person. He was like, well, that's interesting,

319
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,400
back to work. That's what an adult would do.

320
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,440
That's what a grown-up would do. And weirdly, I said something about, isn't it amazing that the

321
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,800
world's richest person knows what a Lagrangian is, and he made a terrible Lagrange joke about

322
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,720
potentials? But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately, Elon may be one of the closest

323
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,600
things we have to an adult. And I can tell you that the internet hyenas will immediately descend

324
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,600
as to what a fraudster he is for pumping his stock price, talking his book and all this stuff.

325
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,360
Shut up.

326
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,480
So, looking at the world seriously and rigorously, you're saying that the people who are running

327
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:23,040
tech companies or running the mediums on which we can exercise the ideal of free speech are not

328
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,440
adults?

329
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,480
I think not. I think, first of all, a lot of them are Silicon Valley utopian businessmen,

330
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,520
where you talk a utopian line and you use it... You've heard my take, which is that

331
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,400
the idealism of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts.

332
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,360
And I believe that in many ways, the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world,

333
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,360
a world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, is really about the

334
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,960
software eating the world, as Mark Andreessen likes to say, through all these legacy properties,

335
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:03,120
and by simply being a bad tech version of something that previously existed like a newspaper,

336
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,080
you could immediately start to dwarf that by aggregating newspapers and their digital versions,

337
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,240
because digital is so much more powerful. As a result, yes, we have lots of man-children

338
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,400
wandering around what once was the Bay Area and is now Austin and Miami and other places,

339
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,680
maybe Singapore, that all of these people... These are friends of ours and they're brilliant

340
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,240
with respect to a certain amount of stuff, but none of them can get off the drip.

341
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,120
It's amazing that none of them have FU money. We've got billionaires who don't have FU money.

342
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,680
Okay. I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey was that there was an incitement of violence,

343
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,520
and not just Jack Dorsey, but everybody that was banning people. And then this word violence was

344
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:59,760
used as a kind of just like extremism and so on without much reason behind it. You think it's

345
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,000
impossible for Jack Dorsey or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult, a grown-up and...

346
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,560
Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grown-up. It seems like he is.

347
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,560
As you've discussed, it seems that he's been on the verge of almost being

348
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,840
quite serious and transparent and real. I don't know where the Jack Dorsey that I met

349
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:28,000
went, and I worry that that must be something behind the scenes that I can't see.

350
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,440
From my perspective, what I think is the stress, the burden of that when people are

351
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:45,040
screaming at you. Jack is a Zen monk. He really is. Jack is an incredibly impressive person,

352
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,360
intellectually, morally, spiritually, at least for a couple of meetings. I don't know him very

353
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:59,120
well, but I'm very impressed by the person I met, and I don't know where that person is,

354
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,480
and that terrifies me. But do you think somebody could step up in that way?

355
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:14,080
No. Does a human being have the capacity to be transparent about the reasoning behind the banning,

356
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,280
or do you think all banning eventually, all banning of people from mediums of communication

357
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,840
is eventually destructive, or it's impossible for human beings to reason with ourselves about it?

358
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:34,080
Well, let's see what the problem is. My phone has been on airplane mode. I'm going to unlock it.

359
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm going to take a picture of Lex Fridden. Now, if I can, I'm going to tweet that picture out.

360
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,960
Great. But here's the weird part about it. That picture sitting with

361
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,000
Lex today. This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made.

362
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:09,280
Okay. In so doing, I have just sent a picture of you and a tiny piece of text all over the

363
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,800
planet that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth, just under half a million different

364
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,840
accounts. And then more from sharing and so on. Well, in some of those accounts are dead,

365
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,240
we don't really know how many places it went. But the key issue with that tweet is that

366
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:41,120
that is a non-local phenomenon. Yes. So I just broadcasted to an entire planet. Somebody in

367
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:50,640
Uganda is reading that at the same time as somebody in Uruguay. There is no known solution to have

368
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,720
so many people with the ability to communicate non-locally because locality was part of the

369
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,560
implicit nature of speech inside of the constitution. Friction, locality, there were all sorts of other

370
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,280
aspects to speech. So if you think about speech as a bundle, I like this.

371
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:17,680
Then it got unbundled. And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on to retard

372
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,840
the impact of speech aren't present. And we don't have the courage to say,

373
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,720
I wonder if the First Amendment really applies in the modern era in the same way,

374
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,960
or we have to work through an abstraction. Either we probably have to amend the constitution,

375
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:41,440
or we have to abstract it properly. And that issue is not something we're facing up to. I watch us

376
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,920
constantly look backwards. We don't seem to try to come up with new ideas and new theories. Nobody

377
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,360
really imagines that we're going to be able to wisely amend the constitution anymore inside of

378
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,520
the United States. Many people abroad will say, why are these guys talking about the US? It's a

379
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,520
US-centric program. Well, that's because nobody knows where this program lives.

380
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,680
The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be in a physical place together is also

381
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,880
bizarre. It could be anywhere. It doesn't really matter that it happens to be here.

382
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,040
So the difference between logical and between physical, local, non-local,

383
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,400
frictional, non-fictional, it's the same thing with firearms. Nobody imagined that the

384
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,080
gatling gun was going to be present when you had to reload a musket.

385
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:38,160
And that's fascinating to think about. You're exactly right that the nature of this particular

386
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,040
freedom that seems so foundational to this nation, to what made this nation great, and perhaps

387
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,720
much of the world that is great, made it great, is changing completely. Can we try to reason through

388
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:58,880
how the ideal freedom of speech is to be changed? I guess I'm struggling. It feels really wrong,

389
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,760
perhaps because I wasn't paying attention to it. It feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump

390
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,320
from Twitter, to ban not just the president. That's really wrong to me. But this particular

391
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,720
human for being divisive. But then when there's an incitement of violence,

392
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:31,680
that is an overused claim. But perhaps there was actual brewing of local violence happening. So

393
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:39,280
one of the things I know what's happening on Parler is people were scheduling meetings together

394
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:47,520
in physical space. So you're now going back from this dynamic, social, large-scale people

395
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,800
from Uganda, people from all over the world being able to communicate. You're now mapping that into

396
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,640
now back meeting in the physical space that is similar to what the founding of this nation was.

397
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,080
But if the violence were digital, if ransomware suddenly was unleashed, the key issue is the

398
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:14,480
abstractions. So what was freedom of speech as a bundle? And then how do we abstract the bundle

399
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,200
into the digital era? Do you think we just need to raise the question and talk about it? Do you

400
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,880
have ideas? Well, sure I have ideas. But the key point is that I'm not even welcome in mainstream

401
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,120
media. I've never seen you on mainstream media. Do you do mainstream media? So we exist in part

402
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:37,360
of an alternate universe because the mainstream media is trying to have a coherent story, which I

403
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,840
have called the gated institutional narrative. And the institutions pretend that they plug their

404
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:49,120
fingers in their ears and pretend that nothing exists outside of MSNBC talking to CNN about what

405
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,400
was in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post. And so that's effectively like a

406
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,760
professional wrestling promotion where they, you know, the undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan

407
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,600
and Rowdy Roddy Piper. Okay, well, that's very different than MMA. You've recently been on

408
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:13,520
Glenn Beck's program. Yeah. And there was this kind of one of the things you've talked about

409
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,080
is being able to have this conversation. I don't know if you would put it as a type of

410
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,320
conversation that was happening outside the mainstream media, but a conversation that

411
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,440
reaches across different worldviews and having a nuanced or just like a respectful

412
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,080
conversation that's grounded and mutual. But we can't have the reality because the main model is

413
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,880
the center, both left and right is in the process of stealing all the wealth that we built up.

414
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,880
And they've organized the extremes into two LARPing teams that I've called

415
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,960
MAgastand and Wokastand. And then you have everybody who isn't part of that complex,

416
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,160
all seven of us, the number of us who are able to earn a living looking at all of these mad

417
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,520
people playing this game. You know, there's a phrase inside finance when the investment banks

418
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,000
are trying to look at price action. And somebody says, this doesn't make any sense.

419
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,040
And somebody will say, it's just the locals stealing from each other. And that's really

420
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,160
what we have. We've got the leaders of MAgastand and Wokastand championing these two teams sponsored

421
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,160
by the center because it's a distraction while they steal all the silver and cut the paintings

422
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,120
out of the frames. That's what you and I are looking at. So when you ask me, do you have any

423
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,760
ideas about the abstraction for free speech? I've never met Mark Zuckerberg. I've never met

424
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,080
Sundar Pichai. I never met Larry Page. I was once in a room with Sergey Brin. I've never

425
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,320
spoken to Elon Musk. I hang out with Peter Thiel, but we have a very deep relationship,

426
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,520
but I don't really speak to that many other people at sort of at this level.

427
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,120
We're not having any kind of smart conversation at a national level. In fact, it's almost as if

428
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,400
we've destroyed every sandbox in which we could play together. There's no place

429
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,120
that we actually talk except long form podcasting. And by the way, they've found,

430
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,880
you see what's going on with like Alex Stamos and the Hoover Institution.

431
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,040
There's a loophole left. Long form podcasting allows people to speak at levels above daytime

432
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,440
CNN. It's like, well, why do you think they're not watching daytime CNN?

433
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,800
But that's just silly journalism. They currently have no power to

434
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,360
displace podcasting. That's why it's so powerful. RSS feed. I mean, that's why the big challenge

435
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:55,680
with Joe Rogan and Spotify is like, there's this dance that's fascinating to see is Joe Rogan is

436
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,200
not part of the system. And then he's also uncancelable. And there's this tension that's

437
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:10,960
happening. Well, Howard Stern, Howard Stern became much less relevant. So if they can't control Joe

438
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,960
by bringing him in house, the key question is, is he going to continue? Like, you know, this

439
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,040
Joe says this thing about FU money. Yeah. Joe's one of the only people with FU money who's actually

440
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:35,600
said FU. Yeah. I don't understand this. I don't have FU money. What exactly is, can we break apart

441
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:44,400
FU money? Because I always thought I've been fortunate enough to have always have FU money

442
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,960
in the sense that my standards were so low that a basic salary in the United States.

443
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,160
This is the stoic point, which is it can live on rice and beans. You're uncancelable because

444
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,480
you're always rich relative to your needs. So isn't that FU fundamental FU money? Why do you say

445
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,000
that tech billionaires don't have FU money? When you need to hire private security to protect

446
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,560
your family, how do you protect your two children? I don't have those yet. Bingo. Yeah. My point is,

447
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:17,760
is that FU money insulates everything that you care about. It's not just about you. So you're

448
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,760
saying as the level of responsibility grows, the amount of money required for FU

449
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,560
we have a war going on. The war is on academic freedom. Academic freedom used to be present

450
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,720
in the system as a, in terms of the idea, we trust our elite. Now we have an idea like,

451
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,280
you want to be the elite, you know, you want a Lord above us. That's like, first of all,

452
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,600
there's like a populist anti-elitist thing. Then there's the idea that we're going to defer tenure

453
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,680
for forever. Then we're going to tell people stay in your lane. Your tenure is only good for your

454
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,800
own particular tiny micro subject. Then we're going to also control your grants and we'll

455
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,120
be able to load up your teaching load if we don't like who you are and we'll make your life

456
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:09,520
absolutely impossible. We lost academic freedom and we ushered in peer review, which was a disaster.

457
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,400
And then we lost funding so that people were confident that they would have the ability to

458
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,720
do research no matter what they said. And as a result, what you find is, is a world in which

459
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,560
there's no ability to get people to say, no, I'm not going to sign your diversity and inclusion

460
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,520
forced loyalty oath. I won't sign any loyalty oath. Get the hell out of my office. FU.

461
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,040
FU. And you're connecting money to that, but. Well, my point is, is that academic freedom

462
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,760
is the whole idea behind it was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire

463
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:56,800
on a much smaller salary. Right. Okay. We've lost that. Yeah. The only reason in part that I wanted

464
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:05,440
to go into academic, academics as a profession, as opposed to wanting to do physical or mathematical

465
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:13,280
research, the great prize was freedom. Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation previously of IBM

466
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,600
research pointed it out. He says, if you lose freedom, you lose the only thing we had to offer

467
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,280
top minds, top minds value their intellectual freedom and their physical and economic security

468
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,800
at a different level than other human beings. And so people say, you know,

469
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,480
I don't understand, dude, you have the ability to do X, Y and Z. What's the problem? It's like, well,

470
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,800
I value my ability to raise the middle finger as an American practically above everything else.

471
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:49,360
I want to talk to you about freedom here in the context of something you've mentioned, which

472
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,600
one way to take away freedom is to put a human being into a cage to create constraints. The other

473
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:03,680
one that worries me is something that I think you spoke into Twitter a little bit on Twitter is

474
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:18,800
we bleed freedom by kind of slowly scaring you into not doing, not expressing the full spectrum

475
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,320
of opportunities you can as freedom. So like when you ban Donald Trump, when you ban Parler,

476
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,960
you give a little doubt in the minds of millions like me, a person who's a tech person,

477
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,560
who's an entrepreneur, there's a little, that's what I'm afraid of when I look in the mirror.

478
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,680
Is there not a little doubt in there that limits the amount of options I will try?

479
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,960
How certain are you that the COVID virus didn't come from the Wuhan lab and his biosafety level

480
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:58,720
for? We both know that we're both supposed to robotically say the idea that the COVID virus

481
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,880
came from a lab is a discredited conspiracy theory. There is no evidence that suggests

482
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,000
that this is true. The World Health Organization and the CDC have both upon this to say otherwise

483
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
would be incredibly irresponsible. And the threat of that is the thing that ultimately limits

484
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,960
the freedoms we feel. I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time.

485
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,000
And you're afraid. In a sense.

486
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's also boring. I mean, I said it in the public many times.

487
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,720
Why is it we don't ask where the records are from Velard House? Where are the financial records?

488
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,480
Where are the SEC filings? Where are the questions on the record to the intelligence

489
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,800
agencies? Was he known to be part of the intelligence community? So we're not interested

490
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,080
in asking questions. Am I going to die as a result of asking the question?

491
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,160
Was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community of any nation?

492
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,320
Is there a reason we're not asking about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund

493
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,920
that he didn't run? Just like the Wuhan lab.

494
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,160
Okay. How do we get to the core of the Jeffrey Epstein, the truth behind Jeffrey Epstein, in

495
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,640
a sense? I mean, there's some things that are just useless conspiracy theories around it,

496
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,560
even if they're true. There's some things they get.

497
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,320
I hate to say it. You're not going to like it.

498
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,960
Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break-in of the Citizens' Committee to investigate the FBI.

499
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:30,080
Those kids, and by the way, they weren't all kids, did what had to be done.

500
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,760
They broke in. They broke the law. It was an incredible act of civil disobedience.

501
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,760
And God bless Judy Feingold for taking to her, she was going to take to her grave.

502
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,280
That she'd been part of this, like the coolest thing of all time.

503
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,160
They didn't say anything for forever. So civil disobedience. I mean, you have to...

504
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,560
We are founded on civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is incredibly...

505
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,280
You screw it up and you're just a vandal. You screw it up, you're a hooligan.

506
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,040
Those cats were so disciplined. It's an art form.

507
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,320
It was an art form and they risked everything they were willing to pay with their freedom.

508
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,720
Those are the sorts of people who earned the right by putting themselves at risk.

509
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,880
I would not do this. I am not volunteering to break into anything.

510
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,960
I think it was William Davodon who was a student of Murray Gelman and a physics professor at Haverford

511
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,920
who corralled these people and led this effort.

512
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,960
And right now, what we need is somebody to blow the lid off of what is controlling everything.

513
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,560
I'm happy to hear that it's a system of incentive structures,

514
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,080
that it's a system of selective pressures. I'm happy to find out that it's emergent.

515
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,400
I'm happy to find that it's partially directed by our own intelligence community.

516
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,200
I'm happy to hear that, in fact, we've been penetrated by North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia.

517
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,600
But I need to know why people aren't... The firebombing of the courthouse in Portland,

518
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:16,080
Oregon has no explanation. And somehow this is normal. This is not normal to any human being.

519
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,200
We have video that people don't believe. I come back to the shaggy defense of it wasn't me.

520
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,600
It's like...

521
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,080
You remember that song? Shaggy, yeah. It wasn't me. He caught you

522
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,480
banging him in the shower on the counter. Yeah, exactly. It wasn't me.

523
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,760
His friend says, well, your strategy makes no sense at all.

524
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,320
But this is what MSNBC is doing. You dropped him from the graphic. It wasn't me.

525
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:51,200
It wasn't me. You came up with another yank. It wasn't me.

526
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:58,400
I will never see MSNBC the same again. So you've spoken about him before. I think it would be nice

527
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:06,000
to maybe honor him to break it apart a little bit. Aaron Schwartz. Why was he a special human

528
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,560
being in this ilk of what we're talking about now, civil disobedience? How do we honor him

529
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:18,320
now moving forward as human beings who are willing to take risks in this world?

530
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,120
Well, I don't know. Are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz?

531
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,520
I am. How do you feel about JSTOR? Let's talk about JSTOR first. Let's say what JSTOR is all about.

532
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:42,000
We the taxpayer pay for research and then the people who do the research do all the work for a

533
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,560
bunch of companies who then charge us $30 an article to read what it is that we already paid

534
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,600
for. And if we don't cite these articles, we're told that we're in violation. Okay.

535
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,760
I almost never call for civil disobedience because I don't really want to, but

536
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,120
fuck JSTOR, fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer. Who the fuck are these people?

537
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah. The smart people need to take the greedy people behind the woodshed and explain to them

538
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,880
what science is. I have a very old fashioned idea that's so out of favor that I will immediately

539
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,400
be seen as a knuckle-dragger. I believe in the great woman theory of history and the great man

540
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:40,240
theory of history. Emmy Nerder is fantastic as an example. And I believe in editors over peer

541
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,840
reviewers. And I believe that wrong things should be allowed into the literature. And I believe that

542
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:52,560
the gatekeeping should go towards zero because the costs associated with distribution are very,

543
00:54:52,560 --> 00:55:00,320
very slight. I believe that we should be looking at the perverse incentives of sending your paper

544
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,720
blindly into your competitors' clutches, particularly if you're a young person being

545
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:12,480
reviewed by an older person. Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor? Are you familiar with

546
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:20,240
the legend of the Magnaia? No. The Magnaia is the Miller's daughter. And the largest food fight

547
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:26,560
in the entire universe, I believe, is held, I think in Italy. It's called the Battle of the

548
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:35,680
Oranges. And it celebrates the Miller's daughter who had fallen in love with her beloved. And when

549
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:45,040
it came time for them to marry, the Virginal Magnaia was in fact told that the Lord of the land

550
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,280
had the right to have the first night with the bride. Well, the Magnaia had a different idea.

551
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:58,320
So she seemed to consent to this perhaps mythical right, also called the Prima note the first night.

552
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:07,520
And by legend, she concealed a dagger underneath her robes. And when it came time for the hated

553
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,960
Lord of the Manor to extract this right, she pulled the knife out and killed him. And I think it

554
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:22,160
also echoes a little bit of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones. But that inspired

555
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:30,880
both men and women. And the Magnaia is the legendary hero. Right now, what we need to do is we need

556
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,920
to resist the Prima note, the right of first look, right? F you, you don't have the right of first

557
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,160
look. I don't want to send something blindly to my competitors. I don't want to subject myself to

558
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:49,920
you naming what work I've done. Why are you in my story? That's my question. Get out of my story.

559
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,440
If I do work, and then you have an idea, oh, well, it's the Matthew principle. To him,

560
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,240
who has much more will be given. I've gone to the National Academy of Sciences and talked about

561
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,440
these things. And it's funny, I've been laughed at by the older people who think, well, Eric,

562
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,960
you know, science proceeds funeral by funeral, that's plonk. You know, the Matthew principle,

563
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,840
you know, the Matilda principle that things done by women are attributed to men,

564
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,680
that these are not new. And you guys just live like this?

565
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,760
Yeah. So the revolutionary act now is to resist all of these things that are not new.

566
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,600
So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz. Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia. One of the things

567
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:35,440
you've done very beautifully is to communicate love. And I think about some of our conversations.

568
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,200
You got me to talk a little bit about my own experiences in 02138 and 39.

569
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,040
We are the product of our trauma. And what people don't understand is that very often,

570
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:57,040
when you see people taking countermeasures against what appear to be imaginary forces,

571
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,960
they're really actually replaying things that really happen to them.

572
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:08,160
And having been through this system and watching all of the ways in which it completely rewrites

573
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,640
the lives of the people who I am counting on to cure our diseases, build our new industries,

574
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:19,520
keep us safe from our foes, the amount of pressure the system is putting on the most

575
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:28,320
hopeful minds is unimaginable. And so my goal is to empower somebody like an Aaron Schwartz in memory

576
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:34,400
and to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation. Do you know that the first person outside

577
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,760
of me to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein?

578
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,280
How did he know I was working on this? I don't know.

579
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,840
So your ideas that formed geometric unity was something that his eyes have seen?

580
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:58,400
I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein as one of the only people who could help me.

581
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,680
No, no, no, listen to this. Yeah, how does this connect?

582
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:09,360
Okay. Well, first of all, my old synagogue, my old school, was the conservative minion at Harvard

583
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:18,240
Hillel. And I believe it's called Rossofsky Hall after Henry Rossofsky in the economics department

584
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:24,240
who was a Japan scholar, if I'm correct. And he became provost or dean of Harvard.

585
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:33,120
I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein's money. And I wondered in part whether the Jewish

586
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,960
students at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck of Harvard Hillel. So that was something

587
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,000
I found very curious, but I don't know much about it. I also found that Jeffrey Epstein hanging

588
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,960
around scientists. I don't think that either you or Joe exactly, I mean, got me correct

589
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:54,400
in your last interchange. For the record, for people who didn't have a listen to Joe Rogan

590
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:01,920
program, Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein was the only person who has gotten laid. And you said

591
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,320
you also got paid as a young man, right? I believe the word was laid, but allegedly.

592
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,920
My hearing isn't so good at age 55. All right, leaving that aside.

593
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,600
What was Jeffrey Epstein doing hanging around all of these scientists? I don't think that was the

594
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:26,400
same program that was about compromising political leaders and business people and entertainment

595
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,040
figures. I think these are two different programs that were being run through one individual.

596
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:38,400
And Joe seemed to think that I didn't think he was smooth. I thought he was glib. I think what Joe

597
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:45,680
was really trying to get at was that I found his mysticism meretricious. He had an ability to deflect

598
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,520
every conversation that might go towards revealing that he didn't know what he was talking about.

599
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,400
Every time you started to get close to something where the rubber hit the road, the rubber wouldn't

600
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:07,120
hit the road. And yet, can you help me untangle the fact that you thought deeply about the physics

601
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,440
of the nature of our universe? And Jeffrey Epstein was interested.

602
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,960
How did he know? I wasn't really talking about this stuff until

603
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,160
even my close friends didn't really know what I was up to.

604
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,360
And yet, you're saying he did not have sufficient brilliance to understand

605
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,800
when the rubber hit the road. So why did he have sufficient interest and curiosity?

606
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:38,000
Tell me what I thought. I've been waiting to find out, does my government even know I exist?

607
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,200
Do you have an answer to that question? A couple times, the government has reached out to me.

608
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:53,440
In general, there is zero interest in me, less than zero interest. I find that fascinating.

609
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:59,360
As far as you know, right? Well, that's what I'm trying to say. The question about not being able

610
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,480
to see through a half-silvered mirror, you don't know what's going on behind the half-silvered

611
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:11,840
mirror. To you, all you see is your reflection. But your intuition still holds. This is where I've

612
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:18,400
mentioned that I... This is where I'll say naive dumb things, but I still hold on to this intuition

613
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:26,400
that Jeff... I'm not confident in this, but I lean towards that direction that Jeffrey Epstein is the

614
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,640
source of evil, not something that's underlying him. You have a bias. It's different than mine.

615
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:40,000
Our Bayesian priors are tutored by different life experiences. If I was mostly concerned,

616
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
like Sam Harris is concerned, that people fill their heads with nonsense,

617
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,400
I would have a very strong sense that people need order in the world, that they take

618
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,200
mysterious situations, they build entire castles in the air, and then they go move in if they

619
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:01,040
really get crazy. The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air and

620
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:06,560
psychotics move in. Coming from a progressive family, we had a different experience. It's

621
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,240
really weird when the government is actually out to get you, when they actually send a spy,

622
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,920
when they actually engage in disinformation campaigns, when they smear you. And if you've

623
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,440
ever had that brought to bear on your family, you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding

624
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,520
of the country, which is different than having a, wow, do people believe crazy stuff because

625
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,880
they watch too much TV? And both of these things have some merit to them, but it's a question

626
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,960
of regulated expression. When do you want to express more Sam Harris and when do you want to

627
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,720
express more Howard Zinn? You can express both, correct? The one human being can express both?

628
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,120
Sure, but there's a trade-off between them. In other words, most people, like the Michael

629
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,920
Shermers of the world are going to tilt very strongly to extraordinary claims, require extraordinary

630
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,520
evidence. You're going to have that kind of energy. And then somebody else is going to say,

631
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,200
how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb before I realize that there's a problem?

632
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:08,160
So my feeling about this is, yes, people see patterns in clouds. They see faces and scripture

633
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,720
and all sorts of things, and it's just random cloud patterns. And it's also the case that there's

634
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,680
tremendous pressure not to see conspiracies when conspiracies are relatively more common

635
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:22,720
than the people who shout conspiracy theory will claim. So both of these things are true. And you

636
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,760
have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn and when your inner Harris? And those are different.

637
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,440
One fundamental difference you and I biases aside is you've actually met Jeffrey Epstein.

638
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:42,800
And I'm listening to reverberations years later of stories and narratives throughout the story.

639
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:49,600
Luckily, I only met him once. And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations with him

640
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:55,040
other than the one meeting. You can learn a lot in just a few words from a human being.

641
01:04:55,040 --> 01:05:00,000
Well, that's true. But I think that the bigger issue was I saw something that I don't hear

642
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:07,200
much remarked upon, which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is. In other words, there's the

643
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:13,040
National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes, there's all this stuff

644
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,000
that kind of has the same feel to it, a little bit of variation and difference,

645
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,240
Department of Energy. If you fall outside of that, there's just Jeffrey Epstein. That's what you're

646
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:30,160
told. That's not quite true. There's Cavley. Maybe Jim Simons is now in the game. Peter

647
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:36,160
Thiel has done some stuff. You had Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try. So there is other money

648
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:42,880
running around, Templeton. But very strongly, there was a belief that if you're doing something

649
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:49,040
really innovative and the system can't fund it because we become pussies, Jeffrey Epstein's your

650
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,960
guy. And that's because it's funnel that you're supposed to go through.

651
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,600
That's right. And the idea is that you get called to the great man's house and the sort of

652
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:08,480
lubricious version of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions and maybe he has

653
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:17,680
an island, maybe he has a plane. And when you're starved, somebody showing you a feast or when

654
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:27,760
you're dehydrated in a death's door and somebody says, oh, I have a well. That's what it is.

655
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:34,160
And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing money into the science system so that we

656
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:41,120
don't have super creeps trying to learn all of our secrets ahead of time? WTF, what is your problem

657
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:47,200
with transparency and taxpayer dollars? All of you, you wouldn't have a country. You'd be speaking

658
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:53,600
German. So essentially, you believe that human beings would not be able to, when the money is

659
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,800
lacking in the system, like in research. We produce public goods. You and I are meant to produce

660
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:04,800
public goods. Now, I sell athletic greens and I sell Theragun and I sell Unagi scooters

661
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:13,680
and Chili Pat. Can I be honest? I love these products. But I didn't get into this game for the

662
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:21,440
purpose of selling. I'm trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle? But you know something

663
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,600
like, I don't know why you built this channel. It's kind of a mystery. I'll tell you why I built

664
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:34,720
my channel. It's going to be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley. I got rolled multiple

665
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:41,120
times and my point is I didn't want to become a celebrity. I didn't want to become well known,

666
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:48,960
but it's a lot harder to roll somebody who's getting, you know, I think I'm, I don't know if

667
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,120
this is mistaken, but I think I'm the math PhD with the largest number of followers on Twitter.

668
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:00,960
And there was nothing you could do before. I mean, again, to put a little responsibility on you.

669
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,320
So you've created something really special for the distribution of your own ideas. I mean,

670
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:13,760
but because it's not necessarily currently scalable, you also, perhaps you and I have

671
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:20,080
the responsibility of giving other people also a chance to spread their ideas. I mean, Joe Rogan

672
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,800
did this very effectively for a bunch of people that. That's why they're angry at him because

673
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:31,520
he's a gatekeeper and he let all sorts of people through that gate from Roger, from Roger Penrose

674
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:39,680
to Alex Jones. To Jordan Peterson to, I mean, even, first of all, to you and to Abby Martin.

675
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:47,920
To Abby Martin. To Barry Weiss. Yeah. That's the problem. Well, but you have not successfully

676
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:54,320
built up a thing that allows that to carry that forward. No, no, no, no. We are all vulnerable

677
01:08:54,320 --> 01:09:00,800
to reputational attack because what happens, you see, the problem Lexis is that you are now in

678
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:06,240
an institution at some level. You walk around with all this equipment in a duffel bag,

679
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:16,560
the last suit, the last suit you'll ever need. And you have the reach of something like CNN

680
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,760
to people who matter. Okay. So now the question is, how do we control something that doesn't

681
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,360
have a board, doesn't have shareholders, doesn't have to make SEC filings, FCC. So the best

682
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:37,520
answer they have is, well, we just have to destroy reputations. All it takes is for us

683
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:42,960
to take something that gets said or done or alleged. And I think it's incredibly important.

684
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,040
One of the things people don't understand is that I'm going to fight general reputational attacks,

685
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:54,400
not because some people don't deserve to have their reputations drag through the mud,

686
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:02,880
but because it's too powerful of a tool to hand it to CNN, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard,

687
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,240
the State Department. Yes. But as some of it is also...

688
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,120
Jake Morgan. Muhammad Ali style being good enough at

689
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,600
doing everything you need to do without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks,

690
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,000
not being afraid, but not giving enough meat. I don't see why the people who have good ideas

691
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,720
have to lead lives that are that clean. If you can do it. You can be messy. Yeah. You should

692
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:37,760
be able to be messy that otherwise we're suppressing too many people. Look. Too many, too

693
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:44,000
billion minds. Yeah. Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt? I still people tell me this.

694
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,520
Okay. I have discussions about Elon and people,

695
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:58,080
the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist who's talking about Amua Amua that it might be alien technology.

696
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:07,760
He told me this outside the box thinker. Yeah. When speaking to me about Elon,

697
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:16,480
said, called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed. The blunt in a dismissive way.

698
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:23,520
Like this guy is crazy because he smoked some weed. I was looking at him. I was like, why? Wow.

699
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:31,680
Wow. I think you should be able to have consensual drug filled orgies. Fuck perfect lives.

700
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,480
Yeah. You should be allowed to be messy. Yeah. Right. I take back my statement. I'm just saying.

701
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:44,160
Respectability is the unique prison where all of the gates are open and the inmates

702
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:50,720
beg to stay inside. It's time to end their prison of respectability because it's too

703
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:57,680
effective of a means of sidelining and silencing people, including it is better that we have bad

704
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:05,280
people in our system than this idea of no platforming people who are beyond the pale

705
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:11,040
because it's such a simple technique. So what's the heroic action here on the...

706
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:17,040
Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program. By the way, she was absolutely

707
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:25,040
delightful as a guest. She is polite in the extreme, far more polite than I am.

708
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,960
And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest because I wanted to highlight this

709
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,000
program can go anywhere. We can talk to anyone. What about social media? You've started highlighting

710
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,840
people being banned on social media. How do we fight this? Like if you get banned from social

711
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,920
media, so you're saying nobody will stand up to me? Well, just figure out what your incentive

712
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,800
structure is before. Assume that I get banned on social media because somebody wants to make

713
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,280
sure that my message doesn't interfere with the dominant narrative. Yeah. Okay.

714
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:02,560
What will happen? By the way, I'm very glad to be able to explain this on your show because

715
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:09,120
that video will presumably be archived and they can't easily make you take it down. Okay.

716
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,800
So what's going to happen is that there'll be a whole bunch of very low quality bot-like

717
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,880
accounts that dog you every time you talk about me.

718
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,800
Right. Dude, it's getting old. It's getting boring. We already heard you. Dude, that was like,

719
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,240
let it go. Not a good look. Not a good look is one of my favorites.

720
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,960
But what about the high-profile ones? Well, then you'll get a few high-profile ones and some of

721
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:41,200
the high-profile ones command armies. Like at some point, I had 10,000 people using exactly the

722
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:46,240
same templated tweeting at me. It was just actually, it got to the point where it was funny because

723
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,640
everybody said, did you hear that in a hipster coffee shop? I was like,

724
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,840
why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee? It's hilarious.

725
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,040
Those things will cause you to think better of it. You'll start to see your follower can't go down

726
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,840
because it's easy to give you a bunch of bot-like follows and then just pull them.

727
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:12,240
So I think it's pretty well known how, and then maybe your account will be suspended and it can't

728
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,560
be revoked and etc. And then three days later, you'll be told it was an error.

729
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,560
So let me push back. I just don't see not defending you. So what are the things you would do

730
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:31,040
that, given that I can actually talk to you offline, that would make me not defend you?

731
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:40,320
Well, first of all, I can imagine some. But all of us have things. If somebody says,

732
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:46,320
do you hear what your boy Lex said about you? What did Lex say about me? Oh, he said you were

733
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:56,240
flawed, dude. Oh, shit. They're so distressed because none of us want to stand behind flawed

734
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,160
people. That's why you have everybody rushing to say, I neither condemn nor condone. I know,

735
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,360
I don't condemn nor condone. What is that? We're all trying to say-

736
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,640
By the way, for the record, I said that Eric is smarter than me in a brilliant human being,

737
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,000
but flawed like all humans are. My point is, I've now come up with a new policy,

738
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,880
which is I don't care what my friends have done. I am not disavowing my friends. Not because

739
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,840
they didn't do the wrong thing. Maybe they did do the wrong thing. I don't know.

740
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,760
What's the value of friendship if that's not that? Like, for example, we've had the situation

741
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,640
with Brian Callan. Brian Callan was featured recently in the Los Angeles Times. I know nothing

742
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:40,560
about the allegations. I can't. I didn't even know Brian at the time, right? I've known him for

743
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,800
roughly the time I've been in Los Angeles, maybe a year and a half during that period of time.

744
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:50,240
I've never seen anything wrong. Now I'm in a situation. What do you think he did? Do you think

745
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:56,240
he didn't? It's like, you know what? I don't know. But I do know this. Everyone's entitled to have

746
01:15:56,240 --> 01:16:02,000
friends because we can't afford isolated people. And if your friends do the wrong thing,

747
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,520
they're still your friends. And if they do terrible, terrible things, you bring that up with

748
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,360
them privately. And it's not my responsibility to disavow in public. We've had this situation

749
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:20,560
that I don't like where particular people that I've been close to, I'm put under tremendous

750
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,120
pressure to disavow them. What do you think now about your buddy? I like Dave Rubin and all that

751
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:30,640
kind of stuff. Here's the thing. My friends are my friends. I don't disavow my friends.

752
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:38,240
We all need to make a statement that we will not be brought under pressure to disavow our friends,

753
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:48,080
our family members, because mass murderers are dangerous the more isolated they become.

754
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:54,160
It is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people. And it's dangerous.

755
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:00,560
It sends a signal to everybody else to fit in, to be more cynical about the

756
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,000
human connection we have to each other. If I find out you've been selling heroin

757
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,360
to elementary school students, you're still my friend and I will not be disavowing you.

758
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,960
And if I have a problem with you selling heroin to elementary school students

759
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:21,440
during school hours, I will bring it up with you privately because we don't need to hear my voice

760
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,160
added to that condemnation. Are there things that you could do that would cause me to say,

761
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:32,560
actually, F this guy? Yeah, above and beyond that. But simply doing the wrong thing, I think we've

762
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,920
gone down a terrible path. I think isolated people are about the most dangerous thing we could have

763
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:44,480
in a heavily armed society. So I deeply agree with you. I'm Brian Callan and all these people

764
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:50,640
that quote unquote got canceled. And I'm not saying that I don't know the truth value because we

765
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:57,920
can't. And even if I did know the truth value, I'm not setting up an incentive structure for the

766
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:04,160
personal destruction as a means of letting institutions combat the fact that individuals

767
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:09,440
are the last thing that can say none of you guys make any sense. I don't treat these things like,

768
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:14,160
you know, I had a conversation where Kevin Spacey was at the dinner table when I came down from a

769
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:20,400
hotel room. And I had a very long conversation with Kevin Spacey. I will not detail because

770
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:26,400
I don't do that as to what we discussed. But we talked very specifically about him being canceled.

771
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:33,680
And I don't think that the world has heard that story in part because there's a very strong sense

772
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:41,920
that he has to be out grouped. And as a result, you know, I mean, do we want do we want to disavow

773
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,080
the space program because it touched Werner von Braun? Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics

774
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,880
because Pascal Jordan and Werner Heisenberg passed through it? Is Aaron Fest theorem false

775
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:57,760
because he murdered his child? I mean, at what point do we recognize that we are the problem?

776
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,680
Humans are humans. And there is no perfect, there is no perfect group of people, even all of the

777
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,320
most oppressed people, the supposed victims of the world who we now have fetishized into thinking

778
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:12,880
that they're all oracles because their lived experience informs us and their pain is more

779
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:20,400
salient than everyone else's pain. Those people are necessarily great people. You know, it's like

780
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,800
none of us, we can't, we can't do this in this fashion. So when we sit down to have a conversation

781
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,440
across the table from somebody, you should be willing to, like you should not have NPR in your

782
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:39,920
mind, you should be willing to take the full risk and to see the good in the person without,

783
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,680
with limited information and to do your best to understand that person.

784
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:50,080
Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget. I don't believe this is of institutions.

785
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,960
Everybody is entitled to a certain amount of screwing up in life.

786
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:00,880
You're entitled to a mendacity budget. You're entitled to an aggression budget.

787
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:07,280
The idea of getting rid of everybody is, you know, people haven't even blown through their

788
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,880
budgets and we're already. Yeah. I think about, for example, one person, I'd be curious to get

789
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,520
your thoughts about Alex Jones. Let's not talk about Alex Jones for a second. Let's talk about

790
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:25,840
the National Enquirer. Is everything the National Enquirer says false? No. Okay. Do you remember

791
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:33,120
the John Edwards story? Did she run his wife? Sorry. He had a child from an extramarital affair.

792
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:37,200
Yes. I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story.

793
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,920
And then what does the New York Times do? The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report that

794
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,080
the National Enquirer is making a claim. That way they don't have to substantiate the story.

795
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:55,760
So why is the New York Times talking to Mike Cernovich or using the National Enquirer as a

796
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,360
source? Are they using Alex Jones as a source? Who, here's the big problem that we're having.

797
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:07,360
Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody and other people are entitled to talk

798
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,600
to no one? I don't really understand this. This is an indulgence system. This is how the Catholic

799
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,240
Church used to do things. It's hard to fight the system because the reason you don't talk to Alex

800
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:21,760
Jones is because the platforms on which we do the communication will de-platform, will remove you.

801
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:28,160
But I'm not platformed. I used to do NPR and I used to do the news hour and I used to

802
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:34,560
provide stories to Washington Post New York Times. That has gone away. They've circled the

803
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,400
wagons closer and closer and more of us are unacceptable. And right now I have no question

804
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,920
that they're going through anybody who has a platform trying to say, okay, what do we have

805
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,960
against that person in case we need to shut that down? We have to make a different decision, Lex.

806
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:57,360
And the different decision is that it doesn't matter how many times Joe said the N-word.

807
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:06,480
It doesn't matter that somebody else, with mathematical theorems, if the worst person

808
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,120
in the world proves a mathematical theorem like the Unabomber, we can't undo the theorem.

809
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:19,120
And I point out Charles Manson's song, Look At Your Game Girl is an amazing song. It's a really

810
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:23,680
good song. I don't think it's one of the greatest songs ever, but it happens that he wasn't a no

811
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:30,080
talent. And I don't know how Hitler was as an artist. Fiction, not bad.

812
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:36,480
Okay, we've got to get past this. We've got to get past this idea that we're going to purge

813
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,920
ourselves of our badness. And we're just going to, this is like, I liken it to teenage girls in

814
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:48,320
cutting. We're just, all we're doing is destroying ourselves in search of perfection. And the answer

815
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,440
is no, we're not perfect. We're flawed. We're screwed up. And we've always been this way.

816
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:58,000
And we're not going to silence everyone who you can point a laser beam at and say, well,

817
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,680
that person, look at how bad that person is. If we do that, kiss the whole thing goodbye.

818
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:09,520
We might as well just, let's learn Chinese. But there is an art to having those messy

819
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:15,280
conversations, whether with Alex or anybody else. Okay, let's talk about Alex. There's

820
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:19,920
particular stuff that Alex does that's absolutely nauseating. And there's other stuff that he's

821
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:24,560
doing that's funny. The methodology of the way he carries. And sometimes he's talking about the

822
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,520
truth. And sometimes he's talking about a conspiracy theory. His variance is incredibly high.

823
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,880
The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O'Keefe or the National Enquirer or anything you

824
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:43,840
don't like is to say, great, go long short. What's that mean? Well, if you invest in a mutual fund,

825
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,240
all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long. But if you invest in a hedge fund,

826
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,440
you do something called relative value trade. It's like, well, you long tech or short tech?

827
01:23:54,240 --> 01:24:01,360
Well, actually, I'm long Microsoft and I'm short Google. Why is that? Oh, because I believe Google

828
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:06,960
got way too much attention and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned. And so this is really a

829
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:14,400
play on legacy tech over more modern tech. Okay. Which part of Alex Jones are you long?

830
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,160
And which part are you short? One of the things that should be a requirement for being a reporter

831
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:24,000
is like, what did Donald Trump do that was good? Nothing. Okay, then you're not a reporter.

832
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,240
What did Hitler do that was good?

833
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,120
The Rosenstrasza protest.

834
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,560
Non-Jewish women campaign for their Jewish men to be returned home to them

835
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:45,760
from certain death almost in death camps. It should have been that not there were no death camps.

836
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:52,000
It should have been that everybody was returned home. But you know what? The fact that the women

837
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,640
of the Rosenstrasza protest, I mean, sorry, I get very emotional about, you know, some of the

838
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:07,680
baddest ass chicks in the world got their husbands returned to them, colica vote. And not, not

839
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:14,160
celebrating Hitler, Hitler's the worst of the worst. But God damn it, you know, this idea

840
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:19,280
that we can just say everything that person does is a lie. Everything that person does is evil.

841
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:27,760
Evil. This reflects a simplicity of mind that humanity cannot afford. Is Google evil,

842
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:32,960
evil because it will sell you mine comp? Is Amazon evil because it will sell you mine comp?

843
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,040
If you find out that mine comp rests on somebody's bookshelves, do you have any idea what it means?

844
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:43,920
If you find out that a scholar used the N word, should that person lose their job? Come on,

845
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:52,240
grow the hell up. I guess our responsibility to lead by example in that, because you have to

846
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:57,040
acknowledge that the fact, like the current public discourse. Have somebody on your podcast

847
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:04,160
who you're worried about. But do it in a principled fashion. I mean, in other words,

848
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:12,240
I'm not here to whitewash everything. On the other hand, if somebody makes, you know, some

849
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:18,240
allegations, I don't know that I'm obligated to treat every set of allegations as if,

850
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,840
now, how do you defend yourself against the, no, allegations are so cheap to make at this moment.

851
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:28,160
Well, my, sort of my standard, I don't know, maybe you could speak to it is,

852
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,240
I don't care. Like in the case of Alex Jones, for example, I don't,

853
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:39,040
I'm willing to have a conversation with Alex Jones and people like him. If I know he's not

854
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,320
going to try to manipulate me. Assume that he is going to try to manipulate you.

855
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,200
I can't. Then, then we're not going to be two humans.

856
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,800
Okay. But Lex, I want you to think well of me. I put on a jacket. I don't usually wear a jacket.

857
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,120
Okay? Thank you, Eric.

858
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:59,120
All right. I'm trying to manipulate you. There's an entire field. No, there's an entire field

859
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:03,920
that says that speech may be best thought of as an attempt to manipulate each other.

860
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,480
This is too simplistic. Everything that we keep talking through.

861
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:11,440
Yes. You know better than this.

862
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,480
I disagree. I think, I think there is ways.

863
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:21,680
There's, of course, it's a gray area, but there is a threshold where your intent with

864
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:29,520
which you come to a meeting to an interaction is one that is not one that's grounded in like

865
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,480
a respect for a common humanity, like a love for each other as deeply messy.

866
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:39,680
If somebody is doing really bad stuff, I expect you to try to keep them from doing really bad

867
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:47,040
stuff. But, you know, just keep in mind that when I was a younger man, I saw an amazing

868
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:53,440
anti pornography documentary and it was called Rate It X and I don't know where it went.

869
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,560
But the conceit of it was we're going to get some pornographers in front of a camera because

870
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:06,080
they want to talk and we're going to ask them about what they do for a living and why it's okay.

871
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,880
No commentary.

872
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,560
Okay. You could potentially, if you really think Alex Jones is the worst, and again,

873
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:28,640
I'm not intimately familiar with him, you could decide to just let him talk.

874
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:35,280
Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people. You know, I've spoken to Stefan Molenu.

875
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:41,200
Stefan Molenu makes many good points, makes many bad points, and he makes many good points in bad

876
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:47,360
ways and I worry about it and I don't feel that it's not my obligation to make sure that

877
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:54,880
Stefan Molenu has a voice on the portal. But I did stand up and say I didn't want him banned

878
01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:00,480
from social media and I do think that a lot of the people who are being banned from social media

879
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:05,920
were worried that they're right rather than that they're wrong. I certainly don't really think that

880
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,680
I'm worried in some sense that some of the really wrong people are wrong. But if you look at, for

881
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:16,400
example, Curtis Jarvin, there's a tremendous amount of interest. Is Eric going to speak to Curtis

882
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,840
Jarvin? Curtis Jarvin says many interesting things and he says many horrible, stupid things,

883
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:30,080
very provocative. And I haven't invited him onto the portal, but I haven't said I will never invite

884
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:37,600
him onto the portal. We are all in a difficult position. That's what I'm saying. I think it's

885
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,760
a much more difficult task and burden who carry it as people who have conversations because

886
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:49,920
Curtis Jarvin is a good example. How much work do I have to put in reading Curtis's work

887
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,840
to really understand? We should talk about the problem of Curtis Jarvin because I think it's

888
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,480
a problem to be illustrative. There's this big question as why does somebody who says such

889
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:03,760
stupid ass things listen to by so many people? Very smart people, people who are part of our

890
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:10,800
daily lives discuss Curtis Jarvin in hush tones. Now, it's a good question. My belief is that Curtis

891
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:17,440
Jarvin has made a number of very interesting provocative points and they associate Curtis

892
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:23,600
Jarvin as the person who has made these points and they treat the completely asinine stuff that

893
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:31,360
he says that's super dangerous as, well, that's Curtis. Right? Right. They give him the credit

894
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:36,960
for, he's kind of like, sorry to use the term, first principles, deep thinker about the way

895
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:44,160
the world, some space about the world. But as a result, we don't actually know why Curtis

896
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:50,320
Jarvin is knocking around so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives.

897
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,840
See, you said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff and that's the sense I got from

898
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,560
a few things I've read, not just about it. This is not just like Wikipedia stuff. Is he,

899
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,040
he's a little like I've said before, he seems to be careless.

900
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,840
I don't think he's careless. No, no, it's like Jim Watson. Jim Watson wants to say very provocative

901
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:16,800
things in order to prove that he's free. It's not a question of careless. He enjoys

902
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:23,440
the freedom to say these things. And the key point is, is that there's, I expect something

903
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:29,600
more of Curtis. I expect that if somebody is insightful about all sorts of things up to that

904
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,280
point, that they're going to have enough care. Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly

905
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:41,760
that vaccines are not 100% safe. Most people who have an idea that anybody is an anti-vaxxer

906
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:47,760
should be silenced, are in a position where they, they probably don't say vaccines are 100%

907
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,240
safe, but you keep finding that statement over and over again. Like believe all women, vaccines

908
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:57,760
are 100% safe. Climate science is settled science. Whatever this Montenegro is where you make

909
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:05,040
extraordinarily vapid blanket claims and then you retreat into something, well, defund the pull,

910
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,080
you know, we don't want no more police actually just means we want the police to

911
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:17,600
not take on mental health duties. We've come up with an incredibly disingenuous society.

912
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:24,880
And what I'm claiming is, is that I might talk to Curtis Yardvin, but I have really very little

913
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,160
interest to talk to a guy who seems to be kind of giddy about who makes good slaves and who makes

914
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:36,880
bad slaves. It's like, why do I want to do that on the portal? One, first of all, because just as

915
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:43,600
you said, that's not Curtis's main thing. He has a lot of ideas and the, what I've read of him,

916
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:50,480
which is not a huge amount, is there's, he's very thoughtful about the way this world works.

917
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:57,120
And on top of that, he's an important historical figure in the birth and the development of the

918
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:02,480
alt-right or what would be called the alt-right. The new reaction. Yeah. And there's, so he's in

919
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:08,080
just an important intellectual. And so it makes sense to talk to him. The question is,

920
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:13,920
how much work do you put in? Well, this is the issue of Fugu. I'm not a chef

921
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,880
that necessarily can serve that Fugu. So you have, you have a puffer fish. You can eat the puffer

922
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,600
fish. You can, you can get a kind of a tingly sensation on your tongue if you get a little bit

923
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:31,200
of the poison organ. But my point is, I don't know how to serve Curtis Yardvin. Yeah. So that,

924
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:37,200
in fact, I'm not worried about what happens. But I believe that if somebody else was a student

925
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:42,880
of the new reactionary movement, that person might be in a better position to host Curtis Yardvin.

926
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,640
So somebody, that's a really good example. Somebody I think you've spoken with,

927
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,640
that's an intermediary. That's a powerful one is Michael Malis. And he's spoken with Curtis Yardvin.

928
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,000
And Michael wrote a book about. By the way, Michael somewhat changed my mind about Michael Malis.

929
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:05,280
I'm glad he did. I think I would call him a friend. And I think he's a underneath it all

930
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:12,560
really kind human being. And I think your skepticism about him was initially from a surface level of

931
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:17,120
what did you call him hyenas, the trolls and so on. I'm not happy about his.

932
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:28,720
It's been so long since I've seen good trolls. Yes. So he needs higher quality of trolling,

933
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:37,200
but he aspires to that. I mean, it, you know, disagree or not. I really enjoy how much care

934
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:42,160
he puts into the work he does, like on North Korea and the study of the world,

935
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:49,600
and how much privately, but also in public love he has for people, especially those who are powerless.

936
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:56,560
Just a genuine admiration for them. But I think Curtis actually,

937
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:01,440
does too. I don't know. I mean, you have to appreciate the first time I met Curtis,

938
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,720
he introduced me, he says, I'm the most right-wing person you've ever met.

939
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:08,000
I was just like, well, this is a conversation that's already over.

940
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,920
It's theatrical in a way that's not conductive to actually having a real connection.

941
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,000
Well, it just, it turned me so, it turned me off because it was like,

942
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,440
you need to be the most right-wing person. And so it's like, I'm a troll, I'm a troll.

943
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:23,840
Yeah. Okay. Why are we doing this?

944
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,720
Yeah. But what I'm trying to get at is different. I'm trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend

945
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:32,560
of yours. If you found out something terrible, you should still be a friend.

946
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:36,480
You should still continue to be his friend. And in Michael Malice's case,

947
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,080
it's very likely that we'll find out something. Curtis is an acquaintance of mine,

948
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:45,600
because he hangs around with some people that I know. I did not get it. I've started to understand

949
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:52,800
why the people in my life, some of them are Curtis Yarvin fans. Many of them disregard the stupid

950
01:35:52,800 --> 01:36:00,160
stuff. But my feeling is, is that too much poison organ, not enough fish. I don't know how to serve

951
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:05,280
that too intermingled. I'm not your chef. Speaking for defending your friends, staying with your

952
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:14,080
friends and bringing the old band together again, you coined the term IDW, Intellectual Dark Web.

953
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:22,880
I like it. It represents a certain group of people that are struggling with, that are almost like

954
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:30,640
challenged the norms of social and political discourse from all different angles.

955
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:36,480
Right. What do you think is the state of the IDW? What do you think is its future? Is it still

956
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:43,920
a useful? Well, it never exists. Is it a protocol? Is it a collection of people featured in an article?

957
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,520
What I learned very clearly is that there's a tremendous desire in the internet age to pin

958
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,640
people down. Well, what do you say? Who's in it? What are the criteria? It's like, I understand.

959
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,760
You want to play the demarcation game and you want to make everything that is demarcated

960
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:07,280
instantly null and void. No, thank you. I resisted saying who was in it. I resisted saying what it

961
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:15,760
was. I resisted saying that Barry Weiss's article was the definitive thing. They chose a ridiculous

962
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,400
concept for the photographs that we couldn't get out of. I did not want those photographs taken.

963
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:24,640
They decided that the Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer needed to take them all at twilight.

964
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:31,680
I didn't even necessarily want to do the article. Barry convinced me that it was the right thing

965
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:39,520
to do. Undoubtedly, Barry was right. I was wrong. But the key point is nothing can grow in this

966
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:47,360
environment. There's a reason we're not building. It does not appear that we found a way to grow

967
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:52,880
anything organic and good and decent that we need right now. That's the key issue.

968
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:57,840
Who's the weed? Do you mean us as a society? Those of us who wish to have a future for our

969
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:03,760
great grandchildren. Let's take the subset of people who are worried about things long after

970
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:12,160
their demise. Do you think it's useful to have a term like the IDW to capture some set of people,

971
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:23,120
some set of ideas or maybe principles that capture what I think the IDW... Okay, you can say it's

972
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:27,760
not supposed to me. It doesn't exist. It doesn't mean anything. But to the public, to me. Okay,

973
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:37,360
I'll just speak to me. It represented something. I think I said this to you. In my first attempt

974
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:43,440
to interview the great Eric Weinstein, I said that I spoke about you, but IDW in general is

975
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:47,280
trying to point out the elephant in the room or that the emperor has no clothes. The set of people

976
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:53,040
that do that in their own way. If there are multiple elephants in the room. Yes. The point is that

977
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:58,480
the IDW was more interested in seeing the totality of elephants and trying to figure out how do we

978
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:02,400
move forward as opposed to saying I can spot the other guy's elephant in the room, but I can't see

979
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:11,280
my own. In large measure, we didn't represent an institutional base. Therefore, it wasn't

980
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:16,480
maximally important that we look at our own hypocrisy because we weren't on the institutional

981
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:22,880
spectrum. This is where friendship comes into play with the different figures that are loosely

982
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:33,760
associated with IDW is you are somehow responsible for the exact thing that you said. Did you hear

983
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:42,240
what Sam Harris said about IDW? Yeah. That kind of thing. I chuckled.

984
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:50,880
Lovingly or chuckled? I was angry at some people who had said things that caused Sam to say what Sam

985
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:58,320
said about turning his imaginary club membership into the IDW. People said very silly things and

986
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:06,640
I think that there is just this confusion that integrity means calling out your friends in

987
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:14,320
front of the world. I've been pretty clear about this. I try to choose my friends carefully and

988
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:19,120
if you would like to recuse me because I'm not a source of reliable information, people that I

989
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:25,600
know and love the most, maybe that's reasonable for you. Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing

990
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:31,440
to throw a friend under the bus at the first sign of trouble. By all means, exit my feed.

991
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:38,240
You don't have to subscribe to me. If that's your concept of integrity, you're barking up the wrong

992
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:42,720
tree. What I will say is that I knew these people well enough to know that they're all flawed.

993
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:53,520
Thank you for the callback. But the issue is that I love people who are flawed and I love

994
01:40:53,520 --> 01:41:01,360
people who have to earn a living even if you call them a grifter. I love people who like the fact

995
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:06,960
that Donald Trump didn't get us into new wars even if you call them alt-right. I love the fact that

996
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:14,480
some people believe in structural oppression and want to fight it even if they're not woke

997
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,200
because they don't believe that structural oppression is hiding everywhere.

998
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:24,000
I care and love different people in different ways and I think that the overarching thing

999
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,000
like so we're not getting at is that we were sold a bill of goods that you can go through life

1000
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:38,560
like an Eliza program with pre-programmed responses. Well, it's what aboutism? It's both

1001
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:45,280
sidesism. It's alt-right. It's the loony left. It's campus madness. It's like, okay,

1002
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:53,600
why don't you just empty the entire goddamn magazine? All of those pre-recorded

1003
01:41:54,480 --> 01:42:03,600
snips. Now that you've done all of that, now we can have a conversation. Your son put it

1004
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:12,880
really well, which is we should in all things resist labels. But we can't deal without labels.

1005
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:19,440
We have to generalize, but we also have to keep in mind that just in the way in science,

1006
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:25,280
you deal with an effective theory that isn't a fundamental one. In science, most of our theories

1007
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:32,320
we consider to be effective theories. If I generalize about Europe, about women, about

1008
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:41,600
Christians, those things have to be understood to mean something and not to have their

1009
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:50,480
definitions extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all, nor that they're so rigid that

1010
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:56,880
their claims that clearly won't bear scrutiny. Lex, what do you really want to talk about? That's

1011
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:03,120
always my question to you. That always gets me. Maybe you are the therapist. But you and I could

1012
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:09,280
talk about people love up until now at least. People have loved listening to the two of us in

1013
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:17,520
conversation. My feeling is that we're not talking about neural nets. We're not talking

1014
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:23,920
about geometric unity. We're not talking about where distributed computing might go. I don't

1015
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:30,400
think that we're really focused on some of the most exciting things we could do to transform

1016
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:36,240
education. We're still caught in this world of other people that we don't belong in. I don't

1017
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:43,200
belong in the world as it's been created. I'm trying to build a new world and I'm astounded

1018
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:47,680
that the people with the independent means to help build that world are so demotivated

1019
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:54,320
that they don't want to build new structures. The people who do want to build new structures

1020
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:58,960
seem to be wild-eyed. Wild-eyed? What do you mean by wild-eyed? They're not.

1021
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:04,560
I guarantee you that I will get some message in my DMs. It says, hey, Eric, I'm a third-year

1022
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:12,400
chemistry student at South Dakota State and I've got a great idea. I just need funding.

1023
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:16,320
I want to build... They don't have the means. The people who have the means have become...

1024
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:22,160
Or the sophistication. It's like you're looking for somebody who's proven themselves a few times

1025
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:29,120
to say, I've got $4 billion behind me that soft-circled. I want to figure out what a new

1026
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:34,240
university would be and what it would take to protect academic freedom and who we would hire

1027
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:37,840
and what are the different characteristics because I can clearly see that everything

1028
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:43,440
following the current model is falling apart. Nobody in my understanding is saying that.

1029
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:52,240
Nobody is saying, let's take that which is functioning independently and make it less

1030
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:58,880
vulnerable. Let's boost those signals. A critical component as money, you think?

1031
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,920
It's not only that, but it's also a kind of... These people are mobbed up hands-off.

1032
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:10,240
Let's imagine for the moment that Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg

1033
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:22,800
founded a university-come-social-media entity. They said, the purpose of this is to make sure

1034
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,960
that academic freedom will not perish from this earth because it's necessary to keep us from

1035
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:33,600
all going crazy. We are going to lock ourselves out. We've come up with this governance system.

1036
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:40,400
The idea is that these people will be assigned the difficult task of making sure that society

1037
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:44,640
doesn't go crazy in any particular direction, that we have a fact-based, reality-based,

1038
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:51,120
feasibility-based understanding. We can try to figure out where our real opportunities are.

1039
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:59,680
It feels like everybody with the ability to do something like that and with the brains and

1040
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:07,440
experience and the resources would rather sit in the current system and hope to figure out

1041
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,600
where they can flee to if the whole thing comes apart.

1042
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:16,960
Maybe to push back on a little bit. I agree with you, but it feels like some people are

1043
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:24,160
trying that. For example, Google purchased DeepMind. DeepMind is a company that represents a lot of

1044
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:30,080
radical ideas. They've become acceptable, actually. AGI, Artificial General Intelligence,

1045
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:38,080
used to be really radical of a thing to talk about. DeepMind and OpenAI are two places

1046
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:44,880
which has made it more acceptable. I know you can now start to criticize, well, they're really,

1047
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,720
now that it's become acceptable, they're not taking the further stuff would be more and more

1048
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:56,640
radical. But that was an attempt by Google to say that let's try some wild stuff.

1049
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,880
Sort of like Boston Dynamics.

1050
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:07,680
Sort of like Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics is a really good example of trying radical ideas

1051
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:12,720
for perhaps no purpose whatsoever except to try to try out their ideas.

1052
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:19,280
The idea is that innovation is like dessert. You can have dessert after you solve

1053
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:24,000
the problem of the main course. The main course is a bunch of insoluble problems.

1054
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:29,520
We can get into innovation once we perfect ourselves.

1055
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,360
And you're saying that we need to make innovation the main meal.

1056
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:39,040
Well, I'm saying that there really is structural pressure. If you train

1057
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,280
a deep learning system on exclusively white faces, it's going to get confused.

1058
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,400
So let's not disagree that there are real issues around this. In fact,

1059
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:58,800
that's an issue of innovation and data. Your data should be responsive. On the other hand,

1060
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,680
there are things we can't do anything about that are actually fundamental.

1061
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:12,480
Those things may have to do with the fact that some of us taste cilantro as soap

1062
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:18,160
and some of us don't. There are differences between people and some of them are in the

1063
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:22,640
hardware, some of them are in the firmware, some of them are in the software that is the human mind.

1064
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:33,040
And this completely simplistic idea that every failure of an organization to promote

1065
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,960
each person who has particular intersexual characteristics,

1066
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:45,440
we cannot hold progress hostage to that. And you've talked about, perhaps we'll

1067
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,360
save this for another time because it's such a fascinating conversation. You talked about this

1068
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:55,440
with Glenn Beck is the whole stagnation of growth and all that kind of stuff. Your idea is that

1069
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:03,040
in as much as the current situation is a kind of Ponzi scheme, the current situation in the United

1070
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:10,880
States is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise of constant unending innovation, we need

1071
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:23,200
to fund the true innovators and encourage them and empower them and sort of culturally say

1072
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:27,440
that this is what this country is about is the brilliant minds.

1073
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:33,120
We're going to kill each other if we don't grow. Growth is like an immune system

1074
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,640
and you always have pathogens present, but if you don't have growth present, you can't fight the

1075
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:42,560
pathogens in your society. And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere.

1076
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:49,600
So if we don't get growth into our system fairly quickly, we are in really seriously bad shape.

1077
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:56,480
So it's very important that if I had a horrible person who was capable of building something

1078
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:01,920
that would give us all a certain amount of what I've called financial beta to some new technology

1079
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:07,600
where we all benefit, let's say quantum computing comes in and everybody, the dry cleaner has a

1080
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:15,600
quantum computing angle. That's necessary to keep this system that we built going.

1081
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:20,240
We can try to redesign the system, but our system expects growth and we've started

1082
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:24,960
started for growth and the madness that we're seeing is the failure of our immune system to

1083
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:29,600
be able to handle the pathogens that have always been present. So people can say, well,

1084
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,960
this was always there. Yes, it was. What's changed was your immune system.

1085
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:41,680
We have got to make sure that one, we understand why diversity is potentially really important.

1086
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:46,880
We have mined certain communities to death. You and I are Ashkenazi Jews.

1087
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,880
Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews are good at technical stuff.

1088
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:56,560
We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff. The Indians have many people who are good

1089
01:50:56,640 --> 01:51:03,920
at technical stuff as the Japanese. I also believe that we have communities where if you

1090
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:08,560
think about the Pareto idea of diminishing returns, if you've never mined a community,

1091
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,160
many of the people you're going to get at the beginning are going to be amazing

1092
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:17,440
because that community, it's like, did you drill for more oil in Texas? Texas is pretty

1093
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:23,840
thoroughly picked over. Do you find some place that's completely insane? Maybe there's oil there.

1094
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:32,080
Who knows? In particular, I would like to displace our reliance on our military competitors in Asia

1095
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:38,880
in our scientific laboratories with women, with African-Americans, with Latinos, people who are

1096
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:43,280
in different categories than we have traditionally sourced. And I would like to get them the money

1097
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:50,880
that the market would normally give these fields were we not using visas in place of payment.

1098
01:51:51,840 --> 01:52:01,760
Now, I have a crazy idea which is that you and I both play music and I find the analytic work

1099
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,520
that I do when I'm trying to figure out chord progressions and symmetries and tritones and

1100
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,040
all these sorts of things to be very similar to the work that I do when I do physics or math.

1101
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:17,440
I believe that one of the things that is true is that the analytic contributions of African-Americans

1102
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:25,120
to music are probably fungible to science. I don't know that that's true. It's true. I haven't done

1103
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:30,320
controlled research, but I believe that it is very important to let the People's Republic of China

1104
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:36,720
know that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore and that we need to look to our own people.

1105
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:41,360
And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit from making sure that women,

1106
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:50,080
black Americans, Latinos, are in a position to take over some of these things because many of

1107
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:55,600
these communities have been underutilized. Now, I don't know if that's an insane idea. I want to

1108
01:52:55,600 --> 01:53:00,640
hear somebody tell me why it's an insane idea, but I believe that part of what we need to do

1109
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:05,600
is we need to recognize that there are security issues. There are geopolitical issues with the

1110
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:11,600
funding of science and that what we've done is we've starved our world for innovation. And if we

1111
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:15,920
don't get back to the business of innovation, we should be doing diversity and inclusion out of

1112
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:22,560
greed rather than guilt. Now, part of the problem with this is that a lot of the energy behind

1113
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:29,600
diversity and inclusion is based on guilt and accusation. And what I want is I want to kick

1114
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:35,360
ass. And my hope is that diminishing returns favors mining the communities that have not

1115
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:42,480
been traditionally mined in order to extract output from those communities, unless there's a

1116
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:47,120
flaw in that plan. If there's a flaw, somebody needs to tell me. If there isn't a flaw, we need

1117
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:53,440
to get greedy about innovation rather than guilty about innovation. That's really brilliantly put.

1118
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:59,680
My biggest problem with what I see is, it exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity.

1119
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:05,920
It's used when it's grounded in guilt. It's then used as a hammer to shame people that don't care

1120
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:13,600
about diversity enough. F that shit. Okay. So my point is, I'm excited about the idea of Jimi

1121
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:20,160
Hendrix doing quantum field theory. I'm excited about the idea of art Tatum trying to figure out

1122
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:29,120
what the neural nets figured out about protein folding. I have some idea of the level of intellect

1123
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:34,080
of people who have not found their way into STEM subjects in incredibly technically demanding

1124
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:39,200
areas. And if there's a flaw in that theory, I want somebody to present the flaw.

1125
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:47,280
But right now, my belief is that these things are merit based. And if you really believe in

1126
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:51,840
structural oppression, you do not want an affirmative action program. You want to make

1127
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:57,440
sure that people have huge amounts of resources to get themselves into position. I want to push

1128
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:03,600
out. I just tried this on this clubhouse application. I want to push out Klein bottles as a secret sign

1129
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:10,320
inside of rap videos in hip hop. I want people to have an idea that there's an amazing world.

1130
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:16,480
And I want to get the people who hopefully I'm trying to lure into science and engineering.

1131
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:21,440
I want to get them paid. I don't want them as the cheap substitutes for the fleeing

1132
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:28,320
white males who've learned that they can't make any money in science and engineering.

1133
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:36,080
So the problem is that we need to take over the ship, Lex. And it doesn't need to be you and me

1134
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:40,080
because, quite honestly, I have no desire to administer. I don't want to be the chief executive

1135
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:46,240
officer of anything. What I do want is I want the baby boomers who've made this mess and can't see it

1136
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:56,320
to be gone. They had almost all of our universities. And I want fresh blood, fresh resources. I want

1137
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:03,680
academic freedom. And I want greed for our country and for the future to determine diversity inclusion

1138
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:10,400
as opposed to shame and guilt, which is destroying our fabric. That's as good of a diversity statement

1139
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:17,920
as I've ever heard. This is a U-turn, but somebody commented on the tweet you sent

1140
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:24,480
that as one of the top comments, they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency. So it's a

1141
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:31,200
U-turn, but not really. Since you're an economist, since you're deep, not an economist, you...

1142
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:37,440
I mean, I pretend to be an economist hoping that the economists will take issue that I'm not an

1143
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:42,720
economist so that I can advance gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics, which the economics

1144
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:48,720
profession has failed to acknowledge was a major innovation that happened approximately 25 years

1145
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:53,600
ago. I don't think that economists understand what a price index is that measures inflation,

1146
01:56:53,600 --> 01:57:02,000
nor do I think economists understand what a growth index or a product quantity index is

1147
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:09,280
that measures GDP. I think that they don't even understand the basics of price and quantity

1148
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:17,440
index construction. And therefore, they can't possibly review field theoretic economics. They

1149
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:22,320
can't review gauge theoretic economics. They're intellectually not in a position to manage their

1150
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,600
own field. You talked about that there's a stagnation in growth currently. I looked at,

1151
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:33,600
from my microeconomics, macroeconomics and college perspective, GDP doesn't seem to capture

1152
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:43,760
the productivity, the full spectrum of what I think is a functioning, successful society.

1153
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:50,480
What do you think is broken about GDP? What does it need to include at these indices?

1154
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,600
Let me explain what they don't understand to begin with.

1155
01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:04,320
Sure. Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output are the same at the end of a year as

1156
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:09,840
they are at the beginning. And you ask, what happened during that year? Was there inflation?

1157
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:15,440
They meandered over the course of the year, but miraculously, they all came back to exactly their

1158
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:22,160
values. The amount produced at the end of the year is the same as at the beginning in every

1159
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:27,760
single quantity. Typically, the claim would be that the price index should be 1.0 and that the

1160
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:39,920
quantity index should be 1.0. That's clearly wrong. Right. Well, it speaks to a fundamental

1161
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:44,800
confusion that economists have. They don't understand that the economy is curved and not flat.

1162
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:51,200
In a curved economy, everything should be path dependence, but they view path dependence as a

1163
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:56,480
problem because they are effectively the flat earth society of market analysis. They don't

1164
01:58:56,480 --> 01:59:00,480
understand that what they've called, and they've actually called it the cycling problem,

1165
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:06,080
is exactly what they need to understand to advance their field. So I'll give you a very

1166
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:13,200
simple example. Let's imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund and Ted and Alice

1167
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:24,800
in another. In both cases, the females that is Alice and Carol are the chief investment officers,

1168
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:31,920
and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers in charge of trying to get money into the fund

1169
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:43,040
and trying to get people not to, in fact, remove their money from the funds. If you, in fact, had

1170
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:52,160
Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, and both hedge funds were invested in assets whose prices came

1171
01:59:52,160 --> 02:00:00,880
back to the same levels and whose exposures were in the same quantities, and you wanted to

1172
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:06,560
compensate these two hedge funds, would you compensate them the same necessarily? What if,

1173
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:14,960
for example, Carol was killing it in terms of investments? Every time she bought some sort

1174
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:24,720
of security, the price of that security went up. But Bob was the worst marketing officer,

1175
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,840
and as chief marketing officer, there were tons of redemptions because Bob was constantly drunk,

1176
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:37,360
Bob was making off-color comments. Now, as a result, at the end of the year, the fund hasn't

1177
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:42,000
grown in size because even though Carol was crushing it in terms of the investments,

1178
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:48,720
Bob was screwing up everything and the redemptions were legendary, so people were making money and

1179
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:57,360
still pulling it out of the fund. In the other fund, Alice can't seem to buy a base hit every

1180
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:04,080
time she gets into a security, the thing plummets, but Ted's amazing marketing skills allowed

1181
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:09,840
the fund to get all sorts of new subscriptions and halted the redemptions as people hoped that

1182
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:21,680
the fund would get its act together. Okay. Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated,

1183
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:34,160
and quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted are compensated. So even though both funds

1184
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:40,400
had closed loops that come back to the original states, what happened during the period that

1185
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,080
they were active tells you how people are supposed to be compensated.

1186
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:52,880
Now, we know that whatever the increase in the price index is, is compensated by a decrease

1187
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:59,440
in the quantity index or conversely because prices and quantities return to their original values.

1188
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:04,160
You could have another fund where nothing much happened, there were no redemptions, no subscriptions,

1189
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:09,280
prices, the fund remained in cash the whole time. So in that third fund,

1190
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:17,120
you know, let's call that Tristan and Izalda, that fund should have no bonuses paid because

1191
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:23,440
nobody did anything, but nobody should be fired either. Now, the fact that economists don't even

1192
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:28,400
understand that this is what their price and quantity indices were intended to do, that they

1193
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:33,280
don't understand that you can actually give what would be called ordinal agents, the freedom to

1194
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:40,480
change their preferences and still have something defined as a conus cost of living adjustment.

1195
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,840
They don't even understand the mathematics of their field.

1196
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,000
So the indices need to be able to capture some kind of dynamics that-

1197
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:54,080
We have had indices that capture these dynamics due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925.

1198
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:59,840
But the economists have not even understood what de Vizier's index truly represents.

1199
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:04,000
What do you miss with such crude indices then?

1200
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,240
Well, you miss the fact that you're supposed to have a field theoretic subject.

1201
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:13,760
The representative consumer should actually be a probability distribution on the space of all

1202
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:18,480
possible consumers weighted by the probability of getting any particular pull from the distribution.

1203
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:25,840
We should not have a single gauge of inflation. What is that in 1973 dollars? Any more than you

1204
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:30,960
should be able to say it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday.

1205
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:38,160
So when we get to the cryptocurrency, what I'm going to say is that because we didn't

1206
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:43,920
found economic theory on the proper marginal revolution, because we missed the major opportunity,

1207
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:49,600
which is that the differential calculus of markets is gauge theory. It's not ordinary

1208
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:57,040
differential calculus. We found that out in finance that it was stochastic differential

1209
02:03:57,040 --> 02:04:02,240
calculus. We have the wrong version of the differential calculus underneath all of modern

1210
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:07,440
economic theory. And part of what I've been pushing for in cryptocurrencies is the idea

1211
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:13,760
that we should be understanding that gold is a gauge theory, just as modern economic theory is

1212
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:19,360
supposed to be a gauge theory, and that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies, and more

1213
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:25,840
importantly, distributed computing, from the problem of this unwanted global aspect, which is

1214
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:31,440
the blockchain. The thing that is most celebrated in some sense about Bitcoin is in fact the reason

1215
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:36,240
that I'm least enthusiastic about it. I'm hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did.

1216
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:43,520
But it's an intermediate step towards trying to figure out what should digital gold actually be.

1217
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:51,680
If physical gold is a collection of up quarks and down quarks in the form of protons and neutrons

1218
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:57,920
held together, the quarks by gluons with electrons orbiting it held together by photons with the

1219
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:03,920
occasional weak interaction beta decay, all of those are gauge theories. So gold is actually

1220
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:10,080
coming from gauge theory, and markets are coming from gauge theory, and the opportunity to do

1221
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:14,800
locally enforced conservation laws, which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is,

1222
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:21,680
should theoretically be founded on a different principle that is not the blockchain. It should

1223
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:28,960
be a gauge theoretic concept in which effectively the tokens are excitations on a network of computer

1224
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:38,000
nodes. And the fact that, let's imagine that this is some token, by moving it from my custodianship

1225
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,000
to your custodianship, effectively, I pushed that glass as a gauge theory towards your region of the

1226
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:50,720
table. We should be recognizing the gauge theory is the correct differential calculus for the 21st

1227
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:54,400
century. In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century. You're saying it captures these

1228
02:05:54,400 --> 02:06:03,520
individual dynamics. Why should my giving you a token have to be, why should we alert the global

1229
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:08,800
community in this token that that occurred? You can talk about side change. You can talk about any

1230
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:13,200
means of doing this. But effectively, we have a problem, which is if I think about this differently,

1231
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:20,960
I have a glass that is extant. You have a glass that is absent. We're supposed to call

1232
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:26,720
the constructor method on your glass at the same moment we call the destructor method on my glass

1233
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:31,200
in order to have a conservation principle. It would be far more efficient to do this

1234
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,960
with the one system that is known never to throw an exception, which is nature.

1235
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,480
And nature has chosen gauge theory and geometry for her underlying language.

1236
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:47,280
We now know due to work of Pia Malani at Harvard in economics in the mid 1990s,

1237
02:06:48,080 --> 02:06:55,280
which I was her co-author on. But I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea.

1238
02:06:56,240 --> 02:07:02,880
We know that modern economic theory is a naturally occurring gauge theory. And the failure of that

1239
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:08,080
community to acknowledge that that work occurred and that it was put down for reasons that make no

1240
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:14,880
analytic sense is important in particular due to the relatively new innovation of distributed

1241
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:20,080
computing and Satoshi's brainchild. So you're thinking we need to have the mathematics that

1242
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:25,360
captures, that enforces cryptocurrency as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized

1243
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:30,080
one where the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized.

1244
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:38,320
The abundance economy much discussed in Silicon Valley or what's left of it is actually a huge

1245
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:43,520
threat to the planet because what it really is is that it is what Mark Andreessen is called

1246
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:48,000
software eating the world. And what that means is that you're going to push things from being

1247
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:52,480
private goods and services into public goods and services. And public goods and services cannot

1248
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:59,520
have price and value tied together. Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value to the

1249
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:03,920
world that they cannot command a price and they will not be able to capture the value that they

1250
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:09,680
have created or a significant enough fraction of it. The abundance economy is a disaster.

1251
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:16,560
It will lead to a reduction in human freedom. The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced

1252
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:24,080
or semi locally enforced conservation laws where the idea is why is gold hard to

1253
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:28,320
create or destroy? It's because it's created not only in stars but in violent events involving

1254
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:36,880
stars like supernova collisions. When gold is created and we transact, we're using conservation

1255
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:43,840
laws, the physics determines the custodianship, whatever it is that I don't have, you now have

1256
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:50,800
and conversely. In such a situation, we should be looking for the abstraction that most closely

1257
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:54,560
matches the physical world because the physical world is known not to throw an exception.

1258
02:08:55,120 --> 02:09:01,280
The blockchain is a vulnerability. The idea that the 51% problem isn't solved, that you could have

1259
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:08,240
crazy race conditions, all of these things, we know that they're solved inside of gauge theory

1260
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:15,040
somehow. So the important thing is to recognize that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever

1261
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:21,120
in the history of economic theory took place already and was essentially instantly buried

1262
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:27,440
and I will stand by those comments. Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you.

1263
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:34,960
Are you Satoshi? No. No, no, I don't have that kind of ability. I really don't. I do other things.

1264
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:41,280
Speaking of Satoshi and gauge theory, you've mentioned to Brian Keating

1265
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:49,280
that you may be releasing a geometric community paper this year or some other form of additional

1266
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:55,520
material on the topic. What is your thinking around this? What's the process you're going

1267
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:01,920
through now? Well, it's very interesting. I used April 1st to try to start a tradition,

1268
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:09,360
which I hope to use to liberate mankind. The tradition is that at least one day a year,

1269
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:15,520
you should be able to say heretical things and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off

1270
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:19,280
or Mark Zuckerberg. Your provost shouldn't call you up and say, what did you say?

1271
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:28,640
We need at some level to have a jubilee from centralized control. And so my hope is that

1272
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:32,480
you know what a tradition is in America, something a baby boomer did twice.

1273
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:45,360
Impeachment? That's very funny. Anyway, so I'm not a baby boomer, but as an exer,

1274
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:52,640
I thought about whether or not April 1st would be a good date on which to release a printed version

1275
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:57,520
of what I already said in lecture form, because I think it's hysterically funny that the physics

1276
02:10:57,520 --> 02:11:05,840
community claims that it can't decode a lecture. Yeah. It must be paper. And you know what? There

1277
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:10,880
will be a steady stream of new complaints up until the point that they fit it into a narrative that

1278
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:19,600
they like. Yeah, I'm thinking about April 1st as a date in which to release a document and it won't

1279
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:26,880
be perfectly complete, but it'll be very complete. And then they'll try to say, it's wrong or you

1280
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:33,520
already did it or no, that was dumb, but what we just did on top of it is brilliant. Or it doesn't

1281
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:39,440
match experiment or who knows what, they'll go through all of their usual nonsense. It's time to go.

1282
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:45,680
Is there still puzzles in your own mind that need to be figured out for you to try to put it on

1283
02:11:45,680 --> 02:11:51,680
paper? I mean, those are different mediums, right? It was a great question. I did not count on something

1284
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:57,920
that turns out to be important. When you work on your own outside of the system for a long time,

1285
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:05,520
you probably don't think you're going to be doing this as a 55-year-old man. And I have been so long

1286
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,280
outside of math and physics departments and I've been occupied with so many other things, as you

1287
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:18,080
can see, that the old idea that I had was if I always did it in little pieces, then I was always

1288
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:25,200
safe because it wouldn't be steelable. And so now those pieces never got assembled completely.

1289
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:34,000
In essence, I have all the pieces and I can fit them together, but there's probably a small amount

1290
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,520
of glue code. There are a few algebraic things I've forgotten how to do. I may or may not figure

1291
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:44,720
them out between now and April 1st, but it's pretty complete. But that's the puzzle you're kind of

1292
02:12:45,680 --> 02:12:50,720
struggling to now figure out to get it all in the same, the glue together.

1293
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:55,120
I can't tell you whether the theory is correct or incorrect. But for example,

1294
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,320
there's what's the exact form of the supersymmetry algebra or what's the rule for passing a minus

1295
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:06,320
sign through a particular operator. And all of that stuff got a lot more difficult because I didn't

1296
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:14,640
do it. Look, it's a little bit like if you're a violinist and you don't touch

1297
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:19,840
your violin regularly for 15 years, you come back to it and you pretty much know the pieces

1298
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:23,280
sort of, but there's lots of stuff that's missing. Your tone is off and that kind of stuff.

1299
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:30,160
I would say I'll get the ship to the harbor and it'll require a tugboat probably to get it in.

1300
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:34,400
And if the tugboat doesn't show up, then I'll pilot the thing right into the dock myself.

1301
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:37,760
But it's not a big deal. I think that it is essentially complete.

1302
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:44,720
Psychologically, just as a human being, this is, I remember perhaps by accident,

1303
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:51,280
but maybe there's no accidents in the universe, I was tuned in, I don't remember where,

1304
02:13:51,280 --> 02:14:00,400
on April 1st, to you, oh, I think in your discord, kind of thinking about thinking through this

1305
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:05,360
release. I mean, it wasn't like, it wasn't obvious that you were going to do it. You were thinking

1306
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:10,640
through it. And I remember there was intellectual, personal, psychological struggle with this.

1307
02:14:10,640 --> 02:14:15,520
Yeah. Well, because I thought it was dangerous. If this turns out to be right, I don't know what

1308
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:25,680
it unlocks. If it's wrong, I think I understand where we are. If it's wrong, it'll be the first

1309
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:30,720
fool's gold that really looks like a theory of everything.

1310
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:38,320
It'll be the iron pyrides of physics. And we haven't even had fool's gold, in my opinion yet.

1311
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:47,520
Got it. So what is your intuition, why this looks right to you? Why it feels like it would be,

1312
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:52,320
if wrong, the first fool's gold? I can say it very simply. It's way smarter than I am.

1313
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:58,080
Can you break that apart a little more? Every time you poke at it, it's giving you intuitions

1314
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:02,320
that follow with the currently known fit. Well, let's put it in computer science terms.

1315
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:07,280
Yes, please. Okay. There's a concept of technical debt that computer scientists struggle with.

1316
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,360
As you commit crimes, you have to pay those crimes back at a later date.

1317
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:18,320
In general, most of the problem with physical theories is that as you try to do something

1318
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:24,400
that matches reality, you usually have to go into some structure that gets you farther away.

1319
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:28,160
And your hope is that you're going to be able to pay back the technical debt.

1320
02:15:28,160 --> 02:15:34,560
And in general, these wind up as checkkiting schemes, or like you're funding a startup and

1321
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:43,040
there are too many pivots. So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover things that have gone

1322
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:53,680
wrong. My belief is that this thing represents something like a summit to me. And I'm very

1323
02:15:53,680 --> 02:16:02,160
proud of having found a route up this summit. But the route is what's due to me. The summit

1324
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:12,480
can't possibly be due to me. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norge did not create Mount Everest.

1325
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:17,680
They know that they didn't create that. They figured out a way up.

1326
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:24,320
You got to tell me what Mount Everest is in this metaphor and also connected to the technical

1327
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:30,800
debt. So technical debt is a negative thing that you'll eventually have to pay it. Are you

1328
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:37,520
saying in the ascent that you're seeing now in the theory is you do not have much technical debt?

1329
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:40,480
Well, that's right. I think that what happens is that early on,

1330
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:51,200
what I would say is, I believe now that the physics community has said many things incorrectly

1331
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:56,560
about the current state of the universe. They're not wildly off, which is why,

1332
02:16:57,600 --> 02:17:02,080
like for example, the claim is that there are three generations of matter. I do not believe

1333
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:05,200
that there are three generations of matter. I believe that there are two generations of matter.

1334
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:13,040
And there's a third collection that looks like a generation of matter as the first two,

1335
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:19,440
only at low energy. Okay, well, that's not a frequent claim. People imagine that there are

1336
02:17:19,440 --> 02:17:24,240
three or more generations of matter. I would claim that that's false. People claim that the matter

1337
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:30,240
is chiral, that is, it knows it's left from its right. I would claim that the chirality is not

1338
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:36,560
fundamental, but it is emergent. We could keep going at all these sorts of things. People think

1339
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:42,640
that space time is the fundamental geometrical construct. I do not agree. I think it's something

1340
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:51,680
that I've termed the observers. All of these different things represent a series of over

1341
02:17:51,680 --> 02:18:00,560
interpretations of the world that preclude progress. So you gave, I think you gave some

1342
02:18:00,560 --> 02:18:06,080
credit to string theory as string theory, I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly,

1343
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:13,280
as like getting close to the fool's gold. Well, I've said that Garrett Leasy,

1344
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:20,480
Garrett Leasy, phenomenologically gets a lot of things right. He's got a reason for chirality,

1345
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:26,560
a reason for uniqueness using E8. In fact, E8 uses something called vial fermions, which are chiral.

1346
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:36,560
He has a way of getting geometry to get Riemann's geometry underneath general relativity to play with

1347
02:18:36,560 --> 02:18:40,240
Eris Mann's geometry, which is underneath the standard model using something called

1348
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:45,840
Cartan connections that are out of favor. He's figured out something involving super connections

1349
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,640
to make sure that the fermion, the matter in the system isn't quantized the same way as the

1350
02:18:50,640 --> 02:18:55,840
bosons were, which is a problem in his old theory. He's got something about three generations for

1351
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:01,680
triality. He's got a lot of phenomenological hits. I don't think Garrett's theory works. It also has a

1352
02:19:01,680 --> 02:19:06,160
very simple Lagrangian. He's basically using the Yang-Mills norm squared, the same thing you would

1353
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:15,680
use as a cost function if you were doing neural nets. The string theorists have a different

1354
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:20,720
selling point, which is that they may have gotten a renormalizable theory of gravity if quantum

1355
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:26,080
gravity was what we were meant to do. They've done some stuff with black holes that they can get

1356
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:33,280
some solutions correct. Then they have lots of agreements where they show mathematical

1357
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:40,240
truths that mathematicians didn't even know. I'm very underwhelmed by string theory based on how

1358
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:45,120
many people have worked on it and how little is supporting the claims to it being a theory of

1359
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:54,000
everything. Those are the two that I take quite seriously. I don't yet take Wolframs quite seriously

1360
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:00,640
because if he really finds one of these cellular automatons that are really distinct and generative,

1361
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:05,120
it'll be amazing. He's looking for such a thing. I don't think he's found anything.

1362
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:12,880
Techmark, I view as a philosopher who is somehow taking credit for Platonism, which I don't see

1363
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:17,440
any reason for fighting with Max because I like Max, but if it ever comes time, I'm putting a

1364
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:22,880
post-it note that I'm not positive. The mathematical universe hypothesis is really anything new.

1365
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:30,960
In general, loop quantum gravity really, I think, grew out of some hopes that the general

1366
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:35,520
relativistic community had that they would be able to do particle theory. I don't think that

1367
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:42,400
they've shown any particle theoretic realism. Essentially, here's what I really think, Lex.

1368
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:49,440
I think we didn't understand how big the difference between an effective theory and a theory of

1369
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:55,760
everything is conceptually. Maybe it's not mathematically that different, but conceptually,

1370
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:59,840
trying to figure out what a theory of everything, how does the universe, and I've compared it to

1371
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:06,080
Escher's drawing hands, how do two hands draw themselves into existence? That's the puzzle

1372
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:13,840
that I think has just been wanting. I'll be honest, I'm really surprised that the theoretical physics

1373
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:25,120
community didn't even get up on their high horse and say, this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable,

1374
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:31,040
because clearly, I always say, I'm not a physicist. I'm an amateur with the heart

1375
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:37,680
as big as all outdoors. In your journey of releasing this, and I'm sure there may be

1376
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:43,680
it will be another American tradition on April 1st that will continue for years to come,

1377
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:58,640
in my, there's crumbs along the way that I'm hoping to collect in my naive view of things

1378
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:10,560
of the beauty that in your geometric view of the universe. So one question I'd like to ask is,

1379
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:18,800
if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful, something important about

1380
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:25,600
geometric community in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty from the outsider's perspective,

1381
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:31,040
what would that thing be? Interesting question. Perhaps we can both

1382
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:35,680
have a journey towards April 1st. Take a look at that.

1383
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:44,480
Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose, not Melrose, on Montana in Santa Monica.

1384
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:51,680
Now you'll notice that all of those discs rotate independently. Yes.

1385
02:22:51,920 --> 02:23:01,280
If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous, but not uniform everywhere, what

1386
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:08,160
you're doing is a so-called gauge transformation on the torus seen as a U1 bundle over a U1

1387
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:15,840
spacetime. So the concept of spacetime here in a very simplified case isn't four-dimensional,

1388
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:21,280
but it's one-dimensional. It's just a circle. And there's a circle above every point in the

1389
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:29,840
circle represented by those little discs. Imagine, if you will, that we took a rubber band

1390
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:37,120
and placed it around here and decided that that was a function from the circle into

1391
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:45,040
this circle that is representing a y-axis that's wrapped around itself. Well, you would have an

1392
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:50,080
idea of what it means for a function to be constant if it just went all around the outside.

1393
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:55,440
But what happens if I turn this a little bit? Then the function would be mostly constant.

1394
02:23:55,440 --> 02:24:01,200
It would have a little place where it dipped and it went back. It turns out that you can transform

1395
02:24:02,080 --> 02:24:08,400
that function and transform the derivative that says that function is equal to zero when I take

1396
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:16,880
its derivative at the same time. That's what a gauge transformation is. Amazing to me that we

1397
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:26,240
don't have a simple video visualizing things that I've already had built and that I can clearly

1398
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:33,120
demonstrate. When you do that torus whose the code of the torus is itself generating spinning

1399
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:39,760
Yeah. This is a U1 principle bundle. And the world needs to know what a gauge theory is,

1400
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:44,000
not by analogy, not what Lawrence Krauss is saying. It's like a checkerboard. If you change

1401
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:50,960
some of the colors this way, not saying that it's a local symmetry involving links,

1402
02:24:50,960 --> 02:24:56,400
none of those things. It's a theory of differential calculus where the functions and the derivatives

1403
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:02,480
are both subject to a particular kind of change so that if a function was constant under one

1404
02:25:02,480 --> 02:25:08,640
derivative, then the new function is constant under the new derivative transformed in the same

1405
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:13,920
fashion. And would you put that under the category of just gauge transformations? Yes,

1406
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:18,240
that would be gauge transformations applied to sections and connections where connections

1407
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:26,640
are the derivatives in the theory. This is easily explained. It is pathological that the community

1408
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:30,880
of people who understand what I'm saying have never bothered to do this in a clear fashion

1409
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:37,280
for the general public. You and I could visualize this overnight. This is not hard.

1410
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:44,320
The public needs to know in some sense that, let's say quantum electrodynamics, the theory of

1411
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:50,560
photons and electrons, more or less electrons are functions and photons are derivatives. Now,

1412
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:55,920
there's some you can object in some ways, but basically a gauge theory is the way in which

1413
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:03,680
you can translate a shift in the definition of the functions and the shift of the definition of

1414
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:09,600
the derivatives so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed. So you have to do both

1415
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:14,800
at the same time. Now, you and I can visualize that. So if what you wanted to do rather than going

1416
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:20,000
directly to geometric unity is that I could sit down with you and I could say, here are the various

1417
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,520
components of geometric unity. And if the public needs a visualization in order to play along,

1418
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,960
we've got a little over two months and I'd be happy to work with you.

1419
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:33,680
I love that as a challenge and I'll take it on and I hope we do make it happen.

1420
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:39,600
And David Goggins, if Lex doesn't do some super macho thing because he's got to work

1421
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:45,120
to get some of this stuff done, you'll understand he'll be available to you after April.

1422
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:49,200
Thank you for the escape clause. I really needed that escape clause.

1423
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:52,240
I'm glad that's on record. I'm worried, 48 miles and 48 hours.

1424
02:26:52,880 --> 02:26:58,240
By the way, I just want to say how much I admire your willingness to keep this kind

1425
02:26:58,240 --> 02:27:04,640
of hardcore attitude. I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews have it in spades,

1426
02:27:04,640 --> 02:27:10,320
but it's harder to do in a society that's sloppy and that's weak and that's lazy.

1427
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:16,240
And the fact that you bring so much heart to saying, I'm going to bring this to jujitsu,

1428
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:19,360
I'm going to bring this to guitar, I'm going to bring this to AI, I'm going to bring this to

1429
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:24,960
podcasting. It comes through loud and clear. I just find it completely and utterly inspiring

1430
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:29,840
that you keep this kind of hardcore aspect at the same time that you're the guy who's extolling

1431
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:33,120
the virtue of love in a modern society and doing it at scale.

1432
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:37,760
Thank you. That means a lot. I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm just following my heart on it

1433
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:42,000
and just going with the gut. This seems to make sense somehow.

1434
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:48,480
I personally think we better get tougher or we're going to get in a world of pain and I

1435
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:54,000
do think that when it comes time to lead, it's great to have people who you know don't crack

1436
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:01,200
under pressure. Do you mind if we talk about love and what it takes to be a father for a bit?

1437
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:04,560
Sure. Do you mind if Zev joins us? I'd be an honor.

1438
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:14,720
Eric, I've talked to your son Zev who's an incredible human being, but let me

1439
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:22,400
ask you, this might be difficult because you're both sitting together,

1440
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:32,800
what advice do you have for him as he makes his way in this world, especially given that,

1441
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:38,320
as we mentioned before, on Joe Rogan, you're flawed and that just like all humans, you're mortal?

1442
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:46,880
Well, at some level, I guess one of my issues is that I've got to stop giving quite so much advice.

1443
02:28:48,640 --> 02:28:53,600
Early on, I was very worried that I could see Zev's abilities and I could see his

1444
02:28:54,240 --> 02:29:01,440
challenges and I saw them in terms of myself. A certain amount of Zev rhymes with whatever I

1445
02:29:01,440 --> 02:29:07,040
went through as a kid and I don't want to doom him to the same outcomes that

1446
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:12,720
suffice for me. I think that he's got a much better head on his shoulders at age 15. He's

1447
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:20,800
much better adjusted and in part, it's important for me to recognize that because I think I did a

1448
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:29,440
reasonably decent job early on, I don't need to get this part right. I'm looking at

1449
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:37,120
at Zev's trajectory and saying, you're going to need to be incredibly and even pathologically

1450
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:41,840
self-confident. The antidote for that is going to be something you're going to need to carry on

1451
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:47,680
board, which is radical humility. You're going to have to have those in a dialectical tension,

1452
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:53,520
which is never resolved, which is a huge burden. You are going to have to forgive people who do

1453
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:58,960
not appreciate your gifts because your gifts are clearly evident and many people will have to pretend

1454
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:03,520
not to see them because if they see your gifts, then they're going to have to question their

1455
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:11,440
entire approach to education or employment or critical thinking. What my hope is is that you

1456
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:16,080
can just forgive those who don't see them and who complicate and frustrate your life and realize

1457
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:20,000
that you're going to have to take care of them too. Zev, let me ask you the more challenging

1458
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:24,000
question because the guy sitting right here, what advice do you have for your dad?

1459
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:33,120
Since after talking to you, I realize you're the more brilliant aside from the better-looking

1460
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:34,800
member of the family.

1461
02:30:42,960 --> 02:30:45,280
You could say anything you want. This is the last time we're going to be seeing them.

1462
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:49,520
This could be an awkward drive home.

1463
02:30:51,760 --> 02:31:00,640
I think a new perspective I've taken on parenting is that it is a task for which

1464
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:08,400
no human is really supposed to be prepared. In Jewish tradition, for example, there are

1465
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:17,120
myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud that compare the role of a parent to the role of a

1466
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:25,840
God. No human is prepared to play God and create and guide a life, but somehow we're forced into

1467
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:35,040
it as people. I think sometimes it's hard for children to understand that however their parents

1468
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:44,880
are failing sort of has to be. It's something for which we must budget because our parents

1469
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:51,040
play a role in our lives of which they're not worthy and they devote themselves to

1470
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:55,280
regardless because that becomes who they are in a certain sense.

1471
02:31:56,240 --> 02:32:12,480
I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human because I think too often it's easy to

1472
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:20,880
have godly expectations of people who are far from such a role. I think I'm really happy that you've

1473
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:30,640
been as open as you have with me about the fact that you don't pretend to be a god in my life.

1474
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:41,040
You are a guide who allows me to see myself and that's been very important considering the fact

1475
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:50,080
that by your self-teaching paradigm I will have to guide myself and being able to see it

1476
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:55,520
and see myself accurately has been one of the greatest gifts that you've given me.

1477
02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:05,040
So I'm very appreciative and I want you to know that I don't buy into the the role that you're

1478
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:16,720
supposed to sort of fake your way through in my in my life but I

1479
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:27,600
am unbelievably happy with a more realistic connection that we've been able to build in

1480
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:33,920
lieu of it. I think it's been easier on you actually as you come to realize what I don't know,

1481
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:39,040
what I can't do and that there's been a period of time I guess that's fascinating to me where

1482
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:46,400
you're sort of surprised that I don't know the answer to a certain thing as well as you do and

1483
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:52,640
that I remember going through this with a particular mathematician who I held and I still

1484
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:59,280
hold an awe named David Kajdan and you know he famously said to him and weirdly our family

1485
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:06,560
knew his family in the Soviet Union but he said you know Eric I always appreciate you coming to

1486
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:11,200
my office because I always find what you have to say interesting but you have to realize that in

1487
02:34:11,200 --> 02:34:15,040
the areas that you're talking about you are no longer the student you are actually my teacher

1488
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:21,280
and I wasn't prepared to hear that and there are many ways in which as I was just saying with the

1489
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:29,280
Mozart I am learning at an incredible rate from you I used to learn from you because I didn't

1490
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:34,240
understand what was possible you were very much I mean this is the weird thing there used to be

1491
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:38,560
this thing called Harvey the invisible rabbit this guy could had a rabbit that was like six feet

1492
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:45,200
tall that only he could see maybe was talking and that was like you at age four is you were saying

1493
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:50,640
batch of crazy things that were all totally sensible and nobody else could put them together

1494
02:34:50,640 --> 02:34:57,520
and so what's wonderful is that the world hasn't caught on but enormous numbers of people

1495
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:05,840
are starting to and I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit and that outside the box

1496
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:14,640
intellectual commitment serves you well as the world starts to appreciate that I think you're a

1497
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:19,760
very trustworthy voice you don't get everything right but the idea that we have somebody at your

1498
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:24,240
age who's embedded in your generation who can tell us something about what's happening is really

1499
02:35:24,240 --> 02:35:30,320
valuable to me and I do hope that you'll consider boosting that voice more than just at the dinner

1500
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:41,600
table. I apologize for saying this four-letter word but do you love Zav? I was really worried

1501
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:48,240
it was going to be another four-letter word. There's so many. It doesn't even rise to the

1502
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:56,000
level of a question. I mean I just there are a tiny number of people with whom you share so much

1503
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:04,480
life that you can't even think of yourself in their absence and I don't know if Zav would find that

1504
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:13,760
but it's you can have a kid and never make this level of connection. I think even right down to

1505
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:22,560
the fact that you know when Zav chooses boogie woogie piano for his own set of reasons why I

1506
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:29,600
would choose boogie woogie piano if I could play in any style it's a question about a decrease in

1507
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:36,320
loneliness. You know like my grandfather played the mandolin and I had to learn some mandolin because

1508
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:42,480
otherwise that instrument would go silent. You don't expect that you get this much of a chance

1509
02:36:42,480 --> 02:36:51,440
to leave this much of yourself in another person who is choosing it and recreating it rather than it

1510
02:36:51,440 --> 02:37:00,240
being directly instilled and my proudest achievement is in a certain sense having not

1511
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:08,640
taught him and having shared this much so you know it's not even love it's like well beyond.

1512
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:20,880
So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world I think I speak for I would argue probably

1513
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:27,200
millions of people that you Eric because this is a conversation with you have made for many people

1514
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:36,240
for me a less lonely world and I can't wait to see how you Zav develop as an intellect but also

1515
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:45,200
I'm so heartworn by the optimism and the hopefulness that was in you that I hope develops further

1516
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:54,640
and lastly I'm deeply thankful that you Eric are my friend and would give me would honor me

1517
02:37:55,440 --> 02:38:02,240
with this watch it means more than words can say. Thanks guys thanks for talking today. Thank you.
