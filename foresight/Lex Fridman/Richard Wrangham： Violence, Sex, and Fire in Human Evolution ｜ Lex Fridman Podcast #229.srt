00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
The following is a conversation with Richard Rangham,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,720
a biological anthropologist at Harvard,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,240
specializing in the study of primates

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,200
and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,160
and other aspects of ape and human behavior

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,360
at the individual and societal level.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,960
He began his career over four decades ago

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,320
working with Jane Goodall

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,560
and studying the behavior of chimps.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,320
And since then, has done a lot of seminal work

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,640
on human evolution

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,840
and has proposed several theories

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,480
for the roles of fire and violence

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,680
in the evolution of us, hairless apes,

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,560
otherwise known as homo sapiens.

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,760

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,040
And now, here's my conversation with Richard Rangham.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,160
You've said that we are much less violent

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,080
than our close living relatives, the chimps.

22
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,040
Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are

23
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,560
and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,040
Well, I haven't said exactly

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,000
that we're less violent than chimps.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,320
What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
One stems from proactive aggression

28
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,640
and the other stems from reactive aggression.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,880
Proactive aggression is planned aggression.

30
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,800
Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.

31
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,600
It's reactive because it takes place

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,880
in seconds after the threat.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,920
And the thing that is really striking about humans

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,840
compared to our close relatives

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,840
is the great reduction in the degree of reactive aggression.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,240
So we are far less violent than chimps

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,760
when prompted by some relatively minor threat

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,680
within our own society.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,680
And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data,

40
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,520
but the study which is particularly striking

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,520
is one of people living as hunter-gatherers

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,760
in a really upsetting kind of environment,

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,760
namely people in Australia living in a place

44
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,560
There's a lot of domestic violence.

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,800
It's all a sort of a society that is as bad

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
from the point of view of violence

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,160
as an ordinary society can get.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,960
There's excellent data on the frequency

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,240
with which people actually have physical violence

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
and hit each other.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,080
And we can compare that to data from several different sites

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,080
comparing, we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,040
and the difference is between two and three orders

55
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,560
of magnitude, the frequency with which chimps and bonobos

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,760
hit each other, chase each other, charge each other,

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,760
physically engage is some day between 500 and 1,000 times

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,440
higher than in humans.

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,960
So there's something just amazing about us

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,680
and this has been recognized for centuries.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,040
Aristotle drew attention to the fact

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,080
that we behave in many ways like domesticated animals

63
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,360
because we're so unviolent.

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,360
But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,000
of this 20th century, the First and Second World War

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,680
and much else besides.

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,160
And that is all proactive violence.

68
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,160
All of that is gangs of people making deliberate decisions

69
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,080
to go off and attack in circumstances

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,640
which ideally the attackers are going to be able

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,440
to make their kills and then get out of there.

72
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,960
In other words, not face confrontation.

73
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,800
That's the ordinary way that arm is trying to work.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,800
And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,160
are in a very similar kind of state.

76
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,000
That is to say, if you look at the rate of death

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
from chimpanzees conducting proactive

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,200
co-editionary violence, it's very similar

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,320
in many ways to what you see in humans.

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,600
So when not downregulated with proactive violence,

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,760
it's just this reactive violence

82
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,200
that is strikingly reduced in humans.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,240
So chimpanzees also practice kind of tribal warfare.

84
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Indeed they do, yeah.

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,960
So this was discovered first in 1974.

86
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,000
It was observed first in 1974,

87
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,640
which was about the time

88
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,640
that the first major study of chimpanzees in the wild

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,480
by Jane Goodall had been going for something like five years

90
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,480
during, of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.

91
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,000
Until then they'd been observed at a feeding station

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,040
where Jane was luring them in to be observed

93
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,920
by seeing bananas, which is great.

94
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,320
She learned a lot, but she didn't learn

95
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,920
what was happening at the edges of their ranges.

96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,480
So five years later, it became very obvious

97
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,640
that there was hostile relationships between groups.

98
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,560
And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form

99
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,600
of the kind of hostile relationships

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
that you see in many animals,

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,720
which is a bunch of chimps in this case shouting

102
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,920
at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.

103
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,560
But dramatically, in addition to that,

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,320
there is a second kind of interaction.

105
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,320
And that is when a party of chimpanzees

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,600
makes a deliberate venture

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
to the edge of their territory,

108
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,240
silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.

109
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,760
And what they're searching for is a lone individual.

110
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,160
So I've been with chimps

111
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,960
when they've heard a lone individual under these circumstances

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
or what they think is a lone one

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,040
and they touch each other and look at each other

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,120
and then charge forward, very excited.

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
And then while they're charging,

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,560
all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
erupts with a volley of calls.

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,880
It was just one calling out of a larger party.

119
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
And our chimps put on the brakes

120
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,720
and scoot back for safety into their own territory.

121
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,720
But if in fact they do find a lone individual

122
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,480
and they can sneak up to them,

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,040
then they make a deliberate attack.

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,560
They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,680
and then they impose terrible damage,

126
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,080
which typically ends in a kill straight away,

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,080
but it might end up with the victim so damaged

128
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,360
that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.

129
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,400
So that was a very dramatic discovery

130
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,400
because it really made people realize for the first time

131
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,800
that Conrad Lorenz had been wrong

132
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,920
when in the 1960s, in his famous book On Aggression,

133
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,800
he said warfare is restricted to humans.

134
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,080
Animals do not deliberately kill each other.

135
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,160
Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals

136
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,400
that deliberately kill each other

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,680
and they always do so under essentially the same circumstances

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,200
which is when they feel safe doing it.

139
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,880
So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.

140
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,400
Animals feel safe when they have a coalition,

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,840
a coalition that has overwhelming power

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,720
compared to the victim.

143
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,440
And so wolves will do that and lions will do that

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,880
and hyenas will do that

145
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,320
and chimpanzees will do it and humans do it too.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,480
Can they pull themselves into something

147
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,600
that looks more like a symmetric war

148
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,680
as opposed to an asymmetric one?

149
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,320
So accidentally engaging on the lone individual

150
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,240
and getting the cells into trouble?

151
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,400
Are they more aggressive in avoiding these kinds of battles?

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,080
No, they're very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,

153
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,720
but occasionally they can make a mistake.

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,360
But so far there have been no observations

155
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,760
of anything like a battle in which

156
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,320
both sides maintain themselves.

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,320
And I think you can very confidently say

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800
that overwhelmingly what happens is that

159
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,120
if they discover that there's several individuals

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
on the other side, then both sides retreat.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,360
Nobody wants to get hurt.

162
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,080
What they want to do is to hurt others.

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,680
So you mentioned Jane Goodall, you've worked with her.

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
What was it like working with her?

165
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
What have you learned from her?

166
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,960
Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,720
who she famously began her studies

168
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
not as a qualified person in terms of education,

169
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,640
but qualified only by enthusiasm

170
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,320
and considerable experience even in her early 20s with nature.

171
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,720
So she's courageous in the sense of being able

172
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
to take on challenges.

173
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,400
The thing that is very impressive about her

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,880
is her total fidelity to the observations,

175
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,920
very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,

176
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,520
waiting until they mount up

177
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,600
and you've really got a confident picture,

178
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,920
and tremendous attention to individuals.

179
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,480
So that was an interesting problem from her point of view

180
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,480
because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,480
this particular community of Casa Calo, about 60 individuals,

182
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,760
so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.

183
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,600
She was there initially with her mother

184
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,520
and then alone for two or three years

185
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,760
of really intense observation

186
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,920
and then slowly joined by other people.

187
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,360
What she discovered was that there were obvious differences

188
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,680
in individual personality.

189
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,160
And the difficulty about that was that when she reported this

190
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,160
to the larger scientific world,

191
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,000
initially her advisors at Cambridge,

192
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,960
they said, well, we don't know how to handle that

193
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,200
because you've got to treat all these animals

194
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
as the same basically because

195
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
there is no research tradition

196
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,320
of thinking about personalities.

197
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,800
Well, now, whatever it is, 60 years later,

198
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,600
the study of personalities is a very rich part

199
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
of the study of animal behavior.

200
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,040
At any rate, the important point in terms of what was she like

201
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,360
is that she stuck to her guns and she absolutely insisted

202
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,360
that we have to show, describe in great detail,

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,440
the differences in personality among these individuals

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,480
and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologist

205
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,720
to think about what it means.

206
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,720
So what is the process of observation like this like?

207
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Observing the personality,

208
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,920
but also observing in a way that's not projecting your beliefs

209
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,840
about human nature or animal nature onto chimps,

210
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,600
which is probably really tempting to project.

211
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,960
So your understanding of the way the human world works,

212
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,440
projecting that onto the chimp world.

213
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,640
Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps

214
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,240
because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior

215
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,000
that it's very easy to make those projections.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,240
As you say, the process involves

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,000
making very clear definitions of what a behavior is.

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,

219
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
a bite and so on.

220
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,360
And writing down every time these things happen

221
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,720
and then slowly totting up the numbers of times

222
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,680
that they happen from individual A towards individuals,

223
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,640
B, C, D and E, so that you build up a very concrete picture

224
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,800
rather than interpreting at any point

225
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,640
and stopping and saying, well,

226
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,400
they seem to be rather aggressive.

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,360
So the formal system is that you build up a pattern

228
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,440
of the relationships based on a description

229
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,520
of the different types of interactions,

230
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,040
the aggressive and the friendly interactions.

231
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,040
And all of these are defined in concrete.

232
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,280
And so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships.

233
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,280
And the relationships can be defined as

234
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,760
relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive,

235
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,440
based on the frequency of these types of interactions.

236
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,000
And so one can talk in terms of individuals

237
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
having a relationship which on the scores of friendliness

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
is two standard deviations outside the mean.

239
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
I mean, you know, it's-

240
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,680
In which direction, sorry, both directions?

241
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,920
Well, I mean, there will be obviously the friendly ones

242
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,040
would be the ones who have exceptionally high rates

243
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,480
of spending time close to each other,

244
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,600
of touching each other in a gentle way,

245
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,120
of grooming each other.

246
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
And by the way, finding that those things

247
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,440
are correlated with each other.

248
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,360
So it's possible to define a friendship with a capital F

249
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,160
in a very systematic way.

250
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,800
And to compare that between individuals,

251
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
but also between communities of chimpanzees

252
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,120
and between different species.

253
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,480
So that, you know, we can say that in some species,

254
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,880
individuals have friends and others, they don't at all.

255
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,720
What about just because there's different personalities

256
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,920
and because they're so fascinating,

257
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,640
what about sort of falling in love

258
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,240
or forming friendships with chimps, you know?

259
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,240
Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer.

260
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,360
What role does that play?

261
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
Is you're tracking these individuals

262
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,800
that are full of life and intelligence

263
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,640
for long periods of time, plus as a human,

264
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,160
especially in those days for Jane,

265
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,320
she's alone observing it.

266
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,120
It gets lonely as a human.

267
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,800
I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human

268
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,760
being observed these other intelligent species.

269
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,920
It's a very reasonable question.

270
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,640
And of course, Jane in those early years,

271
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,320
I think she's willing now to talk about the fact

272
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,880
that she regrets to some extent how close she became.

273
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,680
And the problem is not just from the humans,

274
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,480
the problem is from the chimpanzees as well,

275
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,320
because they do things that are extremely affectionate,

276
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,040
if you like, you know, at one point,

277
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Jane offered a ripe fruit to a chimpanzee

278
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,280
called David Greybeard.

279
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,400
David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand

280
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,840
as if to say thank you.

281
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,200
And then I think he gave it back if I remember rightly.

282
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
Yeah.

283
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,080
No, thank you.

284
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,920
All right.

285
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,440
Oh, it's almost like thank you

286
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,920
and returning the affection by giving the fruit

287
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,240
if they did something like that.

288
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,080
You know, it was a gentle squeeze.

289
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,200
I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard

290
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,280
as that occasionally has happened.

291
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,520
Some chimps are aggressive to people

292
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
and others are friendly.

293
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,000
And the ones that are friendly tend to be

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
rather sympathetic characters

295
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
because they might be ones who are having problems

296
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,440
in their own society.

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,160
So Joe Mio in Gombe used to come and sit next to me

298
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,840
quite often and he was having a hard time

299
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
making it in that society,

300
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,880
which I can describe to you

301
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,760
in terms of the number of aggressive interactions if you want,

302
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,360
but just to be informed about it.

303
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,360
So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.

304
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,720
And in the community that I've been working with

305
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,360
in Uganda for the last 30 years,

306
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,120
we try extremely hard to impress

307
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,440
on all of the research students who come with us

308
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,160
that it is absolutely vital

309
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,800
that you do not fall into that temptation.

310
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,920
Now, you know, we heard a story of one person

311
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,360
who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.

312
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,240
It's a very, very bad idea.

313
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,400
Not because the chimp is going to do anything violent

314
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,200
at the time, but because if they learn

315
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,440
that humans are as weak physically

316
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,080
as we are compared to them,

317
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,800
then they can take advantage of it, us.

318
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
And that's what happened in Gombe.

319
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,400
So after Jane had done the very obvious thing

320
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,840
when you're first engaged in this game

321
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,600
of allowing the infants to approach her

322
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
and then tickling them and playing with them,

323
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,200
some of those infants had the personality

324
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,360
of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.

325
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,120
And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,

326
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,280
who was violent on a regular basis

327
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,760
towards humans when he was an adult

328
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,720
and he was quite dangerous.

329
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,960
I mean, he could easily have killed someone.

330
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,120
In fact, he did kill one person.

331
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,760
He killed a baby that he took from a mother,

332
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,040
a human baby that he took off her hip

333
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,880
when he met her on the path.

334
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,720
So, you know, it's a reminder that we're dealing with

335
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,080
a species that are rather human-like

336
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,040
in the range of emotions they have,

337
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,960
in the capacities they have,

338
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,560
and even in the strength they have,

339
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,720
they are, you know, in many ways stronger than humans.

340
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,840
So it's a...

341
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,800
You've got to be careful.

342
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,600
So in the full range of friendliness and violence,

343
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,480
the capacity for these very human things.

344
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,360
Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,

345
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,280
as we talked about, you know, that they will kill,

346
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,120
they will kill not just strangers.

347
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,680
They can kill other adults within their own group.

348
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,720
They can kill babies that are strangers.

349
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,280
They can kill babies in their own group.

350
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,480
So, you know, this is a long-lived individual.

351
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
Obviously, these killings can't have very often

352
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,400
because otherwise they'd all be dead.

353
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,440
And we're now finding that they can live to 50 or 60 years

354
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
in the wild at relatively low population density

355
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,360
because they're big animals,

356
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,520
eating a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.

357
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,960
So it doesn't happen all the time.

358
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,840
With friendliness, they are very strong to support each other.

359
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,840
They very much depend on their close friendships,

360
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,960
which they express through physical contact.

361
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,680
And particularly through grooming.

362
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,760
So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another

363
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
and might present for grooming,

364
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,120
a very common way of starting, turning their back

365
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,880
or presenting an arm or something like that.

366
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,880
And the other just riffles their fingers through the hair.

367
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,520
And that's partly just soothing.

368
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,400
And it's partly looking for parasites,

369
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,800
but mostly it's just soothing.

370
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,640
Yes.

371
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
The point about this is it can go on for half an hour.

372
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,480
It can go on for sometimes even an hour.

373
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,080
So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.

374
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,760
When did your interest in this one particular aspect

375
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,000
of chimp come to be, which is violence?

376
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,320
When did the study of violence in chimps

377
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,520
become something you're deeply interested in?

378
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,

379
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,040
I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall

380
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,200
and was studying feeding behavior.

381
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,080
But during that time, we were seeing,

382
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,440
and I say we because there were half a dozen

383
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,840
research students all in her camp,

384
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,360
we were discovering that chimps had this capacity

385
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,080
for violence.

386
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,520
The first kill happened during that time,

387
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,040
which was of an infant and a neighboring group.

388
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,280
And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.

389
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,880
And this was the start of my interest

390
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,840
because it was such chilling evidence

391
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,840
of an extraordinary similarity between chimps and humans.

392
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,800
Now, at that time, we didn't know very much

393
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,560
about how chimpanzees and humans were related.

394
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:41,040
Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three big black hairy things

395
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,040
that live in the African forests and eat fruits

396
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,760
and leaves when they can't find fruits and walk on their knuckles.

397
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,320
And they all look rather similar to each other.

398
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,320
So they seem as though those three species,

399
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,720
chimps and gorillas and bonobos,

400
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,400
should all be each other's closest relatives.

401
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,520
And humans are something rather separate.

402
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,640
And so any of them would be of interest to us.

403
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,520
Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true

404
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,440
and that there's a special relationship

405
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,400
between humans and chimpanzees.

406
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,920
But at the time, even without knowing that,

407
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,440
it was obvious that there was something very odd

408
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,760
about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered

409
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,440
they were making tools.

410
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,080
She had seen that they were hunting meat.

411
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,200
She had seen that they were sharing the meat among each other.

412
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
She had seen that the societies

413
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,320
were dominated politically by males,

414
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,680
coalitions of males.

415
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,480
All of these things, of course, resonate

416
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,200
so closely with humans.

417
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,440
And then it turns out that in contrast

418
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,120
to conventional wisdom at the time,

419
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,240
the chimpanzees were capable of hunting

420
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,320
and killing members of neighboring groups.

421
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,440
Well, at that point, the similarities

422
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,640
between chimps and humans become less a matter

423
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,200
of sort of sheer intellectual fascination

424
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,560
than something that has a really deep meaning

425
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,600
about our understanding of ourselves.

426
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,760
I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans

427
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,960
as a species apart from the rest of nature

428
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,800
because we are so peculiar.

429
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,480
But when it turns out that, as it turns out,

430
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
one of our two closest relatives

431
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,840
has got these features that we share

432
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,720
and that one of the features is something

433
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,640
that is the most horrendous, as well as fascinating,

434
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,440
aspect of human behavior, then how can you resist

435
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,320
just trying to find out what's going on?

436
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,640
So I have to say this.

437
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,480
I'm not sure if you're familiar with the man,

438
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,360
but fans of this podcast are.

439
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,960
So we're talking about chimps, we're talking about violence.

440
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,320
My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan, is a big fan of those things.

441
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
I'm a big fan of these topics.

442
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.

443
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,160
So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration

444
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,600
of violence and the relations between chimps

445
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,920
so interesting?

446
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,000
What can they teach us about ourselves?

447
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Until we had this information about chimpanzees,

448
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,800
it was possible to believe that the psychology

449
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,560
behind warfare was totally the result

450
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,640
of some kind of cultural, recent cultural innovation.

451
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
It had nothing to do with our biology.

452
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,240
Or if you like, that it's got something to do with sin

453
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,480
and God and the devil and that sort of thing.

454
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully about it

455
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,720
is that it seems undoubtedly the case

456
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,720
that our evolutionary psychology has given us

457
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,720
the same kind of attitude towards violence

458
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,440
as occurred in chimpanzees.

459
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,400
And in both species, it has evolved

460
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,120
because of its evolutionary significance.

461
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,640
In other words, because it's been helpful

462
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,920
to the individuals who have practiced it.

463
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,920
And now we know that, as I mentioned,

464
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,160
other species do this as well.

465
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,160
In fact, wolves, which this is a really

466
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,240
kind of ironical observation, Conrad Lorenz,

467
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,440
who I mentioned had been the person who thought

468
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,720
that human aggression in the form of killing

469
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,120
members of our own species was unique to our species.

470
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,640
He was a great fan of wolves.

471
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,040
He studied wolves.

472
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,040
And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely

473
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,840
to harm each other in spats among members

474
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,480
of the same group.

475
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,200
What happens is that one of them will roll over

476
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,680
and present their neck, much as you see

477
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,440
in a dog park nowadays.

478
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,720
And the other might put their jaws on the neck

479
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,640
but will not bite.

480
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves

481
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,080
in the wild, then neighboring packs

482
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,800
often go hunting for each other.

483
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,360
They are in fierce competition.

484
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,760
And as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves

485
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,600
is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.

486
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,440
Wow.

487
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,280
So it's a really serious business.

488
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,540
The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern

489
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,920
of understanding animals in which

490
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,080
you don't have an instinct for violence.

491
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,160
What you have is an instinct, if you like,

492
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,840
to use violence adaptively.

493
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,760
And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive.

494
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,800
If the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.

495
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,440
So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent

496
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,240
than others because of things like the frequency

497
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,880
with which a large party of males is likely

498
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,120
to meet a lone victim.

499
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,560
And that's going to depend on the local ecology.

500
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,760
But so the overall answer to the question

501
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,360
what a chimps teach us is that we have to take

502
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,360
very seriously the notion that in humans,

503
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,040
the tendency to make war is a consequence

504
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,440
of a long-term evolutionary adaptation

505
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,120
and not just a military ideology

506
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,360
or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.

507
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,080
And of course, a reading of history,

508
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,200
a judicious reading of history fits that very easily

509
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,920
because war is so commonplace.

510
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,800
It's not an accident.

511
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,640
So it's not a construction of human civilization.

512
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
It's deeply within us, violence.

513
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,480
So what's the difference between violence

514
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,000
on the individual level versus group?

515
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,960
It seems like with chimps and with wolves,

516
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,840
there's something about the dynamic of multiple

517
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,320
chimps together that increase the chance of violence.

518
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,040
Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?

519
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Like would an individual be as violent

520
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,000
as they might be as part of a group?

521
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,240
If we're talking about killing,

522
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,240
then violence in the sense of killing

523
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,000
is very much associated with a group.

524
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,960
And the reason is that individuals don't benefit

525
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,600
by getting into a fight

526
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,680
in which they risk being hurt themselves.

527
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,680
So it's only when you have overwhelming power

528
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,800
that the temptation to try and kill another victim

529
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,640
rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.

530
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,880
The average number of chimpanzee males

531
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,520
that attack a single male

532
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,200
in something like 50 observations

533
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,040
that have accumulated in the last 50 years

534
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,040
from various different study sites is eight, eight to one.

535
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,840
Now sometimes it can go as low as three to one,

536
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,520
but that's getting risky.

537
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,680
But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.

538
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,960
I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,

539
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,120
another male on another foot,

540
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
another male on an arm, another male on another arm.

541
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,520
Now you have an immobilized victim

542
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,360
with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.

543
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,720
And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax

544
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,200
and tear off his testicles

545
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,560
and twist an arm until it breaks

546
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,760
and do this, you know, appalling damage with no weapons.

547
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,480
What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?

548
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,880
Is there something to be said

549
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
about like the actual process of it?

550
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,400
Is there an artistry to it?

551
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,400
So if you look at human warfare,

552
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
there's different parts in history,

553
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
preferred different kind of approaches to violence.

554
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,280
It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.

555
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,880
But just the nature of violence itself,

556
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,560
sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,

557
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,120
is it basically the same?

558
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,440
You improvise, you immobilize the victim

559
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,000
and they just rip off different parts

560
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,800
of their body kind of thing.

561
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,880
Yeah, you have to understand that these things

562
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,880
are happening at high speed in thick vegetation, mostly.

563
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,800
So they have not been filmed carefully.

564
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,720
You know, we have a few little glimpses of them

565
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,440
from one or two people like David Watts,

566
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,960
who's got some great video,

567
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,360
but we don't know enough to be able to say that.

568
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,920
It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles

569
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,480
that vary between communities, you know, cultural styles,

570
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,880
but it is possible and one thing that is striking

571
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,920
is that the number of times

572
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,280
that an individual victim has been killed immediately

573
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,240
has been higher in Kibali Forest in Uganda

574
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,640
than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.

575
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,200
It's conceivable, that's just chance.

576
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,360
We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?

577
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,440
I can't remember exact numbers,

578
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,240
but you know, 10 versus 15 or something.

579
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,160
So maybe they damage to the point of expecting a death

580
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,160
in one place and they just finish it off in the other,

581
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,120
but most likely that sort of difference

582
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,120
will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.

583
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,920
You know, human beings are able to conceive

584
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,400
of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.

585
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,520
Is there any of that for chimps

586
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,520
when they're thinking about violence?

587
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,560
Is violence, like what is the nature

588
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,560
of their conception of violence, do you think?

589
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:41,640
Do they realize they're taking another conscious being's life,

590
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,960
or is it some kind of like optimization

591
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,560
over the use of resources or something like that?

592
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,840
I don't think it's, I can't think of any way to get it

593
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,760
in answer to the question of what they know about that.

594
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I think that the way to think about the motivation

595
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,320
is rather like the motivation in sex.

596
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,640
So when males are interested in having sex with a female,

597
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,080
whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,

598
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,040
they don't think about the fact that what this is going to do

599
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,320
is to lead to a baby.

600
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,280
Mostly.

601
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,120
You're right.

602
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,600
Mostly what they're thinking about is,

603
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,960
I want to get my end away.

604
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,520
And I think that it's a similar kind of process

605
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,800
with the chimps.

606
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,720
What they are thinking about is,

607
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,720
I want to kill this individual.

608
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,560
And it's hard to imagine that

609
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,640
taking the other individual's perspective

610
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,240
and thinking about what it means for them to die

611
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,800
is going to be an important part of that.

612
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
In fact, there's reasons to think

613
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,160
it should not be an important part of it

614
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,120
because it might inhibit them.

615
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,000
And they don't want to be inhibited.

616
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,720
They're more efficient they are in doing this the better.

617
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,640
But I think it's interesting to think about this

618
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,760
whole motivational question

619
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,760
because it does produce the sort of rather haunting thought

620
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,800
that there has been selection

621
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,640
in favor of enthusiasm about killing.

622
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:22,080
And in our relatively gentle

623
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,640
and deliberately moral society that we have today,

624
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,080
it's very difficult for us to face the thought

625
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,560
that in all of us,

626
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,320
there might have been a residue

627
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,800
and more than that,

628
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,640
sort of an active potential for that thought

629
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,640
of really enjoying killing someone else.

630
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,680
But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously

631
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,960
by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true

632
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
that the ordinary human male would be delighted

633
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,680
to be part of a group that was killing someone.

634
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,440
What you've got to do is to be in a position

635
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,320
where you're regarding the victim as dangerous

636
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,440
and thoroughly hostile.

637
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,080
But the pure enjoyment of violence.

638
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,960
There's, I don't know if you know this historian,

639
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,040
Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.

640
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,040
He has an episode three, four hour episode

641
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,960
that I recommend to others, it's quite haunting.

642
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,400
But he takes us through an entire history.

643
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
It's called painful tainment.

644
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,800
The history of humans enjoying the murder of others

645
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,920
in a large group.

646
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,840
So like public executions were part of,

647
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,640
long part of human history.

648
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,280
And there's something that for some reason,

649
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,400
humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.

650
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,840
And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.

651
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,440
For example, he said if it was possible to televise,

652
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,480
to stream online, for example, the execution

653
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,040
and the murder of somebody or even the torture of somebody

654
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,040
that a very large fraction of the population on earth

655
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,040
would not be able to look away.

656
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
They'd be drawn to that somehow.

657
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.

658
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,080
So you think that's part of us in there somewhere,

659
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,080
that selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing

660
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,400
and the enjoyment of observing those in our tribe

661
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,520
doing the killing.

662
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,240
Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end

663
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,240
is critical, I think, because it would be a little bit weird,

664
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,840
I think, to imagine a lot of enjoyment

665
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,760
about people in your own tribe being killed.

666
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,600
Right.

667
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,320
I don't think we're interested in violence

668
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,440
for violence's sake that much.

669
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,920
It's when you get these social boundaries set up.

670
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,480
And in today's world, happily,

671
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,080
we kind of are already one world.

672
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,240
You have to dehumanise someone to get to the point

673
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,240
where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe

674
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,400
at some level, which is the whole human species.

675
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,160
But in ancient times, that would not have been true,

676
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,680
because in ancient times,

677
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,320
there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers

678
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,440
in which the appearance of a stranger

679
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,960
would lead to an immediate response of shooting on site.

680
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,640
Because what was human was the people

681
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,280
that were in your society.

682
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,160
And the other things that actually looked like us,

683
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,760
and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.

684
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,680
So there was a kind of automatic dehumanisation

685
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,200
of everybody that didn't speak our language

686
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,680
or hadn't already somehow become recognised

687
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,680
as sufficiently like us to escape the dehumanisation

688
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,880
of the human population.

689
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,000
And so hopefully the story of human history

690
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
is that we are, that tribalism fades away,

691
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,160
that our dehumanisation, the natural desire to dehumanise,

692
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,320
or tendency to dehumanise groups

693
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,840
that are not within this tribe decreases over time.

694
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,800
And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.

695
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,560
Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.

696
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,280
And the great sort of concern, of course,

697
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,440
is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts

698
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,160
and then dehumanisation happens

699
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,720
and then violence is released.

700
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,600
As Hannah Arendt says, there currently is no known alternative

701
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,400
to war as a means of settling really important conflicts.

702
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,800
So if we look at the big picture,

703
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,040
what role has violence or do you think violence

704
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,040
has played in the evolution of homo sapiens?

705
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,680
So we are quite an intelligent, got a beautiful,

706
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,960
particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.

707
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,080
What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?

708
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,960
Well, I think that violence was responsible

709
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,240
for creating your homo sapiens.

710
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:54,360
And that raises the question of what homo sapiens is.

711
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,880
Yes.

712
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,720
Yeah, exactly.

713
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,720
So nowadays people begin the sort of concept

714
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,800
of what homo sapiens is by thinking about features

715
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,360
that are very obviously different

716
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,800
from all of the other species of homo.

717
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,680
And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,

718
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,240
our relatively small face, these are characteristics

719
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,720
which are developed in a relatively modern way

720
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,160
by about 170,000 years ago.

721
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,960
Say, it's one of the earliest skulls in Africa

722
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,560
that really captures that.

723
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,560
But it has been argued that that is an episode

724
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,280
in a process that has been started substantially earlier.

725
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,240
And there's no doubt that that's true.

726
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,200
Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing

727
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,200
pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.

728
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,480
And it goes back to 300,000 years ago.

729
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
315, naturally, is the time, the best estimate of a date

730
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,680
for a series of bones from Morocco that have been dated

731
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
three or four years ago at that time

732
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,480
and have been characterized as earliest homo sapiens.

733
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,680
Now, at that point, they are only beginning

734
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,840
the trend of sapienization.

735
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,840
And that trend consists basically of grassinization,

736
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,840
of making our ancestors less robust, shorter faces,

737
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,720
smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,

738
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,520
narrower face, thinner cranium,

739
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,440
all these things that are associated

740
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,960
with reduced violence.

741
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,200
Okay, so that's saying, well, that's homo sapiens beginning.

742
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,640
So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago

743
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,640
because by 315,000 years ago,

744
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,400
you've already got something recognizable.

745
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,200
So you're more on that side of things

746
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,760
that those are this gradual process.

747
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,240
It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.

748
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,600
It started like 400,000 years ago.

749
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,440
And it's just-

750
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,400
It started three to 400,000 years ago.

751
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,960
And if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.

752
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,600
And then if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.

753
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,440
And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.

754
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,360
It's all the way.

755
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,160
It's just getting more and more like the moderns.

756
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,800
So the question is, what happened

757
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,600
between three and 400,000 years ago

758
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,720
to produce homo sapiens?

759
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,120
And I think we have a pretty good answer now.

760
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,160
And the answer comes from violence.

761
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,120
And the story begins by focusing on this question.

762
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,120
Why is it that in the human species,

763
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,560
we are unique among all primates

764
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,560
in not having an alpha male in any group

765
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,640
in the sense that what we don't have

766
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,840
is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?

767
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,280
And the answer that has been portrayed

768
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,960
most richly by Christopher Boehm

769
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,760
and whose work I've elaborated on

770
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,800
is that only in humans do you have a system

771
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,640
by which any male who tries to bully others

772
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,280
and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla

773
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo

774
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,600
or an alpha baboon or anything like that,

775
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,640
any male who tries to do that in humans

776
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,520
gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.

777
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,960
That coalition?

778
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,560
I guess it's a really good picture of human society.

779
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,880
Yes, I like it.

780
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,680
Okay, so and that's the way all our societies work now.

781
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,520
Yes.

782
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,720
Because individuals try and be alpha

783
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,080
and then they get taken out.

784
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,040
Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves

785
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:06,520
as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.

786
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,440
Exactly, yes, exactly.

787
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,600
Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.

788
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,840
Well, what alpha males are are males

789
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,640
who respond with high reactive violence

790
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,760
to any challenge to their status.

791
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,120
You see it all the time in primates.

792
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,080
Some beta male thinks he's getting strong

793
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,720
and maturing in wisdom and so on

794
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,920
and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male

795
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,400
and the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.

796
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,680
Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes

797
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,360
or over and then take an opportunity to attack him.

798
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,200
All of these primates have got a high tendency

799
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,200
for reactive aggression

800
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,400
and that enables the possibility of alpha males.

801
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,600
We don't, we have this great reduction

802
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,400
as I talked about earlier.

803
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,000
And the question is when did that reduction happen?

804
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,520
Well, cut to the famous experiments

805
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,280
by the Russian biologist Dmitry Believ

806
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,320
who tried domesticating wild animals.

807
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,920
When you domesticate wild animals,

808
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,760
what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.

809
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,240
You are selecting those individuals to breed

810
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,960
who are most willing to be approached by a human

811
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,360
or by another member of their own species

812
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:39,360
and are least likely to erupt in a reactive aggression.

813
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,960
And you only have to do that for a few generations

814
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,120
to discover that there are changes in the skull

815
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,720
and those changes consist of

816
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,400
shorter face, smaller teeth,

817
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,360
a reduced maleness,

818
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,840
the males become increasingly female-like

819
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,920
and reduced brain size.

820
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,440
Well, the changes that are characteristic

821
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,440
of domesticated animals in general,

822
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,920
compared to wild animals,

823
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,920
are all found in homo sapiens

824
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,680
compared to our early ancestors.

825
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,440
So it's a very strong signal

826
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,080
that when we first see homo sapiens,

827
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,960
what we're seeing is evidence

828
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,280
of a reduction in reactive aggression.

829
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,400
And that suggests that what's happening with homo sapiens

830
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,080
is that that is the point

831
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,520
at which there is selection against the alpha males.

832
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,320
And therefore, the way in which the selection happened

833
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,480
would have been the way it happens today.

834
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,920
The beta males take them out.

835
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,520
So I think that homo sapiens is a species

836
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,520
characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression

837
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,400
as a kind of incidental consequence

838
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,520
of the suppression of the alpha male.

839
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,800
And the story of our species

840
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,160
is the story of how the beta males took charge.

841
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,920
And have been responsible

842
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,000
for the generation of a new kind of human.

843
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,040
And incidentally,

844
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,160
for imposing on the society

845
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,240
a new set of values.

846
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,720
Because when those beta males discovered

847
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,920
that they could take out the previous alpha male

848
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,040
and continue to do so,

849
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,200
because in every generation,

850
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,440
there'll always be some male who says,

851
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,200
maybe I'll become the alpha male.

852
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,280
So they just keep chopping them down.

853
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,600
In discovering that,

854
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,400
they also obviously discovered

855
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
that they could kill anybody in the group.

856
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,480
Females, young males,

857
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,000
anybody who didn't follow their values.

858
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,280
And so this story is one of,

859
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,560
one in which the males of our species,

860
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,480
and these would be the breeding males,

861
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,800
have been able to impose their values on everybody else.

862
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,120
And there was two kind of values.

863
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,040
There's one kind of value is things that are good

864
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,400
for the group, like thou shalt not murder.

865
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,120
And the other kind of value is things

866
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,120
that are good for the males.

867
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,240
Such as, hey, guess what?

868
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,440
When good food comes in, males get it first.

869
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,280
Yes.

870
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,520
So I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals

871
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,960
could outcompete the others.

872
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,400
Do you have a sense of why,

873
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,480
or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals

874
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,240
and all the other early humans.

875
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Why did homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish

876
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,680
and all the other ones,

877
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,120
all the other branches of evolution died out?

878
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,720
Or got murdered out?

879
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:56,040
Nowadays when homo sapiens, meets homo sapiens,

880
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,200
and we don't know each other initially,

881
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,640
then conflict breaks out

882
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,640
and the more militarily able group wins.

883
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,120
You know, we've seen that everywhere

884
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,280
throughout the age of exploration and throughout history.

885
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,160
So I'm rather surprised, you know,

886
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,480
the conventional wisdom that you see nowadays

887
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,400
in contemporary anthropology is very reluctant

888
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,120
to point to success in warfare

889
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,480
as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals

890
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,560
within about 3,000 years of the sapiens

891
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,720
coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.

892
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,280
And people are much more inclined to say,

893
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,240
well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,

894
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,240
so they just couldn't survive the demographic sweep

895
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:54,040
or the disease came in.

896
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,600
You know, maybe those things might have been important,

897
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,040
but far and away, the most obvious possibility

898
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:05,040
is that sapiens were just powerful.

899
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,360
They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.

900
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,640
They had better weapons.

901
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,880
They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows

902
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:20,240
to judge from the little microlyth, bits of flake,

903
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,560
which the Neanderthals didn't.

904
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,040
You know, nowadays there's evidence of interbreeding,

905
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,440
quite extensive interbreeding

906
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,160
between sapiens and Neanderthals,

907
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,200
as well as with some other groups.

908
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,280
And sometimes people say, well, you know,

909
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,560
so they loved each other.

910
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,480
They made love, not war.

911
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,480
I think they made love and war.

912
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,520
And, you know, it wouldn't necessarily mean too loving.

913
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,240
I mean, if you just follow through

914
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,680
from typical ethnographies nowadays

915
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,400
of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,

916
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,840
they didn't know each other,

917
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,520
then you can imagine that Neanderthal females

918
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,400
would essentially be captured

919
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,360
and taken into sapiens groups.

920
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,200
Maybe you can comment on this cautiously

921
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,200
and eloquently, what's the role of sexual violence

922
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,000
in human evolution?

923
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,320
Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.

924
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,760
You've also mentioned that some of these rules

925
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,640
are defined by the male side of the society.

926
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,440
What's the role of sexual violence in this story?

927
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,680
I think you've got to distinguish between groups

928
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
and within groups.

929
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,680
And, you know, I think the world has been slowly waking up

930
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,040
over the last several decades

931
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,040
to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.

932
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,680
And that to me says that it's just another example

933
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,400
of power corrupts because, you know,

934
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,400
when frustrated, scared, elated soldiers

935
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,840
come upon females in a group

936
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,400
that there's been essential dehumanization of,

937
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,600
then they get carried away by opportunity.

938
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,160
It is not always possible to argue

939
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,600
that this is adaptive nowadays

940
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,200
because, you know, you get lots and lots of stories

941
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,200
of women being abused to the point of being killed.

942
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,200
She'll be gang raped and then killed.

943
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,200
There's lots of terrible cases of that reported

944
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,800
from all sorts of different wars.

945
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,600
But you can see that that could build on a pattern

946
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,160
that would have been adaptive if happening

947
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,560
in under sort of much less extreme circumstances.

948
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,240
You know, the war is very extreme nowadays

949
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,520
in the sense that you get battles

950
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,320
in which people are sent by a military hierarchy

951
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,200
into a war situation in which they do not feel

952
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,520
what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt

953
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,680
which would have been that if we attack,

954
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,000
we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.

955
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,280
Nowadays, you know, you're sent in across the Somme

956
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,840
or whatever it is and there's a very high chance

957
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,360
you will be killed and that's totally unnatural

958
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,160
and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.

959
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,600
Then there's sexual coercion within groups

960
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,600
and so that takes various kinds of forms, you know,

961
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,800
but nowadays, of course,

962
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,040
I think people recognize increasingly

963
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,040
that the principal form of sexual intimidation

964
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,120
and rape occurs within relationships.

965
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,440
It's not stranger rape that is really statistically important.

966
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,680
There's much more.

967
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,720
What happens behind the walls of a bedroom

968
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,960
where people have been living for some time

969
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,960
and just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.

970
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,960
One is that it may seem odd that males should be,

971
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,920
should think it a good idea, as it were,

972
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,840
to impose themselves sexually

973
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,200
on someone with whom they have a relationship.

974
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,040
But what they're doing is intimidating someone

975
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,400
in a relationship in which the relative power

976
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,880
in the relationship has continuing significance

977
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,400
for a long time.

978
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,880
And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.

979
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,960
You know, it's to do with domestic relationships,

980
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,240
it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.

981
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,880
It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression

982
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,240
is one of the tools to regain power or gain power

983
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,920
or gain more power and that kind of thing.

984
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,720
Yeah, exactly.

985
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,720
And in that respect, it's worth noting that

986
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,720
although this wasn't appreciated for some time,

987
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,360
it's emerging that in a bunch of primates

988
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,360
you have somewhat parallel kinds of sexual intimidation

989
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,840
where males will target particular females

990
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,320
even in a group in which the norm is for females

991
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,520
to mate with multiple males.

992
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,960
But each male will target a particular female

993
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,640
and the more he is aggressive towards her

994
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,240
then the more she conforms to his wishes

995
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,320
when he wants to mate.

996
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,000
So a long-term pattern of sexual intimidation.

997
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,400
So there's that aspect.

998
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,800
The other aspect I would just note is that males

999
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,240
get away with a lot compared to females

1000
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,720
in any kind of intersexual conflict.

1001
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,560
So the punishment, here's one example of this,

1002
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,480
the punishment for a husband killing a wife

1003
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,640
has always been much less than the punishment

1004
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,160
for a wife killing a husband.

1005
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,200
And you see similar sorts of things

1006
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,200
in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.

1007
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,000
I bring this up in the context of males

1008
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,840
sexually intimidating their partners,

1009
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,240
be it wives or whoever,

1010
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,400
because it's a reminder that it's basically

1011
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,840
a patriarchal world that we have come from,

1012
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:02,120
a patriarchal world in which male alliances

1013
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,280
tend to support males and take advantage of the fact

1014
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,800
that they have political power at the expense of females.

1015
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,040
And I would say that that all goes back

1016
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,880
to what happened three to 400,000 years ago

1017
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,760
when the beta males took charge

1018
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,240
and they started imposing their own norms

1019
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,600
on society as a whole and they've continued to do so.

1020
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,200
And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,

1021
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,840
we are not a patriarchal society.

1022
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:33,080
Well, it's true that the laws try and make it even-handed

1023
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,480
nowadays between males and females.

1024
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,920
But obviously we are patriarchal de facto

1025
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,920
because society still in many ways supports men

1026
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,120
better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.

1027
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,600
So beta male patriarchal.

1028
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,800
Yeah.

1029
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,400
If we're looking at the evolutionary history.

1030
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,960
Okay, is there maybe sticking on Jordan for a second.

1031
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Is there, so he's a psychologist, right?

1032
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,440
And what part of the picture do you think he's missing

1033
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,800
in analyzing the human relations?

1034
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,160
Like what does he need to understand

1035
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,400
about our origins and violence

1036
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,960
and the way the society has been constructed?

1037
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Oh, I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives.

1038
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,600
But I just think that what he's doing

1039
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,880
in that particular example is focusing

1040
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,280
on the legalistic position.

1041
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,240
And that's great that you do not find

1042
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,240
formal patriarchy in the law,

1043
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,800
anything like to the extent

1044
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,840
that you could find it a hundred years ago and so on.

1045
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,120
Women have got the vote now, hooray,

1046
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,720
but it took a long time for women to get the vote.

1047
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,840
And it remains the case that

1048
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,840
the women suffer in various kinds of ways.

1049
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,840
I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners

1050
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,960
is treated much more rudely

1051
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,320
than a male who has lots of sexual partners.

1052
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,160
There are all sorts of informal ways

1053
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,240
in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.

1054
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,240
And if we look at the surface layer of the law,

1055
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,320
we may miss the deeper human nature,

1056
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,240
like the origins of our human nature that still operates

1057
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,640
no matter what the law says.

1058
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,160
Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward

1059
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,000
because it includes some unpleasant features

1060
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,240
that when we sit back and reflect about them,

1061
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,960
we would like them to go away.

1062
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,960
But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned

1063
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,040
to try and have sex with at least one woman

1064
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,080
and often lots of women.

1065
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,320
And so women, men are constantly putting pressure on women

1066
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,920
in ways that women find unpleasant.

1067
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,720
And if men sit back and reflect about it,

1068
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,920
they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this,

1069
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,280
but actually it just goes on because of human nature.

1070
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,920
So maybe looking at particular humans in history,

1071
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,880
let's talk about Genghis Khan.

1072
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,720
So is this particular human

1073
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,240
who was one of the most famous examples

1074
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:42,280
of large-scale violence,

1075
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,800
is he a deep representative of human nature

1076
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,960
or is he a rare exception?

1077
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,960
Well, I think that it's easy to imagine

1078
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,480
that most men could have become Genghis Khan.

1079
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,320
It's possible that he had a particular streak of psychopathy.

1080
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,440
You know, it's striking that by the time you become

1081
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,440
immensely powerful, then you're a willingness

1082
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,080
to do terrible things for the interest

1083
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,080
of yourself and your group becomes very high.

1084
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,880
Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, these sorts of people have histories

1085
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,760
in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.

1086
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,600
But by the time they are big leaders,

1087
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,280
they are really psychopathic in the sense that

1088
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,080
they do not follow the ordinary morality

1089
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,080
of considering the harm that they are doing to their victims.

1090
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,520
What kind of experiment would we need

1091
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,720
whether or not anybody could fall into this position?

1092
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:11,720
I don't know, but Lord Acton's famous dictum

1093
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,840
was power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

1094
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,160
And then the point that people often forget

1095
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,640
is the next sentence that he said,

1096
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,880
which is great men are almost always bad men.

1097
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,480
And that is right.

1098
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,960
It is very difficult to find a great man in history

1099
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:33,080
who was not responsible for terrible things.

1100
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,920
I think there's some aspect of it that it's not just power.

1101
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,360
I think men who have been the most destructive

1102
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:47,360
in human history are not psychopathic completely.

1103
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,000
They have convinced themselves of an idea.

1104
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,600
It's like the idea of psychopathic.

1105
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,280
Stalin, for example, Hitler's a complicated one.

1106
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,520
I think he was legitimately insane,

1107
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,080
but I think Stalin has convinced himself

1108
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,040
that he's doing good.

1109
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,320
So the idea of communism is the thing that's psychopathic

1110
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,560
in his mind, like a bread.

1111
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,720
You construct a worldview in which the violence is justified,

1112
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,560
the cruelty is justified.

1113
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,440
So in that sense, first of all,

1114
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,280
you can construct experiments,

1115
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,200
unethical experiments that could test this,

1116
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,600
but in that sense, anybody else

1117
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,880
could have been in Stalin's position.

1118
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,880
It's the idea that could overtake the mind of a human being

1119
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,360
and in so doing justify cruel acts.

1120
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,160
And that seems to be at least in part unique to humans

1121
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,600
is the ability to hold ideas in our minds

1122
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,440
and share those ideas and use those ideas

1123
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,800
to convince ourselves that proactive violence

1124
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,160
on a large scale is a good idea.

1125
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,080
So that, I don't know if you have a comment.

1126
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,000
I suppose so, I mean, but it seems to me

1127
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,600
what really motivated Stalin

1128
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:09,600
was not so much communism as the retention of power.

1129
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,560
So once he became leader

1130
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,120
and in the process of becoming leader,

1131
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,720
he was absolutely desperate to get rid

1132
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,200
of anybody who was a challenger.

1133
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,120
He was deeply suspicious,

1134
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,800
suspicious of anybody, even on his side,

1135
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,280
who might possibly be showing a glimmerings

1136
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,080
of willingness to challenge him.

1137
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,080
So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,

1138
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,440
Kirov was a great communist,

1139
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,600
Trotsky was a great communist, all his rivals.

1140
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,360
And I mean, when he went into the towns

1141
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,240
and murdered people by the tens of thousands.

1142
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,240
They were all communists.

1143
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,680
A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.

1144
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,360
But what he was worried about was that they were rivals to him.

1145
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,120
I suppose the thought is,

1146
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,440
I am the best person to bring about

1147
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:15,000
a global sort of embrace of communism

1148
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,640
and others are not.

1149
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,760
And so we have to get rid of those others.

1150
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,720
Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,

1151
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,720
but I mean, maybe you know enough about Stalin to really...

1152
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,000
Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,

1153
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,440
is from my understanding and sense,

1154
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,240
of course we can't know for sure,

1155
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,720
is he believed in communism.

1156
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,840
This wasn't purely a game of power.

1157
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,320
Now he got drunk with power pretty quickly,

1158
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,360
but he really believed for,

1159
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,120
I believe his whole life that communism is good for the world.

1160
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,960
And that I don't know what role

1161
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,160
that belief plays with the more natural human desire for power.

1162
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,200
I don't know, but it just seems like...

1163
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,440
As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists

1164
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,520
on his journey.

1165
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:13,840
But it's not that doesn't,

1166
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,600
that calculus doesn't work that way.

1167
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,440
There's humans who are communists,

1168
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,920
and then there's the idea of communism.

1169
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,760
So for him, in his delusional worldview,

1170
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,320
killing a few people is worth the final result

1171
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,760
of bringing communism to the whole world.

1172
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,760
But it was more than that again,

1173
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,640
because I mean, he really wanted power for the Soviet Union.

1174
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:42,640
And so surely the reason that he orchestrated

1175
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,600
the export of wheat from Ukraine,

1176
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,600
and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation,

1177
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,720
was because he wanted to sell it on the market

1178
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,720
in order to be able to build up the power of the Soviet Union.

1179
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,320
You know, alternative view of communism might have been,

1180
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,920
well, let's just make sure everybody survives

1181
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,320
and make sure everybody has enough to eat.

1182
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,000
And we'll all be musically supportive

1183
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,680
in a communal network.

1184
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,200
But no, but he wanted the power for the country.

1185
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,360
Well, I guess exactly.

1186
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,360
So that it's not even communism,

1187
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,840
the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that.

1188
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,120
It's the country.

1189
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,520
I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power

1190
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,840
for the individual.

1191
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,440
It's power for a vision for this great nation,

1192
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,840
the Soviet Union.

1193
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:37,200
And similar with Hitler,

1194
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:42,320
the guy believed that this is a great nation, Germany.

1195
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,560
And like they, it's a nation that's been wronged

1196
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,960
throughout history and needs to be righted.

1197
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:54,440
And there's some dance between the individual human

1198
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,560
and the tribe.

1199
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:57,000
Yes, absolutely.

1200
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,800
Yes, and so just like chimpanzees,

1201
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,200
you know, we are fiercely tribal.

1202
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,200
And the tribalism resides particularly in male psychology.

1203
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,200
And it's very scary because once you assemble

1204
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:17,200
a set of males who share tribal identity,

1205
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,520
then they have power that they can exert

1206
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,840
with very little concern

1207
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,080
about what they're doing to damage other people.

1208
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,000
Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,

1209
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,200
we talked about the corrupting nature of power.

1210
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,720
Do you think that's a manifestation

1211
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,880
of those early origins of violence?

1212
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,080
What's the connection of this desire for power

1213
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,040
and our proclivity for violence?

1214
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,520
You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?

1215
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,960
Power on behalf of a group.

1216
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,800
Yes.

1217
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,080
And yeah, that seems to me to go right back

1218
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,560
to a deep evolutionary origin

1219
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,240
because you see essentially the same thing

1220
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,880
in a whole bunch of animals.

1221
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,040
That most of the sort of cognitively complex animals

1222
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,240
live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.

1223
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,560
And so what you see in chimpanzees

1224
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,840
is echoed in almost all of the primates.

1225
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:33,400
The difference between us and chimpanzees

1226
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,560
and humans on the one hand and other primates on the other

1227
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,320
is that we kill and they don't.

1228
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:42,920
And the reason they don't is because they never meet

1229
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:46,920
in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.

1230
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,840
So two groups of baboons, you know, there's 30 on this side

1231
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,600
and 50 on this side, fine.

1232
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,680
Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else

1233
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,600
because there's serious risks involved.

1234
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,200
But nevertheless, they are tribal.

1235
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,160
So, you know, they will have fairly intense

1236
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,680
intergroup interactions in which everybody knows

1237
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,600
whose side is on, who is on whose side.

1238
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,600
And the long-term consequences of winning those battles,

1239
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:23,360
non-lethal battles is that the dominance

1240
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,320
get access to larger areas of land,

1241
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,560
more safety and so on with chances are.

1242
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,560
Better record of reproductive success, subsequently.

1243
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,800
Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,

1244
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,320
is a feature or a bug,

1245
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:49,320
our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?

1246
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,080
So what's a bug?

1247
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,640
Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,

1248
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:02,640
meaning like it would be more beneficial.

1249
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,720
Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes

1250
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,160
from an evolutionary perspective?

1251
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,920
Yeah, yeah, but...

1252
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,040
What does it mean?

1253
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,160
What does a bug mean?

1254
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,200
Yes, right, I mean...

1255
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,400
Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?

1256
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,080
It's beneficial from, you know,

1257
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,800
it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved

1258
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,360
by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.

1259
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,840
But if by bug you mean something that,

1260
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,280
from the point of view of the species,

1261
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,600
it'd be great if you could just wipe this out,

1262
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,080
because the species would somehow do better as a result.

1263
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,480
Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.

1264
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Come on now, there's some nice things to males,

1265
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,120
speaking as a male.

1266
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,200
The fact that there are some nice things to males

1267
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,000
doesn't mean that they're not bugs.

1268
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,920
You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,

1269
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,400
but it would be much better for the species as a whole

1270
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,480
not to have to have males

1271
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,840
who impose this violence on the species as a whole.

1272
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,080
Yeah.

1273
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:05,160
As somebody who practiced controlled violence

1274
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,000
and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.

1275
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,040
It does seem kind of fun

1276
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,280
to have this kind of controlled violence, also sports.

1277
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,440
Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,

1278
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,560
I guess that's the deeper question.

1279
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,240
Don't you think there's some value to conflict

1280
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,760
for the improvement of society for progress,

1281
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,120
that this tension between tribes,

1282
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,280
isn't this like experiment,

1283
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,680
a continued experiment we conduct with each other

1284
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:40,240
and to figure out what is a better world to build?

1285
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,000
Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas

1286
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,520
to go to war with each other.

1287
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,680
It's like the United States with the 50 states

1288
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,720
and it's the laboratory of ideas.

1289
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:57,240
Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?

1290
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,040
This kind of conflict when it doesn't get out of hand

1291
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,040
is actually ultimately progressive,

1292
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,760
productive for a better world.

1293
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,160
Well, what do you mean by conflict?

1294
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,960
I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of

1295
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,040
people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.

1296
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,000
So their ideas are in conflict,

1297
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,560
they can sit down on a log and chat about it

1298
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,760
and then decide, okay, you're right,

1299
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,200
or I'm wrong or whatever.

1300
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,160
But if my conflict, you mean a great idea

1301
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,600
to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,

1302
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,720
then no, I don't see why it's a good idea

1303
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,080
to have all this violence.

1304
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,480
Yeah, there's...

1305
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:48,680
I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,

1306
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,960
but I wonder if human history would evolve

1307
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,520
the way it did without the violence.

1308
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,160
Oh, I'm sure you're right.

1309
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,160
Probably humans were not evolved in the sense that we have,

1310
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:04,160
but I would hope that the course of violence

1311
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,640
in evolution will continue in the way it has.

1312
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,040
So, there's all sorts of indications

1313
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:20,240
that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.

1314
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,400
And this is made famous in Stephen Pinker's book,

1315
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,080
but others have written about it too,

1316
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:33,160
that the frequency of death from violence

1317
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:37,080
in every country you look at has been declining.

1318
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:38,880
That's just great.

1319
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,480
And so, the amazing thing about this is that

1320
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,600
even when you take the death due to the First World War

1321
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,080
and the Second World War,

1322
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:50,320
the 20th century appears to have been statistically,

1323
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,960
meaning rates of death per individual,

1324
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,400
the least violent in history.

1325
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,280
So, we haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence,

1326
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,760
but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.

1327
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,760
I think it's ridiculous, frankly.

1328
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,200
Excuse my frankness, to say that violence is a good thing.

1329
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,840
I think that it would be a wonderful concept

1330
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,720
if we could evolve somehow to a world

1331
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,080
3,000 years from now,

1332
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,800
where violence is really regarded as simply appalling

1333
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,920
and that they look back on our time

1334
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,560
and can't believe what we were doing.

1335
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,760
Yeah, but of course violence takes a lot of different shapes

1336
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,360
as we start to think deeper and deeper

1337
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,280
about living beings on Earth.

1338
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,920
For example, the violence we commit

1339
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,960
and the torture we commit to animals.

1340
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,240
And then perhaps down the line,

1341
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,560
as we talked offline about, is with robots

1342
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:49,360
and that kind of thing.

1343
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,640
So, there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.

1344
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:56,040
And some people now talk about violence in the space of ideas,

1345
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,000
which of course, to me at least,

1346
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,280
is a bit of a silly notion relative

1347
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:04,040
to use that same V word for the space of ideas

1348
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,440
versus actual physical violence.

1349
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,000
But it may be that long time from now,

1350
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
we see that even violence in the space of ideas

1351
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,760
is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.

1352
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,520
And so, it is interesting where this is headed.

1353
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,080
And I think you're absolutely right.

1354
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:27,640
A world, a nonviolent world does seem like a better world.

1355
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:30,680
I wonder if the constraints on resources

1356
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,440
somehow make that world more and more difficult,

1357
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,200
especially as we run out of resources.

1358
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,480
It's got to be very, very different

1359
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,120
from what we're doing nowadays.

1360
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,920
And it's unimaginably different.

1361
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:41,840
If we could imagine it,

1362
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,680
then maybe we could work towards it at the moment.

1363
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,520
Nobody knows how to work towards it.

1364
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:47,000
Well, that's kind of the stories of humans

1365
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,680
as we don't really know the future.

1366
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:53,240
We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go

1367
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:57,080
and sometimes get into trouble as to violence.

1368
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:02,080
But George Orwell's vision in 1984 was of two or three

1369
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,680
world powers, each so powerful

1370
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,680
that nobody could diminish the, could destroy the other.

1371
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,000
But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship

1372
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
among heavily armed world powers just does not seem,

1373
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,280
as though it's reasonable at all.

1374
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,400
There's to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations in the world,

1375
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,560
dominated by a few big ones, all with arms

1376
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,240
pointing at each other.

1377
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,360
And the notion that we could just carry on

1378
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:49,280
having peace talks and making sure that these arms

1379
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:54,120
don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration

1380
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,000
seems incredibly optimistic.

1381
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,240
Some kind of major change has to happen,

1382
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:03,200
whereby, and some people wouldn't like to see

1383
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,160
all the weapons go, that'd be great.

1384
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,920
I'm a member of that sort of group

1385
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,680
that tries to see that happen.

1386
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,160
It's gonna be very difficult to see it happen.

1387
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,120
Another kind of concept is the nations themselves

1388
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:21,120
will dissolve and will become one government.

1389
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,760
That itself is a terrifying vision

1390
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:28,120
because the capacity for abuse by a single world power

1391
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,800
would be so problematic.

1392
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,520
And in addition, how do you get there

1393
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,200
without a war in the first place?

1394
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,120
So at the moment, we have no reasonable kind

1395
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,080
of future in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.

1396
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,640
It's just that we haven't yet to find it.

1397
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,080
And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space

1398
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,680
argue that you can create decentralized societies

1399
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,360
if you take away the power from states

1400
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,120
to define the monetary system.

1401
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,720
So they argue like, if you make the monetary system

1402
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,280
such that it's disjoint from the control

1403
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,960
of any one individual, any one government,

1404
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,680
then that might be a way to form sort of ad hoc,

1405
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,000
decentralized societies.

1406
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,840
They just pop up all over the place.

1407
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,920
That's a really interesting technological solution

1408
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,240
to how to remove the overreach of power

1409
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,080
from governments.

1410
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,040
Yes, right, absolutely.

1411
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:24,520
And it may well be that the future will emerge

1412
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,680
out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.

1413
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,200
Is it nevertheless surprising to you

1414
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,320
that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?

1415
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,520
So the mutually assured destruction

1416
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,480
that we've had for many decades

1417
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,800
from somebody who studies violence,

1418
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,280
how does that make sense to you?

1419
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:45,480
Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense

1420
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:50,000
that accidental, the fact that we have not had

1421
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,520
an accident yet has been quite remarkable.

1422
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,080
Because all the accounts are

1423
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,320
that we've come very close to having very serious accidents

1424
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:03,160
where people are either side of misread intentions

1425
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,320
or apparent launches and so on.

1426
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,680
So yes, I think it is remarkable.

1427
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:13,680
There is a nasty generalization that can be made

1428
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:19,160
that the longer that powerful states go

1429
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:23,500
without having wars, then the worse the war is afterwards.

1430
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,520
And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense

1431
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,120
because basically what's happening with these tribal groups

1432
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:37,120
that the nations are at the moment is that after a big war

1433
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,120
like the Second World War,

1434
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,200
they established new kinds of dominance relationships.

1435
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,800
And then during the periods of peace,

1436
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,800
what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships

1437
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,560
change because some nations become poorer,

1438
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,000
some become richer,

1439
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,600
some become more militarily powerful and so on.

1440
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:02,320
Generally economy and military goes hand in hand.

1441
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,560
So right now China emerged from the war

1442
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,560
as a relatively low status state and is now high status.

1443
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,040
So if this was chimpanzees,

1444
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,160
what would happen is that you would predict a conflict

1445
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,200
because you need to have a readjustment

1446
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,320
of the formal dominance relationships

1447
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,360
to recognize the new in-practice dominance relationships

1448
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:24,800
recognized by the economy and the military.

1449
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,280
So the longer that you have of a period of peace

1450
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,520
following a war,

1451
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,880
then the more these tensions of unresolved,

1452
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:37,200
changed dominance relationships build up.

1453
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,600
And the longer they take to occur,

1454
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,600
then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.

1455
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,480
That's a terrifying view

1456
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,520
because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.

1457
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,360
That's right.

1458
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,680
Maybe it's building up.

1459
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,560
So it's a scary view.

1460
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,080
But on the other hand,

1461
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:59,800
things have changed hugely with the advent of nuclear weapons

1462
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,800
because at least that conforms to this psychology

1463
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,800
that is very clear in other animals,

1464
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,880
which is you don't want to get into a fight

1465
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,160
if you are going to get hurt.

1466
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:15,760
So that's the whole principle of MAD, Mutual Assured Destruction.

1467
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,680
And it's doubtless being why powerful nations

1468
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,960
like America and Russia

1469
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:25,600
have not used their nuclear weapons since 1945.

1470
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:32,240
So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,

1471
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,360
then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology

1472
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,480
in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions

1473
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:42,600
without using them.

1474
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,520
But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.

1475
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,760
I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed

1476
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,240
because of the poor economy,

1477
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:57,240
but with China desperate to take back Taiwan

1478
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,560
and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,

1479
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,920
the potential for something going wrong

1480
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,200
is clearly very high.

1481
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,440
So what's the hopeful case that you can make

1482
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,840
for a long-term surviving and thriving human civilization

1483
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,120
given all the dangers that we face?

1484
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,200
Well, I can't really exactly make one.

1485
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:27,200
I would just say that we're talking about the dangers.

1486
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,920
Obviously the dangers are there.

1487
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,560
But what I would sort of think about is the notion

1488
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,560
that surprises come from all sorts of different directions.

1489
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,920
And I mean, you work in robotics

1490
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,760
and I can well imagine that there will be advances

1491
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,920
in robotics that in some way I can't even conceive

1492
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:57,920
will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.

1493
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,760
Something about, by the time chips have been planted

1494
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,600
in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information

1495
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,600
in a way that we never did before,

1496
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:12,040
will this change the nature of human existence

1497
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,120
in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?

1498
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,760
So remove the conflicts but keep some of the magic,

1499
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,640
the beauty of what it means to be human.

1500
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,560
So like still be able to enjoy life,

1501
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,720
the richness of life, the full complexity of life.

1502
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:28,360
Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill

1503
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,480
and then they go to sleep, right?

1504
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:35,480
You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.

1505
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,960
And so that's where you have to find the balance.

1506
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:43,000
Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff

1507
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,760
and so how it's gonna work out totally unclear.

1508
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,080
I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.

1509
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,920
I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.

1510
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,080
I think you really need to get rid of males

1511
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:05,080
cause males are the source of a major problem,

1512
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:10,680
which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.

1513
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,400
But you don't think the males are also source of beauty

1514
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,240
and creation?

1515
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:18,160
No, no, I mean, I don't have anything against males

1516
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:20,880
as individuals and that sort of thing.

1517
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,840
And males have clearly done a lot.

1518
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,080
I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative

1519
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:30,960
and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful

1520
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,160
and that sort of thing.

1521
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,320
On the other hand, I'm not sure there's anything

1522
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,880
particularly special and I think that probably females

1523
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:39,840
could do the same thing just as well

1524
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:40,960
when given the chance.

1525
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,320
Yes, including the dark stuff.

1526
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,000
I mean, a part of me is not understanding the,

1527
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,640
so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,

1528
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,760
but I tend to believe both men and women,

1529
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,680
if you look out into the future, it can be destructive,

1530
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,120
it can be evil, it can be greedy,

1531
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,040
it can be corrupted by power.

1532
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:03,680
So if you move males from the picture,

1533
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,520
which are historically connected to this evolution

1534
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,720
of that we've been talking about,

1535
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:11,960
that women are gonna fill that role quite nicely

1536
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,120
and then it'll be just the same kind of process,

1537
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,120
not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.

1538
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,440
There's a sense that the will to power, craving power,

1539
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,280
committing violence is somehow coupled

1540
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:32,640
with all the things that are beautiful about life,

1541
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,160
that if you remove conflict completely,

1542
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:37,800
if you remove all the evil in the world,

1543
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,800
it seems like you're not going to have a stable place

1544
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,520
for the beauty for the goodness.

1545
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,520
Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight for the way,

1546
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,200
if you look at human history,

1547
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,880
now you can say the reason I'm nervous

1548
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,400
about a sort of utopia where everything is great

1549
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,680
is every time you look through human history

1550
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,760
when the utopia has been chased,

1551
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,880
you run into a lot of trouble where again,

1552
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,720
sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.

1553
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,680
Now you can say that's a male problem,

1554
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,960
but I just think it's a human problem

1555
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,160
and it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too.

1556
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,600
It's life on earth problem, intelligent life

1557
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,600
on earth problem.

1558
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,600
So like it's better to not necessarily get rid

1559
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,640
of the sources of the darkest sides of human nature,

1560
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:38,160
but more create mechanisms that the kindness,

1561
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:41,840
the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,

1562
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,840
that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.

1563
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,760
Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia

1564
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,480
if you got rid of the males.

1565
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,320
Right.

1566
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,560
And certainly females capable of conflict.

1567
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,280
I just think it's a gamble worth taking

1568
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,880
if you could actually do it.

1569
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,120
You can certainly find females in history

1570
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:11,280
who've done unpleasant things, but nevertheless,

1571
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,480
we have a very strong evolutionary theory

1572
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,000
which explains why males benefit more

1573
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,560
by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.

1574
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:27,520
And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,

1575
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,040
yes.

1576
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,960
Then it would reduce it to get rid of males.

1577
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,120
Now I understand this is a fantasy.

1578
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:37,160
And I think it's a fantasy that people would be able

1579
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,560
to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology

1580
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,320
is getting to the point where it's quite likely

1581
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,320
that human females could breed without the use of males.

1582
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:55,560
And so there would be a sort of potential dynamic

1583
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,680
if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.

1584
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,760
It's a really interesting thought experiment.

1585
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,440
I will agree with you that if given two buttons,

1586
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,640
one is get rid of all women

1587
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,800
and the other buttons get rid of all men.

1588
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,680
Realizing that I have a stake in this choice,

1589
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:20,800
you're probably getting rid of all men.

1590
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,680
If I wanted to preserve earth

1591
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:28,440
and the richness of life on earth,

1592
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,280
I would probably get rid of all men.

1593
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:31,120
I don't know.

1594
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,680
I don't think you have a stake in it.

1595
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,960
I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.

1596
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:38,560
But I don't see why being a man

1597
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,400
should make you any more interested

1598
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,880
in having a male future for the world than a female future.

1599
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,640
You've got just as many ancestors who were male

1600
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,440
as were female.

1601
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,520
Well, my problem is I'll have to die.

1602
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,800
Well, that's gonna happen anyway.

1603
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:57,120
I know, but I prefer to die tomorrow and not today.

1604
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,560
I prefer to hit the snooze button

1605
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,840
on the whole mortality thing.

1606
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,800
But it's interesting.

1607
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,640
But this is not suggesting that males have to die

1608
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,880
in order to make room for females.

1609
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:11,480
All you have to do is just say,

1610
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:13,920
don't let's have any more males born.

1611
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,760
Interesting.

1612
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:18,240
Of course, the difficulty is that because we're tribal,

1613
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,080
some country, somewhere would say,

1614
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,680
well, we're not gonna do that.

1615
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,640
And then guess what?

1616
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,760
They'd take over because they're males.

1617
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,640
So that's why it's impossible to imagine actually happening.

1618
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,560
You know what?

1619
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,200
I'm gonna take that and actually think about it.

1620
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,040
I don't know.

1621
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,880
I'm uncomfortable.

1622
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:39,320
There's a certain kind of woke culture

1623
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,640
that I've been kind of uncomfortable with

1624
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,560
because it's not women necessarily.

1625
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,920
It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.

1626
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,920
There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness

1627
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,480
towards others that's created by that culture.

1628
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,240
So, but you're speaking about something else.

1629
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:00,240
You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world

1630
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:04,480
and looking at the basics of our human nature

1631
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:09,480
and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens

1632
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:14,520
and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature

1633
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,240
if we get rid of them, we'll make for a better world.

1634
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,240
It's an interesting thought experiment.

1635
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,720
But it is only a thought experiment.

1636
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:25,040
I mean, you know, it's got no practical meaning right now.

1637
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,360
And I take your point that, you know,

1638
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:32,520
males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways

1639
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,560
because the balance of social power

1640
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:43,680
is moving against, I mean, quite rightly

1641
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,160
in a strong sense, of course,

1642
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:50,080
against all the nasty things that males do.

1643
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:55,760
But what people sometimes fail to remember

1644
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,680
is that life is very hard for males

1645
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:05,720
who don't have the power, who don't have money,

1646
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,960
who don't have access to women.

1647
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,760
You know, I'm sympathetic to in cells.

1648
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,480
I'm not sympathetic to them using violence

1649
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,280
to solve their problems.

1650
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:25,280
But I am very sympathetic to the fact that it's not easy,

1651
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:30,360
simply to be told by well-off women

1652
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,520
and feminist middle-class people

1653
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,160
that you shouldn't behave like this

1654
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,400
or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.

1655
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,440
Yes, that's who you are.

1656
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:46,000
I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,

1657
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
male or female, I believe will be the thing

1658
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,440
that builds a better world.

1659
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:57,400
And that's practiced in different ways

1660
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,720
from different backgrounds.

1661
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,600
But ultimately, you should listen to others

1662
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,160
and empathize with the experience of others

1663
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,520
and put more love out there in the world.

1664
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,400
Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,

1665
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:15,320
reduce violence and reduce that whole psychological

1666
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,880
experience of being powerless in this world,

1667
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,560
powerless to become the best version of yourself.

1668
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,400
And that, you know-

1669
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,480
Well, no one's gonna disagree

1670
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,200
with all those fine sentiments, right?

1671
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:32,040
But that, yes, but that's an actionable thing,

1672
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:35,160
is actually practice empathy, right?

1673
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:40,120
Like saying that somebody should be silenced

1674
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,840
or just like, this group is bad and this group is good.

1675
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,400
I just feel like that's not empathy.

1676
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:50,400
Empathy is understanding the experience of others

1677
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
and respecting it.

1678
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,280
I mean, that's what a better world looks like.

1679
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,760
That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.

1680
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,720
It's like, as opposed to saying, my tribe is right,

1681
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:07,160
your tribe is wrong, forget the violence

1682
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,760
or non-violence part.

1683
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,200
That just that act of saying, my tribe is right,

1684
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,640
that tribe is wrong, removing that from the picture,

1685
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,760
that's the way to make a better world.

1686
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:18,360
Like that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.

1687
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,800
Not necessarily removing the people

1688
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,200
who are causing the violence.

1689
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,000
You have to get to the source of the problem.

1690
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,280
I don't mean the evolutionary source,

1691
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:32,280
but just the mindset that creates the violence

1692
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:36,000
is usually just a lack of empathy for others.

1693
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,520
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, you can't just teach that

1694
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:43,600
because our evolutionary psychology

1695
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,600
puts us in particular directions.

1696
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:48,680
So you don't think, do you think it's possible

1697
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:52,080
to learn through practice

1698
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,760
to resist the basics of our evolutionary psychology,

1699
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,960
the basic forces?

1700
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,840
Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training,

1701
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,960
you know, lots and lots of education can do it.

1702
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,240
The famously most peaceful society

1703
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,880
that anthropologists have recorded

1704
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:16,880
involves a tremendous amount of teaching,

1705
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,960
including some punishment.

1706
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,000
You know, it's a society in Thailand.

1707
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.

1708
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,840
So it's carrot and steak.

1709
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,360
You know, the point is that you do not find societies

1710
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:36,360
in which people are spontaneously showing the kinds of behaviors

1711
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:42,080
that we would all love them to show.

1712
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,360
It requires work.

1713
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,160
It requires work.

1714
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,000
What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?

1715
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,360
What are the main ideas in this book?

1716
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,360
Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes

1717
01:35:55,760 --> 01:36:00,480
in both in relationship to both violence and non-violence.

1718
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,240
And the violence is that we are one of these few animals

1719
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:08,920
in which we use coalitionary proactive violence

1720
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,720
to kill members of our own species.

1721
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,240
And we do it in large numbers,

1722
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:14,760
just like a few other species.

1723
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,960
And the non-violence is we're particularly extreme

1724
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,920
in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.

1725
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,760
And I told you the story of how we get there.

1726
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,680
You know, so what's so extraordinary about us

1727
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,000
is that most animals are either high on both

1728
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,480
or relatively low on both.

1729
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,400
So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence

1730
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,080
and reactive violence.

1731
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:44,280
Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,

1732
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,440
but still hundreds of times more

1733
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,960
reactively aggressive than humans are.

1734
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
What we've done is retain proactive violence being high

1735
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,280
and got reactive violence really being low.

1736
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,240
And so we have these wonderful societies

1737
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,840
in which we're also incredibly nice to each other

1738
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,120
and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers

1739
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:12,120
and have no problem about leading to any kind of conflict

1740
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,320
at the same time as we are one of the worst

1741
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,920
killing machine species that's ever existed.

1742
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,320
So what's so extraordinary about this is that

1743
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,960
if you look at the political philosophers

1744
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,000
of the last few hundred years,

1745
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,960
you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes

1746
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:35,320
and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

1747
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,280
or literally you got the fight between their followers.

1748
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,840
You know, so the followers of Hobbes say,

1749
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,920
well, Hobbes was right because he says

1750
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,440
that we are naturally violent and you need a Leviathan

1751
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,360
or sort of central government or a king

1752
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,760
to be able to suppress the violence.

1753
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,920
So we're naturally horrid and we can learn to be good.

1754
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,280
Whereas Jean-Jacques Rousseau is interpreted

1755
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,400
as saying the opposite, that we are naturally good

1756
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,480
and it's only when culture intervenes

1757
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:08,400
and horrid ideologies come in that we become uncivilized.

1758
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,960
And so people have had this endless fight

1759
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,760
between are we naturally corrupt

1760
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,560
or are we naturally kind?

1761
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,760
And that has gone on for years

1762
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,080
and it's only in the last two or three decades

1763
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,280
that anthropologists like Christopher Bohm

1764
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,400
and Bruce Naft have said, look, you know,

1765
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,720
it's obvious what the answer is,

1766
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:30,440
we are both of these things.

1767
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:33,440
And what is so exciting now is I think we can understand

1768
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,920
why we are both.

1769
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:38,280
And the answer is we come from ancestors

1770
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,760
that were elevated on proactive aggression,

1771
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,760
that were hunters and killers,

1772
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,560
both of animals and of each other.

1773
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,120
And you've got to include that

1774
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:52,920
as almost certain from the past.

1775
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,920
And then now we've taken our reactive aggression

1776
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,560
and we've down-regulated it and that's given us power.

1777
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,840
It's given us power because once you get rid

1778
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,600
of the alpha male, once the beta males take over

1779
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:13,400
and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,

1780
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:17,120
less reactively aggressive individual,

1781
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:22,040
the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable

1782
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:25,000
of focusing on things other than conflict.

1783
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,920
And so we have social groups in which individuals,

1784
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:31,000
instead of constantly being on edge

1785
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,400
in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,

1786
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,560
are able to interact in ways

1787
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,800
that enable them to share looking at a tool together

1788
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,080
or share their food together

1789
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,280
or pass ideas from one to the other

1790
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,600
or support each other when they're ill

1791
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,720
or whatever the issue is,

1792
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:56,160
cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.

1793
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,440
So you asked earlier, what did I think about

1794
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,720
why sapiens were able to expand

1795
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:04,280
at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically

1796
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,720
around 40,000 years ago?

1797
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:11,280
And the answer is that whatever it was,

1798
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,480
it had something to do with the sapiens' ability

1799
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,120
to cooperate.

1800
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,280
That was what gave them bigger groups.

1801
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:23,280
That's what enabled them to have a far more effective way

1802
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,240
of living and I suspect it was to do with the weapons

1803
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:29,960
and military aspects, but even if it wasn't that,

1804
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:35,040
that the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing

1805
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,920
would have been hugely important.

1806
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,480
So sapiens then had groups of,

1807
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,120
who knows exactly how big they were,

1808
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:47,120
but scores of people to judge from their remains,

1809
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:52,880
whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated

1810
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,880
small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,

1811
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,840
where they saw others so rarely

1812
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,960
that they were in breeding at high levels.

1813
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,240
Fathers having babies with their daughters.

1814
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,800
Very different world.

1815
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,640
Very different world.

1816
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:12,320
And that's probably what our world was like

1817
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,680
before we got sapiens.

1818
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,040
Before we got sapiens.

1819
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,360
And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence

1820
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:23,360
against, once you get rid of the alpha males,

1821
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:29,440
you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta,

1822
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,320
the beta males, not kindness,

1823
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,520
but collaboration as the better word.

1824
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,560
Yes, much more cooperation,

1825
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,960
not just among the males, among the beta males,

1826
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,800
but also among the gamma males and the females.

1827
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,640
Yeah.

1828
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,920
I don't know what a gamma male is,

1829
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,560
but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.

1830
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,800
Well, I don't know about hell alphabet,

1831
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,440
but I think the big layers of the married men

1832
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,040
and the unmarried men,

1833
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:59,000
because the married men had a problem with the unmarried men.

1834
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,240
I mean, you see it in ethnographies

1835
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,320
of hunters and gatherers recently,

1836
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:07,160
where the unmarried men would be given rules, such as,

1837
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:10,840
I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia was,

1838
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,760
you cannot come to the camp for months.

1839
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,320
You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush,

1840
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:20,040
because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.

1841
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:23,000
And then another kind of rule is,

1842
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,080
if you are in the camp,

1843
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,760
you must be in the firelight all the time.

1844
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,840
Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.

1845
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,960
So you really have us to control them,

1846
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,960
because the men who had lots of wives

1847
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,360
did not want those horrid bachelors sneaking around the place.

1848
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:41,200
I love this.

1849
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:43,960
You also wrote the book titled,

1850
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,600
Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human.

1851
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,720
What's the central idea in this book?

1852
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:52,560
There's some title, How Cooking Made Us Human,

1853
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,360
refers not to homo sapiens, but to homo erectus.

1854
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:59,000
So human there means the genus Homo.

1855
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
And homo erectus is the first full member of the genus Homo

1856
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,760
in the sense that it looked like us,

1857
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:12,200
just with a sort of slightly more robust build

1858
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,160
and a smaller brain.

1859
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,400
And the central idea of catching fire

1860
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:22,120
is that it was the control of fire

1861
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:27,240
that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus

1862
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:30,800
and therefore the genus Homo,

1863
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,040
which happened two million years ago.

1864
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:38,040
And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.

1865
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:46,400
And Australopithecines are the creatures

1866
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,360
from whom we evolved.

1867
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,880
They were present in Africa

1868
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:57,080
from something like six or seven million years ago

1869
01:43:57,080 --> 01:44:01,560
up to, actually up to one million years ago.

1870
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:06,400
And then a branch led off to Homo around two million years ago.

1871
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:10,120
And the way to think of Australopithecines

1872
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:14,080
is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.

1873
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:17,080
So they were erect bipedal walkers.

1874
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,320
They were like chimpanzees in the sense that

1875
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:24,840
they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.

1876
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:27,840
They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,

1877
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,840
a little bit smaller actually.

1878
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:36,840
And they had big jaws because they were still eating raw food.

1879
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,320
They had big teeth and big jaws.

1880
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,320
And then around two million years ago,

1881
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,320
the line of Australopithecines,

1882
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,160
which ended with an intermediate species,

1883
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,440
a kind of missing link area,

1884
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:53,080
because it is not missing, called habilis,

1885
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,600
sometimes called Homo habilis,

1886
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,160
but more properly, in my view,

1887
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:58,160
called Australopithecus habilis.

1888
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:02,520
That gave rise to Homo erectus.

1889
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:06,080
And Homo erectus, here's how different it was.

1890
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:11,080
It had a smaller mouth, a smaller jaw,

1891
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:16,600
smaller teeth, and to judge from its ribs and pelvis,

1892
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,080
smaller gut.

1893
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:23,080
In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had,

1894
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:27,080
which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.

1895
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:31,080
And that meant that Homo erectus must have slept on the ground.

1896
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:34,080
And since it slept on the ground,

1897
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,080
it should have been able to defend itself somehow

1898
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,080
against predators.

1899
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:39,080
And I can't think of any way they could have done that,

1900
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,080
unless they had fire.

1901
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:50,080
So there are two major clues to why it was with Homo erectus

1902
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,080
that our ancestors first acquired the control of fire.

1903
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,080
One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees

1904
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,080
in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos

1905
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:04,080
and all the other primates do.

1906
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:11,080
And the other is that there was this striking reduction

1907
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:15,080
throughout the gut, reduction in size of the mouth

1908
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:19,080
and the chewing apparatus and in the gut itself.

1909
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:24,080
And that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,

1910
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:28,080
which is that our guts are about two-thirds of the size

1911
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:31,080
of what they would be if we ate raw food

1912
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:35,080
to judge by the great apes.

1913
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:39,080
So at some point in our evolution,

1914
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:45,080
we acquired the skill of cooking and skill of controlling fire.

1915
01:46:45,080 --> 01:46:50,080
At no time between two million years ago and the present

1916
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:53,080
do we see any changes in our anatomy

1917
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:59,080
that can, as it were, justify the enormous change

1918
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:03,080
that happens when you are an animal that learns to control fire.

1919
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:07,080
But at two million years ago, we have exactly what you'd expect.

1920
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:11,080
Namely, the gut's becoming smaller because the food is becoming softer

1921
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:13,080
and much more easy to digest,

1922
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:17,080
so you don't have to work so hard in your body to digest it.

1923
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:21,080
And, as I say, commitment to sleeping on the ground,

1924
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:25,080
which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays

1925
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,080
on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti

1926
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,080
unless you had fire.

1927
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:35,080
I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa in the bush

1928
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:40,080
and you will not catch me just lying on the ground

1929
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:44,080
in an area with lots of predators unless I got a fire with me.

1930
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,080
You're going to get eaten.

1931
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:49,080
You're going to get terrified and you're going to get eaten.

1932
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:52,080
Okay, so there's a million questions I want to ask.

1933
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,080
The one, is it very naturally coupled,

1934
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:59,080
the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?

1935
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:01,080
Is that an obvious leap?

1936
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:03,080
Well, here's what we know.

1937
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:06,080
We know that all the animals that we've tested

1938
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:10,080
like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.

1939
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,080
So this is true for all the great apes.

1940
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,080
We've tested them.

1941
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,080
That's fascinating, by the way.

1942
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,080
Why is that?

1943
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:21,080
That's just like a property of food, I suppose.

1944
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:24,080
Yes, I think what it is is that

1945
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,080
animals are always looking for any kind of way

1946
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,080
to get food that is easier to digest.

1947
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,080
And there are various signals in the food,

1948
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,080
such as the amount of sugar there,

1949
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:38,080
the amount of free amino acids,

1950
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:42,080
because the amino acids can be tasted.

1951
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,080
And the physical qualities of the food be particularly important,

1952
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,080
how tough their food is.

1953
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:54,080
They prefer softer food, provided it feels safe, tastes safe.

1954
01:48:54,080 --> 01:49:01,080
And these kinds of sensory cues are all there in cooked food.

1955
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:05,080
It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins,

1956
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,080
it's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.

1957
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:12,080
So everyone loves it spontaneously.

1958
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,080
Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or raw food.

1959
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,080
Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence of domestication.

1960
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:20,080
But even, as I say, all of the great apes,

1961
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:25,080
you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked, if they can.

1962
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:28,080
So then, obviously, once you have fire,

1963
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,080
you're going to accidentally discover that food changes

1964
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,080
when you apply fire to it,

1965
01:49:33,080 --> 01:49:37,080
and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad.

1966
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,080
You took the words out of my mouth.

1967
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:43,080
If they have fire at all and their food rolls into it,

1968
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:46,080
five minutes later, it tastes better than before.

1969
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:50,080
How big of an invention, from an engineering perspective,

1970
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,080
do you think is the discovery of fire?

1971
01:49:53,080 --> 01:50:00,080
Do you think for the, for Homo erectus, Homo sapiens,

1972
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,080
do you think it's the greatest invention ever?

1973
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,080
Yeah.

1974
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:12,080
I think that the control of fire has been ultimately responsible

1975
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:17,080
for essentially how grandiose do I want to be here?

1976
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:21,080
You know, the entire human story going back to Homo

1977
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:26,080
is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.

1978
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:31,080
And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely to have changed us

1979
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:37,080
is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain.

1980
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:47,080
So, you know, the story here is that the constraints on brain size are energetic.

1981
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:57,080
You and I have brains that are something like 2.5% of our body weight.

1982
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:03,080
It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.

1983
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:05,080
So it's disproportionate.

1984
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:11,080
There are other expensive organs in our body as well, such as the heart.

1985
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:18,080
And what's different about the brain is that in addition to us being able to fuel it

1986
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:24,080
in a way that other animals can't, we also have reasons for wanting to have an even bigger brain,

1987
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,080
whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.

1988
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,080
So what those reasons are is unclear.

1989
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:36,080
But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,

1990
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:42,080
cooking makes it possible because it's supplying more calories

1991
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:48,080
and it is enormously reducing the amount of time that it takes to chew your food.

1992
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:53,080
So if you were a gorilla and you wanted to have a bigger brain,

1993
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:56,080
you might say, OK, well, let's just eat some more.

1994
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:02,080
But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day

1995
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:09,080
in the sense that they're eating for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.

1996
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:11,080
That's just chewing.

1997
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,080
And then they've got to sit around and digest their food

1998
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,080
because they can't just eat all the time.

1999
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:21,080
They've got to take a break while the food is digested in the stomach

2000
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:23,080
and then passed into the gut.

2001
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:26,080
So the stomach is already full.

2002
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:30,080
So basically gorillas are eating about the maximum rate already.

2003
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:33,080
So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?

2004
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:34,080
It doesn't.

2005
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:38,080
It's actually got a smaller brain relative to its body size than chimpanzee does.

2006
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:44,080
And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.

2007
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,080
Then you come along and cook.

2008
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:51,080
And all of a sudden you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.

2009
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:56,080
You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.

2010
01:52:56,080 --> 01:53:03,080
There are 25 bodily processes or more that are involved in digesting your food,

2011
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:07,080
making the acid that takes the proteins apart,

2012
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:14,080
maintaining the brush border where the molecules are taken across the gut wall and so on.

2013
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,080
That all costs.

2014
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,080
It costs you to digest your food.

2015
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,080
It costs less if you cook your food.

2016
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,080
That's the net gain in the amount of energy.

2017
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:29,080
And you are reducing the amount of time from, in our case of our ancestors,

2018
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:36,080
probably around 50% of the day chewing to nowadays one hour a day chewing.

2019
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:40,080
So all of a sudden you've got hours a day in which to do other things,

2020
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:44,080
to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow.

2021
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:48,080
So with Homo erectus, you start the process of getting a bigger brain

2022
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:52,080
and famously throughout the whole period of the evolution of the genus Homo,

2023
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:57,080
you have a steadily increasing size of brain.

2024
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:02,080
Until right at the end when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story.

2025
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:04,080
Which end is this?

2026
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,080
Are we talking about Homo sapiens?

2027
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:11,080
Yeah, with Homo sapiens you've got a smaller brain from,

2028
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:17,080
people haven't got it exactly down, but at least 30,000 years ago it starts declining.

2029
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:22,080
And so the fascinating thing about that is that all domesticated animals

2030
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,080
have smaller brains than their wild ancestors.

2031
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:34,080
The domestication is intricately connected to this brain size, you think.

2032
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,080
Exactly.

2033
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:40,080
So I think what we're seeing in humans is that same manifestation.

2034
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:43,080
And then the fascinating question is why.

2035
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:48,080
And the only point I would want to make about this is that there's no evidence

2036
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:55,080
that in the small brain domesticates, they're losing say an average of about 15% of brain size,

2037
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:58,080
in the small brain domesticates compared to their wild ancestors,

2038
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:03,080
there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability.

2039
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:08,080
So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain,

2040
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:13,080
it's a more pedomorphic brain looking like the juveniles of the ancestor,

2041
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:19,080
but just as our kids are very smart and can learn amazing things compared to adults,

2042
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:25,080
all they lack is wisdom and maturity, but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.

2043
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:29,080
And I think that's the same with domesticated animals compared to their wild ancestors,

2044
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:36,080
and probably therefore with Homo sapiens say 30,000 years ago compared to their ancestors.

2045
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:39,080
So we have smaller brains than the underdogs.

2046
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:43,080
Size, Richard, isn't everything.

2047
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,080
Exactly.

2048
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:49,080
What's the connection between fire, cooking, and the eating of meat?

2049
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:56,080
Which came first, do you think, humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat

2050
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:01,080
or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?

2051
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:04,080
I think that fire increased the use of meat.

2052
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:13,080
But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt and kill meat, as do bonobos,

2053
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:15,080
certainly puts us in...

2054
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:20,080
So those two species have a common ancestor with us going six, seven million years ago,

2055
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:24,080
and it was from that common ancestor that you get the Australopithecine line.

2056
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:28,080
It's very likely therefore Australopithecines were eating meat when they could get it,

2057
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:32,080
which wouldn't be very often because they wouldn't be very good sprinters,

2058
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:35,080
but nevertheless they would occasionally be able to get some meat,

2059
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,080
and I bet they loved it all the time.

2060
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:41,080
And basically all primates like meat if they can get it, almost all of them.

2061
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:48,080
But I think fire would have been very important for a couple of reasons.

2062
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:55,080
One is that once you eat your food cooked, then you're saving yourself time.

2063
01:56:55,080 --> 01:57:03,080
By saving yourself time, you can free up the opportunity to go and hunt more

2064
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:07,080
because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.

2065
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:13,080
There's every risk that you will get nothing on one particular afternoon that you go off

2066
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:16,080
looking for opportunities to kill.

2067
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:22,080
But it's high gain because when you do get something, you bring down a kudu,

2068
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:26,080
and you've got a serious amount of meat.

2069
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:32,080
What did males and females do with the time they were saving from not having to chew their food?

2070
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:36,080
I think that in the case of males, it's very reasonable to think,

2071
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:39,080
they spent a greatly increased amount of time hunting.

2072
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:44,080
So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,

2073
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:47,080
and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.

2074
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:53,080
With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,

2075
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:55,080
and the average hunt length is six hours.

2076
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:57,080
So it's a huge difference.

2077
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:01,080
And that's possible because the time was available because they were cooking.

2078
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:03,080
Less chewing, more hunting.

2079
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:05,080
You got it.

2080
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:11,080
The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.

2081
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:14,080
So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,

2082
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:17,080
and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.

2083
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:20,080
They are so excited about going into the hunt,

2084
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:24,080
and when they make the kill, then there's screams everywhere,

2085
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:29,080
and some try to seize it and capture it and take it away from the others,

2086
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:32,080
and eventually the strongest one has it,

2087
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:36,080
and the others sit around begging and trying to get some and tear it off,

2088
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:38,080
and so they all love it.

2089
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,080
There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree

2090
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:44,080
in order to be able to get away from all of these beggars and scavengers,

2091
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:50,080
and while he's there, he drops of blood or little scraps full time to the bottom,

2092
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:55,080
and the junior members of society, you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,

2093
01:58:55,080 --> 01:59:00,080
they are racing through to find a particular leaf that's got to drop a blood on it

2094
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:01,080
so they can lick it.

2095
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,080
I mean, they love it.

2096
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:08,080
But it takes them a lot of time to chew it.

2097
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:11,080
I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.

2098
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:16,080
So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,

2099
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:19,080
and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,

2100
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:22,080
I've had enough of this, I need real food,

2101
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,080
and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again,

2102
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:32,080
because they can get fruit into their bodies so much faster than they can get meat.

2103
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:35,080
So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,

2104
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,080
and they can eat the meat so just much more readily.

2105
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:42,080
So I think that mediating would become important for two reasons with cooking.

2106
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,080
So the key, not to oversimplify, but the key moments in human history

2107
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:55,080
are with the Homo erectus, the discovery of fire and the use of fire for cooking,

2108
01:59:55,080 --> 02:00:02,080
and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males killing off the alpha males

2109
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:07,080
so that the cooperation can exist and cooperation leads to communication

2110
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:11,080
and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas, that kind of thing.

2111
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:16,080
Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that is that you have to ask,

2112
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:21,080
how is it that the beta males were able to kill the alpha male?

2113
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:28,080
And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males within their own group sometimes,

2114
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:31,080
it's not a process of killing the alpha male.

2115
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:36,080
It's taking advantage of opportunity when some male gets into a bad position,

2116
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:39,080
but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.

2117
02:00:39,080 --> 02:00:42,080
And you can see why, because they don't have language.

2118
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:48,080
And without language, it's very difficult to know how confident you can be

2119
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:53,080
of the support of others against a particular individual within your own group.

2120
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:57,080
When you're attacking someone from another group, that problem is solved.

2121
02:00:57,080 --> 02:01:01,080
We all hate those guys.

2122
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:06,080
But the alpha male has got alliances within his group.

2123
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:11,080
Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.

2124
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:15,080
Some of them might be harboring deep feelings of resentment.

2125
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:18,080
But how does anyone else know that?

2126
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:23,080
So in other words, I think that you have to have some kind of language that is pretty good

2127
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:31,080
to solve the problems of gaining confidence that five of you say,

2128
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:38,080
or some number, can trust each other in this final attack.

2129
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:42,080
And even nowadays, it's difficult.

2130
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:44,080
You mentioned Stalin.

2131
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:48,080
It's like, why was everybody terrified?

2132
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,080
Any dictator that takes control?

2133
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:55,080
Why is all of us as individuals terrified when you know there's millions of us?

2134
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,080
That's right.

2135
02:01:57,080 --> 02:02:04,080
And so like that, we lack the language because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.

2136
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,080
Like, who can we talk to?

2137
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,080
Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?

2138
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:09,080
Exactly.

2139
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,080
That's right.

2140
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:16,080
But do you have this intuition that some kind of language was developing

2141
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:20,080
along with this process of beta males taking over?

2142
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,080
Yes.

2143
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:27,080
Once you have sufficient language to be able to have the beta males conspiring to kill the alpha male,

2144
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:34,080
then you have selection in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.

2145
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:39,080
And at that point, there will be increased ability to communicate

2146
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:42,080
and the language will get richer and better and better.

2147
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,080
So yes, absolutely.

2148
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:48,080
Positive feedback loop once you get the situation started.

2149
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:56,080
Can you maybe comment on the full complexity and richness of the human mind through this process?

2150
02:02:56,080 --> 02:03:06,080
Casually saying cooking fire and beta males leading to cooperation.

2151
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:10,080
But how does the beauty of the human mind emerge from all of this?

2152
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,080
Is there other further steps we need to understand?

2153
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:21,080
Or is it as simple as this language emerging from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?

2154
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:25,080
Or am I also over romanticizing how amazing the human mind is?

2155
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:33,080
Is it just like one small step in a long journey of evolution?

2156
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:48,080
Well, if the beauty of the human mind is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore,

2157
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,080
that's one kind of beauty.

2158
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:56,080
Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.

2159
02:03:56,080 --> 02:04:03,080
And we think of that as beautiful because it is a kind of rare and special ability

2160
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:14,080
compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness that can commonly predominate.

2161
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:22,080
I suppose we have to think of different sources for those two types.

2162
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:29,080
I suppose a general answer is that there has been selection in favor of bigger brains

2163
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:34,080
which probably in general has been associated with increasing cognitive ability.

2164
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:41,080
And as that has happened, the complexity of life has increased

2165
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:48,080
because people have more and more complex, highly differentiated strategies

2166
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:53,080
in response to each other's more complex, highly differentiated strategies.

2167
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:57,080
We get to a point where there is deception and self-deception.

2168
02:04:57,080 --> 02:05:07,080
There is a manipulation of ideas through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.

2169
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:22,080
I guess all I'm wanting to say is that there is a world of the mind that evolves in response

2170
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:28,080
to these platforms that are put there, the platform of increasing brain size

2171
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:33,080
and therefore cognitive ability made possible by increased energy supply.

2172
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:42,080
The platform of cooperation and tolerance in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict

2173
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:49,080
and therefore a need to respond to the conflict and manipulate your eyes appropriately.

2174
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:55,080
I don't see either kind of beauty as coming totally independently of these things.

2175
02:05:55,080 --> 02:06:02,080
I don't think there is a selection for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.

2176
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:10,080
But I guess sexual selection, males wanting to impress females in different ways

2177
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:18,080
will lead to them wanting to show off in all the different ways.

2178
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:23,080
All of these are natural consequences of just coming up with strategies

2179
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:27,080
of how to cooperate and how to achieve certain ends.

2180
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:35,080
We haven't spoken about sexual selection, but that is a really important part of it.

2181
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:43,080
They are trying to out-compete each other normally without any physical conflict

2182
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:47,080
just in order to be able to be chosen by mates of the opposite sex.

2183
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:53,080
That is certainly a major source of creativity.

2184
02:06:53,080 --> 02:06:59,080
You've studied chimps, you also all the other relatives, gorillas.

2185
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:03,080
What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps, about gorillas, about humans?

2186
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:10,080
Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary, that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.

2187
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:15,080
How are we related? What is the common ancestor? What are the interesting differences?

2188
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:22,080
I know I'm asking a million questions, but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,

2189
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:29,080
and humans like how we're related and what you find fascinating about each?

2190
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:40,080
In Africa, straddling the equator, there is a strip of rainforest that relies on the combination

2191
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:46,080
of high temperatures and rainfall that you get around the equator.

2192
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:55,080
That rainforest goes into about 22 countries, and throughout those countries you have chimpanzees,

2193
02:07:55,080 --> 02:07:58,080
although they've gone extinct in two of them.

2194
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:10,080
In just a fraction of them, five countries, you've got gorillas, where there are mountains,

2195
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:17,080
and in one country, on the left bank of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.

2196
02:08:17,080 --> 02:08:23,080
In the African forest, you've got these three African apes, the only African apes,

2197
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:30,080
all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.

2198
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:39,080
They walk on their knuckles through the forest looking for fruit trees and eating herbs when they can't find fruits.

2199
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:51,080
Gorillas represent the oldest chain, so about 10 million years ago, maybe as recently as 8 million years ago,

2200
02:08:51,080 --> 02:08:57,080
the ancestor of gorillas broke off from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.

2201
02:08:57,080 --> 02:09:04,080
They've probably remained very similar now to what they were then.

2202
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:18,080
They were probably the largest apes living in montane areas and spending more time eating just herbs, stems,

2203
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:22,080
not so vitally dependent on fruit.

2204
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:36,080
And living in, if it was like the present, groups up to about 50 stable groups with one alpha male who was in charge.

2205
02:09:36,080 --> 02:09:47,080
Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive compared to chimps and bonobos.

2206
02:09:47,080 --> 02:10:00,080
I had the privilege of spending a week or two with gorillas at Diane Fossey's camp before she was murdered.

2207
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:09,080
And I went out with two women, Kelly and Barb, to a particular group.

2208
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:18,080
And there was a young female in the group called Simba, and Simba approached us and stared at the two women.

2209
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:30,080
And then she came towards me and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles and touched me on the forehead.

2210
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:38,080
She was watched in doing this by a young male who was quite keen on her and he was called Digit.

2211
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:44,080
And about five minutes later Digit stood in front of us on the path.

2212
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:50,080
And Kelly was in front of me and then there was Barb and then there was me.

2213
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:56,080
And he came charging down the path and he sidestepped around Kelly and he sidestepped around Barb.

2214
02:10:56,080 --> 02:11:05,080
And me, he just knocked with his arm and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.

2215
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:09,080
And I loved the way that that was a very deliberate response.

2216
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:14,080
And I loved the way that Simba had been so interested in me and held my eye.

2217
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:17,080
Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye.

2218
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:24,080
But gorillas really look as though they're trying to sort of figure out, what are you thinking about?

2219
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:30,080
That was a species that goes back for something like 10 million years.

2220
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:35,080
In that situation, was there a game being played?

2221
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:40,080
Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me, I don't want you messing with Simba.

2222
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:43,080
But was Simba using you?

2223
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:46,080
Oh, I see. Well, that's a fun idea.

2224
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:53,080
I don't see why she should be using me, but you mean testing how strongly Digit was prepared to interview?

2225
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:54,080
Yeah, exactly.

2226
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:58,080
Oh, that's come straight out of a sort of adolescent to high school playbook.

2227
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:00,080
All right. Well, that's all.

2228
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:02,080
No, there's nothing wrong with it for that.

2229
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:07,080
I never thought of that and you never know.

2230
02:12:07,080 --> 02:12:09,080
It's possible.

2231
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:17,080
So, yeah, okay, so this is an ancient branch of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla that led to gorillas.

2232
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:18,080
Gorillas.

2233
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:27,080
So then the next thing that happened on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago when you have the line

2234
02:12:28,080 --> 02:12:34,080
between chimps and bonobos on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.

2235
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:41,080
And basically what happened is that at that point, a chimplike ancestor leaves the forest,

2236
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:47,080
gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts and that becomes the Australopithecines.

2237
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:53,080
And meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor continues in the forest.

2238
02:12:53,080 --> 02:13:01,080
And later what happens is that one branch of that crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.

2239
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:05,080
That was only about two million years ago, maybe one million years ago.

2240
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:13,080
Now, the chimps that remained in the forest for this time and occupied all the countries across from West to East Africa now.

2241
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:21,080
Again, we assume that they're pretty similar to the ones that live nowadays where there's some variation from West to East.

2242
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:29,080
And these are animals that live in social communities of between say 20 and 200.

2243
02:13:29,080 --> 02:13:35,080
They have a lot of them in one group, but they never come together in a single unit.

2244
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:45,080
These are, they share an area, a community territory and that area is defended by males and within it females wander and bring up their young independently.

2245
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:55,080
And the females are very scared about the possibility that males will be mean to their infants.

2246
02:13:55,080 --> 02:14:04,080
And in order to avoid them doing that, they do their best to mate with every single male in the group multiple times.

2247
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:10,080
As if to give a memory in that male of, yeah, yeah, I reminded you, so I'm not going to be mean to your baby.

2248
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:12,080
So what's wonderful about chimps?

2249
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:19,080
Well, you know, as we've spoken about them, you know, they are creative and sort of amazingly human like.

2250
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:25,080
But I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments and here's one.

2251
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:33,080
I've got two chimps who are grooming each other on a day when they are utterly exhausted.

2252
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:39,080
They've walked 11 kilometers the day before up and down hills.

2253
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:45,080
And on this particular day, all they do is they get to one tree and they eat from that tree.

2254
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:52,080
And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.

2255
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:54,080
So they're utterly exhausted.

2256
02:14:54,080 --> 02:14:59,080
And they're just eating nonstop because they're trying to recover their energy.

2257
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:02,080
And this is Hugh and Charlie.

2258
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:08,080
And we think they were probably brothers that we never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.

2259
02:15:08,080 --> 02:15:22,080
Well, I never remember now who it is, but let's say that they both come down from the tree and they're both carrying branches of the food.

2260
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:24,080
Everything actually seeds from these branches.

2261
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:33,080
They're both engaged even in the midday sun when they want to come down and shade themselves for a bit on the ground.

2262
02:15:33,080 --> 02:15:35,080
They're still eating.

2263
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:42,080
Then Charlie finishes his branch and he starts grooming Hugh.

2264
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:49,080
And Hugh continues eating from his branch.

2265
02:15:49,080 --> 02:16:01,080
Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes and he reaches out and he lifts the branch from which Hugh is still taking seeds

2266
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:08,080
and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back as far as possible away from Hugh.

2267
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:10,080
Hugh doesn't do anything.

2268
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:15,080
He just finishes his mouthful and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.

2269
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:19,080
So this very polite way of saying, will you groom me please has worked.

2270
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:33,080
Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back and around to the right side and then down his arm to what point where he can reach the branch again.

2271
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:36,080
And then he picks up the branch and continues.

2272
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,080
Not sure, aren't they?

2273
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,080
Right.

2274
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:39,080
Yeah.

2275
02:16:39,080 --> 02:16:47,080
So in other words, they have a very sort of simple little strategy, but it just shows the courtesy with which they can treat each other.

2276
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:58,080
And the days I love with chimps are when you see that sort of thing or when you see mothers just lying in a sunlit patch in the forest with their babies bouncing on top of them,

2277
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:01,080
just having a wonderful, peaceful time.

2278
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:06,080
And that's what most of their lives are like.

2279
02:17:06,080 --> 02:17:16,080
So chimpanzees are the species that kind of unites the rest of the apes because a gorilla is in many ways just a big version of a chimpanzee.

2280
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:22,080
If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.

2281
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:35,080
And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee, but obviously humans didn't domesticate them, so they're self-domesticated.

2282
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:44,080
They are less aggressive and they show all the marks of domestication that domesticated animals do compared to wild animals in their bones.

2283
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:49,080
So they have reduced differences between males and females in which the males are more like females.

2284
02:17:49,080 --> 02:17:50,080
They have smaller brains.

2285
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:55,080
They have shorter faces, smaller teeth and smaller bodies.

2286
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:57,080
All the things that domesticated animals show.

2287
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:05,080
And bonobos live in this environment in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.

2288
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:16,080
There's no indication that they will have these aggressive kills and enough data now to show that there's a statistical difference in the frequency in which it would happen.

2289
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:21,080
And bonobos are famously erotic.

2290
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:33,080
The females have enlarged sexual parts which swell to a particularly large size compared to the female chimpanzees.

2291
02:18:33,080 --> 02:18:45,080
And the females have a lot of interactions with each other in which they excitedly rubbed their clitorises together and appeared to have orgasms.

2292
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:52,080
These occur in the context of some kind of social tension.

2293
02:18:52,080 --> 02:19:05,080
And they sometimes happen before, sometimes after the social tension, and they seem to be devices, these interactions, for ensuring that everyone's friends and reducing the chances that they're actually going to get into a fight.

2294
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:13,080
There's a kind of conflict resolution through sex or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.

2295
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:16,080
Well, it's often characterized as make love not war.

2296
02:19:16,080 --> 02:19:18,080
Make love not war.

2297
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:21,080
Okay.

2298
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:26,080
You mentioned to me offline that you have a deep love for nature.

2299
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:38,080
If we look at the world today, how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature remain a big part of our lives?

2300
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:51,080
Assuming beings, in the way we think about it, in the way we also keep it around, preserve it, you know, we keep it part of our minds and part of our world.

2301
02:19:51,080 --> 02:20:13,080
It's a very difficult question because every time there is a conflict between conservation of a natural habitat and allowing people to get a little bit of extra food for their babies, then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.

2302
02:20:13,080 --> 02:20:22,080
And so we have this steady erosion in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.

2303
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:31,080
We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats and all the species, and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.

2304
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:40,080
Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples of something being saved, but the overall trend is clear.

2305
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:46,080
And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that because it's not human.

2306
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:57,080
Now that we are essentially a single tribe to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.

2307
02:20:57,080 --> 02:21:14,080
So I think the only way in which we can really conserve is if we put tremendous effort into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.

2308
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:29,080
Often this will be the national parks that already exist, and what we have to do is to make them so valuable that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival to be able to keep those sorts of places.

2309
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:43,080
And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I have taken in Uganda where we want to keep the Kibali National Park alive, which has got the largest population in chimpanzees in Uganda,

2310
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:52,080
and it's got elephants and wonderful birds and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on, and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.

2311
02:21:52,080 --> 02:22:03,080
It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism, and you need to make sure ecotourism is done right.

2312
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:15,080
In other places you will keep nature there because it's useful for maintaining the climate, bringing rain.

2313
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:41,080
Maybe you can in some places convince people of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature that even over the long term, presidents whose job it is to look for the future of the country will be persuaded that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.

2314
02:22:41,080 --> 02:23:02,080
But overall, what is required is for people in the rich countries to do much more investment than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places in their own countries and in the tropics.

2315
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:16,080
And if you look at Africa, the population trends are that Nigeria may become the most populous country in the world, I think, within a century.

2316
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:23,080
The future of African habitats, it's clear what's going to happen in general.

2317
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:27,080
There's going to be a huge conversion towards agricultural land.

2318
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:42,080
I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago about the prospect of the entire globe being turned into a single human feedlot.

2319
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:45,080
It's going to take a lot to avoid that.

2320
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:53,080
He is out there calling for half the earth to be devoted to nature.

2321
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:57,080
It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.

2322
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:03,080
But unless you have really exciting goals, probably nothing will be achieved.

2323
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:17,080
Yeah, I mean, there's something to me like when I visit New York and I see Central Park and somehow constructed a situation where you preserve this park in the middle, probably some of the most expensive land in the world.

2324
02:24:17,080 --> 02:24:35,080
The fact that that's possible gives me hope that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale, perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons of just valuing the beauty and disrespecting our origins of having come from the earth.

2325
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:44,080
We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas as our close relatives still living on the earth.

2326
02:24:44,080 --> 02:24:54,080
We're unlucky that we don't have Australopithecines and other species of homo, but we're still lucky to have those because they are incredibly closely related to us compared to what most animals have.

2327
02:24:54,080 --> 02:25:04,080
There are many animals that don't have any close relatives to them on the earth, but not only are they relatively close, but they teach us so much about ourselves.

2328
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:19,080
The similarities between them and ourselves raise questions that we can then test about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities are derived from the same evolutionary stock as in those great apes.

2329
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:21,080
Well, how much is that worth?

2330
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:30,080
I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars to find evidence of bacteria there, and that's fascinating too.

2331
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:45,080
But we should be spending billions on this earth in order to make sure that we have, I don't know how to say it, substantial representative populations of these close relatives.

2332
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:53,080
Yeah, that we can meet. There's something like space tourism when you go out into space and you look back down on earth.

2333
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:58,080
That's to a lot of people, including myself is worth a lot.

2334
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:13,080
But why is that worth a lot is because it's humbling and beautiful in the same way that meeting our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.

2335
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:19,080
Just to know that this is what we come from. This is who we are.

2336
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:25,080
Not just for the understanding or the science of it, but just like something about just the beauty of witnessing this.

2337
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:35,080
And again, it's both humbling and empowering that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.

2338
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:42,080
Yes, unfortunately, the problems are incredibly difficult to solve and there is no one solver.

2339
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:47,080
It has to happen from a network of potentially cooperating people.

2340
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:52,080
But I mean, you're so right about it being daunting to think about what it looks like from space.

2341
02:26:52,080 --> 02:27:04,080
And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed of being able to go out from space and he said the whole of life would look like a kind of rust on the planet.

2342
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:10,080
Yeah, so the aliens were to visit. I'm not sure they would notice the life.

2343
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:17,080
They would probably notice the trees or ocean. It's a kind of rust.

2344
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:23,080
But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question. What is the meaning of this rust?

2345
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:29,080
What do you think is the meaning of life on earth? What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?

2346
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:40,080
Well, I think it's very clear that we have an evolutionary story that is only getting challenged around the edges.

2347
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:44,080
We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.

2348
02:27:44,080 --> 02:28:02,080
And the meaning is we are here as a consequence of materialistic processes that began in our sense with the establishment of the Earth

2349
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:09,080
four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was, and then water and oxygen and so on.

2350
02:28:10,080 --> 02:28:22,080
And we are the astonishing consequence of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.

2351
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:29,080
The word random is the wrong word to use unless you understand what it means.

2352
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:37,080
It didn't happen by chance, but a lot of random events had to happen to make this possible.

2353
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:42,080
And those random events, of course, are the production of appropriate mutations.

2354
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:54,080
But the meaning of life is there is no meaning. The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?

2355
02:28:54,080 --> 02:29:01,080
And that's saying why propagates itself through the whole process of it.

2356
02:29:01,080 --> 02:29:14,080
For the emergence of planets, the virgins, first of all, galaxies of star systems, of planets, of the proteins required to construct the single cell organisms

2357
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:23,080
and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land and the whole of it.

2358
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:28,080
And then there's fire, some clever guy or lady invented fire.

2359
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:37,080
And then now here we are. It just does seem, speaking as a human, kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole thing.

2360
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:42,080
Wonderful story. So much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.

2361
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:53,080
It is beautiful, but it just seems special that us humans are able to write religions and construct stories and also do science.

2362
02:29:53,080 --> 02:30:11,080
That seems kind of amazing. It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us that are able to investigate it.

2363
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:23,080
And that's why there's this longing for why. It's just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity created by the universe.

2364
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:35,080
It seems like there should be a why, but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.

2365
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:39,080
Even without an infinite number of universes, I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.

2366
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:47,080
Now that we know how many planets have the right sort of conditions, which is what, I can't remember, a lot.

2367
02:30:47,080 --> 02:31:00,080
It's some significant percentage of all planets. Then there are apparently billions of planets and things happen so quickly on Earth.

2368
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:09,080
Once you've got water, then you've got life and it did not take long for life to evolve in the big scheme of things.

2369
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:21,080
And if you think you look out there, say there's a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations, one dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.

2370
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:30,080
And it's interesting to think what level of violence is useful for extending the life of a civilization.

2371
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:37,080
So we have a particular set of violence in our history, maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.

2372
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:41,080
Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.

2373
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:46,080
So you look at viruses. What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?

2374
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:52,080
If you're too deadly, that's a big problem. If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.

2375
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:55,080
So that is a fascinating exploration of...

2376
02:31:55,080 --> 02:32:01,080
I don't see any evidence. There's no way you're coming from when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.

2377
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:12,080
Well, because, I'll say it this way, death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.

2378
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,080
But there's lots of ways to die without violence.

2379
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:19,080
Right. To me, death in itself is violence.

2380
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:31,080
And a lot of people that talk about, for example, longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff, they see death is the way they talk about it.

2381
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:37,080
And it's interesting to think of it that way. Death is like mass murder that's happening.

2382
02:32:38,080 --> 02:32:47,080
People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life, they see that you're helping...

2383
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:58,080
The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization, from their perspective, is not allocating all our resources to solving death.

2384
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:06,080
Right. Because death is a kind of violence. It is a kind of murder that we're allowing to be committed on us by nature.

2385
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:14,080
So the flip side of that is death makes way for new life, for new ideas.

2386
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:24,080
Yes, but that's got nothing to do with peace versus war. You have animals that are very, very peaceful, but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.

2387
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:28,080
They just don't do it with death caused by violence.

2388
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:34,080
And violent death is premature death, surely. I mean, I don't mind about people dying.

2389
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:40,080
What I mind about is people dying in their youth.

2390
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:46,080
Prematurely, but some people would say all death is premature. It certainly feels that way.

2391
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:52,080
It's died too soon. Anyone who's ever died died too soon.

2392
02:33:52,080 --> 02:34:00,080
Yeah. Well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years, that would be great.

2393
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:04,080
Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?

2394
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:10,080
I don't think I'm afraid of it. You know, I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.

2395
02:34:10,080 --> 02:34:19,080
I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life, you know, and I don't want to, to leave the party.

2396
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:25,080
Yeah, it's kind of a fun party. I don't want to leave the party either.

2397
02:34:25,080 --> 02:34:30,080
So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party and you're right.

2398
02:34:30,080 --> 02:34:35,080
Having a party with a little bit less violence than it is an even more fun party.

2399
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:40,080
Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time with me today. Your work is amazing.

2400
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:48,080
It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history and the nature of human civilization.

2401
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:51,080
So again, thank you so much for talking today. It's an honor.

2402
02:34:51,080 --> 02:34:54,080
Thanks for your great questions. It's a really fun conversation.

2403
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:58,080

And now let me leave you some words from Jane Goodall.

2406
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:09,080
The greatest danger to our future is apathy.

2407
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:13,080
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
