0	4280	The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio, his second time on the podcast.
4600	10280	He is a legendary investor, founder of Bridgewater Associates, author of a book
10280	15120	I highly recommend called Principles, and also a new book called Principles
15120	20080	for Dealing with a Changing World Order that looks at the geopolitics of the day,
20440	25800	especially U.S. and China, to the lens of history, providing a fascinating
25800	29880	model for the rise and fall of empires that can be applied to the analysis
30120	31160	of our world today.
32160	34040	This is the Lex Friedman podcast.
34320	37240	To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
37520	41120	And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.
42040	45920	When you look at the history of the world, as you have done in your new book,
45960	50960	Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order, what is more important,
51000	53160	more impactful, money or power?
54360	55920	They go hand in hand.
56440	60240	They support each other and they compete with each other.
61080	65160	Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.
66320	72520	That power has to do with all that they can buy, but it also has the ability
72520	75200	to influence those with political power.
75960	82440	So, and so you see this throughout history, this symbiotic relationship.
83080	92640	You know, for example, between the royal families, the nobility and the church.
93360	99400	So, you see that group of people supporting each other in various ways and
99400	105360	then wrestling around with each other for the money and power among that group.
105840	112200	So, the dynamic that's quite classic is you could look at the parties in power.
112800	120720	Back in, you know, the 16th, 17th centuries, you would look at royal families,
120800	125120	nobles and the church, if you're in Europe.
125520	131640	And then you would look at agricultural land and there was a certain dynamic.
132240	134000	And that varies over time.
134080	140400	It changes as those people get thrown out and technology changes.
140440	146400	So, when we evolved, when the society evolved, so that it would produce goods
146400	152360	and services and you have something like the industrial revolution, the first
152360	157200	industrial revolution, they have machines and you have the talent of people
157240	163240	that are off the farms and then you have a struggling for power.
164280	167000	You see that power mix change.
167480	173480	And so, we don't see that same power mix anymore, but you still see the same dynamic.
173880	181200	You see those with money dealing with those who have political power around
181200	186720	those assets that are considered most valuable to particularly the productive
186760	188560	assets that produce money.
189320	193480	And political power is usually centered around nation state.
194000	197320	So, the major locus is the powers, the nations.
197800	198320	Yes.
198400	209680	In 1668, after 30 years of war, there was the development of nation states.
209840	215120	Before then, we had, it was really the development of the countries as we know
215120	221640	it, that there were borders and that within those borders, those who had
221640	227480	control got to control it and there would not to be intrusions in those
227480	230960	borders and that's how we established the nation state.
231480	235720	And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.
236360	243480	There is a central level and then there is a typically a province or state
243840	246920	level down below and then there's a municipal level.
246920	253560	So, they each have different levels of power and it's the coordination of those
254400	257720	that determines how the country is run.
259200	265160	You write that the quote archetypal big cycle governs the rising and declining
265160	269800	empires and influences everything about them, including their currencies and markets.
270320	274600	The most important three cycles are the ones you mentioned in the introduction.
275040	280160	The long-term debt and capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle
280480	284200	and the external order and disorder cycle.
284600	287160	Can you describe this big cycle?
288320	289480	There are two orders.
290600	296680	There is an order by a order, I mean a system, how the system works.
297680	304480	So, there's an internal order that is the internal governance system and that's
304480	310040	usually set out in a constitution or some agreements and then there's the world
310040	312600	order, how the world system.
312680	320480	So, for example, in 1945, at the end of a war, which is basically a fight for
320480	328760	determining the world order, the winners of the fight got together and created
328760	331960	the world system as we now know it.
332400	337240	44, they created the Brenton Woods monetary system that determined the money
337280	344040	pretty much and because the United States won and had 80% of the world's money,
344080	348160	gold was money then and has 80% of the world's gold and it was half the world
348160	350760	economy and it was the great military power.
351480	356480	The order was built around an American world order so that the United
356880	361160	nations was in New York, the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington and they
361160	362680	built that new order.
362680	369200	So, classically, you have a war to determine whose rules were following and then you
369200	372640	have the new order being constructed.
373360	379720	After that, there is usually period of extended peace and prosperity.
380680	387160	Peace suits prosperity and so there's not, and the reason you have the peace is
387160	391760	because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.
391760	395120	You know you're going to lose, you've surrendered, there's been the surrendering.
395280	398880	They carve up the world, they say what it's going to look like, who's going to
398880	407040	control what and then you come into that period of peace and then prosperity where
407040	410600	then there's a working together.
410800	417880	Usually, at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt, you've wiped out a
417880	424400	lot of the issues, the class warfare and so on and then there's good working
424400	431400	together so those great periods, such as the industrial revolution in the late
431400	438160	1800s or what we've experienced in the post-World War II period are peaceful and
438160	442880	prosperous periods led largely by the dominant world power.
443520	452480	Over a period of time, since really 1500 and maybe before, but really 1500 when the
452840	458520	Dutch invented capitalism and what I mean by that, they invented the first
458520	464720	capital markets, the first stocks and the first stock market, that since then
464720	470440	capitalism has been an effective tool for building wealth because it got resources
470800	473120	into the hands of inventive people.
473960	478800	That's when we move from agriculture to the importance of inventiveness of people.
478800	482800	They got resources and then they built that prosperity.
483440	488600	In that process of doing that, they create wealth gaps naturally.
489000	494840	Those who make a lot of money make a lot more and then those that don't.
495960	504120	And it also produces opportunity gaps because, for example, those who earn a
504120	509520	lot of money have that wealth, they have the power to educate their children in a
509520	517920	way that others don't and the gaps grow and also the debts grow at that time.
518520	526040	When they go around the world with their competitiveness, they earn a lot of money.
526040	532760	So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire, learned how to build ships and that
532760	533920	would go around the world.
534200	540120	A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle is the improvement of education.
540600	545920	And by education, I mean the skills that come from education, but also civility,
545920	548280	the ability to deal with wealth together.
548680	553360	So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world and they had military
553360	556040	power, but they were also very inventive society.
556400	560880	25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch.
561520	566640	And so as they went around the world, they also brought their currency and they
566640	567720	brought their military.
568240	572720	They needed the currency, they paid for things and that currency.
572760	578960	And then the more that happens, the more that becomes a reserve currency and then
578960	580160	they have their military.
580160	582040	So they need their military strength.
582040	585400	And so you see it evolve in all of those ways.
585920	593160	But over a period of time, as they become more successful and more expensive, they
593160	601760	become, they become more expensive and newer countries come along, like the UK,
603200	609000	then be, learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch and could do that less
609000	615600	expensively and also when they become more expensive, so less competitive.
616120	618600	And also the work ethic begins to change.
619040	622560	They believe that since they're richer, they can enjoy life more.
622600	624680	They don't have to work quite as hard.
625240	627400	And so you start to see the tilt.
628040	630720	Now you start to see the development of the top.
631160	636000	And when you have a world reserve currency, that allows you to borrow a lot of
636000	641880	money because those who want to save want to hold your money.
641920	644040	And that means that they'll lend you money.
644080	646560	And so those countries get deeper into debt.
647120	654240	So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness and they get themselves
654240	657760	into financial circumstances, which are not good.
658680	664120	And they have large wealth gaps, which set the stage for downturns.
664600	670000	And when they have downturns, the first question is, do they have enough money?
670120	674720	And traditionally, you know, money is, is resources.
675600	681600	So you classically see that the coffers are bare, that they're spending more money
681600	688280	than they're, than they are earning and they run out of money in the coffers.
688840	694720	And their granaries are empty rather than stocked so that they give them the buffer.
695280	699800	And as that deteriorates, that's that worsens conditions.
700280	705360	And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them, they see greater
705400	708000	internal conflict over wealth.
708760	714840	And then they have the problems internally and the problems externally, which usually
714880	721280	results in an internal war or an external war that leads to the change
721280	722800	in the, to the new world order.
724840	727200	And to you, the Dutch empire is a good example of that.
727680	732240	The British, what are some of the key examples that you think about in the book
733160	735480	of this process that follow the big cycle?
736240	741240	Well, the leading reserve currency empires, but it applies to all the empires,
741840	747600	were the, the Dutch, the British, the American and the Chinese.
748760	751640	But you could follow the same pattern.
752600	758960	In the book, it was very important for me to not just use words and concepts
758960	760960	because that's subjective.
761320	765280	It was very important for me to use actual measurements.
765760	769400	So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.
769440	771720	You can see, where's the education level?
772000	775240	What is the military power, each one of those.
775520	778720	And you could see them back going over the 500 years.
779240	784880	And so you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs.
784920	790320	And what you see is really in most countries and most dynasties, you can see that.
790720	795960	But you also can see through those numbers, the health of those countries.
796000	802280	Today, there are, there are statistics that you could, that are in the book that show
802280	805120	what is the level of education?
805120	808240	What is the level of economic output?
808240	812120	What is the level of military strength?
812120	817520	What is the level of a number of different measures of strength so that you can then compare that?
818000	823120	And I think that because they're objective measures of strength that you could see change,
824120	827680	that shows the picture of where we are today.
828080	834080	And I think one of the most important things about the book is that it allows people to monitor
834080	836000	how those things are transpiring.
836440	842600	I think for policymakers, you know, are your policymakers doing a good job?
843000	845640	And there's so much subjectivity in that.
846080	847680	But I think it's very simple.
848120	852640	If those lines on the chart are improving, if your health index is improving,
853280	857200	then you're moving toward a better life.
857600	859280	So that's what the book works like.
859280	863520	Also, it was used to create a model for the future.
864040	867480	In other words, there are cause-effect relationships.
868120	874320	Everything that happens has reasons, causes that preceded it, that made it happen.
874760	881960	And so by having all those in numbers, one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.
882400	886720	So that's what you see in the book.
886720	889880	It's not just, you know, raise interpretation.
889880	893400	I didn't want to make it raise interpretation because I don't know if I'm right.
893800	894080	Yeah.
894080	899120	So one of the fascinating things in the book, see, I've listed these 18 measures and there's
899120	904320	like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today.
904320	910960	So let's say US, China and Europe and what it was 20 years ago and looking at the change
910960	916640	from 20 years ago, and that's another indicator to change itself to see where things are headed.
917160	923560	Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective, how is US and China doing?
924040	929400	And in the 18 measures, what are some measures that stand out to you as particularly important
929400	932320	to think about today for the United States, for China?
933320	934240	Well, there are a number.
934600	944760	Financially, what you see in the United States is that we're borrowing a lot more money,
944760	949520	creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.
950240	957840	And our capacity to do that is very much is limited, first of all, because when you,
957840	964400	when there's a sale of a bond, when the government borrows more than it borrows money
964400	969520	because it spends more than it takes in, you have to sell a bond.
970240	976240	And the world right now has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds because as the world's reserve
976240	984320	currency, they sell, so on them, and they have very bad returns, negative real returns,
984320	987120	negative real returns significantly and so on.
987760	996000	So that means that more bonds has to be sold than are bought.
996640	1003600	And that means that the Federal Reserve has, is faced with the choice of having to raise
1003600	1009920	the interest rate to curtail borrowing, which slows the economy and hurts the markets,
1009920	1018080	or by filling that difference and producing money, the debt monetization, which produces
1018080	1022800	an inflation in goods, services, and financial assets.
1023360	1027760	So in that regard, that's our, the United States' position.
1028800	1033840	In China's case, its balance of payments is better.
1034800	1041440	China has displaced the United States as the world's largest trading country,
1041440	1044240	in other words, more exports to other countries.
1044240	1052080	And as a result, it's economically competitive, but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.
1052080	1053600	It's a real blessing.
1053600	1060240	So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency, but it is risking it because of this
1060320	1066080	imbalance. So if you look at history, you see that those go slowly, but when they go
1067200	1073920	eventually, they go quickly. So there's a risk of that financially.
1074800	1077760	Then there's the issue of internal order.
1078400	1082080	So I'm just giving you the major ones, but I'll get into some of the other ones too.
1082720	1087920	Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict in the United States,
1088880	1093040	which affects how well it works.
1094240	1100640	In China, there's less internal conflict because it's a more autocratic state,
1100640	1109680	but also they've created this bifurcation of what is political and what is economic
1109680	1114400	in terms of producing that prosperity. So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,
1115040	1123040	and then you're seeing entrepreneurship, you're seeing the finances of new businesses,
1123040	1131200	and so on. And so that internal working, that's subject to different people's interpretations,
1131200	1136320	whether they like it or not, but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds of measures
1136320	1140080	is less. Sorry to pause on that for a second.
1140080	1147760	So these measures, I guess you don't want to romanticize anyone measure or something like that,
1147760	1157040	overinterpret anyone measure, but is internal conflict always a bad thing? Is it a complicated
1157040	1161280	calculation, or do you kind of, the way we think about these measures that you've presented,
1161280	1166960	we should be thinking like the higher, the better, the lower, the worse, or of course,
1166960	1173120	depending on the... Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces the revolution
1173760	1183200	produces revolutionary changes that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.
1184560	1192160	And so their short-term, a short-term civil war is a hellacious experience,
1192800	1201840	and at the same time, it can be the transition to a new beginning. Also, there are different types
1201840	1213440	of conflict. Competition, which makes everything better, is a productive conflict, whereas
1213440	1223520	destructive conflicts are not good over the short time. So that's how those go.
1223520	1228480	So within each measure, the story is complicated?
1229120	1235520	Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear, meaning how much political conflict, how much
1236800	1241840	social conflict. In other words, you can measure conflict, you can measure fighting,
1241840	1250480	you can measure crime rates, you can measure lots of different ways of conflict. So the measures
1250480	1254880	are a composite of different types of internal conflict.
1255680	1260880	What are some other interesting measures, maybe you can also mention that for me in particular,
1260880	1266960	interest is education and innovation. Yes. The classic cycle, the most important
1266960	1275360	leading indicator is the quality of education. Most importantly, broad-based education,
1276000	1282880	drawn from the largest population, because you can never tell who the talent is going to be,
1283520	1288960	where they're going to come from. So for example, if you look at the great Chinese
1288960	1298400	dynasties and the Confucian approach, it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams
1298400	1304000	and so on, broad base of drawing in the populations. And you see that if you go across societies,
1305120	1313760	because that draws on the largest number of population to get education. And that creates
1314720	1323040	a reality and a perception that the system is fairer, equal opportunity, not just one of privilege.
1323040	1333440	And that helps to create social stability. But education is not just education in understanding
1333440	1340640	facts and so on. It is education in civility of how to behave together. And so if they're smart,
1341200	1347280	they understand how to be productive, because they work well together and they're productive.
1347280	1352560	And then that leads to the next stage. You could see in the lines in the charts,
1353600	1359920	I plotted these, so that you could see in a typical cycle, you could see that education is the long
1359920	1367600	leading indicator. And then you could see, as you mentioned, that what you see is inventiveness
1367680	1375040	and technology measures then follow. And you see then also competitiveness and world markets
1375040	1382880	follows. For example, in the early stages of a cycle, the industries that they go into tend to
1382880	1390080	be very basic industry, because they have cheap labor, something like textiles and simple manufactured
1390080	1398000	goods and so on. But as the education rises, then they move up the value chain to greater
1398000	1405840	technologies and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity. So yes, those, and as you say,
1405840	1412720	there are 18 different measures like that, but education and then civility and the inventiveness.
1412720	1421120	So you see it reflected in who's inventing what. And that corresponds then who's trading with,
1421760	1427680	who's a big trading country, and where's the value of economic output and what are per capita incomes.
1427680	1433680	They all follow those arcs. Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,
1433680	1439920	so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots. Yeah, you could see it.
1440880	1445360	So it's not just your opinion. It's kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like,
1446240	1450400	but you're just giving a lot of your own insights along with the numbers.
1451920	1458640	If you were to look at the American nation, the American empire, and the trajectories looking
1458640	1465920	into the future, given these measures, what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse of
1465920	1470800	the American empire based on these measures? What are the concerning indicators? And if
1472080	1480720	those break down further, what does that look like? Well, all of those indicators are concerning,
1482480	1492000	maybe except for one, which is technology, the technology niche, although even in that area
1492000	1500880	the United States is improving at a slower rate than is China for various advantages that they
1500880	1506240	have there. They put out about eight times as many computer engineers, they have free data,
1506240	1515920	and so on. But if you look at them, so the financial is a concern, the internal order,
1515920	1522720	disorder is a concern. Then if you look at education levels, the United States
1523520	1530800	is in many ways, is losing its educational advantage. If you were to look at, compare it with China,
1532400	1539840	if you take general public education in the United States, it's deteriorated tremendously,
1539840	1544720	even in comparison to developed countries. There are scores, pieces scores, and so on,
1544720	1549520	and it's something like 38th in the world or something, and that was a big plunge,
1549520	1554720	average public education. If you look at the best universities in the world,
1554720	1559680	the United States is unique in having the best universities in the world, so there are these
1559680	1569120	privileged spots that are excellent, uniquely excellent. So when you look at the comparison,
1569200	1579040	education in China is improving rapidly, and the quantity is a quantity of educated people
1579040	1585200	in the areas that they're moving in are, is greater, and the resources that they're putting
1585200	1593680	behind it is greater, and so you see the results are greater. But it's sort of a long line that
1593680	1602000	I'm dealing with. If you were to follow through in terms of actual productions, I think you know
1602000	1609440	in terms of technologies, there are some areas that the United States is in a lead. At the moment,
1609440	1615680	there's some areas that China's in a lead, but China's gaining very quickly. When I first went
1615760	1624880	to China, 1984, I would bring $10 calculators, and I gave them away as gifts to high-ranking people,
1624880	1633200	and they thought they were miracle devices. Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing,
1633200	1643120	and AI, and you know, many areas, you have a race going on, and so if you take the trajectory
1643120	1648480	of the competitiveness, not just look at the current level, you have a situation where they're
1648480	1654720	improving at a much faster rate. This is all good for the world if the world can get along.
1656560	1664960	And the main thing I think is, in just how do you have a healthy world, and how do you have a
1664960	1671280	strong economy, and how do you have a strong situation, is be strong. The United States's
1671280	1677120	war is with itself. That's the main war. You know, it's very simple in history.
1679440	1688880	Be financially sound, earn more than you spend, and be strong in these ways, and pretty much
1688880	1694960	everything will take care of itself. But you make it sound simple, of course,
1694960	1700240	because there's a momentum when things degrade. When the education system degrades, when you
1700240	1705600	start borrowing, when, I mean, all of these indicators, once they start going down,
1706800	1710080	there's a momentum to it, right? So it's hard to reverse it.
1710080	1715840	Right, and there are circumstances that you're then in. For example, indebtedness,
1716880	1725520	you know, it's politically desirable for those to borrow money and spend, because their
1725520	1731840	constituencies only look at what they get. And when they get a lot, they don't pay attention
1731840	1738000	to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books. So it's always better to borrow, spend,
1738560	1746160	and then leave the cleanup to the next guy. And so you inherit a lot. You inherit it as
1747280	1755040	a new president enters in, or new legislators. They have a lot of debt. They have a broken down
1755040	1763440	infrastructure. They don't have enough money to fix that. And so that's the lay of the land that
1764160	1772320	the prior generations put you in, and there you are. And so that's right. It's difficult,
1772320	1777840	because when you start to think, okay, what's healthy? Well, spend, earn more than you spend.
1777840	1783840	Well, that's not so easy, because, you know, what does that mean? Go earn more? I mean,
1783840	1790960	okay, that's not so easy. Spend less? That isn't going to work. So now what do you do? Okay,
1790960	1796800	you have this debt that you then monetize, and that's why it's classic. So yes, that's why these
1796800	1803360	cycles occur, because what has created before, what happened before created the lay of the land
1803360	1809120	that is then increasingly difficult to deal with. So what can great leaders do in this moment? I mean,
1809200	1816320	maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here. So for example, to do very large projects that
1816320	1824080	invest in the education system, that sort of try to fix the fundamentals, or maybe invest more and
1824080	1830320	more into the innovation and the development of new technologies and so on. It feels like that
1830320	1837840	just doesn't happen organically. So you have to have strong leaders that
1839280	1842480	convince the populace of the importance of these ideas.
1843520	1849520	Well, I completely agree with your list. What we have is a situation where everybody
1850400	1856000	has their opinions, and they have to sort of get them exactly right, and they all fight with
1856080	1863440	each other about whether their opinions. So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan
1863440	1871280	so that we don't, and we get over our differences. I would have a bipartisan cabinet. I would draw upon
1872960	1879120	both members of both parties, the moderates, who are going to be able to work together.
1879840	1889200	So as then we have one country, and then we deal with those in a means that works for the majority
1889200	1896160	of the people in the middle, rather than the polarity. I think our greatest risk is in not
1896160	1904080	being able to do that. So I would say that's a paramount importance because we have the resources,
1904720	1911680	wealth, real wealth, and science, and everything has never been better than it is.
1912400	1918720	But the notion is that it has to work for the majority of people, and we have to keep it
1918720	1927440	being productive. So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably work together so that they
1927440	1934000	increase the size of the pie, and they create broad-based prosperity. So that is a paramount
1934000	1942240	importance. Whatever they do, if they do it that way, I can say I'm happy about because that other
1942240	1953920	alternative is the really scary alternative. The scary alternative, the different ways it has
1953920	1961840	evolved throughout history, some of it has led to wars. What are the future trajectories that
1961840	1968160	lead to a potential war with China? Cold war or hot war? Is this something you think about?
1968160	1972960	Is this something you're worried about? Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars. So the war
1972960	1980240	with China, as I say, there are five kinds of wars. There's a trade war technology war,
1980960	1990640	geopolitical influence war, capital war, and military war. As far as military war goes,
1990640	1998160	I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue, and we could talk about that for a minute.
1998720	2006720	But those others, they'll be rough competitions, and we'll have that type of evolution over a
2006720	2013840	period of time. That's what that war looks like. Taiwan has been, for a long time,
2015920	2025760	a sovereignty issue to China, and it has its roots in what's called 100 years of humiliation.
2027120	2035600	From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in, took advantage of China. They had the Opium
2035600	2046880	Wars in such times, and that represented the 100 years of humiliation. Taiwan represents
2046880	2054480	their sovereignty and their important thing. And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,
2054480	2063600	there was an agreement that there is one China, and Taiwan is part of China, and that there would be
2064240	2072160	peaceful reunification. The peaceful reunification hasn't happened, and in their view,
2073200	2079680	that's a very big issue. And so it's a big contentious issue, and that could produce a
2079680	2086960	military war, could produce a military accident, it's a very tense situation. And if we had a
2086960	2095680	military war, God help us because of the capacity in all different new ways to inflict harm on each
2095680	2103360	other. But anyway, that's that. If you don't have that military war, you'll have the competition
2103360	2110320	between those other kinds of wars, and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.
2111280	2113840	Where do you put cyber war within the five?
2114560	2121040	Well, cyber war is a military war. I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're
2121040	2127920	referring to is that which it's used to inflict pain on the other party through cyber. So cyber wars,
2127920	2134000	you'll see cyber war, you could see space war, you can see drone warfare,
2134720	2141920	you, new types of warfare, not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare,
2142480	2143920	but you could see any of the above.
2146000	2150560	What are the defining characteristics? What are the interesting things about
2150560	2154880	Xi Jinping, the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?
2155760	2163760	His father was a early leader. He was himself
2166640	2175600	in the Cultural Revolution in times, treated brutally. And during that period of time,
2175680	2184880	it was very, very difficult. And he came up through the ranks and is a very intelligent man.
2186480	2193760	When he first came to power, as you know, they have two five-year terms, and we're now coming to
2193760	2200240	the end of the second of those five-year terms. When he first came to power, he felt that there
2200240	2208560	should be a lot of reform, and reform meant moving to much more of a market and open economy.
2209360	2217520	When that happened in him coming in, I had some contact with economic policymakers, but in the
2217520	2225120	circumstances then, were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises and local governments
2225120	2232080	with implied government guarantees. And so there was not control of that and the movement to aim
2232080	2239200	more of a market economy. And the development of markets was a primary. And also the dealing
2239200	2245280	with the corruption issue. There was a lot of corruption prior to that, and that was viewed
2245280	2253680	as an existential threat to the system. So that became the primary objective. And then as time
2253680	2262800	progressed over those 10 years, there was a lot of changing in the world, their financial
2262800	2269120	circumstances, opening many, many other markets. They particularly getting money to small and
2269120	2275280	medium-sized enterprises and developing a lending system and then establishing controls on it.
2275280	2287760	So right now, there's a vibrant capital markets. You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,
2287760	2293840	you can become a billionaire in the capital markets. And they developed the markets to be
2293840	2302560	the second largest capital markets. At the same time, they had to deal with their rising debt issue,
2302560	2312640	which they began to deal with really about four years ago, when the second term began.
2315360	2326800	And then Lou Ha became the vice premier responsible for that and to deal with those issues. So
2326880	2333040	you see right now that what's happening is the dealing with the real estate bubble.
2333040	2339360	There was a development in real estate, a bubble, which produced a lot of unproductive lending.
2340000	2349840	And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in, not to speculate on. And so that was wasteful.
2349840	2354800	So they established what they call three red lines, which are financial ratios,
2354800	2362080	that the property developers had to live within. And that is then causing the adjustments that are
2362080	2369360	going on now, which in my view are very healthy because whenever there's bankruptcies and so on,
2369360	2375200	the most in the public think, okay, that's a problem. It's in many cases really a cleaning
2375200	2382560	up of bad debts and bad practices. And so that's what's going on. So that's, let's say economically.
2382560	2389920	At the same time, there is the changing relationships, the changing world order,
2389920	2395280	the changing relationships with the United States and other countries, which is becoming
2396080	2404240	much less cooperative and much more warlike, much more confrontational. Those two things,
2404240	2412000	the domestic debt problem and the domestic has led to what's called core, what they call core
2412000	2422080	leadership, which means a leadership more around him that is less challenging because they believe
2422080	2429760	in history that during very difficult times, a more centrally controlled decision making process
2429760	2436400	lends itself better than to a more fragmented political contentious project. And that's basically
2436400	2446480	what's going on now. You said it very eloquently, but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men
2446480	2455360	and there's a lot of centralized control. That characterization is much more black and white
2455360	2459520	than it really is. But it leans towards that direction.
2460320	2465280	Like, for example, of the standing members of the Politburo, four are more alleged,
2465280	2472560	allowed him, three are less so. You have to understand that it's kind of a collective
2472560	2479120	leadership at the top. And then, of course, there's just jockeying for power in a highly
2479120	2489280	political sense at the top. But no one leader can be successful against all those powers at
2489280	2496800	the top. So it's very politically negotiating. It's very much more like, if you put in the
2496800	2501360	United States, the Democrats and the Republicans, and they had to be in the same government and
2501360	2507840	they work it out, it's kind of something like that. And so that's that struggle, but it's an
2507840	2513760	internal struggle. Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas at the founding of the
2513760	2519920	United States when then, now we're talking about that at the context of China, the freedom of
2519920	2525920	speech freedoms. What China is doing with the central management of a lot of things, it's
2525920	2533840	enabling a lot of growth, but it's also limiting people on the very basic level in terms of freedom,
2533840	2539600	the kind of freedom that I think can lead to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,
2539600	2544480	to having big dreams and chasing those dreams, and then creating totally new things in whatever
2544480	2552480	the space, maybe in technology, in business and whatever. How important is that as a metric for
2552480	2560320	society? Well, they have a view which is the idea of a dialectic, which means that two things are
2561280	2568080	that everything comes with pros and cons, and two opposites exist. And you want the benefits of
2568080	2575600	those two opposites, and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites? So let's say
2575600	2582160	you want the capital markets because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs who are
2582160	2589120	motivated, they build fortunes, and that drives an economy to do very well. And at the same time,
2589120	2596800	it produces the other problems, the wealth gaps, the other problems, then the debt cycle that we're
2596800	2606000	talking about and so on. And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism and the market economy
2606000	2613680	and the capital markets? And he famously said, and it doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a
2613680	2619920	black cat, just as long as it catches mice. In other words, if it works in making the country richer,
2620560	2625200	then that becomes the objective, and then they move that along. So there are these conflicts,
2626480	2633840	and one of the leaders described it to me as follows, because it's confusion and it goes back
2633840	2641200	over a period of time. There's a hierarchy, and it's an extension of the family he described it.
2641200	2648000	And he said, the United States is a country of individuals and individualism,
2649600	2658560	and that is its vibrancy that we see. The individual rights to speak up, the individual
2660800	2664880	protection of the individual, individual property rights, and all of those things
2665440	2671360	is of paramount importance. And we build our organization. That's why democracy is from the
2671360	2677680	bottom up, or even a company will get together and we'll be partners to prosper together. That
2677680	2686240	is the American approach. He was describing that in China, it's an extension of the Confucian family,
2686720	2694800	essentially. And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy. And so what they think about is
2694800	2702320	the common good, not the individualism. So for example, if they want a high-speed rail to go
2702320	2708880	from one place to another, and that's best in the common good, then the individual protections that
2708880	2717120	would stand in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern. So that notion of controlling.
2717120	2728160	So for example, what they're doing with video games, they control what type of video games
2728160	2737200	and how many hours a day kids can be on video games operating in that way, because they believe
2737280	2743120	that that's good for the society and that's very controlling. In the United States, I think probably
2743120	2748960	most parents would say, leave it to me, and it's a matter between me and my kids. The same thing
2748960	2756080	has to do with data. In other words, in the United States, who controls the data? Does the company
2756080	2762960	control the data? Do you individually control the data? And so the inclination would be to figure
2762960	2768080	that out, but nobody would say that the government is going to control the data because of our
2768080	2774320	inclination of really anti-government control. In China, it would be that the government will
2774320	2780240	control the data because that's going to be best for the society and it depends who you trust.
2781520	2791120	So that difference in philosophy is very much at the heart of that. As far as your question in terms
2791120	2799120	of effectiveness, it really is, in China's case, it's how you balance the things. So what they're
2799120	2808000	attempting to do is to create a lot of freedom and creativity in areas that are not political, let's
2808000	2816640	say. And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship, you see a lot of product development, you see a lot
2816640	2824880	of creativity happening in that way. So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening
2824880	2830880	is an old stereotype. There's a lot of creativity certainly happening and the system can work well
2830880	2836720	if they can achieve that kind of balance. It's proven to work well. Since I started going there
2836720	2848160	in 1984, real per capita income has increased by 26 times. The longevity rate has increased by 10
2848160	2856400	years. The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1% in terms of basics like starvation
2856400	2864480	and things. And if you read history, Plato's Republic, he talks about the cycles, democracy
2865120	2873360	and autocratic and the benevolent despot and all of that. Each has their own vulnerability. The
2873360	2879920	vulnerability of democracy, which has been a remarkable, remarkable system and I don't have
2879920	2890480	to extol the benefits of it. But the vulnerability of it has always been the internal conflict that
2890480	2901680	produces itself as anarchy. In World War II, four democracies chose to be autocracies
2902960	2910080	because there was internal disorder and there was the belief will somebody bring about order
2910080	2917120	and get control of the situation. That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.
2917840	2925360	They were parliamentary systems that turned themselves over to that. So, both systems
2926240	2934720	have vulnerabilities. I think the main thing that we need to think about is those vulnerabilities.
2934720	2943360	Democracy is an amazing system because the adherence to the rules and the system
2943360	2949440	and the checks and balances is quite amazing and it gives it a flexibility to change without
2949440	2956960	civil wars. But there has to be the respect of the rules. And when you see something like
2958240	2967840	they will not accept elections or they will not accept rules, history has shown when the causes
2967920	2974400	that people are behind are more important to them than the system. The system is in jeopardy.
2974400	2981760	So, we have a situation that's very much like that in terms of, let's say, the 2024 elections.
2982480	2991280	I believe that there's a very high chance that neither side will accept losing, for example.
2991760	3000240	And so, we have that kind of a situation. So, one would hope that one could rise above the
3000240	3009200	disagreements and rely on the system for resolving disagreements because if that doesn't happen,
3009200	3016160	then we have our own chaos. So, the kind of the trend that started in 2020,
3016720	3024960	or I suppose it's been growing. One representation of this internal disorder has been
3024960	3028880	the growing trend of being skeptical about the results of the election.
3029520	3033920	Well, it started before that. There was the emergence of population
3035040	3043680	before President Trump was elected. He was basically elected as a populist because there
3043680	3050000	was a large percentage of the population that felt that the system didn't work for them,
3050560	3057600	and he tapped into that, and he was largely elected as a populist leader, first populist leader
3057600	3066880	in a developed country. And so, populism began then, and that was a battle of one group against
3066960	3073280	the other group. And so, since then, it's been like that, and it continued to grow.
3077920	3084720	You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy, the internal disorder is the
3084720	3090400	vulnerability of democracy. What's the vulnerability of a system like China? Maybe one way to
3090960	3094880	say is put China aside and look at history, look at Soviet Union.
3094880	3098960	What's the vulnerability of a communist-type system?
3099840	3108960	Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic, depending on how much autocracy,
3108960	3118720	is that it lacks flexibility. It lacks the ability, but I should deal with them differently.
3119440	3125600	In other words, there's the economic system. The economic system threatens motivation
3126160	3135440	and productivity. So, communism or socialism has to be done in a way where you can threaten
3135440	3144000	productivity. Capitalism has, and what I mean by that, I mean free markets and capital markets.
3144640	3152480	I've been an effective way of allocating resources and also creating the incentives
3152480	3158400	and the resources, providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas. And so,
3158400	3166000	if I compare that, what the Chinese have done, to a large extent, is to recognize that and have made
3166000	3173920	a move, that's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict between those two things exist. But
3173920	3183360	anyway, that's it. As far as an autocratic system, rather than one man, one vote from the population
3183360	3191040	up, the risks of the autocratic system is that there's enough discontent that arises,
3192000	3200080	that the system doesn't have the flexibility, and that rather than bending, it breaks.
3201360	3209440	That's the big risk. The notion of trying to control a population, if there's that, rather
3209440	3216000	than giving it the flexibility. So, that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.
3216080	3221120	What's the human, because you mentioned like the top gets bigger with the empires,
3222400	3229600	and you start taking things for granted, is some of this just human nature. So, the concern with
3229600	3240400	China, with autocratic nations, the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union, was that
3241360	3247600	fundamentally, at the individual level, the humans involved at the top, they start becoming,
3247600	3253920	they're starting to lose touch with the reality, in a way that no longer makes them. I guess that's
3253920	3259120	the representation of the flexibility that you're referring to. Well, I mean, in a democracy,
3260320	3265680	you could change. You can go as far left or as far right. You can change the leaders easily,
3265680	3270800	and so the people don't become, they pretty much only have themselves to blame.
3273920	3281440	One of the problems of that is they may not choose the best leaders, but they have that
3281440	3288960	flexibility. So, vote and you get what you wanted. In the case of the autocratic, let's say, leaders,
3288960	3297360	and then the movement from democracies to autocracies, what you see normally, that movement,
3297360	3303360	is that one of the systems is not working. Let's say the democracy is not effectively. Everybody's
3303360	3308080	arguing with each other, and nobody's getting anything done, and you know, like Mussolini,
3308080	3313840	the trains are not running on time, and that would be the example. Geez, this place has gotten
3313840	3321520	chaotic. Well, somebody gets to control, and then you get the autocratic, and then he's
3321520	3329680	autocratic enough to boss people around, and then you follow those kinds of orders, and it's like
3329680	3335920	maybe a CEO in a powerful company ordering around, and that could work well or it could work badly.
3336400	3346400	Most companies are run as like autocracies, in a sense. There's the hierarchy and the command
3346400	3356320	economy and that kind of thing, and that can work well or not, but then quite often when you get the
3356320	3364480	populist autocratic, their personality is something that they want to fight, and they become more
3364480	3372240	nationalistic, and they tend to become more militaristic, and human nature at that stage
3373760	3379680	lends itself to fighting. There's an arc here that when we think of a country,
3380800	3387840	and we say we, and we think of a country, it's not true, it's not like that. There are individuals
3387840	3394720	who change. One generation dies, and another generation comes along, and one of those arcs
3394720	3404320	is that the ones who have been through war don't want to go to war and are more happily willing to
3405200	3411520	abide by whatever the rules are. As you get farther along into that cycle, and you get a new
3411520	3419440	generation, and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight,
3419440	3427040	and so you're seeing right now the emerging of fight for right, and what that means is you see
3427040	3435760	it internally. Fight, where are you in fight for that thing, and they mean fight, and then
3435840	3441760	externally, fight, are you going to be the strong one who will fight and win,
3441760	3448160	and that develops on both sides, this fight and win, and they side is cheering each other on
3448160	3455680	into a war, but that comes by those who really have not experienced war because it comes
3455680	3459840	in their part of their lifetime. Humans are fascinating.
3460560	3468160	Humans are fascinating, and by the way, human nature has not changed over the thousands of years,
3468160	3474000	so it's so interesting because like in doing this study, and it comes across in the study,
3474000	3481040	it's like watching the same movie over and over again. You see the arc, and you see it happen
3481040	3486080	over and over again. The only things that seem to change are the clothes people wear and the
3486080	3493680	technologies they use. Yeah, and then somebody probably will disagree with you about the clothes,
3493680	3499280	maybe there's also cycles within fashions. Maybe we're not even creative there. What do you
3500720	3506320	make of Russia and Vladimir Putin? What do you think about Putin as a leader,
3506320	3512960	as a human being on this world stage, within the context of the cycles of empires that you think about?
3513840	3522560	Well, Putin came to power at the failure of Russia's last order, so there was the end of
3522560	3529920	communism, and there was the development of the market economy, the collapse of the Soviet Union,
3531760	3541200	and at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin who was an alcoholic and had problems
3541920	3549600	managing and was put into power. The conditions in the Russian, there was anarchy,
3550800	3556560	there was no money. It had the classic end of cycle ingredients. It was broke,
3556560	3562320	it was people fighting with each other, it was the anarchy, and that's when he came to power.
3563040	3571280	And there were not institutions, the whole thing had collapsed. It was not effective ministry of
3571280	3581120	education, ministry of anything. And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability,
3581120	3587280	and they needed a democracy, and they needed the improvement of capital markets.
3587280	3600000	So he's been in that position as a, I guess I would call him a semi-autocratic leader in that,
3601600	3609040	from all indications, he would respect the democracy, and he's very popular. He's won
3609040	3616720	democratic elections because he's been a strong leader, and he's brought peace and stability
3616800	3627280	to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. And he's a strong leader in pursuit of
3629760	3639840	the country's interests in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power,
3640640	3650400	but it is a significant military power. So the issues, and then there's a strong alliance between
3650400	3659440	Russia and China now. So that's kind of the lay of the land. And then there are sensitivities. The
3659440	3668320	Ukraine issue is a sensitivity because there are a lot of Russians who live in the Ukraine,
3668880	3675520	and there's also the issue of NATO on their border. So there are those kinds of things,
3675520	3683040	and he has military power, and he has a strong alliance with China. And I guess that's my best
3683040	3695280	summary of what his position is. Strong leader, popular. These are not subjective interpretations.
3695280	3700960	These are objective interpretations. Yeah, it's interesting. Just in this conversation,
3700960	3707840	you're not sort of doing the usual criticism of any one particular system. You're looking
3707840	3713760	at these systems from the perspective of history. You're just describing how they work. It's often
3713760	3718960	times when you talk about what Russia is today, or what the Soviet Union was, or what China is
3718960	3724240	today, is you start to criticize. Well, they do this kind of censorship, or they do this kind
3724240	3730000	of they limit freedoms in this kind of way. But you're just kind of describing this as a nation
3730640	3735760	with ideas, what they think is right. This is how they hope to get it to work. This is why
3735760	3741520	it's working. This is what's not working. Here's metrics that show that it's not working. I think
3741520	3745920	that's a refreshing way to think about it. It's easy though. I mean, you got some criticism
3747520	3749680	saying that I think China is a strict parent.
3750240	3759840	You know, some people criticize these countries for violating human rights. I suppose there's some
3760880	3765200	people that criticize the United States for violating human rights. But what are your thoughts
3767360	3775680	on the world stage today about some of the behaviors it has governed in terms of respecting
3775680	3782880	the rights, the basic rights of human beings? You described accurately how I just tried to look
3782880	3793600	at things in a non, I don't want to impute my values on anybody. I mean, there are intolerable
3793600	3799040	things, so I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things. But one of the great things of being an
3799040	3805760	American here is that I grew up with all different nationalities, having all different points of
3805760	3813040	view and all different religions and all different ways of operating. And I've come to treasure the
3813040	3820480	fact that what's their business is their business. And then the question is, where do you cross the
3820480	3826960	line under what circumstances that others have got to do it my way? And then when you do it
3826960	3835120	internationally, the issue of what is a sovereign state, you know, which as I say in the piece of
3835120	3842560	Westphalia, and you have borders, and then when do you cross the line, that my way of doing things
3842560	3847360	has got to be their way of doing things or what are the various rights? And so that's a very
3848320	3855600	delicate question or a very difficult question. And we all have responsibilities to different
3855600	3861360	parties, and we all have different levels of knowledge about those particular things. So
3862400	3868000	for example, as an international investor, I have a responsibility to my investors.
3869120	3874960	Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs of how do they run that. So if you're
3874960	3884320	taking Nike or Sinkers and so on, and Americans can decide whether they want to buy Chinese products
3884320	3890560	or not buy Chinese products, we are all faced with those types of choices. So you have what do
3890560	3896240	you want to do in your constituency, and you have your choices. And then beyond that, in many cases,
3896240	3902480	the issues are quite complex, like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it. So
3902880	3909600	and then I believe that if you disconnect it, if all those
3910800	3917760	if entities like myself, the businesses doing business with China disconnected,
3917760	3923360	I think that that would be disastrous, economically disastrous. And it would also be
3924240	3931360	reduce the understanding that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.
3931360	3939520	And so these are all complicated. So what we do is and who makes it my opinion matters the most.
3939520	3944800	Why should it be my opinion that matters the most in making that decision? So I largely look at
3944800	3950720	the government guidance that I get not only from my own government, but from the other governments.
3950720	3957200	And I follow the rules. I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries. And we want to do that in the best
3957200	3963520	way to provide the diversified portfolio. And we sort of need that. Every one of those countries
3963520	3970800	has similar complexities. There are always one issue or another. And there's only so much
3970800	3976000	that we really understand about all of those issues. So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.
3976960	3982080	Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect to the culture, the place, the way things are done.
3983040	3991440	You don't necessarily, the way you heal relationships between nations is like you said,
3991440	4001040	you work together. And that requires kind of to listen maybe more than you talk. And I think people
4001040	4007520	in the public sphere talk a lot about China without really listening, without understanding much
4007520	4012080	about China, without one of the things that makes me really sad because I know how to speak Russian
4013600	4019920	and I can, I know how much is lost in translation. It makes me sad that I'll never really get to
4019920	4025520	know the Chinese culture because like I'll never really get to know the language, the literature,
4025520	4030560	the just talk to regular people. It's not just the government or officials or scientists,
4030560	4034480	just regular folks get the culture. I think if you don't understand the culture,
4034480	4042240	just the basics of the human nature of what people love about their country, about their
4042240	4047040	family, what the kind of hopes they have, what kind of values they have without that,
4047040	4055760	you're not going to be able to fully connect with them. And you have to do that first,
4055760	4060160	to have a chance of building a good world. I couldn't agree with you more. I was very lucky
4060160	4069440	because as I say, since 1984, so for more than half of my life, I've been going there and the
4069440	4075200	common people and all sorts of people and I've got to meet them. I don't speak the language,
4076240	4082880	but a combination of through translators or them speaking English and being in situations,
4082880	4090720	I had my son go to school, a local school and we developed those kinds of understandings.
4090720	4101040	I think that but the not wanting to know the other perspective is the thing that's most
4101040	4111120	scary. Like I'm right now in the middle and all I want to try to do is to help a mutual understanding.
4111680	4118000	You're right. If there were questions probing me, asking me, what is it? I'm not on one side
4118000	4123920	or another. I don't want to be on one side or another. I believe that each has their right
4123920	4128560	within there to approach their different culture in their own way. So many ways you gave an example.
4129040	4143200	If they're not doing harm to others, but that issue of trying to understand is so much better.
4143200	4153520	That doesn't mean agree with. If you are wanting to out-clever and out-compete somebody, it still
4153520	4160400	pays to understand what they're thinking. So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,
4160400	4164560	even if you want to go to war with them, that understanding is the best thing to have.
4165200	4173360	What we have now is a situation in which there's an enemy mentality. That means that anything
4173920	4181760	that seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding seems to mistakenly create the
4181840	4190080	notion of I'm on their side in a war. That's a dangerous thing because there's a momentum here
4190080	4196880	to fight. Henry Kissinger praises your new book and you thank him in it in the dedication.
4197520	4202320	What's your relationship like with him? What makes him interesting? Maybe what makes him
4202320	4207440	controversial? What makes him such a central figure in history? First, most importantly,
4208000	4213200	he's unique about seeing things through all the other's eyes.
4216400	4223360	It's like there's a chess game. I think geopolitics is like a chess game, but with
4223360	4230320	multiple chess players playing the same game. So imagine there are six people around playing
4230320	4237120	the chess game and he could sit in each seat and he could know how they see it
4238480	4245520	and see it in a calm way of how they see it. He's unique in that way. He's 98 years old
4245520	4253120	and he's equally able to do that. He has a background in which he's a historian, so he
4253120	4261920	really understands history super terrifically. He doesn't understand economic history as much,
4261920	4267440	so that's why, to some extent, we enjoy having a conversation because he's interested in the
4268640	4273680	economic piece he doesn't know and I'm so interested in the geopolitical piece that I
4273680	4280400	don't know as well. But anyway, he's able to do that, but not only a historian, but a practitioner.
4281360	4291200	So when you go from an academic to a practitioner who has that talent to see things through other's
4291200	4298400	eyes in an objective way and to be strategic rather than just tactical, that's a very special
4298400	4304320	person and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person. Yeah, he's lived a fascinating
4304320	4311600	life. Just all of the world events he's been involved in is fascinating and, like you said,
4311600	4317120	that's such an interesting skill to have to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,
4317120	4322560	the fears of all the people at the table. What are they thinking? I find that people don't,
4323440	4327920	once again, don't do that enough when it's the obvious thing you should be doing, whether it's
4328000	4336320	business deals or political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation. I'm often surprised
4336320	4344560	again, sorry, to go to the Russian thing because I hear Putin talk in Russian and you start to
4344560	4351520	infer certain intentions, not the trivial stuff, like the human being. What is that human being
4351520	4356640	hoping for himself, for his country, for his close in a circle, for the bigger,
4357840	4363840	and I just see that that's often just lost in translation. I just see American leaders
4363840	4371360	talking to Putin and there's not a connection. Absolutely. I know exactly what you're talking
4371360	4380400	about. It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation or even reading a speech
4381040	4388960	or, and you see then it reported. Inevitably, the reporter picks some
4390000	4396240	headline characterization that has very little to do with what was really happening,
4396240	4402800	but might be a headline grabber that's at some kind of distortion and there's a lack of understanding
4402800	4408560	of really what's going on. If it's okay, let me ask you a couple of questions about cryptocurrency.
4409520	4414800	You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years. What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today?
4414800	4420560	Its role in the global financial system and just in human society in general?
4421280	4427040	Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years is one of the things that has
4428400	4438320	influenced changes in my view. It has proven itself. Something like 10, 11 years ago, imagine
4438400	4444160	the programming of this and here's the, you throw it out and that's the idea. It has not been hacked.
4444800	4454720	It has operated, it has built, it has come an amazing way over that 11 years to be
4456160	4464800	maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people and has been used and is now
4465520	4474560	has obtained the status of having imputed value. At the same time, it is one of those assets
4475200	4482400	that is an alternative money. I think we're entering an era where there's going to be a
4482400	4493280	competition of monies because of the printing of fiat money and the depreciated value. There will
4493280	4501120	be a competition of monies and Bitcoin is part of that competition, but there'll be many monies,
4501120	4508000	not just crypto monies, but there'll be central bank crypto monies, but there'll be different
4508000	4516960	kinds of monies. Even monies are things that you buy and sell. NFTs can become a money,
4517760	4522880	a type of money. You own it and it's an investment and you could say, I'd rather own it than own
4523440	4527520	Bitcoin. Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs? Not yet.
4529920	4538160	But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs to just experience them. I think I should
4538160	4545040	produce one. I should have asked that. Have you minted an NFT? You probably should just to know
4545040	4551280	what it's like. Yeah, that's right. This stuff is happening. This stuff is real and how it operates,
4551840	4561360	but like all new real things, some are going to go and it's like in the internet in the year 2000,
4562960	4568560	pets.com could have been a great, but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows. That's
4568560	4573520	the beauty of the competitive system that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured and some
4573520	4582880	things will be trashed. But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment of what is an
4582880	4588400	alternative money. Money has two purposes, a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth.
4589680	4597760	We are looking for and it's portable and it's best if it's recognized in other countries.
4598560	4608400	Gold is one of those. I look at it as an alternative gold, but I look at a number of things as an
4608400	4617440	alternative gold. Gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities. For example,
4618000	4624640	you can't trace it. In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it, where it's going and so on. Governments
4624640	4630720	can have that ability to trace it and so on. A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.
4630720	4636960	I think not connected has benefits, particularly in a world where maybe connections can be more
4636960	4648320	risky. Gold has been, for many thousands of years, universally recognized as a source of money
4648400	4654800	and central banks. It's the third largest source of money in central bank reserves.
4655840	4662240	I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve those types of purposes and so on. For various reasons,
4662240	4666240	I prefer gold to the other, but it's a little bit part of my mix.
4666880	4673120	But then you look at it, it hit I think 69,000 this year is the high Bitcoin hit. Do you think
4673120	4679760	it's possible? You mentioned gold. Do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers like
4679760	4686000	one million that some people talk about? I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it
4686000	4699520	is there's a certain amount of it and there's a certain amount of gold. I'll use gold as a benchmark.
4700080	4709520	The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion. Total crypto is about $2.2 trillion,
4709520	4716960	but let's say Bitcoin. It's $1 trillion. If you take the amount of money that is in
4718400	4725840	gold that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks, and I assume
4725840	4732880	Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes, that amount in gold is
4732880	4741280	about $5 trillion. Right now, if you were to have a portfolio that has gold and crypto,
4742240	4749120	gold and Bitcoin, it's worth about 20% of the value of gold. Do I think it's going to be
4750000	4756800	worth more than gold in terms of that mix? I don't think it'll be worth more than gold,
4756800	4764160	but let's say it became worth as much as gold. I don't believe it will be. I think the 20%
4764160	4770320	sounds kind of about right. I really don't know what the right answer is. Then there's the question
4770320	4777280	of what is all of that pool of money that let's say gold and gold equivalents relative to everything
4777280	4786000	else. Does it go from let's call it $6, $7, $8 trillion to $16 trillion? Maybe it could double.
4786000	4791360	It depends what it is in the world environment, but basically, if you use gold as a measure,
4794160	4801600	it just makes no sense that it's going to be used that much more. Am I sure about that?
4801600	4809280	I'm not sure about anything, but logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation on its price
4809280	4812000	in relationship to other things that are like it.
4813200	4818960	Let me ask for your deep financial analysis on a very important issue. I just talked a couple
4818960	4824160	days ago with Elon Musk. He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon. What are your
4824160	4833040	thoughts about Dogecoin? Do you think it'll be the official currency? Maybe reserve currency on
4833040	4841520	the moon and on Mars? My reaction is, that's cute. I remember Elon when he first got his money from
4841520	4849200	PayPal. I think he said to me, he got $180 million, $90 million. He decided to say,
4849200	4857680	why aren't we going to outer space? He wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified
4858240	4872720	using Russian technology to put a plant and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it
4872720	4885200	was. He said, first life on Mars or first life on that as an inspiring notion. Then,
4885200	4892560	there's always what's behind it. I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability to do other things
4892560	4901040	behind it. I would take that as symbolic and I'd be asking him, what's behind it? What's next?
4901600	4906720	I'm also just on the topic of Dogecoin and Memecoin. There's some aspect of humor and
4906720	4913520	lightheartedness that's really interesting about the way we communicate, what ideas become viral,
4914080	4919920	how to captivate people with ideas. There's something about taking things too seriously
4919920	4924640	that somehow slows it all down. It's interesting. You're right. That's part of human nature
4924720	4933200	somehow. Humor is part of this whole thing. You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down
4934320	4940960	and you have- Principles in particular. Principles. You have this really nice thing in your book where
4940960	4951920	you actually, I think there's such a brilliant way of highlighting which parts are extra important
4951920	4956880	and you make them bold. That's a brilliant idea. Let me just ask the high level question of what's
4956880	4966480	a good system for taking notes? Well, I find that almost everything happens over and over again.
4968640	4976480	We're in the blizzard of these things happening. What I found is that if I'm making a decision
4977440	4987680	that after I make the decision usually or right at the time, if I pause and reflect and I write my
4987680	4996480	principle down, in other words, principle is sort of a recipe, how would I make that decision
4996480	5002560	and what are the criteria around it? I find that I make it much more clear. It becomes clear
5003120	5008880	and it applies to the next thing that comes along. It'll be that way because everything
5008880	5015120	happens over and over and over again. I think people make the mistake of looking at just the
5015120	5020880	one like it's the first one. I don't know. They have the first problem of this sort of the first
5020880	5026560	child or whatever it is. This has been happening plenty of times. If you have the principles,
5026560	5033040	I found that that helped me think more clearly about it and it helped me communicate better
5033040	5041280	like why. Over the years, over the last 30 years or so, that's what I've done. I did it originally
5041280	5047760	to communicate very well with the people I work with. I set up my company and it was very important
5047760	5053360	to have good communication. Then we could debate the principles. That's the process.
5054000	5061520	I urge people to do that. There are many excellent decision makers and I just wish that
5061520	5069600	they wrote down their principles when this set. For example, we're talking about Henry Kissinger
5069600	5076240	and his new book is going to come out with a book on leadership. Don't just describe the leaders.
5076960	5083040	Describe then what about them were the essential elements to make a good leader under what
5083040	5092480	circumstances. If we think about that, then you begin to think in a principled way. Then
5092480	5098960	when you start to think in a principled way, life becomes so much easier to make decisions and it's
5098960	5106400	so much less confusing because it's like coming up on a species and you say, okay, well, what
5106400	5113680	species is it? Not just another, it's a thing. What species is it and how do I deal with that
5113680	5120720	species effectively? That's what that is. I encourage people to write it down. I wish
5120720	5125840	anybody who's successful wrote down their principles or their recipes for making those
5125840	5133360	types of decisions. The events of interest here happens over and over and over in similar ways.
5133360	5138720	As you're looking for the patterns and you're defining the process, that's right to respond
5139280	5145520	to those patterns and you call that the principles. That allows you to deal with the
5145520	5151440	future effectively. That codifies the lessons from the past to be able to deal with the future.
5151680	5158800	What advice do you have for young folks today in high school, in college, thinking about how to live,
5160400	5164720	have a career they can be proud of or maybe have a life they can be proud of?
5165360	5171680	Know yourself, follow your passion. Make your work and passion the same thing
5172640	5178880	while considering the money part because money will get you freedom and choice and be able to
5178880	5191360	beg that. If you know yourself, feel the pull and pursue that passion. Along those lines,
5191360	5198640	by the way, I found that using personality profile tests has been very helpful. I've used
5198640	5204000	those for about 25 years for people to help to understand themselves and understand each other.
5204000	5214000	I created a free one that is called Principles You. It's online. It's had remarkable,
5215440	5221120	loving people who've taken it learn about themselves, but also you can put in somebody else
5221120	5226720	and it'll tell you about your relationship with them. That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,
5226720	5231920	but the main thing is to understand on your journey, your hero's journey,
5233840	5243440	that you will have mistakes and you will have weaknesses and to understand those,
5243440	5250960	not fight those because by understanding mistakes, you will learn not to make mistakes again.
5250960	5260400	I have a principle which is pain plus reflection equals progress. That reflection is important to
5260400	5267120	know yourself, know your pulls, know your weaknesses. When you also know your weaknesses and the
5267120	5272960	strengths of other people, there are people who have strengths where you're weak and you have
5272960	5278800	strengths where they're weak. To be able to work well together is the most effective way of
5278800	5288800	achieving success. It's that journey and there's a life arc and there's a journey and you want to
5288800	5297600	make it the best that you can make it. It's like a video game. It has the challenges and the
5298320	5305600	obstacles and the learning experiences and the temptations and all of that. The maximizing
5305600	5311680	learning to go where you want to go to achieve the life you want is the most important. That's
5311680	5320320	kind of maybe a long-winded way of seeing it. I'll try to say it simply. There's a five-step
5320320	5329840	process. Step one is know your goals. Know what you're going after. You could have almost anything
5329840	5334400	you want, but you can't have everything you want. You have to prioritize and you move in
5334400	5340080	that direction. On the way to your goals, you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.
5342320	5348480	Step two is understanding your problems and your obstacles. Identify them. Step three
5349120	5356400	is to diagnose them to get at the root cause of the problem. That could be many root causes,
5356400	5361520	but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others, but you have to be objective about them.
5362080	5368960	Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four, which is to design a way to get around them.
5371200	5377440	Then, after you have that design, you implement that design. You have to follow through and do it.
5379840	5386720	That will then produce its new results, which should be better results. I call this the looping
5386800	5394320	process. It's the evolutionary looping process. You just keep doing that and you learn over a
5394320	5400080	period of time and you move in the direction that you want. Last question, and you only have one
5400080	5408080	minute to answer it. You dedicate the book, quote, to my grandchildren and those of their generation,
5408640	5415040	who will be participants in the continuation of the story. May the force of evolution be with you.
5415840	5422400	Let me ask, where is this force of evolution taking human civilization and what in this story
5422400	5430320	that evolution is writing gives you hope? Evolution is a direction toward improvement.
5432320	5442160	The greatest force is man's capacity to adapt and invent. You see in the charts in the book,
5442880	5454000	you see that this upward movement, life expectancy, health, all the things that we
5454000	5460400	think are better, there's a chart and it shows that over a period of time. You barely see
5461200	5469600	the downturns from depressions and wars in that. That is the greatest power. Man's ability to
5469840	5476400	invent and adapt is evolution and that's the greatest power and that is what
5477280	5483120	gives me justifiable hope. A continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,
5483120	5488640	maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species. Not only will we keep creating amazing things here
5488640	5495120	on earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos. My time horizon isn't going to have me
5495120	5502080	analyzing that yet, but I hope so and I agree that that would be in the natural.
5502080	5506480	So I'm not going to ask you for the best financial system on Mars. I think we'll
5506480	5511120	focus on earth for now. Thank you so much for your brilliance, for the books you've written,
5511120	5517040	for the works you've done, for the inspiration of millions. And thank you for spending your valuable
5517040	5522560	time here with me today. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.
5522560	5526160	To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.
5526720	5532960	And now, let me leave you with some words from Ray Dalio himself. Every time you confront something
5532960	5538240	painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life. You have the opportunity
5538240	5544320	to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.
5544320	5549280	Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
