00:00.000 --> 00:04.280
The following is a conversation with Ray Dalio, his second time on the podcast.

00:04.600 --> 00:10.280
He is a legendary investor, founder of Bridgewater Associates, author of a book

00:10.280 --> 00:15.120
I highly recommend called Principles, and also a new book called Principles

00:15.120 --> 00:20.080
for Dealing with a Changing World Order that looks at the geopolitics of the day,

00:20.440 --> 00:25.800
especially U.S. and China, to the lens of history, providing a fascinating

00:25.800 --> 00:29.880
model for the rise and fall of empires that can be applied to the analysis

00:30.120 --> 00:31.160
of our world today.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.040
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.120
And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.920
When you look at the history of the world, as you have done in your new book,

00:45.960 --> 00:50.960
Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order, what is more important,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.160
more impactful, money or power?

00:54.360 --> 00:55.920
They go hand in hand.

00:56.440 --> 01:00.240
They support each other and they compete with each other.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.160
Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.

01:06.320 --> 01:12.520
That power has to do with all that they can buy, but it also has the ability

01:12.520 --> 01:15.200
to influence those with political power.

01:15.960 --> 01:22.440
So, and so you see this throughout history, this symbiotic relationship.

01:23.080 --> 01:32.640
You know, for example, between the royal families, the nobility and the church.

01:33.360 --> 01:39.400
So, you see that group of people supporting each other in various ways and

01:39.400 --> 01:45.360
then wrestling around with each other for the money and power among that group.

01:45.840 --> 01:52.200
So, the dynamic that's quite classic is you could look at the parties in power.

01:52.800 --> 02:00.720
Back in, you know, the 16th, 17th centuries, you would look at royal families,

02:00.800 --> 02:05.120
nobles and the church, if you're in Europe.

02:05.520 --> 02:11.640
And then you would look at agricultural land and there was a certain dynamic.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.000
And that varies over time.

02:14.080 --> 02:20.400
It changes as those people get thrown out and technology changes.

02:20.440 --> 02:26.400
So, when we evolved, when the society evolved, so that it would produce goods

02:26.400 --> 02:32.360
and services and you have something like the industrial revolution, the first

02:32.360 --> 02:37.200
industrial revolution, they have machines and you have the talent of people

02:37.240 --> 02:43.240
that are off the farms and then you have a struggling for power.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.000
You see that power mix change.

02:47.480 --> 02:53.480
And so, we don't see that same power mix anymore, but you still see the same dynamic.

02:53.880 --> 03:01.200
You see those with money dealing with those who have political power around

03:01.200 --> 03:06.720
those assets that are considered most valuable to particularly the productive

03:06.760 --> 03:08.560
assets that produce money.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.480
And political power is usually centered around nation state.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.320
So, the major locus is the powers, the nations.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.320
Yes.

03:18.400 --> 03:29.680
In 1668, after 30 years of war, there was the development of nation states.

03:29.840 --> 03:35.120
Before then, we had, it was really the development of the countries as we know

03:35.120 --> 03:41.640
it, that there were borders and that within those borders, those who had

03:41.640 --> 03:47.480
control got to control it and there would not to be intrusions in those

03:47.480 --> 03:50.960
borders and that's how we established the nation state.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.720
And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.

03:56.360 --> 04:03.480
There is a central level and then there is a typically a province or state

04:03.840 --> 04:06.920
level down below and then there's a municipal level.

04:06.920 --> 04:13.560
So, they each have different levels of power and it's the coordination of those

04:14.400 --> 04:17.720
that determines how the country is run.

04:19.200 --> 04:25.160
You write that the quote archetypal big cycle governs the rising and declining

04:25.160 --> 04:29.800
empires and influences everything about them, including their currencies and markets.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.600
The most important three cycles are the ones you mentioned in the introduction.

04:35.040 --> 04:40.160
The long-term debt and capital market cycle, the internal order and disorder cycle

04:40.480 --> 04:44.200
and the external order and disorder cycle.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.160
Can you describe this big cycle?

04:48.320 --> 04:49.480
There are two orders.

04:50.600 --> 04:56.680
There is an order by a order, I mean a system, how the system works.

04:57.680 --> 05:04.480
So, there's an internal order that is the internal governance system and that's

05:04.480 --> 05:10.040
usually set out in a constitution or some agreements and then there's the world

05:10.040 --> 05:12.600
order, how the world system.

05:12.680 --> 05:20.480
So, for example, in 1945, at the end of a war, which is basically a fight for

05:20.480 --> 05:28.760
determining the world order, the winners of the fight got together and created

05:28.760 --> 05:31.960
the world system as we now know it.

05:32.400 --> 05:37.240
44, they created the Brenton Woods monetary system that determined the money

05:37.280 --> 05:44.040
pretty much and because the United States won and had 80% of the world's money,

05:44.080 --> 05:48.160
gold was money then and has 80% of the world's gold and it was half the world

05:48.160 --> 05:50.760
economy and it was the great military power.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.480
The order was built around an American world order so that the United

05:56.880 --> 06:01.160
nations was in New York, the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington and they

06:01.160 --> 06:02.680
built that new order.

06:02.680 --> 06:09.200
So, classically, you have a war to determine whose rules were following and then you

06:09.200 --> 06:12.640
have the new order being constructed.

06:13.360 --> 06:19.720
After that, there is usually period of extended peace and prosperity.

06:20.680 --> 06:27.160
Peace suits prosperity and so there's not, and the reason you have the peace is

06:27.160 --> 06:31.760
because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.120
You know you're going to lose, you've surrendered, there's been the surrendering.

06:35.280 --> 06:38.880
They carve up the world, they say what it's going to look like, who's going to

06:38.880 --> 06:47.040
control what and then you come into that period of peace and then prosperity where

06:47.040 --> 06:50.600
then there's a working together.

06:50.800 --> 06:57.880
Usually, at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt, you've wiped out a

06:57.880 --> 07:04.400
lot of the issues, the class warfare and so on and then there's good working

07:04.400 --> 07:11.400
together so those great periods, such as the industrial revolution in the late

07:11.400 --> 07:18.160
1800s or what we've experienced in the post-World War II period are peaceful and

07:18.160 --> 07:22.880
prosperous periods led largely by the dominant world power.

07:23.520 --> 07:32.480
Over a period of time, since really 1500 and maybe before, but really 1500 when the

07:32.840 --> 07:38.520
Dutch invented capitalism and what I mean by that, they invented the first

07:38.520 --> 07:44.720
capital markets, the first stocks and the first stock market, that since then

07:44.720 --> 07:50.440
capitalism has been an effective tool for building wealth because it got resources

07:50.800 --> 07:53.120
into the hands of inventive people.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.800
That's when we move from agriculture to the importance of inventiveness of people.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.800
They got resources and then they built that prosperity.

08:03.440 --> 08:08.600
In that process of doing that, they create wealth gaps naturally.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.840
Those who make a lot of money make a lot more and then those that don't.

08:15.960 --> 08:24.120
And it also produces opportunity gaps because, for example, those who earn a

08:24.120 --> 08:29.520
lot of money have that wealth, they have the power to educate their children in a

08:29.520 --> 08:37.920
way that others don't and the gaps grow and also the debts grow at that time.

08:38.520 --> 08:46.040
When they go around the world with their competitiveness, they earn a lot of money.

08:46.040 --> 08:52.760
So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire, learned how to build ships and that

08:52.760 --> 08:53.920
would go around the world.

08:54.200 --> 09:00.120
A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle is the improvement of education.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.920
And by education, I mean the skills that come from education, but also civility,

09:05.920 --> 09:08.280
the ability to deal with wealth together.

09:08.680 --> 09:13.360
So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world and they had military

09:13.360 --> 09:16.040
power, but they were also very inventive society.

09:16.400 --> 09:20.880
25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch.

09:21.520 --> 09:26.640
And so as they went around the world, they also brought their currency and they

09:26.640 --> 09:27.720
brought their military.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.720
They needed the currency, they paid for things and that currency.

09:32.760 --> 09:38.960
And then the more that happens, the more that becomes a reserve currency and then

09:38.960 --> 09:40.160
they have their military.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.040
So they need their military strength.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.400
And so you see it evolve in all of those ways.

09:45.920 --> 09:53.160
But over a period of time, as they become more successful and more expensive, they

09:53.160 --> 10:01.760
become, they become more expensive and newer countries come along, like the UK,

10:03.200 --> 10:09.000
then be, learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch and could do that less

10:09.000 --> 10:15.600
expensively and also when they become more expensive, so less competitive.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.600
And also the work ethic begins to change.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.560
They believe that since they're richer, they can enjoy life more.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.680
They don't have to work quite as hard.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.400
And so you start to see the tilt.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.720
Now you start to see the development of the top.

10:31.160 --> 10:36.000
And when you have a world reserve currency, that allows you to borrow a lot of

10:36.000 --> 10:41.880
money because those who want to save want to hold your money.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.040
And that means that they'll lend you money.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.560
And so those countries get deeper into debt.

10:47.120 --> 10:54.240
So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness and they get themselves

10:54.240 --> 10:57.760
into financial circumstances, which are not good.

10:58.680 --> 11:04.120
And they have large wealth gaps, which set the stage for downturns.

11:04.600 --> 11:10.000
And when they have downturns, the first question is, do they have enough money?

11:10.120 --> 11:14.720
And traditionally, you know, money is, is resources.

11:15.600 --> 11:21.600
So you classically see that the coffers are bare, that they're spending more money

11:21.600 --> 11:28.280
than they're, than they are earning and they run out of money in the coffers.

11:28.840 --> 11:34.720
And their granaries are empty rather than stocked so that they give them the buffer.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.800
And as that deteriorates, that's that worsens conditions.

11:40.280 --> 11:45.360
And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them, they see greater

11:45.400 --> 11:48.000
internal conflict over wealth.

11:48.760 --> 11:54.840
And then they have the problems internally and the problems externally, which usually

11:54.880 --> 12:01.280
results in an internal war or an external war that leads to the change

12:01.280 --> 12:02.800
in the, to the new world order.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.200
And to you, the Dutch empire is a good example of that.

12:07.680 --> 12:12.240
The British, what are some of the key examples that you think about in the book

12:13.160 --> 12:15.480
of this process that follow the big cycle?

12:16.240 --> 12:21.240
Well, the leading reserve currency empires, but it applies to all the empires,

12:21.840 --> 12:27.600
were the, the Dutch, the British, the American and the Chinese.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.640
But you could follow the same pattern.

12:32.600 --> 12:38.960
In the book, it was very important for me to not just use words and concepts

12:38.960 --> 12:40.960
because that's subjective.

12:41.320 --> 12:45.280
It was very important for me to use actual measurements.

12:45.760 --> 12:49.400
So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.720
You can see, where's the education level?

12:52.000 --> 12:55.240
What is the military power, each one of those.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.720
And you could see them back going over the 500 years.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.880
And so you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs.

13:04.920 --> 13:10.320
And what you see is really in most countries and most dynasties, you can see that.

13:10.720 --> 13:15.960
But you also can see through those numbers, the health of those countries.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.280
Today, there are, there are statistics that you could, that are in the book that show

13:22.280 --> 13:25.120
what is the level of education?

13:25.120 --> 13:28.240
What is the level of economic output?

13:28.240 --> 13:32.120
What is the level of military strength?

13:32.120 --> 13:37.520
What is the level of a number of different measures of strength so that you can then compare that?

13:38.000 --> 13:43.120
And I think that because they're objective measures of strength that you could see change,

13:44.120 --> 13:47.680
that shows the picture of where we are today.

13:48.080 --> 13:54.080
And I think one of the most important things about the book is that it allows people to monitor

13:54.080 --> 13:56.000
how those things are transpiring.

13:56.440 --> 14:02.600
I think for policymakers, you know, are your policymakers doing a good job?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.640
And there's so much subjectivity in that.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.680
But I think it's very simple.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.640
If those lines on the chart are improving, if your health index is improving,

14:13.280 --> 14:17.200
then you're moving toward a better life.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.280
So that's what the book works like.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.520
Also, it was used to create a model for the future.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.480
In other words, there are cause-effect relationships.

14:28.120 --> 14:34.320
Everything that happens has reasons, causes that preceded it, that made it happen.

14:34.760 --> 14:41.960
And so by having all those in numbers, one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.

14:42.400 --> 14:46.720
So that's what you see in the book.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.880
It's not just, you know, raise interpretation.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.400
I didn't want to make it raise interpretation because I don't know if I'm right.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.080
Yeah.

14:54.080 --> 14:59.120
So one of the fascinating things in the book, see, I've listed these 18 measures and there's

14:59.120 --> 15:04.320
like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today.

15:04.320 --> 15:10.960
So let's say US, China and Europe and what it was 20 years ago and looking at the change

15:10.960 --> 15:16.640
from 20 years ago, and that's another indicator to change itself to see where things are headed.

15:17.160 --> 15:23.560
Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective, how is US and China doing?

15:24.040 --> 15:29.400
And in the 18 measures, what are some measures that stand out to you as particularly important

15:29.400 --> 15:32.320
to think about today for the United States, for China?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.240
Well, there are a number.

15:34.600 --> 15:44.760
Financially, what you see in the United States is that we're borrowing a lot more money,

15:44.760 --> 15:49.520
creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.

15:50.240 --> 15:57.840
And our capacity to do that is very much is limited, first of all, because when you,

15:57.840 --> 16:04.400
when there's a sale of a bond, when the government borrows more than it borrows money

16:04.400 --> 16:09.520
because it spends more than it takes in, you have to sell a bond.

16:10.240 --> 16:16.240
And the world right now has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds because as the world's reserve

16:16.240 --> 16:24.320
currency, they sell, so on them, and they have very bad returns, negative real returns,

16:24.320 --> 16:27.120
negative real returns significantly and so on.

16:27.760 --> 16:36.000
So that means that more bonds has to be sold than are bought.

16:36.640 --> 16:43.600
And that means that the Federal Reserve has, is faced with the choice of having to raise

16:43.600 --> 16:49.920
the interest rate to curtail borrowing, which slows the economy and hurts the markets,

16:49.920 --> 16:58.080
or by filling that difference and producing money, the debt monetization, which produces

16:58.080 --> 17:02.800
an inflation in goods, services, and financial assets.

17:03.360 --> 17:07.760
So in that regard, that's our, the United States' position.

17:08.800 --> 17:13.840
In China's case, its balance of payments is better.

17:14.800 --> 17:21.440
China has displaced the United States as the world's largest trading country,

17:21.440 --> 17:24.240
in other words, more exports to other countries.

17:24.240 --> 17:32.080
And as a result, it's economically competitive, but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.600
It's a real blessing.

17:33.600 --> 17:40.240
So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency, but it is risking it because of this

17:40.320 --> 17:46.080
imbalance. So if you look at history, you see that those go slowly, but when they go

17:47.200 --> 17:53.920
eventually, they go quickly. So there's a risk of that financially.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.760
Then there's the issue of internal order.

17:58.400 --> 18:02.080
So I'm just giving you the major ones, but I'll get into some of the other ones too.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.920
Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict in the United States,

18:08.880 --> 18:13.040
which affects how well it works.

18:14.240 --> 18:20.640
In China, there's less internal conflict because it's a more autocratic state,

18:20.640 --> 18:29.680
but also they've created this bifurcation of what is political and what is economic

18:29.680 --> 18:34.400
in terms of producing that prosperity. So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,

18:35.040 --> 18:43.040
and then you're seeing entrepreneurship, you're seeing the finances of new businesses,

18:43.040 --> 18:51.200
and so on. And so that internal working, that's subject to different people's interpretations,

18:51.200 --> 18:56.320
whether they like it or not, but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds of measures

18:56.320 --> 19:00.080
is less. Sorry to pause on that for a second.

19:00.080 --> 19:07.760
So these measures, I guess you don't want to romanticize anyone measure or something like that,

19:07.760 --> 19:17.040
overinterpret anyone measure, but is internal conflict always a bad thing? Is it a complicated

19:17.040 --> 19:21.280
calculation, or do you kind of, the way we think about these measures that you've presented,

19:21.280 --> 19:26.960
we should be thinking like the higher, the better, the lower, the worse, or of course,

19:26.960 --> 19:33.120
depending on the... Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces the revolution

19:33.760 --> 19:43.200
produces revolutionary changes that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.

19:44.560 --> 19:52.160
And so their short-term, a short-term civil war is a hellacious experience,

19:52.800 --> 20:01.840
and at the same time, it can be the transition to a new beginning. Also, there are different types

20:01.840 --> 20:13.440
of conflict. Competition, which makes everything better, is a productive conflict, whereas

20:13.440 --> 20:23.520
destructive conflicts are not good over the short time. So that's how those go.

20:23.520 --> 20:28.480
So within each measure, the story is complicated?

20:29.120 --> 20:35.520
Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear, meaning how much political conflict, how much

20:36.800 --> 20:41.840
social conflict. In other words, you can measure conflict, you can measure fighting,

20:41.840 --> 20:50.480
you can measure crime rates, you can measure lots of different ways of conflict. So the measures

20:50.480 --> 20:54.880
are a composite of different types of internal conflict.

20:55.680 --> 21:00.880
What are some other interesting measures, maybe you can also mention that for me in particular,

21:00.880 --> 21:06.960
interest is education and innovation. Yes. The classic cycle, the most important

21:06.960 --> 21:15.360
leading indicator is the quality of education. Most importantly, broad-based education,

21:16.000 --> 21:22.880
drawn from the largest population, because you can never tell who the talent is going to be,

21:23.520 --> 21:28.960
where they're going to come from. So for example, if you look at the great Chinese

21:28.960 --> 21:38.400
dynasties and the Confucian approach, it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams

21:38.400 --> 21:44.000
and so on, broad base of drawing in the populations. And you see that if you go across societies,

21:45.120 --> 21:53.760
because that draws on the largest number of population to get education. And that creates

21:54.720 --> 22:03.040
a reality and a perception that the system is fairer, equal opportunity, not just one of privilege.

22:03.040 --> 22:13.440
And that helps to create social stability. But education is not just education in understanding

22:13.440 --> 22:20.640
facts and so on. It is education in civility of how to behave together. And so if they're smart,

22:21.200 --> 22:27.280
they understand how to be productive, because they work well together and they're productive.

22:27.280 --> 22:32.560
And then that leads to the next stage. You could see in the lines in the charts,

22:33.600 --> 22:39.920
I plotted these, so that you could see in a typical cycle, you could see that education is the long

22:39.920 --> 22:47.600
leading indicator. And then you could see, as you mentioned, that what you see is inventiveness

22:47.680 --> 22:55.040
and technology measures then follow. And you see then also competitiveness and world markets

22:55.040 --> 23:02.880
follows. For example, in the early stages of a cycle, the industries that they go into tend to

23:02.880 --> 23:10.080
be very basic industry, because they have cheap labor, something like textiles and simple manufactured

23:10.080 --> 23:18.000
goods and so on. But as the education rises, then they move up the value chain to greater

23:18.000 --> 23:25.840
technologies and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity. So yes, those, and as you say,

23:25.840 --> 23:32.720
there are 18 different measures like that, but education and then civility and the inventiveness.

23:32.720 --> 23:41.120
So you see it reflected in who's inventing what. And that corresponds then who's trading with,

23:41.760 --> 23:47.680
who's a big trading country, and where's the value of economic output and what are per capita incomes.

23:47.680 --> 23:53.680
They all follow those arcs. Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,

23:53.680 --> 23:59.920
so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots. Yeah, you could see it.

24:00.880 --> 24:05.360
So it's not just your opinion. It's kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like,

24:06.240 --> 24:10.400
but you're just giving a lot of your own insights along with the numbers.

24:11.920 --> 24:18.640
If you were to look at the American nation, the American empire, and the trajectories looking

24:18.640 --> 24:25.920
into the future, given these measures, what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse of

24:25.920 --> 24:30.800
the American empire based on these measures? What are the concerning indicators? And if

24:32.080 --> 24:40.720
those break down further, what does that look like? Well, all of those indicators are concerning,

24:42.480 --> 24:52.000
maybe except for one, which is technology, the technology niche, although even in that area

24:52.000 --> 25:00.880
the United States is improving at a slower rate than is China for various advantages that they

25:00.880 --> 25:06.240
have there. They put out about eight times as many computer engineers, they have free data,

25:06.240 --> 25:15.920
and so on. But if you look at them, so the financial is a concern, the internal order,

25:15.920 --> 25:22.720
disorder is a concern. Then if you look at education levels, the United States

25:23.520 --> 25:30.800
is in many ways, is losing its educational advantage. If you were to look at, compare it with China,

25:32.400 --> 25:39.840
if you take general public education in the United States, it's deteriorated tremendously,

25:39.840 --> 25:44.720
even in comparison to developed countries. There are scores, pieces scores, and so on,

25:44.720 --> 25:49.520
and it's something like 38th in the world or something, and that was a big plunge,

25:49.520 --> 25:54.720
average public education. If you look at the best universities in the world,

25:54.720 --> 25:59.680
the United States is unique in having the best universities in the world, so there are these

25:59.680 --> 26:09.120
privileged spots that are excellent, uniquely excellent. So when you look at the comparison,

26:09.200 --> 26:19.040
education in China is improving rapidly, and the quantity is a quantity of educated people

26:19.040 --> 26:25.200
in the areas that they're moving in are, is greater, and the resources that they're putting

26:25.200 --> 26:33.680
behind it is greater, and so you see the results are greater. But it's sort of a long line that

26:33.680 --> 26:42.000
I'm dealing with. If you were to follow through in terms of actual productions, I think you know

26:42.000 --> 26:49.440
in terms of technologies, there are some areas that the United States is in a lead. At the moment,

26:49.440 --> 26:55.680
there's some areas that China's in a lead, but China's gaining very quickly. When I first went

26:55.760 --> 27:04.880
to China, 1984, I would bring $10 calculators, and I gave them away as gifts to high-ranking people,

27:04.880 --> 27:13.200
and they thought they were miracle devices. Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing,

27:13.200 --> 27:23.120
and AI, and you know, many areas, you have a race going on, and so if you take the trajectory

27:23.120 --> 27:28.480
of the competitiveness, not just look at the current level, you have a situation where they're

27:28.480 --> 27:34.720
improving at a much faster rate. This is all good for the world if the world can get along.

27:36.560 --> 27:44.960
And the main thing I think is, in just how do you have a healthy world, and how do you have a

27:44.960 --> 27:51.280
strong economy, and how do you have a strong situation, is be strong. The United States's

27:51.280 --> 27:57.120
war is with itself. That's the main war. You know, it's very simple in history.

27:59.440 --> 28:08.880
Be financially sound, earn more than you spend, and be strong in these ways, and pretty much

28:08.880 --> 28:14.960
everything will take care of itself. But you make it sound simple, of course,

28:14.960 --> 28:20.240
because there's a momentum when things degrade. When the education system degrades, when you

28:20.240 --> 28:25.600
start borrowing, when, I mean, all of these indicators, once they start going down,

28:26.800 --> 28:30.080
there's a momentum to it, right? So it's hard to reverse it.

28:30.080 --> 28:35.840
Right, and there are circumstances that you're then in. For example, indebtedness,

28:36.880 --> 28:45.520
you know, it's politically desirable for those to borrow money and spend, because their

28:45.520 --> 28:51.840
constituencies only look at what they get. And when they get a lot, they don't pay attention

28:51.840 --> 28:58.000
to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books. So it's always better to borrow, spend,

28:58.560 --> 29:06.160
and then leave the cleanup to the next guy. And so you inherit a lot. You inherit it as

29:07.280 --> 29:15.040
a new president enters in, or new legislators. They have a lot of debt. They have a broken down

29:15.040 --> 29:23.440
infrastructure. They don't have enough money to fix that. And so that's the lay of the land that

29:24.160 --> 29:32.320
the prior generations put you in, and there you are. And so that's right. It's difficult,

29:32.320 --> 29:37.840
because when you start to think, okay, what's healthy? Well, spend, earn more than you spend.

29:37.840 --> 29:43.840
Well, that's not so easy, because, you know, what does that mean? Go earn more? I mean,

29:43.840 --> 29:50.960
okay, that's not so easy. Spend less? That isn't going to work. So now what do you do? Okay,

29:50.960 --> 29:56.800
you have this debt that you then monetize, and that's why it's classic. So yes, that's why these

29:56.800 --> 30:03.360
cycles occur, because what has created before, what happened before created the lay of the land

30:03.360 --> 30:09.120
that is then increasingly difficult to deal with. So what can great leaders do in this moment? I mean,

30:09.200 --> 30:16.320
maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here. So for example, to do very large projects that

30:16.320 --> 30:24.080
invest in the education system, that sort of try to fix the fundamentals, or maybe invest more and

30:24.080 --> 30:30.320
more into the innovation and the development of new technologies and so on. It feels like that

30:30.320 --> 30:37.840
just doesn't happen organically. So you have to have strong leaders that

30:39.280 --> 30:42.480
convince the populace of the importance of these ideas.

30:43.520 --> 30:49.520
Well, I completely agree with your list. What we have is a situation where everybody

30:50.400 --> 30:56.000
has their opinions, and they have to sort of get them exactly right, and they all fight with

30:56.080 --> 31:03.440
each other about whether their opinions. So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan

31:03.440 --> 31:11.280
so that we don't, and we get over our differences. I would have a bipartisan cabinet. I would draw upon

31:12.960 --> 31:19.120
both members of both parties, the moderates, who are going to be able to work together.

31:19.840 --> 31:29.200
So as then we have one country, and then we deal with those in a means that works for the majority

31:29.200 --> 31:36.160
of the people in the middle, rather than the polarity. I think our greatest risk is in not

31:36.160 --> 31:44.080
being able to do that. So I would say that's a paramount importance because we have the resources,

31:44.720 --> 31:51.680
wealth, real wealth, and science, and everything has never been better than it is.

31:52.400 --> 31:58.720
But the notion is that it has to work for the majority of people, and we have to keep it

31:58.720 --> 32:07.440
being productive. So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably work together so that they

32:07.440 --> 32:14.000
increase the size of the pie, and they create broad-based prosperity. So that is a paramount

32:14.000 --> 32:22.240
importance. Whatever they do, if they do it that way, I can say I'm happy about because that other

32:22.240 --> 32:33.920
alternative is the really scary alternative. The scary alternative, the different ways it has

32:33.920 --> 32:41.840
evolved throughout history, some of it has led to wars. What are the future trajectories that

32:41.840 --> 32:48.160
lead to a potential war with China? Cold war or hot war? Is this something you think about?

32:48.160 --> 32:52.960
Is this something you're worried about? Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars. So the war

32:52.960 --> 33:00.240
with China, as I say, there are five kinds of wars. There's a trade war technology war,

33:00.960 --> 33:10.640
geopolitical influence war, capital war, and military war. As far as military war goes,

33:10.640 --> 33:18.160
I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue, and we could talk about that for a minute.

33:18.720 --> 33:26.720
But those others, they'll be rough competitions, and we'll have that type of evolution over a

33:26.720 --> 33:33.840
period of time. That's what that war looks like. Taiwan has been, for a long time,

33:35.920 --> 33:45.760
a sovereignty issue to China, and it has its roots in what's called 100 years of humiliation.

33:47.120 --> 33:55.600
From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in, took advantage of China. They had the Opium

33:55.600 --> 34:06.880
Wars in such times, and that represented the 100 years of humiliation. Taiwan represents

34:06.880 --> 34:14.480
their sovereignty and their important thing. And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,

34:14.480 --> 34:23.600
there was an agreement that there is one China, and Taiwan is part of China, and that there would be

34:24.240 --> 34:32.160
peaceful reunification. The peaceful reunification hasn't happened, and in their view,

34:33.200 --> 34:39.680
that's a very big issue. And so it's a big contentious issue, and that could produce a

34:39.680 --> 34:46.960
military war, could produce a military accident, it's a very tense situation. And if we had a

34:46.960 --> 34:55.680
military war, God help us because of the capacity in all different new ways to inflict harm on each

34:55.680 --> 35:03.360
other. But anyway, that's that. If you don't have that military war, you'll have the competition

35:03.360 --> 35:10.320
between those other kinds of wars, and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.840
Where do you put cyber war within the five?

35:14.560 --> 35:21.040
Well, cyber war is a military war. I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're

35:21.040 --> 35:27.920
referring to is that which it's used to inflict pain on the other party through cyber. So cyber wars,

35:27.920 --> 35:34.000
you'll see cyber war, you could see space war, you can see drone warfare,

35:34.720 --> 35:41.920
you, new types of warfare, not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare,

35:42.480 --> 35:43.920
but you could see any of the above.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.560
What are the defining characteristics? What are the interesting things about

35:50.560 --> 35:54.880
Xi Jinping, the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?

35:55.760 --> 36:03.760
His father was a early leader. He was himself

36:06.640 --> 36:15.600
in the Cultural Revolution in times, treated brutally. And during that period of time,

36:15.680 --> 36:24.880
it was very, very difficult. And he came up through the ranks and is a very intelligent man.

36:26.480 --> 36:33.760
When he first came to power, as you know, they have two five-year terms, and we're now coming to

36:33.760 --> 36:40.240
the end of the second of those five-year terms. When he first came to power, he felt that there

36:40.240 --> 36:48.560
should be a lot of reform, and reform meant moving to much more of a market and open economy.

36:49.360 --> 36:57.520
When that happened in him coming in, I had some contact with economic policymakers, but in the

36:57.520 --> 37:05.120
circumstances then, were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises and local governments

37:05.120 --> 37:12.080
with implied government guarantees. And so there was not control of that and the movement to aim

37:12.080 --> 37:19.200
more of a market economy. And the development of markets was a primary. And also the dealing

37:19.200 --> 37:25.280
with the corruption issue. There was a lot of corruption prior to that, and that was viewed

37:25.280 --> 37:33.680
as an existential threat to the system. So that became the primary objective. And then as time

37:33.680 --> 37:42.800
progressed over those 10 years, there was a lot of changing in the world, their financial

37:42.800 --> 37:49.120
circumstances, opening many, many other markets. They particularly getting money to small and

37:49.120 --> 37:55.280
medium-sized enterprises and developing a lending system and then establishing controls on it.

37:55.280 --> 38:07.760
So right now, there's a vibrant capital markets. You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,

38:07.760 --> 38:13.840
you can become a billionaire in the capital markets. And they developed the markets to be

38:13.840 --> 38:22.560
the second largest capital markets. At the same time, they had to deal with their rising debt issue,

38:22.560 --> 38:32.640
which they began to deal with really about four years ago, when the second term began.

38:35.360 --> 38:46.800
And then Lou Ha became the vice premier responsible for that and to deal with those issues. So

38:46.880 --> 38:53.040
you see right now that what's happening is the dealing with the real estate bubble.

38:53.040 --> 38:59.360
There was a development in real estate, a bubble, which produced a lot of unproductive lending.

39:00.000 --> 39:09.840
And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in, not to speculate on. And so that was wasteful.

39:09.840 --> 39:14.800
So they established what they call three red lines, which are financial ratios,

39:14.800 --> 39:22.080
that the property developers had to live within. And that is then causing the adjustments that are

39:22.080 --> 39:29.360
going on now, which in my view are very healthy because whenever there's bankruptcies and so on,

39:29.360 --> 39:35.200
the most in the public think, okay, that's a problem. It's in many cases really a cleaning

39:35.200 --> 39:42.560
up of bad debts and bad practices. And so that's what's going on. So that's, let's say economically.

39:42.560 --> 39:49.920
At the same time, there is the changing relationships, the changing world order,

39:49.920 --> 39:55.280
the changing relationships with the United States and other countries, which is becoming

39:56.080 --> 40:04.240
much less cooperative and much more warlike, much more confrontational. Those two things,

40:04.240 --> 40:12.000
the domestic debt problem and the domestic has led to what's called core, what they call core

40:12.000 --> 40:22.080
leadership, which means a leadership more around him that is less challenging because they believe

40:22.080 --> 40:29.760
in history that during very difficult times, a more centrally controlled decision making process

40:29.760 --> 40:36.400
lends itself better than to a more fragmented political contentious project. And that's basically

40:36.400 --> 40:46.480
what's going on now. You said it very eloquently, but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

40:46.480 --> 40:55.360
and there's a lot of centralized control. That characterization is much more black and white

40:55.360 --> 40:59.520
than it really is. But it leans towards that direction.

41:00.320 --> 41:05.280
Like, for example, of the standing members of the Politburo, four are more alleged,

41:05.280 --> 41:12.560
allowed him, three are less so. You have to understand that it's kind of a collective

41:12.560 --> 41:19.120
leadership at the top. And then, of course, there's just jockeying for power in a highly

41:19.120 --> 41:29.280
political sense at the top. But no one leader can be successful against all those powers at

41:29.280 --> 41:36.800
the top. So it's very politically negotiating. It's very much more like, if you put in the

41:36.800 --> 41:41.360
United States, the Democrats and the Republicans, and they had to be in the same government and

41:41.360 --> 41:47.840
they work it out, it's kind of something like that. And so that's that struggle, but it's an

41:47.840 --> 41:53.760
internal struggle. Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas at the founding of the

41:53.760 --> 41:59.920
United States when then, now we're talking about that at the context of China, the freedom of

41:59.920 --> 42:05.920
speech freedoms. What China is doing with the central management of a lot of things, it's

42:05.920 --> 42:13.840
enabling a lot of growth, but it's also limiting people on the very basic level in terms of freedom,

42:13.840 --> 42:19.600
the kind of freedom that I think can lead to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,

42:19.600 --> 42:24.480
to having big dreams and chasing those dreams, and then creating totally new things in whatever

42:24.480 --> 42:32.480
the space, maybe in technology, in business and whatever. How important is that as a metric for

42:32.480 --> 42:40.320
society? Well, they have a view which is the idea of a dialectic, which means that two things are

42:41.280 --> 42:48.080
that everything comes with pros and cons, and two opposites exist. And you want the benefits of

42:48.080 --> 42:55.600
those two opposites, and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites? So let's say

42:55.600 --> 43:02.160
you want the capital markets because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs who are

43:02.160 --> 43:09.120
motivated, they build fortunes, and that drives an economy to do very well. And at the same time,

43:09.120 --> 43:16.800
it produces the other problems, the wealth gaps, the other problems, then the debt cycle that we're

43:16.800 --> 43:26.000
talking about and so on. And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism and the market economy

43:26.000 --> 43:33.680
and the capital markets? And he famously said, and it doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a

43:33.680 --> 43:39.920
black cat, just as long as it catches mice. In other words, if it works in making the country richer,

43:40.560 --> 43:45.200
then that becomes the objective, and then they move that along. So there are these conflicts,

43:46.480 --> 43:53.840
and one of the leaders described it to me as follows, because it's confusion and it goes back

43:53.840 --> 44:01.200
over a period of time. There's a hierarchy, and it's an extension of the family he described it.

44:01.200 --> 44:08.000
And he said, the United States is a country of individuals and individualism,

44:09.600 --> 44:18.560
and that is its vibrancy that we see. The individual rights to speak up, the individual

44:20.800 --> 44:24.880
protection of the individual, individual property rights, and all of those things

44:25.440 --> 44:31.360
is of paramount importance. And we build our organization. That's why democracy is from the

44:31.360 --> 44:37.680
bottom up, or even a company will get together and we'll be partners to prosper together. That

44:37.680 --> 44:46.240
is the American approach. He was describing that in China, it's an extension of the Confucian family,

44:46.720 --> 44:54.800
essentially. And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy. And so what they think about is

44:54.800 --> 45:02.320
the common good, not the individualism. So for example, if they want a high-speed rail to go

45:02.320 --> 45:08.880
from one place to another, and that's best in the common good, then the individual protections that

45:08.880 --> 45:17.120
would stand in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern. So that notion of controlling.

45:17.120 --> 45:28.160
So for example, what they're doing with video games, they control what type of video games

45:28.160 --> 45:37.200
and how many hours a day kids can be on video games operating in that way, because they believe

45:37.280 --> 45:43.120
that that's good for the society and that's very controlling. In the United States, I think probably

45:43.120 --> 45:48.960
most parents would say, leave it to me, and it's a matter between me and my kids. The same thing

45:48.960 --> 45:56.080
has to do with data. In other words, in the United States, who controls the data? Does the company

45:56.080 --> 46:02.960
control the data? Do you individually control the data? And so the inclination would be to figure

46:02.960 --> 46:08.080
that out, but nobody would say that the government is going to control the data because of our

46:08.080 --> 46:14.320
inclination of really anti-government control. In China, it would be that the government will

46:14.320 --> 46:20.240
control the data because that's going to be best for the society and it depends who you trust.

46:21.520 --> 46:31.120
So that difference in philosophy is very much at the heart of that. As far as your question in terms

46:31.120 --> 46:39.120
of effectiveness, it really is, in China's case, it's how you balance the things. So what they're

46:39.120 --> 46:48.000
attempting to do is to create a lot of freedom and creativity in areas that are not political, let's

46:48.000 --> 46:56.640
say. And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship, you see a lot of product development, you see a lot

46:56.640 --> 47:04.880
of creativity happening in that way. So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening

47:04.880 --> 47:10.880
is an old stereotype. There's a lot of creativity certainly happening and the system can work well

47:10.880 --> 47:16.720
if they can achieve that kind of balance. It's proven to work well. Since I started going there

47:16.720 --> 47:28.160
in 1984, real per capita income has increased by 26 times. The longevity rate has increased by 10

47:28.160 --> 47:36.400
years. The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1% in terms of basics like starvation

47:36.400 --> 47:44.480
and things. And if you read history, Plato's Republic, he talks about the cycles, democracy

47:45.120 --> 47:53.360
and autocratic and the benevolent despot and all of that. Each has their own vulnerability. The

47:53.360 --> 47:59.920
vulnerability of democracy, which has been a remarkable, remarkable system and I don't have

47:59.920 --> 48:10.480
to extol the benefits of it. But the vulnerability of it has always been the internal conflict that

48:10.480 --> 48:21.680
produces itself as anarchy. In World War II, four democracies chose to be autocracies

48:22.960 --> 48:30.080
because there was internal disorder and there was the belief will somebody bring about order

48:30.080 --> 48:37.120
and get control of the situation. That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.

48:37.840 --> 48:45.360
They were parliamentary systems that turned themselves over to that. So, both systems

48:46.240 --> 48:54.720
have vulnerabilities. I think the main thing that we need to think about is those vulnerabilities.

48:54.720 --> 49:03.360
Democracy is an amazing system because the adherence to the rules and the system

49:03.360 --> 49:09.440
and the checks and balances is quite amazing and it gives it a flexibility to change without

49:09.440 --> 49:16.960
civil wars. But there has to be the respect of the rules. And when you see something like

49:18.240 --> 49:27.840
they will not accept elections or they will not accept rules, history has shown when the causes

49:27.920 --> 49:34.400
that people are behind are more important to them than the system. The system is in jeopardy.

49:34.400 --> 49:41.760
So, we have a situation that's very much like that in terms of, let's say, the 2024 elections.

49:42.480 --> 49:51.280
I believe that there's a very high chance that neither side will accept losing, for example.

49:51.760 --> 50:00.240
And so, we have that kind of a situation. So, one would hope that one could rise above the

50:00.240 --> 50:09.200
disagreements and rely on the system for resolving disagreements because if that doesn't happen,

50:09.200 --> 50:16.160
then we have our own chaos. So, the kind of the trend that started in 2020,

50:16.720 --> 50:24.960
or I suppose it's been growing. One representation of this internal disorder has been

50:24.960 --> 50:28.880
the growing trend of being skeptical about the results of the election.

50:29.520 --> 50:33.920
Well, it started before that. There was the emergence of population

50:35.040 --> 50:43.680
before President Trump was elected. He was basically elected as a populist because there

50:43.680 --> 50:50.000
was a large percentage of the population that felt that the system didn't work for them,

50:50.560 --> 50:57.600
and he tapped into that, and he was largely elected as a populist leader, first populist leader

50:57.600 --> 51:06.880
in a developed country. And so, populism began then, and that was a battle of one group against

51:06.960 --> 51:13.280
the other group. And so, since then, it's been like that, and it continued to grow.

51:17.920 --> 51:24.720
You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy, the internal disorder is the

51:24.720 --> 51:30.400
vulnerability of democracy. What's the vulnerability of a system like China? Maybe one way to

51:30.960 --> 51:34.880
say is put China aside and look at history, look at Soviet Union.

51:34.880 --> 51:38.960
What's the vulnerability of a communist-type system?

51:39.840 --> 51:48.960
Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic, depending on how much autocracy,

51:48.960 --> 51:58.720
is that it lacks flexibility. It lacks the ability, but I should deal with them differently.

51:59.440 --> 52:05.600
In other words, there's the economic system. The economic system threatens motivation

52:06.160 --> 52:15.440
and productivity. So, communism or socialism has to be done in a way where you can threaten

52:15.440 --> 52:24.000
productivity. Capitalism has, and what I mean by that, I mean free markets and capital markets.

52:24.640 --> 52:32.480
I've been an effective way of allocating resources and also creating the incentives

52:32.480 --> 52:38.400
and the resources, providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas. And so,

52:38.400 --> 52:46.000
if I compare that, what the Chinese have done, to a large extent, is to recognize that and have made

52:46.000 --> 52:53.920
a move, that's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict between those two things exist. But

52:53.920 --> 53:03.360
anyway, that's it. As far as an autocratic system, rather than one man, one vote from the population

53:03.360 --> 53:11.040
up, the risks of the autocratic system is that there's enough discontent that arises,

53:12.000 --> 53:20.080
that the system doesn't have the flexibility, and that rather than bending, it breaks.

53:21.360 --> 53:29.440
That's the big risk. The notion of trying to control a population, if there's that, rather

53:29.440 --> 53:36.000
than giving it the flexibility. So, that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.

53:36.080 --> 53:41.120
What's the human, because you mentioned like the top gets bigger with the empires,

53:42.400 --> 53:49.600
and you start taking things for granted, is some of this just human nature. So, the concern with

53:49.600 --> 54:00.400
China, with autocratic nations, the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union, was that

54:01.360 --> 54:07.600
fundamentally, at the individual level, the humans involved at the top, they start becoming,

54:07.600 --> 54:13.920
they're starting to lose touch with the reality, in a way that no longer makes them. I guess that's

54:13.920 --> 54:19.120
the representation of the flexibility that you're referring to. Well, I mean, in a democracy,

54:20.320 --> 54:25.680
you could change. You can go as far left or as far right. You can change the leaders easily,

54:25.680 --> 54:30.800
and so the people don't become, they pretty much only have themselves to blame.

54:33.920 --> 54:41.440
One of the problems of that is they may not choose the best leaders, but they have that

54:41.440 --> 54:48.960
flexibility. So, vote and you get what you wanted. In the case of the autocratic, let's say, leaders,

54:48.960 --> 54:57.360
and then the movement from democracies to autocracies, what you see normally, that movement,

54:57.360 --> 55:03.360
is that one of the systems is not working. Let's say the democracy is not effectively. Everybody's

55:03.360 --> 55:08.080
arguing with each other, and nobody's getting anything done, and you know, like Mussolini,

55:08.080 --> 55:13.840
the trains are not running on time, and that would be the example. Geez, this place has gotten

55:13.840 --> 55:21.520
chaotic. Well, somebody gets to control, and then you get the autocratic, and then he's

55:21.520 --> 55:29.680
autocratic enough to boss people around, and then you follow those kinds of orders, and it's like

55:29.680 --> 55:35.920
maybe a CEO in a powerful company ordering around, and that could work well or it could work badly.

55:36.400 --> 55:46.400
Most companies are run as like autocracies, in a sense. There's the hierarchy and the command

55:46.400 --> 55:56.320
economy and that kind of thing, and that can work well or not, but then quite often when you get the

55:56.320 --> 56:04.480
populist autocratic, their personality is something that they want to fight, and they become more

56:04.480 --> 56:12.240
nationalistic, and they tend to become more militaristic, and human nature at that stage

56:13.760 --> 56:19.680
lends itself to fighting. There's an arc here that when we think of a country,

56:20.800 --> 56:27.840
and we say we, and we think of a country, it's not true, it's not like that. There are individuals

56:27.840 --> 56:34.720
who change. One generation dies, and another generation comes along, and one of those arcs

56:34.720 --> 56:44.320
is that the ones who have been through war don't want to go to war and are more happily willing to

56:45.200 --> 56:51.520
abide by whatever the rules are. As you get farther along into that cycle, and you get a new

56:51.520 --> 56:59.440
generation, and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight,

56:59.440 --> 57:07.040
and so you're seeing right now the emerging of fight for right, and what that means is you see

57:07.040 --> 57:15.760
it internally. Fight, where are you in fight for that thing, and they mean fight, and then

57:15.840 --> 57:21.760
externally, fight, are you going to be the strong one who will fight and win,

57:21.760 --> 57:28.160
and that develops on both sides, this fight and win, and they side is cheering each other on

57:28.160 --> 57:35.680
into a war, but that comes by those who really have not experienced war because it comes

57:35.680 --> 57:39.840
in their part of their lifetime. Humans are fascinating.

57:40.560 --> 57:48.160
Humans are fascinating, and by the way, human nature has not changed over the thousands of years,

57:48.160 --> 57:54.000
so it's so interesting because like in doing this study, and it comes across in the study,

57:54.000 --> 58:01.040
it's like watching the same movie over and over again. You see the arc, and you see it happen

58:01.040 --> 58:06.080
over and over again. The only things that seem to change are the clothes people wear and the

58:06.080 --> 58:13.680
technologies they use. Yeah, and then somebody probably will disagree with you about the clothes,

58:13.680 --> 58:19.280
maybe there's also cycles within fashions. Maybe we're not even creative there. What do you

58:20.720 --> 58:26.320
make of Russia and Vladimir Putin? What do you think about Putin as a leader,

58:26.320 --> 58:32.960
as a human being on this world stage, within the context of the cycles of empires that you think about?

58:33.840 --> 58:42.560
Well, Putin came to power at the failure of Russia's last order, so there was the end of

58:42.560 --> 58:49.920
communism, and there was the development of the market economy, the collapse of the Soviet Union,

58:51.760 --> 59:01.200
and at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin who was an alcoholic and had problems

59:01.920 --> 59:09.600
managing and was put into power. The conditions in the Russian, there was anarchy,

59:10.800 --> 59:16.560
there was no money. It had the classic end of cycle ingredients. It was broke,

59:16.560 --> 59:22.320
it was people fighting with each other, it was the anarchy, and that's when he came to power.

59:23.040 --> 59:31.280
And there were not institutions, the whole thing had collapsed. It was not effective ministry of

59:31.280 --> 59:41.120
education, ministry of anything. And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability,

59:41.120 --> 59:47.280
and they needed a democracy, and they needed the improvement of capital markets.

59:47.280 --> 01:00:00.000
So he's been in that position as a, I guess I would call him a semi-autocratic leader in that,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:09.040
from all indications, he would respect the democracy, and he's very popular. He's won

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:16.720
democratic elections because he's been a strong leader, and he's brought peace and stability

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:27.280
to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. And he's a strong leader in pursuit of

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:39.840
the country's interests in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power,

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:50.400
but it is a significant military power. So the issues, and then there's a strong alliance between

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:59.440
Russia and China now. So that's kind of the lay of the land. And then there are sensitivities. The

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:08.320
Ukraine issue is a sensitivity because there are a lot of Russians who live in the Ukraine,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:15.520
and there's also the issue of NATO on their border. So there are those kinds of things,

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:23.040
and he has military power, and he has a strong alliance with China. And I guess that's my best

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:35.280
summary of what his position is. Strong leader, popular. These are not subjective interpretations.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.960
These are objective interpretations. Yeah, it's interesting. Just in this conversation,

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:47.840
you're not sort of doing the usual criticism of any one particular system. You're looking

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.760
at these systems from the perspective of history. You're just describing how they work. It's often

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.960
times when you talk about what Russia is today, or what the Soviet Union was, or what China is

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.240
today, is you start to criticize. Well, they do this kind of censorship, or they do this kind

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:10.000
of they limit freedoms in this kind of way. But you're just kind of describing this as a nation

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:15.760
with ideas, what they think is right. This is how they hope to get it to work. This is why

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.520
it's working. This is what's not working. Here's metrics that show that it's not working. I think

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.920
that's a refreshing way to think about it. It's easy though. I mean, you got some criticism

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.680
saying that I think China is a strict parent.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:39.840
You know, some people criticize these countries for violating human rights. I suppose there's some

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.200
people that criticize the United States for violating human rights. But what are your thoughts

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:55.680
on the world stage today about some of the behaviors it has governed in terms of respecting

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:02.880
the rights, the basic rights of human beings? You described accurately how I just tried to look

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:13.600
at things in a non, I don't want to impute my values on anybody. I mean, there are intolerable

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.040
things, so I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things. But one of the great things of being an

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.760
American here is that I grew up with all different nationalities, having all different points of

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:33.040
view and all different religions and all different ways of operating. And I've come to treasure the

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:40.480
fact that what's their business is their business. And then the question is, where do you cross the

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:46.960
line under what circumstances that others have got to do it my way? And then when you do it

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:55.120
internationally, the issue of what is a sovereign state, you know, which as I say in the piece of

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:02.560
Westphalia, and you have borders, and then when do you cross the line, that my way of doing things

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:07.360
has got to be their way of doing things or what are the various rights? And so that's a very

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:15.600
delicate question or a very difficult question. And we all have responsibilities to different

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.360
parties, and we all have different levels of knowledge about those particular things. So

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.000
for example, as an international investor, I have a responsibility to my investors.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:34.960
Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs of how do they run that. So if you're

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:44.320
taking Nike or Sinkers and so on, and Americans can decide whether they want to buy Chinese products

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:50.560
or not buy Chinese products, we are all faced with those types of choices. So you have what do

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.240
you want to do in your constituency, and you have your choices. And then beyond that, in many cases,

01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:02.480
the issues are quite complex, like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it. So

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:09.600
and then I believe that if you disconnect it, if all those

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:17.760
if entities like myself, the businesses doing business with China disconnected,

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.360
I think that that would be disastrous, economically disastrous. And it would also be

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:31.360
reduce the understanding that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:39.520
And so these are all complicated. So what we do is and who makes it my opinion matters the most.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.800
Why should it be my opinion that matters the most in making that decision? So I largely look at

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:50.720
the government guidance that I get not only from my own government, but from the other governments.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:57.200
And I follow the rules. I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries. And we want to do that in the best

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:03.520
way to provide the diversified portfolio. And we sort of need that. Every one of those countries

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:10.800
has similar complexities. There are always one issue or another. And there's only so much

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:16.000
that we really understand about all of those issues. So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:22.080
Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect to the culture, the place, the way things are done.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:31.440
You don't necessarily, the way you heal relationships between nations is like you said,

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:41.040
you work together. And that requires kind of to listen maybe more than you talk. And I think people

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:47.520
in the public sphere talk a lot about China without really listening, without understanding much

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.080
about China, without one of the things that makes me really sad because I know how to speak Russian

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:59.920
and I can, I know how much is lost in translation. It makes me sad that I'll never really get to

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:05.520
know the Chinese culture because like I'll never really get to know the language, the literature,

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.560
the just talk to regular people. It's not just the government or officials or scientists,

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.480
just regular folks get the culture. I think if you don't understand the culture,

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:22.240
just the basics of the human nature of what people love about their country, about their

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:27.040
family, what the kind of hopes they have, what kind of values they have without that,

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:35.760
you're not going to be able to fully connect with them. And you have to do that first,

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.160
to have a chance of building a good world. I couldn't agree with you more. I was very lucky

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:49.440
because as I say, since 1984, so for more than half of my life, I've been going there and the

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:55.200
common people and all sorts of people and I've got to meet them. I don't speak the language,

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:02.880
but a combination of through translators or them speaking English and being in situations,

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:10.720
I had my son go to school, a local school and we developed those kinds of understandings.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:21.040
I think that but the not wanting to know the other perspective is the thing that's most

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:31.120
scary. Like I'm right now in the middle and all I want to try to do is to help a mutual understanding.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.000
You're right. If there were questions probing me, asking me, what is it? I'm not on one side

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.920
or another. I don't want to be on one side or another. I believe that each has their right

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.560
within there to approach their different culture in their own way. So many ways you gave an example.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:09:03.200
If they're not doing harm to others, but that issue of trying to understand is so much better.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:13.520
That doesn't mean agree with. If you are wanting to out-clever and out-compete somebody, it still

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:20.400
pays to understand what they're thinking. So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,

01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:24.560
even if you want to go to war with them, that understanding is the best thing to have.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:33.360
What we have now is a situation in which there's an enemy mentality. That means that anything

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:41.760
that seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding seems to mistakenly create the

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:50.080
notion of I'm on their side in a war. That's a dangerous thing because there's a momentum here

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:56.880
to fight. Henry Kissinger praises your new book and you thank him in it in the dedication.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:02.320
What's your relationship like with him? What makes him interesting? Maybe what makes him

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.440
controversial? What makes him such a central figure in history? First, most importantly,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.200
he's unique about seeing things through all the other's eyes.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:23.360
It's like there's a chess game. I think geopolitics is like a chess game, but with

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:30.320
multiple chess players playing the same game. So imagine there are six people around playing

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:37.120
the chess game and he could sit in each seat and he could know how they see it

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:45.520
and see it in a calm way of how they see it. He's unique in that way. He's 98 years old

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:53.120
and he's equally able to do that. He has a background in which he's a historian, so he

01:10:53.120 --> 01:11:01.920
really understands history super terrifically. He doesn't understand economic history as much,

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.440
so that's why, to some extent, we enjoy having a conversation because he's interested in the

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.680
economic piece he doesn't know and I'm so interested in the geopolitical piece that I

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:20.400
don't know as well. But anyway, he's able to do that, but not only a historian, but a practitioner.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:31.200
So when you go from an academic to a practitioner who has that talent to see things through other's

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:38.400
eyes in an objective way and to be strategic rather than just tactical, that's a very special

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:44.320
person and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person. Yeah, he's lived a fascinating

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.600
life. Just all of the world events he's been involved in is fascinating and, like you said,

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:57.120
that's such an interesting skill to have to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:02.560
the fears of all the people at the table. What are they thinking? I find that people don't,

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.920
once again, don't do that enough when it's the obvious thing you should be doing, whether it's

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:16.320
business deals or political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation. I'm often surprised

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:24.560
again, sorry, to go to the Russian thing because I hear Putin talk in Russian and you start to

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.520
infer certain intentions, not the trivial stuff, like the human being. What is that human being

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.640
hoping for himself, for his country, for his close in a circle, for the bigger,

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:43.840
and I just see that that's often just lost in translation. I just see American leaders

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:51.360
talking to Putin and there's not a connection. Absolutely. I know exactly what you're talking

01:12:51.360 --> 01:13:00.400
about. It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation or even reading a speech

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:08.960
or, and you see then it reported. Inevitably, the reporter picks some

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:16.240
headline characterization that has very little to do with what was really happening,

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:22.800
but might be a headline grabber that's at some kind of distortion and there's a lack of understanding

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.560
of really what's going on. If it's okay, let me ask you a couple of questions about cryptocurrency.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.800
You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years. What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today?

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:40.560
Its role in the global financial system and just in human society in general?

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:47.040
Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years is one of the things that has

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:58.320
influenced changes in my view. It has proven itself. Something like 10, 11 years ago, imagine

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.160
the programming of this and here's the, you throw it out and that's the idea. It has not been hacked.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:14.720
It has operated, it has built, it has come an amazing way over that 11 years to be

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:24.800
maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people and has been used and is now

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:34.560
has obtained the status of having imputed value. At the same time, it is one of those assets

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:42.400
that is an alternative money. I think we're entering an era where there's going to be a

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:53.280
competition of monies because of the printing of fiat money and the depreciated value. There will

01:14:53.280 --> 01:15:01.120
be a competition of monies and Bitcoin is part of that competition, but there'll be many monies,

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:08.000
not just crypto monies, but there'll be central bank crypto monies, but there'll be different

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:16.960
kinds of monies. Even monies are things that you buy and sell. NFTs can become a money,

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.880
a type of money. You own it and it's an investment and you could say, I'd rather own it than own

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.520
Bitcoin. Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs? Not yet.

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:38.160
But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs to just experience them. I think I should

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:45.040
produce one. I should have asked that. Have you minted an NFT? You probably should just to know

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:51.280
what it's like. Yeah, that's right. This stuff is happening. This stuff is real and how it operates,

01:15:51.840 --> 01:16:01.360
but like all new real things, some are going to go and it's like in the internet in the year 2000,

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.560
pets.com could have been a great, but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows. That's

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.520
the beauty of the competitive system that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured and some

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:22.880
things will be trashed. But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment of what is an

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.400
alternative money. Money has two purposes, a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth.

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:37.760
We are looking for and it's portable and it's best if it's recognized in other countries.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:48.400
Gold is one of those. I look at it as an alternative gold, but I look at a number of things as an

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:57.440
alternative gold. Gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities. For example,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.640
you can't trace it. In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it, where it's going and so on. Governments

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.720
can have that ability to trace it and so on. A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:16.960
I think not connected has benefits, particularly in a world where maybe connections can be more

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:28.320
risky. Gold has been, for many thousands of years, universally recognized as a source of money

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:34.800
and central banks. It's the third largest source of money in central bank reserves.

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:42.240
I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve those types of purposes and so on. For various reasons,

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.240
I prefer gold to the other, but it's a little bit part of my mix.

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:53.120
But then you look at it, it hit I think 69,000 this year is the high Bitcoin hit. Do you think

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:59.760
it's possible? You mentioned gold. Do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers like

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:06.000
one million that some people talk about? I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:19.520
is there's a certain amount of it and there's a certain amount of gold. I'll use gold as a benchmark.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:29.520
The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion. Total crypto is about $2.2 trillion,

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:36.960
but let's say Bitcoin. It's $1 trillion. If you take the amount of money that is in

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:45.840
gold that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks, and I assume

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:52.880
Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes, that amount in gold is

01:18:52.880 --> 01:19:01.280
about $5 trillion. Right now, if you were to have a portfolio that has gold and crypto,

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:09.120
gold and Bitcoin, it's worth about 20% of the value of gold. Do I think it's going to be

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.800
worth more than gold in terms of that mix? I don't think it'll be worth more than gold,

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:24.160
but let's say it became worth as much as gold. I don't believe it will be. I think the 20%

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:30.320
sounds kind of about right. I really don't know what the right answer is. Then there's the question

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:37.280
of what is all of that pool of money that let's say gold and gold equivalents relative to everything

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:46.000
else. Does it go from let's call it $6, $7, $8 trillion to $16 trillion? Maybe it could double.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.360
It depends what it is in the world environment, but basically, if you use gold as a measure,

01:19:54.160 --> 01:20:01.600
it just makes no sense that it's going to be used that much more. Am I sure about that?

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:09.280
I'm not sure about anything, but logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation on its price

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.000
in relationship to other things that are like it.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.960
Let me ask for your deep financial analysis on a very important issue. I just talked a couple

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.160
days ago with Elon Musk. He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon. What are your

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:33.040
thoughts about Dogecoin? Do you think it'll be the official currency? Maybe reserve currency on

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:41.520
the moon and on Mars? My reaction is, that's cute. I remember Elon when he first got his money from

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:49.200
PayPal. I think he said to me, he got $180 million, $90 million. He decided to say,

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:57.680
why aren't we going to outer space? He wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:12.720
using Russian technology to put a plant and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:25.200
was. He said, first life on Mars or first life on that as an inspiring notion. Then,

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:32.560
there's always what's behind it. I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability to do other things

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:41.040
behind it. I would take that as symbolic and I'd be asking him, what's behind it? What's next?

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:46.720
I'm also just on the topic of Dogecoin and Memecoin. There's some aspect of humor and

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:53.520
lightheartedness that's really interesting about the way we communicate, what ideas become viral,

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.920
how to captivate people with ideas. There's something about taking things too seriously

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:04.640
that somehow slows it all down. It's interesting. You're right. That's part of human nature

01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:13.200
somehow. Humor is part of this whole thing. You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:20.960
and you have- Principles in particular. Principles. You have this really nice thing in your book where

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:31.920
you actually, I think there's such a brilliant way of highlighting which parts are extra important

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.880
and you make them bold. That's a brilliant idea. Let me just ask the high level question of what's

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:46.480
a good system for taking notes? Well, I find that almost everything happens over and over again.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:56.480
We're in the blizzard of these things happening. What I found is that if I'm making a decision

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:07.680
that after I make the decision usually or right at the time, if I pause and reflect and I write my

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:16.480
principle down, in other words, principle is sort of a recipe, how would I make that decision

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:22.560
and what are the criteria around it? I find that I make it much more clear. It becomes clear

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:28.880
and it applies to the next thing that comes along. It'll be that way because everything

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:35.120
happens over and over and over again. I think people make the mistake of looking at just the

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.880
one like it's the first one. I don't know. They have the first problem of this sort of the first

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.560
child or whatever it is. This has been happening plenty of times. If you have the principles,

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:53.040
I found that that helped me think more clearly about it and it helped me communicate better

01:23:53.040 --> 01:24:01.280
like why. Over the years, over the last 30 years or so, that's what I've done. I did it originally

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:07.760
to communicate very well with the people I work with. I set up my company and it was very important

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:13.360
to have good communication. Then we could debate the principles. That's the process.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:21.520
I urge people to do that. There are many excellent decision makers and I just wish that

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:29.600
they wrote down their principles when this set. For example, we're talking about Henry Kissinger

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:36.240
and his new book is going to come out with a book on leadership. Don't just describe the leaders.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:43.040
Describe then what about them were the essential elements to make a good leader under what

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:52.480
circumstances. If we think about that, then you begin to think in a principled way. Then

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:58.960
when you start to think in a principled way, life becomes so much easier to make decisions and it's

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:06.400
so much less confusing because it's like coming up on a species and you say, okay, well, what

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:13.680
species is it? Not just another, it's a thing. What species is it and how do I deal with that

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:20.720
species effectively? That's what that is. I encourage people to write it down. I wish

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.840
anybody who's successful wrote down their principles or their recipes for making those

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:33.360
types of decisions. The events of interest here happens over and over and over in similar ways.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.720
As you're looking for the patterns and you're defining the process, that's right to respond

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.520
to those patterns and you call that the principles. That allows you to deal with the

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:51.440
future effectively. That codifies the lessons from the past to be able to deal with the future.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:58.800
What advice do you have for young folks today in high school, in college, thinking about how to live,

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.720
have a career they can be proud of or maybe have a life they can be proud of?

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.680
Know yourself, follow your passion. Make your work and passion the same thing

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:18.880
while considering the money part because money will get you freedom and choice and be able to

01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:31.360
beg that. If you know yourself, feel the pull and pursue that passion. Along those lines,

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:38.640
by the way, I found that using personality profile tests has been very helpful. I've used

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:44.000
those for about 25 years for people to help to understand themselves and understand each other.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I created a free one that is called Principles You. It's online. It's had remarkable,

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:01.120
loving people who've taken it learn about themselves, but also you can put in somebody else

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.720
and it'll tell you about your relationship with them. That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.920
but the main thing is to understand on your journey, your hero's journey,

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:23.440
that you will have mistakes and you will have weaknesses and to understand those,

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:30.960
not fight those because by understanding mistakes, you will learn not to make mistakes again.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:40.400
I have a principle which is pain plus reflection equals progress. That reflection is important to

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:47.120
know yourself, know your pulls, know your weaknesses. When you also know your weaknesses and the

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.960
strengths of other people, there are people who have strengths where you're weak and you have

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.800
strengths where they're weak. To be able to work well together is the most effective way of

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:08.800
achieving success. It's that journey and there's a life arc and there's a journey and you want to

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:17.600
make it the best that you can make it. It's like a video game. It has the challenges and the

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:25.600
obstacles and the learning experiences and the temptations and all of that. The maximizing

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:31.680
learning to go where you want to go to achieve the life you want is the most important. That's

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:40.320
kind of maybe a long-winded way of seeing it. I'll try to say it simply. There's a five-step

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:49.840
process. Step one is know your goals. Know what you're going after. You could have almost anything

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.400
you want, but you can't have everything you want. You have to prioritize and you move in

01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:00.080
that direction. On the way to your goals, you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:08.480
Step two is understanding your problems and your obstacles. Identify them. Step three

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:16.400
is to diagnose them to get at the root cause of the problem. That could be many root causes,

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.520
but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others, but you have to be objective about them.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.960
Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four, which is to design a way to get around them.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:37.440
Then, after you have that design, you implement that design. You have to follow through and do it.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:46.720
That will then produce its new results, which should be better results. I call this the looping

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:54.320
process. It's the evolutionary looping process. You just keep doing that and you learn over a

01:29:54.320 --> 01:30:00.080
period of time and you move in the direction that you want. Last question, and you only have one

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:08.080
minute to answer it. You dedicate the book, quote, to my grandchildren and those of their generation,

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:15.040
who will be participants in the continuation of the story. May the force of evolution be with you.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:22.400
Let me ask, where is this force of evolution taking human civilization and what in this story

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:30.320
that evolution is writing gives you hope? Evolution is a direction toward improvement.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:42.160
The greatest force is man's capacity to adapt and invent. You see in the charts in the book,

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:54.000
you see that this upward movement, life expectancy, health, all the things that we

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.400
think are better, there's a chart and it shows that over a period of time. You barely see

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:09.600
the downturns from depressions and wars in that. That is the greatest power. Man's ability to

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:16.400
invent and adapt is evolution and that's the greatest power and that is what

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:23.120
gives me justifiable hope. A continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,

01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:28.640
maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species. Not only will we keep creating amazing things here

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:35.120
on earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos. My time horizon isn't going to have me

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:42.080
analyzing that yet, but I hope so and I agree that that would be in the natural.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.480
So I'm not going to ask you for the best financial system on Mars. I think we'll

01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:51.120
focus on earth for now. Thank you so much for your brilliance, for the books you've written,

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:57.040
for the works you've done, for the inspiration of millions. And thank you for spending your valuable

01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:02.560
time here with me today. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.160
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.960
And now, let me leave you with some words from Ray Dalio himself. Every time you confront something

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:18.240
painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life. You have the opportunity

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:24.320
to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.280
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
