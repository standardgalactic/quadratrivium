0	5120	The following is a conversation with Lee Cronin, a chemist from the University of Glasgow,
5120	9840	who is one of the most fascinating, brilliant, out-of-the-box thinking scientists I have ever
9840	16480	spoken to. This episode was recorded more than two weeks ago, so the war in Ukraine is not mentioned.
17120	21360	I have been spending a lot of time each day talking to people in Ukraine and Russia.
22000	26320	I have family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones in both countries.
27200	32000	I will try to release a solo episode on this war, but I have been failing to find the words that
32000	39360	make sense of it, for myself and others, so I may not. I ask for your understanding no matter
39360	46000	which path I take. Most of my time is spent trying to help as much as I can privately.
47040	51120	I am talking to people who are suffering, who are angry, afraid.
51520	58000	When I returned to this conversation with Lee, I couldn't help but smile. He is a beautiful,
58000	63760	brilliant, and hilarious human being. He is basically a human manifestation of the mad scientist
63760	69440	Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. I thought about quitting this podcast for a time,
70080	76400	but for now at least, I will keep going. I love people too much. You, the listener.
76640	83840	I meet folks on the street or when I run. You say a few kind words about the podcast,
83840	89200	and we talk about life, the small things, and the big things. All of it gives me hope.
90320	97120	People are just amazing. You are amazing. I ask for your support, wisdom, and patience
97120	103600	as I keep going with this silly little podcast, including through some difficult conversations.
104480	109200	And hopefully, many fascinating and fun ones too.
112080	117040	This is Alex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.
117600	121200	And now, dear friends, here's Lee Cronin.
122400	128480	How do you think life originated on Earth, and what insights does that give us about life?
129280	136320	If we go back to the origin of Earth, and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago,
136320	140560	planet was quite hot. There was a limited number of minerals. There was some carbon,
140560	146960	some water. And I think that maybe it's a really simple set of chemistry that we really don't
146960	151920	understand. So that means you've got a finite number of elements that are going to react
151920	158320	very simply with one another. And out of that mess comes a cell. So literally sand turns into cells.
158800	163520	And it seems to happen quick. So what I think I can say with some degree of,
164320	170160	I think, not certainty, but curiosity, genuine curiosity is that life happened fast.
170160	176880	Yeah. So when we say fast, this is a pretty surprising fact, and maybe you can actually
176880	183120	correct me and elaborate, but it seems like most, like 70 or 80% of the time that Earth has been
183120	187840	around has been life on it, like some very significant percentage. So when you say fast,
187840	193680	like the slow part is from single cell or from bacteria to something more complicated
193680	198640	organism. It seems like most of the time that Earth has been around, it's been single cell
199360	204640	or like very basic organisms, like a couple of billion years. But yeah, you're right. That's
204640	212720	really, I recently kind of revisited our history and saw this. And I was just looking at the timeline,
212720	218800	wait a minute, like how did life just spring up so quickly? Like really quickly? That makes me
218800	224880	think that it really wanted to, like put another way, it's very easy for life to spring.
225920	233120	Yeah, I agree. I think it's much more inevitable. And I think I try to kind of not provoke, but try
233120	236960	and push chemists to think about this, because chemists are essential to this problem, right?
238000	242240	Understanding the origin of life on Earth, at least, because we're made of chemistry.
242240	247520	But I wonder if the origin of life on a planet also, the emergence of life on the planet is as
249680	256240	common as the formation of a star. And if you start framing it in that way, it allows you to then
256240	260480	look at the universe slightly differently, because, and we can get into this, I think,
260480	266720	in quite some detail. But I think to come back to your question, I have little idea of how life
266720	273840	got started. But I know it was simple. And I know that the process of selection had to occur before
274560	282480	the biology was established, so that selection built the framework from which life kind of grew
282480	287440	in complexity and capability and functionality and autonomy. And I think these are all really
287440	293280	important words that we can unpack over the next while. Can you say all the words again? So you
294000	299760	say selection, so natural selection, the original A-B testing.
299760	306400	And then complexity, and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication. Because I think
306400	312480	that people misunderstand what life is. Some people say that life is a cell, and some people
312480	321040	that say that life is a virus, or life is an on-off switch. I don't think it's that.
321040	327520	Life is the universe developing a memory. And the laws of physics, and the way, well,
327520	333280	there are no laws of physics. Physics is just memory-free stuff, right? So there's only a
333280	338640	finite number of ways you can arrange the fundamental particles to do the things.
338640	348240	Life is the universe developing a memory. So it's like sewing a piece of art slowly,
349200	356960	and then you can look back at it. So there's a stickiness to life. It's like
356960	362560	universe doing stuff. And when you say memory, there's a stickiness to a bunch of the stuff
362560	371680	it's building together. So you can, in a stable way, trace back the complexity that tells a
371680	377040	coherent story. Yeah. And I think, yeah. Okay. That's, by the way, very poetic.
378320	385840	Beautiful. Life is the universe developing a memory. Okay. And then there's autonomy,
385840	390960	you said, complexity we'll talk about. But it's a really interesting idea, the selection
390960	398720	preceded biology. Yeah, I think. So what, first of all, what is chemistry? Like,
398800	403520	the sand still count as chemistry? Sure. I mean, as a chemist, a card carrying
403520	406880	chemist, if I'm allowed a card, I don't know. I don't know what I am most days.
406880	411360	What is the card made of? What's the chemical composition of the card?
412320	416400	So what is chemistry? Well, chemistry is the thing that happens when you bring electrons
416400	421760	together and you form bonds. So bonds, or I say to people when they talk about life elsewhere,
422480	426960	and I just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope. Because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity,
426960	432080	they allow you to record those memories. Or at least on Earth, you could imagine,
433280	437920	you know, a Stanislaw Lemtripe world where you might have life emerging or intelligence
437920	444080	emerging before life. That may be something like Solaris or something. But, you know, to get to
444080	451360	selection, if atoms can combine and form bonds, those bonds, those atoms can bond to different
451360	456560	elements and those molecules will have different identities and interact with each other
456640	461200	differently. And then you can start to have some degree of causation or interaction,
461200	469760	and then selection, and then existence. And then you go up the kind of the path of complexity.
469760	476480	And so at least on Earth, as we know it, there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals to
476480	483120	start searching that combinatorial space or bonds. So, okay, this is a really interesting
483120	489200	question. Let's let's lay it out. So, bonds, almost like cards, we say there's bonds,
490080	496080	there's life, there's intelligence, there's consciousness. And what you just made me realize
497680	506080	is those can emerge, or let's put bonds aside, those can emerge in any order.
507040	514640	That's really brilliant. So, intelligence can come before life. It's like panpsychists believe
514640	523280	that consciousness, I guess, comes before life and before intelligence. So, consciousness permeates
523280	528720	all matter, it's some kind of fabric of reality. Okay, so within this framework, you can kind of
528720	535280	arrange everything. But you need to have the bonds that precedes everything else.
535280	540320	Oh, and the other thing is selection. So, like the mechanism of selection, that could
541520	546160	precede, he couldn't that precede bonds to whatever the hell selection is?
546160	552560	I would say that there is an elegant order to it that bonds allow selection, allows the emergence
552560	558480	of life, allows the emergence of multicellularity, and then more information processing, building
558480	563840	state machines all the way up. However, you could imagine a situation if you had, I don't know,
563840	569280	a neutron star or a sun or what a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another, and these
569280	573280	oscillators building state machines, and these state machines reading something out in the environment.
574240	579360	Over time, these state machines would be able to literally record what happened in the past and
579360	585440	sense what's going on in the present and imagine the future. However, I don't think it's ever going
585440	591200	to be within a human comprehension, that type of life. I wouldn't count it out because,
592160	595760	you know, whenever you, I know in science, whenever I say something's impossible,
595760	599120	I then wake up the next day and say, no, that's actually wrong. I mean, there are some limits,
599120	603360	of course. I don't see myself traveling fast and light anytime soon.
603360	606640	Eric Weinstein says that's possible, so he will say you're up.
606640	610800	Sure, but I'm an experimentalist as well. So, one of my, I have two superpowers.
611600	616160	My stupidity, and I don't mean that as a, you know, I'm like absolutely completely
616160	620240	witless, but I mean my ability to kind of just start again and ask the question,
620240	624960	and then do it with an experiment. I always wanted to be a theoretician growing up, but I just didn't
624960	630080	have the, just didn't have the intellectual capability, but I was able to think of experiments
630080	635680	in my head. I could then do in my lab or in the, you know, when I was a child outside,
635680	639920	and then those experiments in my head and then outside reinforced one another.
639920	644240	So, I think that's a very good way of kind of grounding the science, right?
644240	648480	Well, that's the nice way to think about theoreticians is they're just people who run
648480	652240	experiments in their head. I mean, that's exactly what Einstein did, right? And but you're also
652240	657040	capable of doing that in the head, in your head, inside your head, and in the real world, and
657040	663120	the connection between the two is when you first discovered your superpower stupidity. I like it.
663120	668320	Yes, there you go. Okay, what's the second superpower, your accent, or is that?
668320	673680	Well, I don't know. I am genuinely curious. So, my curiosity, so I have a, you know,
673680	678080	like everybody, ego problems, but my curiosity is bigger than my ego. So, as long as that happens,
678720	684160	I can, I can. That's awesome. That is so powerful. You're just dropping some powerful lines. So,
684160	689280	curiosity is bigger than ego. That's something I have to think about, because you always struggle
689280	696880	about the role of ego in life. And that's, that's so nice to think about. Don't think about the
696880	701360	size of ego, the absolute size of ego, think about the relative size of ego to the other,
702160	706480	the other horse is pulling at you. And if the curiosity one is bigger,
706480	712800	then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to. Anyway, so those are the two
712800	717920	superpowers. How do those connect to natural selection or selection and bonds? And I forgot
717920	722400	already, life and consciousness. So, we're going back to selection in the universe and origin of
722400	728560	life on earth. I mean, selection is a, I'm convinced that selection is a force in the
728560	734400	universe. So, not me, not a fundamental force, but a, but a directing, but it is a directing force,
734400	741360	because existence, although existence appears to be the default, the existence of what? Why does,
742880	748320	we can get to this later, I think, but it's amazing that, that discrete things exist.
749040	753600	And, you know, you see this cup, it's not the, you know, sexiest cup in the world,
753680	759760	but it's pretty functional. This cup, the complexity of this cup isn't just in the object,
759760	764320	it is literally the lineage of people making cups and recognizing that, seeing that in their head,
764320	769280	making an abstraction of a cup and then making a different one. So, I wonder how many billions of
769280	775040	cups have, you know, come before this one. And that's a process of selection and existence. And
775040	779040	the only reason the cup is still used is quite useful, like the handle, you know, it's convenient,
779040	785600	so I don't die, I keep hydration. And so, I think we are missing something fundamental in the universe
785600	793120	about selection. And I think what biology is, is a, is a selection amplifier. And that the,
793120	798000	this is where autonomy comes in. And actually, I think that how humanity is going to humans and,
799040	803680	autonomous robots or whatever we're going to call them in the future, we'll supercharge that even
803680	808080	further. So, selection is happening in the universe. But if you look in the asteroid belt,
808800	814480	selection, if objects are being kicked in and out the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite
814480	818640	complex, you don't really look at that as productive selection, because it's not doing anything to
818640	824480	improve its function. But is it? The asteroid belt has existed for some time. So, there is some
824480	832160	selection going on, but the functionality is somewhat limited. On Earth, at the formation of
832240	838720	Earth, interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment gave selection, and then things
838720	842800	could happen. Because you could think about, in chemistry, we can have an infinite number of
842800	846960	reactions happen, but they don't all, all the reactions are allowed to happen don't happen,
846960	852160	why? Because they're energy barriers. So, there must be some things called catalysts out there, or
852800	856960	there are bits of minerals, that when two molecules get together on that mineral,
856960	861600	it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction. And so, the reaction is, is promoted. So,
861600	867040	suddenly you get one reaction over another series of possibilities occurring that makes a particular
867040	872560	molecule, and this keeps happening in steps. And before you know it, these, almost these waves
872560	880480	as discrete reactions work together, and you start to build a machinery that, that is run by
880480	887920	existence. So, as you, you go forward in time, the fact of the molecules, the bonds are getting,
887920	892320	there are more bonds in a molecule, there's more function, there's more capability for this molecule
892320	897600	to interact with other molecules, to redirect them, it's like a series of little, and I don't want
897600	903840	to use this term too much, but it's almost thinking about the simplest von Neumann constructor,
904560	908320	that's the simplest molecule that could build a more complicated molecule, build a more complicated
908320	912720	molecule. And before you know it, when that more complicated molecule can act on the causal chain
912720	918400	that's produced itself, and change it, suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy,
918400	924640	and that's where life I think emerges in earnest. Every single word in the past few paragraphs,
924640	932160	let's break those apart. But who's von Neumann, what's the constructor, the closing of the loop
932160	938960	that you're talking about, the molecule that starts becoming the, I think you said like the
939040	945360	smallest von Neumann constructor, the smallest, the minimal, so what do all those things mean,
945360	951200	and what is, what are we supposed to imagine when we think about the smallest von Neumann constructor?
951200	956400	So, John von Neumann is a real hero, actually, not just me, but many people, I think, computer
956400	963040	science and physics. He was an incredible intellect, who probably solved a lot of the problems that
963120	968960	we're working on today, I just forgot to write them down. And I'm not sure if it's John von Neumann
968960	974800	or Johnny, as I think his friends called him, but I think he was Hungarian, mathematician,
974800	980800	came to the US, and basically was involved in the Manhattan Project and developing computation,
981440	986400	and came up with all sorts of ideas, and I think it was one of the first people to come up with
986400	991760	cellular automata. And but he- Really? I didn't know this little fact. I think so, I think so,
992240	996720	Well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it, he probably did come up with it and didn't write
996720	1000000	it down. There was a couple of people did at the same time, and then Conway obviously took it on,
1000000	1006240	and then Wolfram loves CAs, there is his fabric of the universe. And what I think he imagined was
1006240	1013120	that he wasn't satisfied, and this may be incorrect recollection, but so a lot of what I say is going
1013120	1018640	to be kind of, you know, just way out of my- You're just part of the universe,
1019600	1024080	creating its memory, designing- Exactly, yeah, rewriting history.
1024080	1028080	Rewriting history. Exactly, imperfectly. So, but what I mean is, I think he would,
1028080	1034880	he liked this idea of thinking about how could a Turing machine literally build
1034880	1039520	itself without a Turing machine, right? It's like, literally, how did state machines emerge?
1039520	1044080	And I think that von Neumann constructors, he was, wanted to conceive of a minimal thing,
1044640	1050560	autonomous, that could build itself. And what would those rules look like in the world?
1050560	1054880	And that's what a von Neumann kind of constructor looked like, like it's a minimal hypothetical
1054880	1061840	object that could build itself, self-replicate. And I'm really fascinated by that, because I think
1061840	1068640	that, although it's probably not exactly what happened, it's a nice model, because as chemists,
1068640	1073120	if we could go back to the origin of life and think about, what is a minimal machine
1074080	1080320	that can get structured randomly, so like with no prime mover, with no, with no architect,
1081120	1086880	and it symbols through just existence. So random stuff bumping in together, and you make this
1086880	1092720	first molecule. So you have molecule A. And molecule A interacts with another random molecule B,
1092720	1096800	and they get together, and they realize by working together, they can make more of themselves.
1097520	1103520	But then they realize they can mutate, so they can make AB prime. So AB prime is different to AB,
1104160	1110880	and then AB prime can then act back where A and B are being created, and slightly nudge
1110880	1120480	that causal chain, and make AB prime more evolvable, or learn more. So that's the closing the loop part.
1120480	1127120	Closing the loop part, got it. It feels like the mutation part is not that difficult. It feels
1127120	1134560	like the difficult part is just creating a copy of yourself at step one. That seems like
1134560	1140960	one of the greatest inventions in the history of the universe is the first molecule that figured
1140960	1148720	out, holy shit, I can create a copy of myself. How hard is that? I think it's really, really easy.
1149600	1155600	Okay, I did not expect that. I think it's really, really easy. Well, let's take a step back. I think
1155600	1162800	replicating molecules are rare. But if you say, you know, I think I was saying on, I probably got
1162800	1168160	into trouble on Twitter, there's about more than 18 mils of water in there. So one mole of water,
1168160	1173520	6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules, that's about the number of stars in the universe,
1173520	1177040	I think, of the order. So there's three universe worth, but between one and...
1177040	1178400	So many corrected John Twitter.
1178400	1183680	Yeah, I'm always being corrected. It's a great fact. But there's a lot of molecules in the water.
1184000	1189440	And so there's a lot of... So although it's for you and me really hard to conceive of,
1189440	1196480	if existence is not the default for a long period of time, because what happens is the molecules
1196480	1201760	get degraded. So much of the possibilities in the universe are just broken back into atoms.
1201760	1207040	So you have this kind of destruction of the molecules for our chemical reactions.
1207680	1212160	So you only need one or two molecules to become good at copying themselves,
1212160	1217600	for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool and start to grow. And so then replication
1217600	1223760	actually over time, when you have bonds, I think is much simpler and much easier. And I even found
1223760	1229360	this in my lab years ago, I had one of the reasons I started doing inorganic chemistry
1229360	1234960	and making rust, making a bit of rust based on a thing called molybdenum. Molybdenum oxide
1234960	1240800	is this molybdenum oxide, very simple. But when you add acid to it and some electrons,
1240800	1245760	they make these molecules, you just cannot possibly imagine would be constructed big,
1245760	1253680	gigantic wheels of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel or an icosidodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms,
1254240	1258640	all in the same pot. And I realized when I just finished experiments two years ago,
1258640	1261840	I've just published a couple of papers on this, that there are actually...
1262560	1267680	There is a random small molecule with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly,
1267680	1273040	but it happens to template its own production. And then by chance, it templates the ring,
1273920	1280240	just an accident, just like just an absolute accident. And that ring also helps make the small
1280960	1288320	12 mer. And so you have what's called an autocatalytic set, where A makes B,
1289040	1295280	and B helps make A and vice versa, and you then make this loop. So it's a bit like
1296240	1304560	these, they all work in synergy to make this chain of events that grow. And it doesn't take
1305200	1311680	a very sophisticated model to show that if you have these objects are competing and then collaborating
1311680	1316880	to help one another build, they just grow out of the mess. And although they seem improbable,
1316880	1323280	they are improbable, in fact, impossible in one step. There's multiple steps. This is when the
1323760	1330480	people look at the blind watchmaker argument, and you talk about how could a watch spontaneously
1330480	1337120	emerge? Well, it doesn't. It's a lineage of watches and cruder devices that are bootstrapped onto
1337120	1345920	one another. Right. So it's very improbable, but once you get that little discovery, like with the
1345920	1355760	wheel and fire, it just explodes in because it's so successful, it explodes. It's basically
1357120	1363360	selection. So this templating mechanism that allows you to have a little blueprint for yourself,
1363360	1366320	how you go through different procedures is to build copies of yourself.
1367040	1373760	I don't know. So in chemistry, somehow it's possible to imagine that that kind of thing
1374720	1380160	is easy to spring up. In more complex organisms, it feels like a different thing and much more
1380160	1386160	complicated. Like we're having like multiple abstractions of the birds and the bees conversation
1386160	1391280	here. But with humans, sorry, with complex organisms, it feels like difficult to have
1391280	1402320	reproduction. That's going to get clipped out. I'm going to make fun of that. It's difficult
1402320	1408560	to develop this idea of making copies of yourself or no. Because that seems like a magical idea for
1408560	1417600	life. Wow. That feels like very necessary for what selection is, for what evolution is,
1417600	1424240	but then if selection precedes all of this, then maybe these are just like echoes of the
1425120	1429680	selecting mechanism at different scales. Yeah, that's exactly it. So selection is the default
1429680	1437280	in the universe, if you want to. And what happens is that life, the solution that life has got on
1437280	1444000	earth, life on earth, biology on earth is unique to earth. We can talk about that. And that was
1444000	1449440	really hard fought for. But that was that is a solution that works on earth, the ribosome,
1449440	1455040	the fundamental machine that is responsible for every life for, you know, every cell on earth
1455040	1460080	of whatever wherever it is in the in the thick kingdom of life. That is an incredibly complex
1460080	1465520	object. But it was evolved over time. And it wasn't involved in a vacuum. And I think that
1465520	1473920	once we understand that selection can occur without the ribosome, but what the ribosome does
1474160	1479920	is it's a phase transition in replication. And I think that that and also technology that is
1481680	1488880	probably much easier to get to than we think. Why do you put the ribosome as a central
1490480	1495120	part of living organisms on earth? It basically is a combination of two different polymer
1495120	1502320	systems. So RNA and peptides. So the RNA world, if you like, gets transmitted and builds proteins,
1502320	1506480	and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis, the majority of the catalysis goes on
1506480	1514240	the cell. No ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution. So ribosome is looking at the action.
1514240	1520000	You don't put like the RNA itself as the critical thing, like information, you put action as the
1520000	1524080	most important thing. I think the actual molecules that we have in biology right now, entirely
1524080	1529040	contingent on the history of life on earth, they could, there are so many possible solutions.
1529120	1532720	And this is where chemistry got itself into origin of life chemistry, gets itself into
1532720	1536560	a bit of a trap. Yeah, let me interrupt you there. You've tweeted, you're going to get,
1536560	1541360	I'm going to set your tweets like it's Shakespeare. Okay. It's surprising you haven't
1541360	1547120	gotten canceled on Twitter yet. It's your brilliance once again saves you. I'm just kidding.
1549040	1552720	You like to have a little bit of fun on Twitter. You've tweeted that quote,
1552800	1560400	origin of life research is a scam. So if this is Shakespeare, can we analyze this word? Why is
1560400	1564880	the origin of life research a scam? Aren't you kind of doing origin of life research?
1566640	1571680	Okay, it was tongue-in-cheek, but yeah, I think, and I meant it as tongue-in-cheek. I am, I'm not
1571680	1577440	doing, I'm not doing the origin of life research, I'm trying to make artificial life. And I also
1577440	1582320	want to bound the likelihood of the origin of life on earth, but more importantly, to find
1582320	1587120	origin of life elsewhere. But let me directly address the tweet. There are many, many good
1587120	1591920	chemists out there doing origin of life research, but I want to nudge them. And I think they're
1591920	1596480	brilliant. Like, there's no, there's, there's no question. The chemistry they are doing,
1596480	1601760	their motivation is great. So what I meant by that tweet is saying that maybe they're making
1601760	1608160	assumptions about saying, if only I could make this particular type of molecule, say this RNA
1608240	1616480	molecule, or this phosphodiester, or this other molecule, it's going to somehow unlock the origin
1616480	1622960	of life. And I think that origin of life has been looking at this for a very long time. And whilst I,
1622960	1629760	I think it's brilliant to work out how you can get to those molecules, I think that chemistry
1629760	1636400	and chemists doing origin of life could be nudged into doing something even more profound. And,
1636480	1642800	and so the argument I'm making, it's a bit like right now, let's say, I don't know, the first Tesla
1642800	1647600	that makes its way to, I don't know, into a new country in the world, let's say I,
1648240	1652000	let's say there's a country X that has never had a Tesla before and they get the Tesla.
1652000	1655680	Russia. And they take the Tesla, and what they do is they take the Tesla apart and say,
1655680	1659920	we want to find the origin of cars in the universe and say, okay, how did this form and
1659920	1664000	how did this form? And they just randomly keep making till they make the door, they make the
1664000	1667760	wheel, they make the steering column and all this stuff. And, and they say, well, that's the
1667760	1672160	route. That's the way, that's the way cars emerge on earth. But actually, we know that there's a
1672160	1676720	causal chain of cars going right back to Henry Ford and the horse and carriage. And before that,
1676720	1684240	maybe, you know, where people were using wheels. And, and I think that obsession with the identities
1684240	1690240	that we see in biology right now are giving us a false sense of security about what we're looking for.
1690880	1700080	And I think the origin of life chemistry is in danger of, of not making the progress that it
1700080	1704160	deserves. Because the chemists are doing this as there's the field is exploding right now,
1704160	1709600	there's amazing people out there, young and old doing this. And there's deservedly so more money
1709600	1713600	going in. You know, I used to complain, there's more money being spent searching for the Higgs
1713600	1718560	boson that we know exists in the origin of life. You know, why is that the origin, we understand
1718560	1723040	the origin of life, we're going to actually work out what life is. We're going to be at a bound,
1723040	1727520	the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe. And most important for us, we are going
1727520	1733280	to know, or have a good idea of what the future of humanity looks like. You know, we need to understand
1733280	1737840	that although we're precious, we're not the only life forms in the universe. Or that's my very
1737840	1742960	strong impression. I have no data for that. It's just right now a belief. And I want to turn that
1742960	1750480	belief into a more than a belief by experimentation. But I coming back to the scam, the scam is if we
1750480	1756560	just make this RNA, we've we've got this, you know, this, this fluke event, we know how that's
1756560	1762320	simple. Let's make this phosphodiester, or let's make ATP or ATP, we've got that part nailed,
1762320	1765280	let's now make this other molecule, another molecule, and how many molecules are going
1765280	1772160	to be enough. And then the reason I say this is when you go back to Craig Venter, when he invented
1772800	1782320	his life form, Cyndia, this micro, this, this minimal plasmid is a myoplasma, something I don't
1782320	1789360	know the name of it, but he made this wonderful cell and said, I've invented life. Not quite. He
1789360	1796320	facsimilead the genome from this entity and made it in the lab, or the DNA, but he didn't make the
1796320	1802560	cell. He had to take an existing cell that has a causal chain going all the way back to Luca.
1802560	1808720	And he showed when he took out the gene, the genes and put in his genes, synthesized, the cell could
1808720	1814160	boot up. But it's remarkable that he could not make a cell from scratch. And even now today,
1814160	1820240	synthetic biologists cannot make a cell from scratch, because there's some contingent information
1820320	1827360	embodied outside the genome in the cell. And that is just incredible. So there's lots of layers to
1827360	1836560	the scam. Well, let me then ask the question, how can we create life in a lab from scratch?
1837120	1842640	What have been the most promising attempts at creating life in a lab from scratch? Has anyone
1842640	1847360	actually been able to do it? Do you think anyone will be able to do it in the near future if they
1847360	1855280	haven't already? Yeah, I think that nobody has made life in the lab from scratch. Lots of people
1855280	1859840	would argue that they have made progress at Craig Venture. I think the synthesis of a synthetic
1859840	1868320	genome milestone in human achievement, brilliant. Yeah, can we just walk back and say, what would
1868320	1873600	you say from your perspective, one of the world experts in exactly this area, what does it mean
1873680	1878640	to create life from scratch? Where if you sit back, whether you do it or somebody else does it,
1878640	1887440	it's like, damn, this is, we just created life. Well, what I can tell you, what I would expect,
1887440	1898960	I would like to be able to do, is to go from sand to cells in my lab. Can you explain what sand is?
1899920	1906400	Just inorganic stuff, like basically just so sand, it's just silicon oxide with some other
1906400	1912880	ions in it, maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates, just basically clearly dead stuff
1912880	1917840	that you could just grind rocks into sand. And it would be what, in a kind of vacuum,
1917840	1925760	so they could remove anything else that could possibly be a shadow of life that can assist
1925840	1928880	in the chemical. You could do that. You could insist and say, look, I'm going to take,
1928880	1932480	and not just inorganic, I want some more, I want to cheat and have some organic,
1932480	1936000	but I want inorganic organic, and I'll explain the play on words in a moment.
1936000	1942720	So I would like to basically put into a world, say a completely, you know, a synthetic world,
1942720	1949200	if you like a closed world, put some inorganic materials, and just literally add some energy
1949280	1957040	in some form, be it lightning or heat, UV light, and run this thing in cycles over time,
1957040	1961520	and let it solve the search problem. So I see the origin of life as a search problem in chemical
1961520	1966640	space. And then I would literally wait for a life form to crawl out of the test tube. That's
1966640	1972400	a joke I tell my group. Literally wait for a very, and don't worry, it's going to be very feeble,
1972400	1975920	it's not going to take over the world. You know, there's ways of ethically containing it.
1976240	1985040	Last words. Indeed, indeed, indeed. You know, this is being recorded, right? It will not make
1985040	1990400	you look good once it crawls out of the lab and destroys all human civilization. But there is
1990400	1995440	very good things you can do to prevent that. For instance, if you put stuff in your world,
1995440	2001040	which isn't abundant, so let's say we make life based on molybdenum and it escapes,
2001040	2005680	it would die immediately because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment. So we can do
2005680	2010400	responsible life. Or as I fantasize with my research group on our away day that would go in,
2011440	2017920	I think it's actually morally, if we don't find, until humanity finds life in the universe,
2017920	2021920	this is going on the tangent, it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs,
2021920	2026480	identify dead planets and bomb them with our origin of life machines and make them alive.
2026480	2031680	I think it is our moral obligation to do that. Some people might argue with me about that,
2031680	2034320	but I think that we need more life in the universe.
2034320	2038720	And then we kind of forget we did it and then come back.
2041120	2043920	Where did you come from? But coming back to what I'd expect.
2043920	2049040	Father, are you back? I think this is once again a Rick and Morty episode.
2049920	2053600	Definitely all Rick and Morty all the way down. So I imagine we have this pristine
2054720	2061120	experiment and everything is sanitized and we put in inorganic materials and we have
2061120	2067200	cycles with them, day night cycles, up, down, whatever. And we look for evidence of replication
2067200	2071280	and evolution over time. And that's what the experiment should be. Now, are there people
2071280	2075440	doing this in the world right now? There are a couple of, there's some really good groups doing
2075440	2079360	this. There's some really interesting scientists doing this around the world. They're kind of,
2080560	2089280	perhaps, too much associated with the scam. And so they're using molecules that are already,
2089280	2092960	were already invented by biology. So there's a bit of replication built in.
2094000	2098560	But I still think the work they're doing, they're doing is amazing. But I would like
2098560	2103440	people to be a bit freer and say, let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box
2103440	2107360	and wait for life to come out, because that's what happened on earth. And so that we have to
2107360	2112640	understand that. Now, how would I know I've been successful? Well, because I'm not obsessing with
2112640	2121040	what molecules are in life now, I would wager a vast quantity of money. I'm not very rich. So
2121040	2129440	just be a few dollars. But for me, the solution space will be different. So the genetic material
2129440	2135440	will be not RNA. The proteins will not be what we think. The solutions will be just completely
2135440	2138880	different. And it might be, and it will be very feeble, because that's the other thing we should
2138880	2145440	be able to show fairly robustly that even if I did make, or someone did make a new life form in
2145440	2154880	the lab, it would be so poor that it's not going to leap out. It is the fear about making a lethal
2154880	2161280	life form in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining that we're going to make the
2161280	2168080	terminator at Boston Dynamics tomorrow. And the problem is, we don't communicate that
2168080	2173760	properly. I know you yourself very, you explain this very well, you know, there is not the AI
2173760	2178320	Catastrophe coming. We're very far away from that. That doesn't mean we should ignore it.
2178320	2182960	Same with the origin of life Catastrophe, it's not coming anytime soon. We should ignore it.
2182960	2186480	But we shouldn't let that fear stop us from doing those experiments.
2186480	2190320	But this is a much, much longer discussion, because there's a lot of details there. I would say
2190320	2197840	there's potentials for catastrophic events to happen in much dumber ways. In AI space,
2198480	2204560	there's a lot of ways to create, like social networks are creating a kind of accelerated
2205520	2211680	set of events that we might not be able to control. The social network, virality in the
2211680	2219680	digital space can create mass movements of ideas that can then, if times are tough,
2220320	2224960	create military conflicts and all those kinds of things. But that's not super intelligent AI.
2225600	2231840	That's an interesting at scale application of AI. And if you look at viruses, viruses are pretty
2231840	2239360	dumb. But at scale, their application is pretty detrimental. And so origin of life, much like
2240240	2249200	all of the kind of virology, the very contentious word of gain of function research and virology,
2249200	2257600	sort of like research on viruses, messing with them genetically, that can create a lot of
2257600	2264000	problems if not done well. So we have to be very cautious. So there's a kind of whenever you're
2264000	2273280	ultra cautious about stuff in AI or in virology and biology, it borders on cynicism, I would say,
2273280	2279040	where it's like everything we do is going to turn out to be destructive and terrible. So I'm just
2279040	2284880	going to sit here and do nothing. Okay, that's a possible solution, except for the fact that
2284880	2292960	somebody's going to do it. It's science and technology progresses. So we have to do it in an
2292960	2299760	ethical way, in a good way, considering in a transparent way in an open way, considering
2301680	2306400	all the possible positive trajectories that could be taken and making sure as much as possible that
2306400	2313600	we walk those trajectories. So yeah, I don't think Terminator is coming, but a totally unexpected
2313600	2318560	version of Terminator maybe around the corner. Yeah, it might be here already. Yeah. So I agree
2318560	2323040	with that. And so going back to the origin of life discussion, I think that in synthetic biology
2323040	2330880	right now, we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes and edit synthetic biology to do
2330880	2335040	things. So that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong in the same way as, you know,
2335040	2341680	Twitter turning ourselves into kind of strange scale effects. I would love origin of life research
2341680	2347280	or artificial life research to get to the point where we have those worries. Because that's why
2347280	2351360	I think we're just so far away from that. We are just, you know, right now, I think there are two
2351360	2357120	really important angles. There is the origin of life, people, researchers who are faithfully
2357120	2362080	working on this, and trying to make those molecules, the scam molecules I talked about.
2362640	2366400	And then there are people on the creationist side is saying, look, the fact you can't make these
2366400	2370640	molecules and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true and all this other stuff.
2370640	2375440	Gotcha. Yeah. And so, and I find that really frustrating because actually the origin of life
2375440	2380960	researchers are all working in good faith, right? Yes. And so what I'm trying to do is give origin
2380960	2387760	of life research a little bit more of a, of a, of an open, an open context. And one of the things I
2387760	2393040	think is important, I really want to make a new life form in my lifetime. I really want to prove
2393040	2398800	that life is a general phenomena, a bit like gravity in the universe. Because I think that's
2398800	2406160	going to be really important for humanities, global psychological state, meaning going forward.
2406160	2412480	That's beautifully, that's beautifully put. So one, it will help us understand ourselves. So
2412480	2422800	that's useful for science. But two, it gives us a kind of hope, if not an awe at all the huge
2422800	2429520	amounts of alien civilizations that are out there, if you can build life and understand just how
2429520	2436800	easy it is to build life, then that's just as good, if not much better than discovering life
2436800	2444640	on another planet. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's cheaper. It's much cheaper and much easier. And
2445920	2450480	probably much more conclusive because once you're able to create life, like you said,
2450560	2456720	it's a search problem that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it. Once you create the,
2456720	2461280	once you find the first solution, you probably have all the right methodology for finding all
2461280	2465520	kinds of other solutions. Yeah. And wouldn't it be great if we could find a solution? I mean,
2465520	2469680	it's probably a bit late for, I mean, I worry about climate change, but I'm not that worried
2469680	2474400	about climate change. And I think one day you could think about, could we engineer a new type
2474400	2478560	of life form that could basically, and I don't want to do this. And I don't think we should do
2478640	2483040	this necessarily, but it's a good thought experiment that would perhaps take CO2 out of the
2483040	2488080	atmosphere or an intermediate life forms. It's not quite alive. It's almost like an add-on
2488080	2495040	that we can, with a time dependent add-on, you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean,
2495040	2499520	or to maybe to wheat and say, right, we're just going to, we're going to fix a bit more CO2.
2500160	2506240	And we're going to work out how much we need to fix to basically save the climate. And we're going
2506240	2511040	to use evolutionary principles to basically get there. What worries me is that biology has had
2511040	2517040	a few billion years to find a solution for CO2 fixation. It hasn't really done. It's not,
2517040	2521040	the solution isn't brilliant for our needs, but biology wasn't thinking about our needs. Biology
2521040	2526000	was thinking about biology's needs. But I think if we can do, as you say, make life in the lab,
2526560	2531600	then suddenly we don't need to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it. I think we make life
2531600	2536400	in the lab. We look at the extent of life in the solar system. How far did Earth life get?
2536400	2540400	Probably we're all Martians. Probably life got going on Mars, the chemistry on Mars,
2540400	2544800	seeded Earth. That might have been a legitimate way to kind of truncate the surface.
2545360	2548240	But in the outer solar system, we might have completely different life forms
2548240	2553280	on Enceladus, on Europa, and Titan. And that would be a cool thing because-
2553280	2558480	Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you just say that you think,
2558480	2563520	in terms of likelihood, life started on Mars, statistically speaking,
2563520	2567600	life started on Mars and seeded Earth? It could be possible because life was,
2568720	2573360	Mars was habitable for the type of life that we have right now, type of chemistry before Earth.
2574240	2580640	It seems to me that Mars got searching doing chemistry. It started way before.
2580640	2585360	Yeah. And so they had a few more replicators and some other stuff. And if those replicators got
2585360	2590080	ejected from Mars and landed on Earth, and Earth was like, I don't need to start again.
2591520	2596400	Thanks for that. And then it just carries on. So I'm not going, I think we will find evidence
2596400	2602400	of life on Mars, either life we put there by mistake, contamination, or actually life,
2602400	2606800	the earliest remnants of life. And that would be really exciting. There's a really good reason
2606800	2611520	to go there. But I think it's more unlikely because of the gravitational situation in the solar system
2611520	2615440	if we find life in the outer solar system. Tighten and all that. That would be its own
2615440	2620720	thing. Exactly. Wow, that would be so cool. If we go to Mars and we find life that looks
2620720	2626880	a hell of a lot similar to Earth life. And then we go to tighten and all those weird moons with
2626880	2631760	the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff. And then we find there something that looks,
2632480	2638720	I don't know, way weirder. Yeah. Some other, some non RNA type of situation.
2638720	2643520	Almost life like in the prebiotic chemical space. And I think there are four types of exoplanets
2643520	2647840	we're going to look for, right? Because when JWST goes up and touch wood, it goes up and
2647840	2653360	everything's fine. When we look at a star, we know statistically most stars have planets around them.
2653360	2656960	What type of planet are they? Are they going to be dead? Are they going to be
2657680	2662320	just a prebiotic origin of life coming? So are they going to be technological?
2663200	2668640	And, you know, so we have intelligence on them. And will they will they have died? So, you know,
2668640	2671760	from, you know, had life on them, but not. Those are the four states of the world.
2671760	2676400	And so, and suddenly, it's a bit like I want to classify planets, the way we classify stars.
2676960	2682560	Yeah. And I think that in terms of their rather than having this, oh, we've found we found methane,
2682560	2686320	there's evidence of life, we found oxygen, that's the evidence of life, we found whatever
2686320	2691600	molecule marker and start to then frame things a little bit more.
2691600	2695840	As those four states, which by the way, you're just saying four, but there could be a
2697120	2702080	before the dead, there could be other states that we humans can even conceive of.
2702080	2707120	Just prebiotic, almost alive, you know, got the possibility to come alive. I think.
2707120	2712000	There could be a post technological, like whatever we think of as technology,
2712000	2720480	that could be like pre-conscious, like when we all meld into one super intelligent
2720480	2723760	consciousness or some weird thing that naturally happens over time.
2723760	2726640	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that the all bets.
2726640	2727440	The metaverse.
2728080	2735360	Yeah. We join into a virtual metaverse and start creating, which is kind of an interesting idea,
2735360	2741120	almost arbitrary number of copies of each other, much more quickly to can mess with different
2741120	2748000	ideas in mind, like I can create a thousand copies of Lex, like every possible version of Lex,
2748000	2753440	and then just see like, and then I just have them like argue with each other and like until,
2753440	2757920	like in the space of ideas and see who wins out, how could that possibly go wrong?
2757920	2763200	But anyway, but there's a, especially in this digital space where you could start exploring
2763200	2767360	with AI's mixed in, you could start engineering arbitrary intelligences,
2767440	2772160	you can start playing in the space of ideas, which might move us into a world that looks
2772160	2777600	very different than a biological world. Like our current world, the technology,
2777600	2783360	is still very much tied to our biology. It's, we might move past that.
2783360	2785120	Oh, definitely. We definitely will.
2785120	2787280	We definitely, because that could be another phase then.
2787280	2787600	Sure.
2787600	2788400	Because then you.
2788400	2791520	But I did say technological, so I think I agree with you. I think so you can have,
2791680	2795520	let's get this right. So dead world, no prospect of alive.
2796400	2801440	Prebiotic world, life emerging, living, and technological. And you probably,
2801440	2804320	and the dead one, you probably won't be able to tell between the dead never been alive.
2804320	2808480	And the dead one, maybe what some artifacts, and maybe there's five, there's probably not more
2808480	2814160	than five. And I think the technological one could allow, could have life on it still,
2814160	2818720	but it might just have exceeded. Because, you know, one way that life might survive on earth
2818720	2823120	is if we can work out how to deal with the coming, the real climate change that comes
2823120	2827280	when the sun expands. It might be a way to survive that, you know.
2829360	2832960	But yeah, I think that we need to start thinking statistically when it comes to
2833600	2835120	looking for life in the universe.
2835120	2843120	Let me ask you then, sort of statistically, how many alien civilizations are out there
2843840	2847760	in those four phases that you're talking about? When you look up to the stars,
2848480	2855520	and you're sipping on some wine, and talking to other people with British accents about
2855520	2862080	something intelligent and intellectual, I'm sure. Do you think there's a lot of alien
2862080	2865200	civilizations looking back at us? I'm wondering the same.
2865760	2872480	My romantic view of the universe is really taking loans from my logical self. So what
2872480	2879600	I'm saying is I have no idea. But having said that, there is no reason to
2880720	2887680	suppose that life is as hard as we first thought it was. And so if we just take earth as a marker,
2888720	2893200	and if I think that life is a much more general phenomena than just our biology,
2893200	2899360	then I think the universe is full of life. And the reason for the Fermi paradox is not that
2900240	2905440	they're not out there, it's just that we can't interact with the other life forms because they're
2905440	2910560	so different. And I'm not saying that they're necessarily like has been depicted in a rival
2910560	2919280	or other, you know, I'm just saying that perhaps there are very few universal facts in the universe.
2920000	2927360	And that, and maybe that is not, it's quite hard, our technologies are quite divergent.
2927360	2931600	And so I think that it's very hard to know how we're going to interact with alien life.
2931600	2935200	You think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible. I guess that was the intuition.
2936480	2944800	You provided that the way biology itself, but even this particular kinds of biology that we
2944800	2954720	have on earth is something that is just one sample of nearly infinite number of other possible
2955520	2960960	complex autonomous self-replicating type of things that could be possible. And so
2961600	2970640	we're almost unable to see the alternative versions of us. I mean, we'll still be able to
2970640	2975920	detect them. We'll still be able to interact with them. We'll still be able to, like, which
2976960	2982560	what's exactly is lost in translation? Why can't we see them? Why can't we talk to them?
2982640	2994000	Because I too have a sense, you put it way more poetically, but it seems both statistically
2994880	3002000	and sort of romantically, it feels like the universe should be teaming with life,
3002000	3009600	like super intelligent life. And I just, I sit there and the Fermi Paradox is very,
3009600	3014800	it's felt very distinctly by me when I look up at the stars because it's like,
3015840	3019920	it's the same way I feel when I'm driving through New Jersey and listening to Bruce
3019920	3025760	Springsteen and feel quite sad. It's like Lucy K talks about pulling off to the side of the road
3025760	3032800	and just weeping a little bit. I'm almost like wondering like, hey, why, why aren't you talking
3032800	3036800	to us? You know, it feels lonely. It feels lonely because it feels like they're out there.
3037040	3042160	I think that there are a number of answers to that. I think the Fermi Paradox is perhaps
3042160	3048400	based on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe, it would be similar to our life
3049040	3053920	and there's only one solution. And I think that what we've got to start to do is go out and look
3053920	3062160	for selection detection rather than an evolution detection rather than life detection. And I think
3062160	3067520	that once we start to do that, we might start to see really interesting things. And we haven't
3067520	3073440	been doing this for very long. And we are living in an expanding universe and that makes the problem
3073440	3081840	a little bit harder. Everybody's always leaving. But I'm, I'm very optimistic that we will,
3082720	3086720	well, I don't know, there are two movies that came out in the same within six months of one
3086720	3093600	another, Ad Astra and Cosmos. Ad Astra, the very expensive blockbuster, you know, with Brad Pitt in
3093600	3098400	it and saying there is no life and it's all, you know, we've got a life on Earth has more pressures
3098400	3102800	and Cosmos, which is a UK production, which basically aliens came and visited Earth one day
3102800	3109440	and they were discovered in the UK, right? It was quite, it's a fun film. But I really loved
3109440	3114560	those two films. And I'm, and at the same time, those films, at the time those films are coming
3114560	3120960	out, I was working on a paper, a life detection paper. And I fact, it was so hard to publish this
3120960	3126400	paper. And it was almost as depressed that I got so depressed trying to get this science out there,
3126400	3133520	that I felt the depression of the film and Ad Astra like life is there's no life elsewhere in
3133520	3138800	the universe. And but I, but I'm incredibly optimistic that I think we will find life in
3138800	3143680	the universe firm evidence of life. And it will have to start on Earth making life on Earth and
3143680	3149120	surprising as we have to surprise ourselves and make non biological life on Earth. And then people
3149120	3153760	say, well, you, you make this life on Earth, therefore, it's the, you're part of the causal
3153760	3160320	chain of that. And that might be true. But if I can show how I, I'm able to do it with very little
3160320	3165840	cheating or very little information inputs, just creating like a model planet, some description,
3165840	3171360	and watching it, watching life emerge, then I think that we will be even to, to persuade even
3171360	3178400	the hardest critic that that is, it's possible. Now with regards to the Fermi paradox, I think
3178400	3184080	that we might crush that with the JWST. It's basically, if I recall correctly, the mirror is
3184080	3188960	about 10 times the size of the Hubble, that we're going to be able to do spectroscopy,
3188960	3194400	look at colors of exoplanets, I think, not brilliantly, but we'll be able to start to classify
3194400	3200640	them. And we'll start to get a real feet feel for what's going on in the universe on these
3200640	3206960	exoplanets. Because it's only in the last few decades, I think, maybe even last decade that we
3206960	3215520	even came to recognize that exoplanets even are common. And I think that that gives us a lot of
3215520	3223120	optimism that life is going to be out there. But I think we have to start framing, we have to start
3223120	3228560	preparing the fact that biology is only one solution. I can tell you with confidence that
3228560	3234000	biology on Earth does not exist anywhere else in the universe. We are absolutely unique.
3234640	3241280	Well, okay, I love the confidence, but where does that confidence come from?
3242320	3247600	Chemistry, like how many options does chemistry really have?
3247600	3251520	Many. That's the point. And the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam comes in,
3251680	3259920	is that people don't count the numbers. So if biology, as you find on Earth, is common everywhere,
3259920	3263840	then there's something really weird going on that basically written in the quantum mechanics,
3263840	3267760	there's some kind of these bonds must form over these bonds, and this catalyst must form over
3267760	3273920	this catalyst when they're all quite equal. Life is contingent. The origin of life on Earth was
3273920	3279840	contingent upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on Earth. So that means if we want
3279840	3285280	to find other life-like, other Earth-like worlds, we look for the same kind of rocky world, we might
3285280	3293680	look in the same zone as Earth, and we might expect reasonably to find biological-like stuff going on.
3293680	3298160	That would be a reasonable hypothesis, but it won't be the same. It can't be. It's like saying,
3298720	3304000	I don't believe in magic. That's why I'm sure. I just don't believe in magic. I believe in
3304000	3309680	statistics and I can do experiments. And so I won't get the same, exactly the same sequence of
3309680	3314720	events. I'll get something different. And so there is TikTok elsewhere in the universe, but it's not
3314720	3320000	the same as our TikTok, right? That's what I mean. Which aspect of it is not the same?
3320000	3326720	Well, I just think, so what is TikTok? TikTok is a social media where people upload videos,
3326720	3330880	right? Silly videos. So I guess there might be... Well, there's humor, there's attention,
3330880	3337200	there's ability to process, there's ability for intelligent organisms to collaborate on ideas
3337200	3341440	and find humor and ideas and play with those ideas, make them viral, memes.
3343680	3346480	Humor seems to be kind of fundamental to human experience.
3346480	3351440	And I think that that's a really interesting question we can ask. Is humor a fundamental
3351440	3355440	thing in the universe? I think maybe it will be, right? In terms of you think about in a game
3355440	3362720	theoretic sense, humor, the emergence of humor serves a role in our game engine. And so if
3362720	3369280	selection is fundamental in the universe, so is humor. Well, I actually don't know exactly
3370320	3378880	what role humor serves. Maybe from a chemical perspective, it's like a catalyst for...
3380240	3383680	I guess it serves several purposes. One is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet.
3383680	3391120	That's modern humor. But humor is also a good way to deal with the difficulty of life. It's a kind
3391120	3398480	of valve, release valve for suffering. Throughout human history, life has been really hard.
3399040	3401920	And for the people that I have known in my life who've lived through some
3402960	3408720	really difficult things, humor is part of how they deal with that. It's usually dark humor.
3409280	3416080	But yeah, it's interesting. I don't know exactly what's the more mathematically
3416080	3421840	general way to formulate what the hell is humor. What humor does it serve? But I still...
3422640	3430320	We're kind of joking here, but it's a counterintuitive idea to me to think that
3431760	3438080	life elsewhere in the universe is very different than life on earth. And also,
3439040	3445440	like all of each instantiation of life is likely very different from each other.
3446400	3453200	Like maybe there's a few clusters of similar like life, but it's much more likely is what you're
3453200	3458080	saying. To me, it's a kind of novel thought. I'm not sure what to do with it. But you're saying that
3459200	3466400	it's more common to be a weird outcast in the full spectrum of life than it is to be in some
3466800	3472720	usual cluster. So every instantiation of a kind of chemistry that results in complexity,
3472720	3476240	that's autonomous and self-replicating, however the hell you define life,
3477120	3484400	that is going to be very different every time. I don't know. It feels like a selection is a
3484400	3491600	fundamental kind of directed force in the universe. Won't selection result in a few pockets of
3492080	3500880	interesting complexities? If we ran earth over again, over and over and over,
3500880	3504880	you're saying it's going to come up, but there's not going to be elephants every time?
3505920	3511760	Yeah, I don't think so. I think that there will be similarities. And I think we don't
3511760	3520000	know enough about how selection globally works. But it might be that the elephant,
3520960	3524560	the emergence of elephants was wired into the history of earth in some way, like the
3524560	3529280	gravitational force, how evolution was going, the Cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah,
3529280	3534800	the emergence of mammals. But I just don't know enough about the contingency, the variability.
3534800	3540080	All I do know is you count the number of bits of information required to make an elephant
3541200	3546320	and think about the causal chain that provide the lineage of elephants going all the way back
3546320	3553600	to Luca. There's a huge scope for divergence. Yeah, but just like you said, with chemistry
3553600	3563840	and selection, the things that result in self-replicating chemistry and self-replicating
3563840	3571520	organisms, those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying. But once they're successful,
3571520	3578800	they multiply. So it might be a tiny subset of all things that are possible in the universe,
3578800	3583120	chemically speaking, it might be a very tiny subset that's actually successful at creating
3585120	3589920	elephant-like creatures. Well, there's two different questions. The first one, if we were
3589920	3594800	to reset earth and to start again. At the different phases, sorry to keep interrupting.
3594800	3598720	Yeah, no. If we restart earth and start again, say we could go back to the beginning and do
3598720	3603360	the experiment or have a number of earths, how similar would biology be? I would say that there
3603360	3610080	would be broad similarities. But the emergence of mammals is not a given unless we're going to
3610080	3614960	throw an asteroid at each planet each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happens.
3615680	3620400	Then there's the other thing about when you go to another earth-like planet elsewhere,
3620400	3626400	maybe there's a different ratio, particular elements, maybe the bombardment at the beginning
3626400	3632880	of the planet was quicker or longer than earth. I just don't have enough information there. What
3632880	3642240	I do know is that the complexity of the story of life on earth gives us lots of scope for variation.
3642240	3648720	And I just don't think it's a reasonable mathematical assumption to think that life on
3648720	3654080	earth that happened again would be same as what we have now. Okay. But you've also extended that
3654080	3661120	to say that as an explanation for the Fermi paradox that that means we're not able to
3661120	3667680	interact with them. Or that's an explanation for why we haven't at scale heard from aliens is
3669440	3675280	they're different than us. We've only been looking for say 70, 80 years. So I think that the reason
3675280	3679280	we have not found aliens yet is that we haven't worked out what life is.
3679840	3686800	No, but the aliens have worked that out surely. I mean, statistically speaking,
3686800	3692880	there must be a large number of aliens that are way ahead of us on this whole life question.
3693440	3700800	Unless there's something about this stage of intellectual evolution that often quickly results
3700800	3709760	in nuclear war and destroys itself, like there's something in this process that eventually, I
3709760	3715120	don't know, crystallizes the complexity and it stops either dies or stops developing.
3715680	3720560	But most likely they already figured it out. And why aren't they contacting us? Is it some
3721520	3729040	grad student somewhere wants to study a new green planet? Maybe they have. I mean,
3729680	3734560	I don't have a coherent answer to your question, other than to say that if there are other aliens
3734560	3738960	out there and they're far more advanced, they might be in contact with each other.
3739840	3745360	And they might also, we might be at a point where what I'm saying quite critically is it takes two
3745360	3751120	to talk, right? So the aliens might be there. But if we don't have the ability to recognize them
3751120	3757200	and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going to want to talk to us. And I think that's a critical
3757200	3764320	point. Then probably, if that's a filter, there needs to be an ability for one
3764320	3768560	to communicate with the other. And we need to know what life is before we do that. So we haven't
3768560	3773920	qualified to even join the club to have a talk. Well, I think they still want to teach us how to
3773920	3781280	talk, right? But my worry is that, or I think they would want to teach us how to talk like you do
3781280	3794640	when you meet it. I was going to say child, but that's a human species. And you want to try to
3794640	3800960	communicate with them through whatever devices you can, given what an ant is like. I worry mostly
3800960	3805680	about that humans are just too close-minded or don't have the right tools. I'm going to push
3805680	3810480	back on this quite significantly. I would say because we don't understand what life is,
3810560	3815360	and because we don't understand how life emerged in the universe, we don't understand the physics
3816000	3821200	that gave rise to life yet. That means our fundamental description. I'm way out of my
3821200	3824560	pay grade, even further out. But I'll say it anyway, because I think it's fun.
3824560	3827120	You don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier.
3828480	3834000	So I would say that because we don't understand the universe yet, we do not understand how the
3834000	3839680	universe spat out life. And we don't know what life is. And I think that until we understand that,
3839680	3844720	it is going to limit our ability to even... We don't qualify to talk to the aliens.
3845760	3850720	So I'm going to say that they might be there, but I'm not going to say that I believe in
3850720	3852400	interdimensional aliens being present in this world.
3852400	3857360	Yeah, but I think you're just being self-critical, like we don't qualify. I think the fact that we
3857360	3862000	don't qualify qualifies us. We're interesting in our innocence.
3862000	3867760	No, I'm saying that because we don't understand causal chains and the way that information is
3867760	3872080	propagated in the universe. And we don't understand what replication is yet. And we don't understand
3873440	3881760	how life emerged. I think that we would not recognize aliens. And if someone doesn't recognize you,
3883120	3888160	you wouldn't go and talk to it. You don't go and talk to ants. You don't go and talk to birds.
3888160	3892000	Or maybe some birds you do, right? Because you can. There's just enough cognition.
3892000	3896720	So I'm saying because we don't have enough cognitive... Our cognitive abilities are not
3896720	3900240	yet where they need to be. We probably aren't communicating with them.
3900240	3905920	So you don't agree with the dating strategy of playing hard to get? Because us humans,
3905920	3907280	that seems to attract us.
3907280	3911600	We're in a species that's fine, but I think we don't actually have abstraction.
3911600	3916560	No, actually, I think in this talk, in this conversation, you've helped me crystallize
3916560	3920080	something that I think has been troubling me for a long time with the thermo paradox.
3920080	3926880	I'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue is to say that you would not go and talk to
3927520	3930560	your cat about calculus, right?
3930560	3932160	But I was so petty.
3932160	3936000	Sure, but I'm not talking about petting a cat. The analogy is that the aliens are not going
3936000	3940640	to talk to us because we... And I'm using calculus as an analogy for abstraction.
3941280	3948480	Because we lack the layer, the fundamental layer of understanding what life is and what the universe
3948960	3955120	is in our reality, that it would be so counterproductive interacting with intelligent alien species
3955120	3958400	that it would cause more angst for human race.
3959600	3964080	They don't care. Okay, they got to be self-interested. So they'll probably...
3964080	3967520	They more care about... Is it interesting for them? Maybe they...
3968640	3976880	I mean, surely there's a way to pet the cat in this analogy.
3976880	3983280	Because even if we lack complete understanding, it must be a very frustrating experience for
3984320	3989280	other kinds of intelligences to communicate with us. Still, there must be a way to interact with us.
3990480	3995760	Preturb the system in interesting ways to see what these creatures do.
3995760	4000880	We might actually find the answer. I mean, again, out of my pay grade in a simulation
4001680	4007120	of Earth, or let's say a simulation where we allow an intelligent AI to emerge, right?
4007120	4014240	And that AI, we then give it... The objective is to be curious, interact with other
4014240	4022320	intelligence in its universe. And then we might find the parameters required for that AI to work...
4022320	4026880	And I think you'll find if the AI will not talk to other AIs that don't share
4027840	4031280	the ability to abstract to the level of the AI, because it's just a cat.
4031840	4035200	And are you going to travel 20 light years to go and pet a cat?
4035200	4042080	So not because of the inability to do so, but because of boredom. It's more interesting.
4042080	4048960	It will start talking to... It will spend most... It will spend a majority of its time talking to
4048960	4053040	other AI systems that can at least somewhat understand it. It's much more fun.
4053040	4056080	It's a bit like, do we know that plants are conscious? Well, plants unconscious in the way
4056080	4058640	we typically think, but we don't talk to them. They could be, right?
4058640	4062320	But there's a lot of people on Earth who like gardening. There's always going to be a weird...
4062320	4064080	They're not talking. They're just gardening.
4064080	4068240	Okay. Well, you're not romantic enough to see gardening as a way of communication between
4068240	4070160	humans and animals. Okay. You've got me there.
4070160	4075520	But there's ways... There's always going to be the people who are curious. Jane Goodall,
4075520	4080400	who lives with the chimps, right? There's always going to be curious intelligence
4080400	4089680	species that visit the weird Earth planet and try to interact. I mean, I think it's a super
4089680	4095040	cool idea that you're expressing. I just kind of have a sense... Maybe it's a hope that there's
4095040	4101360	always going to be a desire to interact even with those that can't possibly understand the depth of
4101360	4107600	what you understand. So I'm with you. So I want to be as positive as you that the aliens do exist
4107600	4113360	and we will interact with them. What I'm trying to do is to give you a reasonable hypothesis
4113360	4119040	why we haven't yet and also something to strive for to be able to do that. I mean,
4120720	4125360	there is the other view that the universe is just too big and life is just too rare.
4126000	4131600	But I want to come up with an alternative explanation which I think is reasonable and not
4131600	4137760	being philosophically and scientifically thought out, which is this, if you can't actually communicate
4137760	4144480	with the object, the person, the thing competently, you don't even know it's there, then there's no
4144480	4148720	point yet. See, I disagree with that, but I'm totally aligned with your hopeful vision, which is
4148720	4153760	like we need to understand the origin of life. It will help us engineer life. It will help us
4153760	4159280	engineer intelligent life through perhaps on the computer side through simulation and explore all
4159280	4164800	the ways that life emerges. And that will allow us to, I think the fundamental reason we don't see
4164800	4172400	overwhelming amounts of life is I actually believe aliens, of course, these are all just kind of
4174000	4179440	open-minded beliefs. It's difficult to know for sure about any of this, but I think there's a lot
4179440	4184240	of alien civilizations which are actively communicating with us and we're too dumb.
4185200	4188400	We don't have the right tools to see it. That's what I'm saying.
4188400	4195760	No, but maybe I misinterpreted you, but I interpret you just say they kind of tried a few
4195760	4200800	times and they're like, oh God. No, no, no. What I'm saying is we, so this goes two ways. Yeah,
4200800	4205280	I agree with you. There could be information out there, but just put in such a way that we just
4205280	4209920	don't understand it yet. Right. So sorry if I didn't make that clear. I mean, it's not just,
4210000	4214800	I don't think we qualify. I think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal.
4215520	4219360	Right. So when you say qualified, got it, got it. So you mean we're just not smart enough,
4219360	4222400	the word qualified will stop me off. So we're not smart enough to do,
4222400	4227360	it's like, but we just need to get smarter. And there's a lot of people who believe,
4227360	4237120	let me get your opinion on this, about UFO sightings. So sightings of weird phenomena,
4237520	4247200	that, you know, what does UFO mean? It means it's a flying object and it's not identified
4248560	4253600	clearly at the time of sighting. That's what UFO means. So it could be a physics phenomena,
4253600	4257440	could be ball lightning, it could be all kinds of fascinating. I was always fascinated with
4257440	4264160	ball lightning as a, like the fact that there could be physical phenomena in this world
4264160	4268400	that are observable by the human eye. Of course, all physical phenomenon generally
4268400	4274960	are fascinating that are, that, that really smart people can't explain. I love that.
4274960	4279280	Cause it's like, wait a minute, especially if you can replicate it. It's like, wait a minute,
4279280	4284720	how does this happen? That's like the precursor to giant discoveries in chemistry and biology
4284720	4290080	and physics and so on. But it sucks when those events are super rare, right? Physically like
4290080	4296880	leg ball lightning. So, so that's out there. And then of course that phenomena could have
4296880	4302080	other interpretations that don't have to do with the physics, the chemistry, the biology of earth.
4302080	4309040	It could have to do with more extraterrestrial explanations that in large part,
4309040	4313040	thanks to Hollywood and movies and all those kinds of things, captivates the imaginations
4313040	4319920	of millions of people. But just because it's science fiction that captivates the imagination
4319920	4326400	of people doesn't mean that some of those sightings, all it takes is one. One of those sightings
4327360	4335280	is actually a sign that it's extraterrestrial intelligence, that it's object that's not of
4335280	4339600	this particular world. Do you think there's a chance that that's the case? What do you make,
4339600	4341840	especially the pilot sightings, what do you make of those?
4343840	4349280	So I agree there's a chance, there's always a chance, any good scientist would have to
4349360	4355280	or observationist would have to, I want to see if aliens exist, come to earth.
4356080	4361360	What I know about the universe is I think it's unlikely right now that there are aliens visiting
4361360	4369760	us, but not impossible. I think the releases, the dramatization that's been happening politically
4369760	4373280	saying we're going to release all this information, this classified information.
4373520	4383680	I was kind of disappointed because it was just very poor material. And right now,
4385120	4390480	the ability to capture high resolution video, everybody is carrying around with them an
4390480	4399200	incredible video device now. And we haven't got more compelling data. And so that we've just
4399920	4406960	seeing grainy pictures, a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions and whatnot.
4406960	4411280	And so I think on balance, I think it's extremely unlikely, but I think something
4411280	4417280	really interesting is happening. And also during the pandemic, right, we've all been locked down,
4417280	4422720	we all want to have, we want to our imaginations are, you know, running riot. And I think that
4424000	4428240	I don't think that the information out there is convinced me there are anything interesting
4428240	4433280	on the UFO side. But what it has made me very interested in about is how humanity is opening
4433280	4442320	up its mind to ponder aliens and the mystery of our universe. And so I don't want to dissuade
4442320	4446000	people from having those thoughts and say, you're stupid and look at that, it's clearly incorrect.
4446000	4451520	That's not right. That's not fair. What I would say is that I lack sufficient data, replicated
4452080	4457600	observations to make me go, oh, I'm going to take this seriously. But I'm really interested
4457680	4463840	by the fact that there is this, this great deal of interest. And I think that it drives me
4464560	4470960	to maybe want to make or make an artificial life form even more and to help NASA and the
4470960	4474960	Air Force and whoever go and look for things even more, because I think humanity wants to know
4474960	4480720	what's out there. There's this yearning, isn't there? Yeah, but I see I almost
4481360	4487920	depending on the day, I sometimes agree with you, but with the thing you just said, but
4490560	4496160	one of the disappointing things to me about the sightings, I still hold the belief that
4496880	4508000	a non zero number of them is an indication of something very interesting. So I don't
4508080	4513200	side with the people who say everything can be explained with sensor artifacts kind of thing.
4513200	4517280	Yeah, I agree with you. I didn't say that either. I would say I just don't have enough data.
4517280	4522320	But the thing I want to push back on is the statement that everybody has a high definition
4522320	4526880	camera. One of the disappointing things to me about the report that the government released,
4526880	4532000	but in general, just having worked with government, having worked with people all over,
4532880	4540320	is how incompetent we are. Like if you look at the response to the pandemic, how incompetent we are
4541200	4547840	in the face of great challenges without great leadership, how incompetent we are in the face
4547840	4553840	of the great mysteries before us without great leadership. And I just think it's actually,
4553840	4560240	the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras is not enough to capture the full richness
4560240	4566320	of weird of the mysterious phenomenon out there of which extraterrestrial intelligence
4566320	4572080	visiting Earth could be one. I don't think we have, I don't think everybody having a smartphone in
4572080	4579440	their pocket is enough. I think that allows for TikTok videos. I don't think it allows for the
4579440	4586400	capture of even interesting relatively rare human events. That's not that common. It's rare to have
4586400	4589920	be in the right moment in the right time to be able to capture the thing.
4590480	4595680	I agree. I agree. Let me rephrase what I think on this. I haven't seen enough information. I
4595680	4601040	haven't really actively sought it out. I must admit, but I'm with you in that I love the
4601040	4605760	idea of anomaly detection in chemistry in particular. I want to make anomalies, sorry,
4605760	4611520	or not necessarily make anomalies. I want to understand an anomaly. Let me give you two from
4611520	4620000	chemistry, which are really quite interesting. Phlogiston, going way back where people said
4620000	4626560	there's this thing called phlogiston. For ages, the alchemists got really this kind of that this
4626560	4633200	fire is the thing. That's one. Then we determined that phlogiston wasn't what we thought it is.
4633200	4637600	Let's go to physics, the aether. The aifers are a hard one because I think actually the aether
4637600	4645360	might exist. I'll tell you what I think the aether is later. Can you explain the aether?
4645360	4649360	As the vacuums, the light traveling through the aether in the vacuum, there is some
4649360	4653280	thing that we call the aether that basically mediates the movement of light.
4656240	4659920	Then the other one is cold fusion, which is more of a... A few years ago,
4661760	4666480	that people observed that when they did some electrochemistry, when they were splitting water
4666480	4671840	into hydrogen and oxygen, that you got more energy out than you put in. People got excited
4671840	4678080	and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction. In the end, it was kind of discredited because
4678080	4684240	you didn't detect neutrons and all stuff. I'm pretty sure... I'm a chemist. I'm going telling
4684240	4688320	you this on your podcast, but why not? I'm pretty sure there's interesting electrochemical phenomena
4688320	4692720	that's not completely bottomed out yet, that there is something there. However, we lack the
4692720	4699120	technology and the experimental design. All I'm saying in your response about aliens is we lack
4699120	4705840	the experimental design to really capture these anomalies. We are encircling the planet with
4705840	4711600	many more detection systems. We've got satellites everywhere. I do hope that we are going to discover
4711600	4717840	more anomalies. Remember, the solar system isn't just static in space. It's moving through the
4717840	4723520	universe. There's just more and more chance. I'm not one with Avi Loeb. He's generating all
4723520	4731920	sorts of a cult, I would say, with this, but I'm not against him. I think there is a finite chance
4731920	4735360	if there are aliens in the universe that we're going to happen upon them because we're moving
4735360	4740480	through the universe. What's the nature of the following that Avi Loeb has? He's doubling down
4740480	4744560	more and more and more and say there are aliens, interdimensional aliens and everything else. He's
4744560	4749920	gone from space junk accelerating out of to interdimensional stuff in a very short space of
4749920	4760480	time. He's obviously bored. Or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand. He's playfully
4760480	4767040	trying to interact with society and his peers to say, stop saying it's not possible, which I agree
4767040	4772080	with. We shouldn't do that, but we should frame it statistically in the same way we should frame
4772320	4782560	everything as good scientists statistically. Yeah, good scientists. Recently, the idea of good
4782560	4789680	scientists is, I take quite skeptically. I've been listening to a lot of scientists tell me
4789680	4794720	about what is good science. That makes me sad because you've been interviewing, well, I would
4794720	4800480	consider a lot of really good scientists. No, that's true, but that's exactly right. Most of the
4800480	4808560	people I talk to are incredible human beings, but there's a humility that's required. Science can
4808560	4818480	not be dogmatism. Sure, I agree. Authority, a PhD does not give you authority. A lifelong pursuit
4818480	4823840	of a particular task does not give you authority. You're just as lost and clues as everybody else,
4823920	4831120	but you're more curious and more stubborn. That's a nice quality to have, but overall, just
4834080	4844400	using the word science and statistics can often, as you know, become a catalyst for dismissing
4845600	4850400	new ideas out of the box ideas, wild ideas, all that stuff.
4851280	4860240	Yes and no. I like to, some people find me extremely annoying in science because I'm
4860240	4867520	basically quite rude and disruptive. Not in a rude, some people say they're ugly or stupid or
4867520	4875840	anything like that. I just say, you're wrong, or why do you think this? Something, a gift I got
4875920	4880560	given by society when I was very young because I was in the learning difficulties class at school
4880560	4888080	as I was told I was stupid. I know I'm stupid, but I always wanted to be smart. I remember going
4888080	4892320	to school going, maybe today they're going to tell me I'm not as stupid as I was yesterday,
4892320	4896560	and it was always disappointed, always. When I went into academia and everyone said,
4896560	4903840	you're wrong, I was like, join the queue because it allowed me to walk through the wall. I think
4903840	4908000	that people like to always imagine science as a bit like living in a Japanese house,
4908000	4913680	they're paper walls, and everyone sits in their room, and I annoy people because I walk straight
4913680	4918480	through the wall, not because why should I be a chemist and not a mathematician? Why should I
4918480	4923200	be a mathematician and not computer scientist? Because if the problem requires us to walk through
4923200	4931760	those walls, but I like walking through the walls, but then I have to put up, I have to
4931760	4938640	do good science, I have to win the people in those rooms across by good science, by taking
4938640	4944080	their criticisms and addressing them head on. And I think we must do that. And I think that I try
4944080	4951200	and do that in my own way. And I kind of love walking through the walls. And it gives me,
4951200	4958160	it's difficult for me personally, it's quite painful. But it always leads to a deeper understanding
4958160	4962400	of the people I'm with, and particularly the arguments I have with all sorts of
4962400	4967440	interesting minds, because I want to solve the problem, or I want to understand more about why
4967440	4976240	I exist. That's it, really. And I think we have to not dismiss science on that basis. I think we
4976240	4983120	can work with science. No, science is beautiful, but humans with egos and all those kinds of things
4983120	4993520	can sometimes misuse good things, like social justice, like all ideas were all aspired to
4993520	5001120	misuse these beautiful ideas to manipulate people to all those kinds of things. And that's,
5001120	5008000	there's assholes in every space and walk of life, including science. And those are,
5008000	5013440	those are no good. But yes, you're right. The scientific method has proven to be quite useful.
5014560	5022240	That said, for difficult questions, for difficult rare explanations for rare phenomena,
5022960	5031280	you have to walk cautiously. Because the scientific method, when you totally don't
5031280	5036320	understand something, and it's rare, and you can't replicate it, doesn't quite apply.
5037040	5042080	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. I agree with you. The challenge is to, is to not dismiss the anomaly
5042080	5046640	because you can't replicate it. I mean, we can talk about this. This is something I realized when
5046640	5055680	we were developing assembly theory. People think in the track they're on is so dogmatic,
5055680	5060160	but there is this thing that they see, but they don't see. And it takes a bit of time,
5060160	5064720	and you just have to keep reframing it. And my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right?
5064800	5070320	You know, why, why must we accept that RNA is the only way into life? I mean, who said,
5070320	5076480	was there, you know, does RNA have a special, special class of, of information that's encoded
5076480	5080640	in the universe? No, of course it doesn't, right? You know, RNA is not a special molecule
5080640	5085200	within the space of all the other molecules. But it's so elegant and simple of, and it works
5085200	5089280	so well for the evolution process that we kind of use that as an intuition to explain that
5089280	5095440	that must be the only way to have life. Sure. But you mentioned assembly theory. Well, first
5095440	5102400	let me pause. Bathroom break needed? Yeah, let's take two minutes. We took a quick break and offline
5102400	5110320	you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home. And then I said that you're basically
5110320	5115280	Rick from Rick and Morty, which is something I've been thinking this whole conversation.
5115360	5123120	And then you say that there's a glowing pickle that you used something involving cold plasma,
5123120	5126000	I believe, I don't know, but can you explain the glowing pickle situation?
5131360	5137280	And is there many arbitrarily many versions of you in alternate dimensions that you're aware of?
5137280	5144640	I tried to make an electrochemical memory in at home using a, and the only way, using a pickle,
5144640	5150080	the only way I could get any traction with it was actually by plugging it into a very high
5150080	5154480	voltage alternating current and then putting in a couple of electrodes. But my kids weren't
5154480	5158160	impressed. They're not impressed with anything I do, any experiments I do at home, I think it's
5158160	5162160	quite funny. But you connected that pickle to some electro, I mean, you... To 240 volts,
5162160	5165840	yeah, AC. Yeah. And then had a couple of electrodes on it. So what happens is a pickle,
5167520	5172400	this is a classic thing you do. I mean, I shouldn't, pranks you do, you put a pickle
5172400	5177520	into the mains and just leave it, run away and leave it. And what happens is it starts to decompose,
5177520	5182640	it heats up and then explodes because the water turns to steam and it just violently explodes.
5182640	5187280	But I wondered if I could cause the iron, sodium potassium ions in the pickle to migrate,
5187280	5192880	it'd been in a jar, right? So it'd been in a brine. That was, yeah, that was not my,
5192880	5196880	that was not my best experiment. So I've been far better experiments in my lab at home.
5196880	5199840	At that time it was a failed experiment, but you never know. It could,
5201520	5205840	every experiment is a successful experiment if you stick with it long enough.
5205840	5209920	Well, I mean, I get, I got kicked out of my own lab by my research team many years ago,
5209920	5213200	and for good reason. I mean, my team is brilliant and I used to go in and just break things.
5213760	5217360	So what I do do at home is I have a kind of electronics workshop
5218720	5225200	and I prototype experiments there. Then I try and, then I try and suggest to my team sometimes,
5225200	5229360	maybe we can try this thing. And they would just say, oh, wow, that's not going to work
5229360	5233520	because of this. And I'll say, aha, but actually I've tried and here's some code and here's some
5233520	5239200	hard work and we have a go. So that I'm doing that less and less now as I get even more busy.
5239200	5244160	But that's quite fun because then they feel that we're in the, you know, in the experiment together.
5244160	5249200	You do, in fact, brilliantly, just like Rick from Rick and Morty,
5250000	5260080	connects up chemistry with computation. So sort of, and when we say chemistry,
5260080	5267840	we don't mean the simulation of chemistry or modeling of chemistry. We mean chemistry in
5267840	5274080	the physical space as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating. We'll talk about that.
5274160	5280080	But first, you mentioned assembly theory. So we'll stick on theory and these big ideas.
5280640	5287200	I would say revolutionary ideas. There's an intersection between mathematics and philosophy.
5287200	5294480	What is assembly theory? And generally speaking, how would we recognize life if we saw it?
5295120	5300640	So assembly theory is a theory. It goes back a few years now and my struggle for maybe almost
5300720	5305680	10 years when I was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences
5305680	5312000	where I thought that everybody was dancing around the problem of what life is and what it does.
5312560	5316560	But I'll tell you about what assembly theory is because I think it's easier. So assembly theory
5316560	5322560	literally says if you take an object, any given object, and you are able to break the object
5322560	5328880	into parts very gently, so just maybe let's say take a piece of very intricate Chinese porcelain
5328880	5334160	and you tap it just with a hammer or the nail at some point and it will fragment into many parts.
5334880	5340400	And if that object is able to fragment into many and you count those parts, the different parts,
5340400	5347120	so they're unsymmetrical. Assembly theory says the larger the number of parts,
5347120	5352720	unsymmetrical parts that object has, the more likely it is that object has been created by an
5352720	5360160	evolutionary or information process, especially if that object is not one-off, you've got an
5360160	5366320	abundance of them. And that's really important. Because what I'm literally saying about the
5366320	5372080	abundance, if you have a one-off object and you break it into parts and it has lots of parts,
5372080	5378960	you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate and complex, but it could be just random.
5379840	5384480	And I was troubled with this for years because I saw in reality that assembly theory works.
5384480	5390320	But when I talked to very good computational complexity computation lists, algorithmic
5390320	5394720	complexity people, they said, you haven't really done this properly, you haven't thought about it.
5394720	5400800	It's like this is the random problem. And so I kept working this up because I invented an
5400800	5406400	assembly theory in chemistry, first of all, with molecules. And so the thought experiment was
5406880	5412240	how complex does a molecule need to be when I find it, that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance
5412240	5417600	probabilistically. And if I found this molecule able to detect enough quantities in the same
5417600	5422000	object, like a machine, like a mass spectrometer, so typically in a mass spectrometer, you weigh
5422000	5426400	the molecules in electric field, you probably have to have the order of 10,000 identical molecules
5426400	5433440	to get a signal. So 10,000 identical molecules that are complex, what is the chance of them
5434000	5439360	occurring by chance? Well, we can do the math. Let's take a molecule like Strickneen or
5441920	5447360	yeah, so Strickneen is a good molecule actually to take. Or Viagra is a good molecule. I made jokes
5447360	5452160	about Viagra because it's complex molecule. And one of my friends said, if we find Viagra on Mars
5452160	5460080	in detectable quantities, we know something is up. But anyway, it's a complex molecule.
5460160	5463680	So what you do is you take this molecule in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons
5463680	5469440	or in electric field, it breaks apart. And if the larger than the larger the number of different
5469440	5474640	parts you know, when it starts to get refresh old, my idea was that that molecule could not be
5474640	5480480	created by chance, probabilistically. So that was where assembly thought theory was born in an
5480480	5485440	experiment in a mass spec experiment. And I was thinking about this because NASA sending mass
5485520	5490720	spectrometers to Mars to Titan is going to send them to Europa. There's going to be a nuclear
5490720	5495760	powered mass spectrometer going to Titan. I mean, this is the coolest experiment ever.
5495760	5500240	They're not only sending a drone that's going to fly around Titan, it's going to be powered by a
5501440	5505920	nuclear slug, a nuclear battery, and it's going to have a mass spectrometer on it.
5505920	5511120	Is this already launched? No, it's Dragonfly and it's going to be launched in a few years. I think
5511120	5514800	it got pushed a year because of the pandemic. So I think it's three or four years.
5514800	5521680	Dragonfly, nuclear Dragonfly is going to fly to Titan and collect
5524880	5529520	data about the composition of the various chemicals on Titan.
5529520	5534320	Yeah, I'm trying to convince NASA, I don't know if I'll be able to convince the Dragonfly team
5535520	5539200	that they should apply this approach, but they will get data and depending on how good their
5539200	5543520	mass spectrometer is. But I had this thought experiment anyway and I did this thought experiment
5544240	5549920	and for me it seemed to work. I turned the thought experiment into an algorithm in assembly theory
5549920	5554720	and I basically, assembly theory, if I take, let's just make it generic and let's just take the word
5554720	5561280	abracadabra. So can I, if you find the word, so if you have a book with lots of words in it and you
5561280	5566560	find abracadabra one off and there's a wrap book that's been written by, in a random way, you know,
5566640	5572400	set of monkeys in a room and you untype writers and you find one off abracadabra no big deal.
5572400	5577360	But if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra, well, that means something weird is going on.
5577360	5582240	But let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra. So abracadabra has a,
5582240	5586800	you know, has a number of letters in it, you can break it down, so you just cut the letters up.
5587360	5591760	But when you actually reassemble abracadabra, the minimum number of weights of organizing
5591760	5598800	those letters, so you'd have an A, a B, you know, and keep going up. There's just the, you can,
5598800	5603920	when you cut abracadabra up into parts, you can put it together again in seven steps.
5603920	5608160	So what does that mean? That means if you basically don't read, you're allowed to reuse
5608160	5612960	things you make in a chain at the beginning. That's the memory of the universe, the process
5612960	5618480	that makes abracadabra. And because that calls all chain, you can then get to abracadabra
5618480	5622240	quicker than the number of letters we're having to specify only in seven.
5623120	5628720	So if you take that to a molecule and you cut the molecule up into parts, and you can,
5628720	5632560	on the causal chain, and you basically start with the atoms and then bonds,
5632560	5638000	and then you randomly add on those parts to make the A, make the B, make the, and keep going all
5638000	5644240	the way up, I found that literally a assembly theory allows me to say how compressed a molecule is.
5644800	5650960	So when there's some information in there, and I realized the assembly theory isn't just
5651760	5655840	confined to molecular space, it can apply to anything, but let me finish the molecular argument.
5655840	5662000	So what I did is I had this theory, I was one of my students, we wrote an algorithm,
5662560	5667520	we basically took the 20 million molecules from the database and we just calculate their assembly
5667520	5673280	number, and that's the index. Like basically, if I take a molecule and I cut it up into bonds,
5673840	5679680	what is the minimum number of steps I need to take to reform that molecule from atoms?
5679680	5683760	So reusability of previously formed things is somehow fundamental.
5683760	5688080	Exactly. So it's like a memory in the universe, right? I'm making lots of leaps here, like,
5688080	5692400	it's kind of weird. I'm saying, right, there's a process that can form the A and the B and the C,
5692400	5697200	let's say, and then there's, and because we've formed A and B before, we can use A and B again
5697200	5702480	with no extra cost except one unit. So that's the kind of the chain of events.
5702480	5706560	And that's how you think about memory here when you say the universe, when you talk about the
5706560	5711840	universe and or life is the universe creating memory.
5711840	5716800	Exactly. So we went through chemical space and we looked at the assembly numbers,
5716800	5722720	we were able to classify it, said, okay, let's test it, let's go. So we're able to take a whole
5722720	5730160	bunch of molecules and assign an assembly index to them. And it's just a function of the number
5730160	5735760	of bonds in the molecule and how much symmetry. So literally, assembly theory is a measure of how
5735760	5740800	little symmetry a molecule has. So the more asymmetry, the more information, the more
5740800	5746960	weird it is, like a Jackson Pollock of some description. So I then went and did a load
5746960	5751280	of experiments. And I basically took those molecules, I cut them up in the mass spec and
5751280	5756400	measured the number of peaks without any knowledge of the molecule. And we found the assembly number
5757120	5762320	there was a almost, not quite a one to one correlation, but almost because not all bonds
5762320	5766960	are equal, they have different energies. I then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques,
5766960	5771680	NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules and
5771680	5777200	get a signature out. And they also used infrared. And infrared and NMR almost gave us a one to one
5777200	5785040	correlation. So what am I saying? Saying by taking a molecule and doing either infrared or NMR or mass
5785120	5791280	spec, I can work out how many parts there are in that molecule, and then put it on a scale.
5792240	5799120	And what we did in the next part of the work is we took molecules randomly from the environment,
5799120	5806560	from outer space, from all around Earth, from the sea, from Antarctica, and from fossils,
5806560	5810960	and so on. And even NASA, and they, because they didn't believe us, blinded some samples.
5811520	5819200	And we found that all these samples that came from biology produced molecules that had a
5819200	5825760	very high assembly number above a threshold of about 15. So basically, all the stuff that came
5825760	5831600	from my ebiotic origin was low. There was no complexity there. So we suddenly realized that
5831600	5837520	on Earth, at least, there is a cutoff that natural phenomena cannot produce molecules
5837600	5844400	that need more than 15 steps to make them. So I realized that this is a way to make a scale of
5844400	5851520	life, a scale of technology as well. And literally, you could just go sniffing for molecules off Earth
5851520	5856400	on Titan, on Mars. And when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer that gives you more than
5856400	5863760	15 parts, you'll know pretty much for sure that it had to be produced by evolution. And this allowed
5863760	5868320	me to come up with a general definition of life based on assembly theory, to say that if I find an
5868320	5877440	object that has a large number of parts, say an iPhone, or Boeing 747, or any complex object,
5877440	5883280	and I can find it in abundance and cut it up, I can tell you whether that has been produced by
5883280	5888240	an informational process or not. And that's what assembly theory kind of does. But it goes a bit
5888240	5895200	further. I then realized that this isn't just about life, it's about causation. So actually,
5895200	5898560	it tells you about where there's a causal structure. So now I can look at objects in the
5898560	5902480	universe, say that again, this cup, and say, right, I'm going to look at how many independent parts
5902480	5908320	it has. So that's the assembly number. I'll then look at the abundance, how many cups are two on
5908320	5914160	this table, maybe there's a few more you got snatched away. So assembly is a is a function of
5914720	5919840	the complexity of the object times the number of copy numbers of that object or function of the
5919840	5925600	copy number normalized. So I realized there's a new quantity in the universe, you have energy,
5926240	5932640	entropy, and assembly. So assembly, the way we should think about that is how much
5932640	5939200	reusability there is. Because what reusability is like the like, can you play devil's advocate
5939200	5951440	to this? Or could this just be a nice tertiary signal for living organisms? Like some kind of
5951440	5956560	distant signal that's, yeah, this is a nice property, but it's not capturing something
5956560	5961760	fundamental. Or do you think reusability is something fundamental to the life in complex
5961760	5967040	organisms? I think reusability is fundamental in the universe, not just for life in complex
5967040	5973040	organisms is about causation. So I think assembly tells you if you find objects, because you can
5973040	5978880	do this with trajectories as well, you think about it that in the unit, the fact there are objects
5979440	5985280	in the universe on earth is my is weird. You think about it, we should just have a
5985280	5992560	commentary explosion of stuff. The fact that not everything exists is is really weird.
5993360	6000560	Yeah. And then as I'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles, and the things that exist
6003760	6010640	are similar and multiply in copies. So I would say that assembly allows you to do something
6010640	6016160	that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy have got stuck with for a while.
6016880	6020800	So I'm making, it's pretty bold. I mean, I'm writing a paper with Sarah Walker on this at the
6020800	6025280	moment. And we're realizing we don't want to get ahead of ourselves because I think that
6025280	6031680	there's lots of ways where this is, you know, it's a really interesting idea. It works for molecules,
6032320	6036320	and it appears to work for any objects produced by causation. Because you can take a motor car,
6036320	6039120	you can look at the assembly of the motor car, look at a book, look at the assembly of the book.
6039680	6044640	Assembly theory tells you there's a way of compressing and reusing. And so when people,
6044640	6049360	I talk to information theorists, they say, oh, this is just logical depth. I say it is
6050000	6054560	like logical depth, but it's experimentally measurable. They say, oh, it's a bit like
6054560	6060000	Comma Golarov complexity. I say, but it's computable. And now, okay, it's not infinitely
6060000	6064320	computable, gets NP hard very quickly, right? It's very hard problem when you get, but it's
6064320	6068720	a computable enough, you contractible enough to be able to tell the difference between a
6068720	6075600	molecule that's been formed by the random background and by causation. And, and I think that that's
6075680	6080800	really interesting because until now, there's no way of measuring complexity objectively.
6082080	6089680	Complexity has required algorithmic comparisons and programs and human beings to label things.
6090480	6095840	Assembly is label free. Well, not entirely, we can talk about what that means in a minute.
6096960	6101920	Okay. My brain has been broken a couple of times here.
6101920	6103440	Sorry, I explained it really badly.
6103440	6107520	No, it was very well explained. It was just fascinating. And it's a,
6108880	6117360	my brain is broken into pieces and I'm trying to assemble it. So NP hard. So when you have a molecule,
6118240	6123840	you're trying to figure out, okay, if we were to reuse parts of this molecule,
6123840	6133120	which parts can we reuse to as an optimization problem and be hard to figure out the minimum
6133120	6139600	amount of reused components that will create this molecule. And it becomes difficult when you start
6139600	6145520	to look at a huge, huge molecules arbitrarily large. Cause I'm also like mapping this. Can I,
6145520	6150880	can I think about this in complexity generally, like looking at a cellular automata system and
6150880	6157200	saying like, what's the, what can this be used as a measure of complexity for like a arbitrarily
6157200	6163360	complicated system? Yeah, I think it can. It can. And I think that the question is, and what's the
6163360	6168560	benefit? Cause there's plenty of, I mean, in computer science and mathematics and physics,
6168560	6173760	people have been really seriously studying complexity for a long time. And I think there's
6173760	6179280	a really interesting problems of where we course grade and we lose information. And all assembly
6179280	6184800	theory does really assembly theory just explains weak emergence. And, and so what assembly theory
6184800	6190320	says, look, going from the atoms into atoms interact, those first replicators that build
6190320	6196400	one another assembly at the, the minimal level just tells you evidence that there's been replication
6196400	6203360	and selection. And I think the more selected something is the higher the assembly. And so
6203360	6208320	we were able to start to know how to look for selection in the universe. If you go to the moon,
6208320	6212160	there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon, except the human artifacts we've left there.
6212960	6219520	So again, let's go back to the sandbox. In assembly theory says, if all the sand grains could stick
6219520	6224080	together, that's the infinite convent or explosion in the universe, that should be the default.
6224720	6230320	We don't have that. Now let's assemble sand grains together and let's, and do them in every
6230320	6236080	possible way. So we have a series of minimal operations that can move the sand together.
6236080	6240000	But all that doesn't exist either. Now, because we have specific memory where we say, well,
6240000	6243920	we're going to put three sand grains in a line or four, make a cross or a triangle,
6243920	6247440	or something unsymmetrical. And once we've made the triangle and the unsymmetrical thing,
6247440	6251840	we remember that we can use it again, because on that causal chain. So what assembly theory
6251840	6256640	allows you to do is go to the actual objects that you exist, you find in space. And actually,
6256640	6262960	the way you get there is by disassembling it says disassembly theory works by disassembling
6262960	6270080	objects you have and understanding the steps to create them. And it works for molecules beautifully
6270080	6274800	because you just break bonds. But like you said, it's going to be very difficult. It's a difficult
6274800	6278560	problem to figure out how to break them apart. For molecules, it's easy. If you just keep low
6278560	6284480	enough in molecular weight space, it's good enough. So it's a complete theory. When we start to think
6284480	6289040	about objects, we can start to assign, we can start to think about things at different levels,
6289600	6294560	what do you assign as your atom? So in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing,
6294560	6299600	because word atom, I mean smallest breakable part. So in a molecule, the atom is the bond,
6299600	6306080	because you break bonds, not atoms, right? So in a car, the atom might be, I don't know,
6306080	6313440	a small amount of iron, or the smallest reusable part, a rivet, a piece of plastic or something.
6313440	6317680	So you've got to be really careful in a micro process of the atoms might be transistors.
6318400	6326560	And so the amount of assembly is something as a function, you have to look at the atom level.
6326560	6330160	What are your parts? What are you counting? That's one of the things you get to choose.
6330800	6335600	What is, at what scale is the atom? What is the minimal exact thing? I mean, there's a huge
6335600	6340720	amount of trade-offs in when you approach a system and try to analyze. Like if you approach earth,
6341200	6345680	you know, an alien civilization, try to study earth, what is the atom for trying to measure
6345680	6352720	the complexity of life? Are humans the atoms? I would say to start with, you just use molecules.
6353440	6357520	I can say for sure, if there are molecules of sufficient complexity on earth,
6358080	6361600	then I know that life has made them. And you can go further and show technology. There are
6361600	6367120	molecules that exist on earth that are not possible even by biology. You needed technology
6367120	6371360	and you needed microprocessors to get there. So that's really cool.
6371360	6378480	And there's a correlation between the coolness of that and assembly number,
6378480	6381520	whatever the measure, what would you call the measure?
6381520	6387040	Assembly index. So there are three kind of fundamental kind of labels we have. So there's
6387040	6392480	the quantity of assembly and the assembly, so if you have a box, let's just have a box of molecules.
6392480	6396480	So I'm going to have my box, we count the number of identical molecules,
6396480	6402320	and then we chop each molecule up in a individual molecule class and calculate assembly number.
6402320	6409360	So basically, you then have a function that sums over all the molecules for each assembly,
6409360	6414160	and then you divide through. So you make it divide through by the number of molecules.
6414160	6416160	So that's the assembly index for the box.
6416160	6419600	So that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box. So basically,
6419600	6426160	the assembly equation we come up with is basically the sum of e to the power of the assembly index
6426160	6431360	for molecule i times the number of copies of the molecule i, and then you normalize.
6431360	6435680	So you sum them all up and then normalize. So some boxes are going to be more assembled than others.
6436400	6440880	Yeah, that's what they tell me. So if you were to look at me as a box, say I'm a box,
6441920	6448160	am I assembling my parts in terms of like, how do you know what's my assembly index and be gentle?
6448720	6453120	So let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you. So let's just take a pile of sand the same
6453120	6461840	weight as you, and I would take you and just cut up all the molecules. I mean, and look at the
6461840	6466160	number of copies and assembly number. So in sand, let's say there's probably going to be nothing
6466160	6470720	more than the assembly number of two or three, but there might be trillions and trillions of
6470720	6476000	sand grains in your body, there might be, the assembly number is going to be higher,
6476000	6480560	but there might not be as quite as many copies because the molecular weight is higher.
6481200	6484320	So you do want to average it out. You can average. You do average it.
6484320	6489120	I'm not, I'm not defined by the most impressive. No, no, you're an average in your volume. I mean,
6489120	6494000	we're just working this out. But what's really cool is that you're going to have a really high
6494000	6500080	assembly. The sand will have a very low assembly. Your causal power is much higher. You get to make
6500080	6505920	decisions. You're alive. You're aspiring assembly says something about causal power in the universe.
6506560	6513040	And that's not supposed to exist because physicists don't accept that causation exists at the bottom.
6513040	6518480	So I understand at the chemical level why the assembly is causation. Why is it causation?
6518480	6524080	Because it's capturing the memory. Exactly. It's capturing memory, but there's not an
6524080	6533840	action to it. So I'm trying to see how it leads to life. Well, it's what life does. So I think it's,
6534000	6540080	we don't know. That's a good question. What is life versus what does life do?
6540080	6543760	Yeah. So that's, this is the definition of life, the only definition we need.
6544320	6545040	The assembly.
6545040	6553920	It's basically that life is able to create objects in abundance that are so complex.
6553920	6559360	Your semi-number is so high, they can't possibly form in an environment where there's just random
6559360	6566480	interactions. So suddenly you can put life on a scale and then life doesn't exist actually
6567120	6574240	in that kind. It's just how evolved you are. And you as an object, because you have incredible
6574240	6586000	causal power, you could go and launch rockets or build cars or create drugs or you can do so many
6586000	6592400	things. You can build stuff, build more artifacts that show that you have had causal power. And
6592400	6599040	that causal power was this kind of a lineage. And I think that over time, I mean, realizing that
6599040	6606080	that physics as a discipline has a number of problems associated with me as a chemist is kind
6606080	6611680	of interesting that assembly theory, and I'm really, you know, I want to maintain some,
6611680	6615680	some credibility in the physics side, but I have to push them because physics
6616560	6621520	is a really good discipline. It's reduced the number. Physics is about reducing the belief
6621520	6626480	system, but they're down to some things in their belief system, which is kind of really makes me
6626480	6631040	kind of grumpy. Number one is requiring order at the beginning of the universe magically. We
6631040	6635840	don't need that. The second is the second law. Well, we don't actually need that.
6636640	6643280	And this is blasphemous. In a minute, I'll recover my career in a second, although I think the good,
6643280	6646320	the only good thing about being in the religious chair means I think there has to be an active
6646320	6655600	parliament to fire me. Yeah. But you can always go to least Twitter and protest.
6656560	6661440	And I think the third thing is that, so we've got, you know, we've got the order at the beginning.
6662400	6665840	Second law. Yeah, the second law, and the fact that causation is emergent,
6666640	6670880	right? And that time is emergent. John Carroll just turned off this program.
6672080	6675440	I think he believes that it's emergent. So causation is not...
6675440	6681280	That's clearly incorrect, because we wouldn't exist otherwise. So time, so physicists have kind
6681280	6687040	of got confused about time. Time is a real thing. Well, I mean, so look,
6687040	6692880	I'm very happy with the current description of the universe as physicists give me, because I
6692880	6696960	can do a lot of stuff, right? I can go to the moon with Newtonian physics, I think, and I can
6696960	6703200	understand the orbit of Mercury with relativity. And so, and I can build transistors with quantum
6703200	6707520	mechanics, right? And I can do all this stuff. So I'm not saying the physics is wrong. I'm just
6707520	6712640	saying, if we say that time is fundamental, i.e. time is non-negotiable, there's a global clock,
6712880	6719680	I don't need to, I don't need to require that there's order being magically made in the past,
6719680	6722960	because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is.
6725440	6729360	So if time is fundamental, I mean, you've been referring to this kind of
6731120	6737520	an interesting formulation of that as memory. Yeah. So time, time is hard to like put a
6738320	6742880	finger on like, what the hell are we talking about? Well, it's just a direction, but memory
6742880	6748960	is a construction, especially when you have like, think about these local pockets of complexity,
6748960	6756000	these non-zero assembly index entities that's being constructed, and they remember,
6757280	6761600	never forget molecules. But remember, the thing is, I invented assembly theory.
6762320	6767120	I'll tell you I invented it. When I was a kid, I mean, the thing is, I keep making fun of myself
6767120	6772240	to my search group. I've only ever had one idea. I keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or
6772240	6777200	so since I had that idea. Well, aren't you the idea that the universe had? So it's very kind of
6777200	6784400	hierarchical. Anyway, go ahead. I'm sorry. That's very poetic. So I think I came up with assembly
6784400	6789840	theory the following idea. When I was a kid, I was obsessed about survival kits. What is the
6789840	6795520	minimum stuff that I would need to basically replicate my reality? And I love computers,
6795520	6800240	and I love technology or what technology was going to come. So I imagined that I would have
6800240	6804880	basically this really big truck full of stuff. And I thought, well, can I delete some of that
6804880	6809360	stuff out? Can I have a blueprint? And then in the end, I kept making this, making it smaller,
6809360	6814960	I got to maybe a half a truck, then to a suitcase. And then I went, okay, screw it. I want to carry
6814960	6820640	my entire technology in my pocket. How do I do it? And I'm not like going to launch into Steve,
6820640	6826960	Joel B, and you know, I play. I came up with a matchbox survival kit. In that matchbox survival
6826960	6831440	kit, I would have the minimum stuff that would allow me to interact the environment to build
6831440	6837920	my shelter, to build a fishing rod, to build a water purification system. And it's kind of like,
6837920	6843680	so what did I use in my box to assemble in the environment to assemble, to assemble, to assemble.
6844480	6849440	And I realized I could make a causal chain in my survival kit. So I guess that's probably why
6849440	6856240	I've been obsessed with assembly theory for so long. And I was just pre-configured to find it
6856240	6862880	somewhere. And when I saw it in molecules, I realized that the causal structure that we say
6862880	6868800	emerges, and the physics kind of gets really stuck, because they're saying that time, you can go
6868800	6873920	backwards in time. I mean, how do we let physicists get away with the notion that we can go back in
6873920	6883360	time and meet ourselves? I mean, that's clearly a very hard thing to allow. The physicists would not
6883360	6890000	let other sciences get away with that kind of heresy, right? So why are physicists allowed to
6890000	6896160	get away with it? So first of all, to push back, to play devil's advocate, you are clearly married
6896160	6903920	to the idea of memory. You see in this, again, Rick from Rick and Morty Way, you have these
6903920	6910160	deep dreams of the universe that is writing the story through its memories, through its chemical
6910160	6915040	compounds that are just building on top of each other. And then they find useful components that
6915040	6921680	can reuse. And then their reused components create systems that themselves are then reused.
6921680	6929600	And all in this way construct things. But when you think of that as memory, it seems like quite
6929600	6935360	sad that you can walk that back. But at the same time, it feels like that memory, you can walk in
6935360	6940320	both directions on that memory in terms of time. You could walk in both directions. But I don't
6940320	6950480	think that that makes any sense. Because the problem that I have with time being reversible is that
6951920	6955840	I mean, I'm just a, you know, I'm a dumb experimental chemist, right? So I love burning
6955840	6961040	stuff, you know, burning stuff and building stuff. But when I think of reversible phenomena,
6961040	6966720	I imagine in my head, I have to actually manufacture some time. I have to borrow time from the
6966720	6972320	universe to do that. I can't, when anyone says let's imagine that we can go back in time or
6972320	6976880	reversibility, you can't do that. You can't step out of time. Time is non-negotiable. It's happening.
6976880	6983120	No, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental, which most of us do when we go
6983120	6988960	day to day, but it takes a leap of wild imagination to think that time is emergent.
6989600	6994000	No, time is not emergent. Yeah. I mean, this is an argument we can have, but I believe
6994000	6998800	I can come up with an experiment. An experiment that proves that time cannot possibly be emergent.
6998880	7006480	Experiment that shows how assembly theory kind of is the way that the universe
7006480	7012720	produces selection and that selection gives rise to life. And also to say, well, hang on,
7013440	7018480	we could allow ourselves to have a theory that requires us to have these statements to be possible.
7019120	7025040	Like we need to have order in the past, or we can have used the past hypothesis,
7026000	7033120	which is order in the past as well. And we have to have an arrow of time. We have to
7033120	7039840	require that entropy increases. And then we can say, look, the universe is completely closed
7039840	7045280	and there's no novelty, or that novelty is predetermined. What I'm saying is very, very
7045280	7051040	important that time is fundamental, which means if you think about it, the universe becomes
7051040	7054960	more and more novel each step, it generates, there's more states in the next step than it was
7054960	7060160	before. So that means bigger search. So what I'm saying is that the universe wasn't capable of
7060160	7067200	consciousness at day one. Actually, because you didn't have enough states, but today the universe
7067200	7072400	is complex. So it's like, how? All right, all right, hold on a second. Now we've pissed off the
7072400	7079600	pants like it's two. Okay. No, that's brilliant. Sorry. A part of me is just joking, having fun
7079680	7083440	with this thing, but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff, and I'm trying to
7083440	7088720	slow it down before my brain explodes. So because I want to break apart some of the
7088720	7094640	fascinating things you're saying. So novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe,
7094640	7098400	because the number of states is increasing. What do you mean by states?
7098400	7102240	So I think the physicists almost got everything right. I can't fault them at all.
7102800	7106400	I just think there's a little bit of dog. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate. I'm very
7106400	7111200	happy to be entirely wrong on this, right? I'm not right on many things at all. But
7112000	7117200	but if I can make less assumptions about the universe with this, then potentially that's a
7117200	7122480	more powerful way of looking at things. If you think of time as fundamental, you can make less
7122480	7126960	assumptions overall. Exactly. The time is fundamental. I don't need to add on a magical
7126960	7131280	second law, because the second law comes out of the fact the universe is actually there's
7131280	7135440	more states available. I mean, we might even be able to do weird things like dark energy in the
7135440	7140960	universe might actually just be time, right? Yeah, but then you have to still have to explain
7140960	7145440	why time is fundamental, because I can give you one explanation that's simpler than time and say
7145440	7152160	God. Just because it's simple doesn't mean it's okay. You still have to explain
7152160	7156960	God and you still have to explain time. Why is it fundamental? So let's just say existence is
7156960	7162640	default, which means time is the default. So how did you go from the existence to the
7163280	7166880	Well, look, we exist, right? So let's just take, be very
7166880	7170960	We're yet to talk about what exists mean. All right, let's go all the way back. Yeah, okay.
7170960	7174960	I think it's very poetic and beautiful what you're weaving into this. I don't think this
7174960	7181040	conversation is even about the assembly, which is fascinating. And we'll keep mentioning it
7181040	7187520	as an index and this idea that I don't think is necessarily connected to time. Oh, I think it
7187520	7192960	is deeply connected. I can't explain it yet. So you don't think everything you've said about
7192960	7198640	assembly theory and assembly index can still be correct even if time is emergent?
7198640	7203520	So yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work, I appear to be able to measure
7203520	7206880	objects of high assembly in a mass spectrum and look at their abundance and you know,
7206880	7211840	all that's fine, right? It's a nice, if nothing else, it's a nice way of looking at how molecules
7211840	7217760	can compress things. Now, am I saying that a time has to be fundamental or not emergent for
7217760	7224640	assembly theory to work? No, I think I'm saying that the universe, it appears that the universe
7224640	7228240	has many different ways of using time, you could have three different types of time,
7228240	7231920	you could just have time that's the way I would think of it. If you want, if you want to hold
7231920	7236640	on to emergent time, I think that's fine. Let's do that for a second. Hold on to emergent time.
7237360	7241600	And the universe is just doing its thing. Then assembly time only exists when the
7241600	7245520	universe starts to write memories through bonds. So let's just say there's rocks running around,
7245520	7252160	you know, there's, when the bond happens and selection starts, suddenly there are,
7252160	7257280	the universe is remembering cause in the past. And those structures will have effects in the
7257280	7262880	future. So suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point, which has a direction. And I think
7262880	7267520	Sean Carroll at this point might even turn the podcast back on and go, okay, I can deal with
7267520	7271440	that. That's fine. But I'm just basically trying to condense the conversation and say, hey,
7271440	7275280	let's just have time fundamental and see how that screws with people's minds. Why-
7275280	7278080	You're triggering people by saying fundamental. Why not?
7278080	7279760	Well, why not? Let's say-
7279760	7286160	Why am I, look, I'm walking through the wall. Why, why, why should I grow up in a world where time,
7286880	7291280	I don't go back in time. I don't meet myself in the past. There are no one,
7291360	7294160	there are no aliens coming from the future. Right?
7294160	7295520	But, you know, it's just like-
7295520	7299440	No, no, no. But that's not, no, no, no, hold on a second. That's like saying,
7300000	7305600	we're talking about biology or like evolutionary psychology and you're saying, okay, let's just
7305600	7310560	assume that that clothing is fundamental. People wearing clothes is fundamental. It's like, no,
7310560	7316480	no, no, wait a minute. You can't, like, I think you're getting in a lot of trouble if you assume
7316480	7317520	time is fundamental.
7317520	7320880	Why? Give me one reason why I'm getting into trouble time being fundamental.
7321280	7328560	Because you might not understand the origins of this memory that might be deeper. Like that,
7328560	7333760	this memory, that could be a thing that's explaining the construction of these
7334960	7344080	higher complexities better than just saying it's a search. It's chemicals doing a search for
7345040	7352240	reusable, reusable structures that they can, like, then use as bricks to build the house.
7352240	7357120	Okay. So, I accept that. So, let's go back a second because it's a kind of,
7357120	7362080	it is, I wanted to drop the time bomb at this part because I think we can carry on discussing it
7362080	7370080	for many, many, many, many, many, many days, many months. But I'm happy to accept that it might be
7370080	7375200	wrong. But what I would like to do is imagine a universe where time is fundamental and time is
7375200	7382720	emergent and ask, let's just then talk about causation. Because physicists require that causation.
7382720	7388320	So, this is where I'm going to go. Causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the micro scale.
7388320	7392800	Well, that clearly is wrong. Because if causation has to emerge at the macro scale, life cannot
7392800	7398240	emerge. So, how does life emerge? Life requires molecules to bump into each other, produce
7398240	7403200	replicators. Those replicators need to produce polymers. There needs to be cause and effect at
7403200	7410080	the molecular level. There needs to be a non-agirdic to an agirdic transition at some point. And
7412160	7418880	those replicators have material consequence in the universe. Physicists just say, oh,
7418880	7423680	you know what? I'm going to have a bunch of particles in the box. I'm going to think about it
7423760	7429040	in a Newtonian way, in a quantum way. And I'll add on a narrow time so I can label things.
7430080	7433360	And causation will happen magically later. Well, how? Explain causation.
7434800	7440000	And they can't. The only way I can reconcile causation is having a fundamental time,
7440560	7444560	because this allows me to have a deterministic universe that creates novelty.
7445840	7450240	And there's so many things from unpack here. But let's go back to the point. You said,
7450560	7455680	can assembly theory work with immersion time? Sure, it can. But it doesn't give me a deep
7455680	7462960	satisfaction about how causation and assembly gives rise to these objects that move through
7462960	7469200	time and space. And again, what am I saying? To bring it back, I can say without fear,
7469760	7473840	take this water bottle and look at this water bottle and look at the features on it, this writing,
7473840	7479120	you've got a load of them. I know that causal structures gave rise to this. In fact,
7479120	7482320	I'm not looking at just one water bottle here, I'm looking at every water bottle that's ever
7482320	7488240	been conceived of by humanity. This here is a special object. In fact, Leibniz knew this.
7488240	7493920	You know, Leibniz, who was at the same time of Newton, he kind of got stuck. I think Leibniz
7493920	7498880	actually invented assembly theory. You gave soul. The soul that you see in objects wasn't
7498880	7504240	the mystical soul, it is assembly. It is the fact there's been a history of objects related. And
7504800	7510720	without the object in the past, this object wouldn't exist. There is a lineage and there is
7510720	7514480	conserved structures, causal structures have given rise to those.
7517040	7522880	Fair enough. And you're saying it's just a simpler view with time is fundamental.
7522880	7527600	And it shakes the physicist's cage a bit, right? I'm going to say, but I think that...
7529040	7532400	I just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages.
7532640	7538240	I think that, I mean, I would say that, you know, Lee Smolin, I don't want to speak for Lee. I'm
7538240	7543600	talking to Lee about this. I think Lee also is an agreement that time has to be fundamental.
7543600	7548320	But I think he goes further. You know, even in space, I don't think you can go back to the same
7548320	7553440	place in space. I've been to Austin a few times now. This is my, I think third time I've been to
7553440	7558080	Austin. Is Austin in the same place? No. The solar system is moving through space.
7559040	7565920	I'm not going back in the same space. Locally, I am. Every event in the universe is unique.
7567760	7573920	In space. And time. And time. Doesn't mean we can't go back though. I mean,
7574640	7579920	you know, I mean, let's just, you know, rest this conversation, which was beautiful,
7580640	7585040	with a quote from the Rolling Stones that you can't always get what you want,
7585040	7590000	which is you want time to be fundamental. But if you try, you'll get what you need,
7590000	7597120	which is assembly theory. Okay, let me ask you about, continue talking about complexity and
7598560	7604720	to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours that you're developing and I'm sure will continue
7604720	7613520	developing both in the lab and in theory. Yeah, it's, can't be said enough, just the ideas you're
7613600	7617920	playing with it in your head are just, and we've been talking about it just beautiful.
7617920	7620320	So if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally,
7622560	7629840	maybe in an admiring romantic way, how does complexity emerge from simple rules? The why,
7629840	7636880	the how? Okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there. I would say that the problem I have
7636880	7641280	right now is, I mean, you're right, we can, about time as well. The problem is I have this hammer
7641280	7647360	called assembly and everything I see is a nail. So now let's just apply it to all sorts of things.
7647360	7650720	We take the Bernard instability, the Bernard instability is you have oil,
7652160	7657360	if you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan, when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns.
7657360	7665600	Take the formation of snowflakes, right? Take the emergence of a tropical storm
7665600	7670000	or the storm on Jupiter. When people say, let's talk about complexity in general,
7670000	7677600	what they're saying is, let's take this collection of objects that are correlated in some way and
7677600	7683680	try and work out how many moving parts or how this got, how this exists. So what people have been
7683680	7690000	doing for a very long time is taking complexity and counting what they've lost, calculating the
7690000	7695360	entropy. And the reason why I'm pushing very hard on assembly is entropy tells you how much you've
7695360	7701040	lost. It doesn't tell you the microstates are gone. But if you embrace it, go the bottom up with
7701040	7708000	assembly, those states, and you then understand the causal chain that gives rise to the emergence.
7708560	7713600	So what I think assembly will help us do is understand weak emergence at the very least
7714240	7721040	and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way. And I've been fascinated with
7721040	7728400	complexity theory for many years. I mean, as soon as I could, I learned of the Mandelbrot set
7728400	7735120	and I could just type it up in my computer and run it and just show it and see it unfold.
7735680	7742080	It was just this mathematical reality that existed in front of me. I just found
7743120	7748400	incredible. But then I realized that actually we were cheating. We're putting in the boundary
7748400	7753760	conditions all the time. We're putting in information. And so when people talk to me about
7753760	7759520	the complexity of things, I say, but relative what? How do you measure them? So my attempt,
7759520	7765920	my small attempt, naive attempt, because there's many greater minds than mine on the planet right
7765920	7770240	now thinking about this properly. And you've had some of them on the podcast, right? They're just
7770240	7776800	absolutely fantastic. But I'm wondering if we might be able to reformat the way we would explore
7777760	7785200	algorithmic complexity using assembly. What's the minimum number of constraints we need
7785200	7790960	in our system for this to unfold? So whether it's like, you know, if you take some particles and put
7790960	7796320	them in a box, at a certain box size, you get quasi-crystallinity coming out, right?
7796960	7802880	But that emergence, it's not magic. It must come from the boundary conditions you put in.
7803680	7810000	So all I'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see is a direct read of the constraints we put
7810000	7814480	in, but we just don't understand. So as I said earlier, to the poor origin of life chemists,
7814480	7820240	you know, origin of life is a scam, I would say lots of complexity calculation theories,
7820240	7825440	a bit of a scam, because we put the constraints in, but we don't count them correctly. And I'm
7825440	7831840	wondering if- Oh, you're thinking and starting to drop as assembly theory, the assembly index is
7831840	7837840	a way to count to the constraints. Yes, that's it. That's all it is. So assembly theory doesn't lower
7837840	7843040	any of the importance of complexity theory, but it allows us to go across domains and start to
7843040	7848800	compare things, compare the complexity of a molecule of a microprocessor of the text you've
7848800	7856960	writing, of the music you may compose. You've tweeted, quote, assembly theory explains why
7856960	7862560	Nietzsche understood we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom. So we've applied
7862560	7868560	assembly theory to cellular automata in life and chemistry. What does Nietzsche have to do
7868560	7874800	with assembly? Oh, that gets me into free will and everything. So let me say that again, assembly
7874800	7880400	theory explains why Nietzsche understood we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom,
7880400	7884400	limited freedom, freedom I suppose is referring to the fact that there's constraints.
7885040	7893280	Or what is radical freedom? What is freedom? So Sartre was like believed in absolute freedom,
7894240	7901280	and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination. And Nietzsche understood that his
7901280	7906720	freedom was somewhat more limited. And it kind of takes me back to this computer game that I played
7906720	7913280	when I was 10. So I think it's called Dragon's Lair. Do you know Dragon's Lair? I think I know
7913280	7917280	Dragon's Lair, yeah. Dragon's Lair, I knew I was being conned, right? Dragon's Lair, when you play
7917280	7921440	the game, you're lucky that you grew up in a basically procedurally generated world.
7921440	7927520	That was RPG a little bit. No, it's like, is it turn-based play? Was it? No. It was a role-playing
7927520	7932480	game, but really good graphics, and one of the first laser discs. And when you actually flicked
7932480	7938640	the stick, it's like it was like a graphical adventure game with animation. And when I played
7938640	7942880	this game, you could get through the game in 12 minutes if you knew what you were doing
7942880	7946160	without making mistakes. You just play the disc, play the disc, play the disc. So it was just
7946160	7952320	about timing. And actually, it was a complete fraud because all the animation has been pre-recorded
7952320	7958160	on the disc. It's like the Black Mirror, the first interactive where they had all the several million
7958880	7963760	kind of permutations of the movie that you could select on Netflix. I've forgotten the name of it.
7964560	7970000	So this was exactly that in the laser disc. You basically go left, go right, fight the yoga,
7970800	7974720	slay the dragon. And when you flick the joystick at the right time, it just goes to the next
7974720	7980080	animation to play. It's not really generating it. And I played that game and I knew I was being had.
7980720	7988400	Oh, okay. So to you, dragging there is the first time you realized that free will is an illusion?
7989600	7996640	Yeah. And why does assembly theory give you hints about free will, whether it's an illusion
7996640	8002720	or not? Yeah, so no, so not entirely. I do think I have some will. And I think I am an agent. And
8002720	8007200	I think I can interact and I can play around with the models I have of the world and the
8007280	8011360	cost functions, right? And I can hack my own cost functions, which means I have a little bit of
8011360	8016560	free will. But as much as I want to do stuff in the universe, I don't think I could suddenly say,
8017200	8020000	I mean, actually, this is ridiculous, because now I say I could try and do it, right? It's like,
8020000	8025760	I'm suddenly give up everything and become a rapper tomorrow, right? Maybe I could try that,
8025760	8031680	but I don't have sufficient agency to make that necessarily happen. I'm on a trajectory. So when
8031680	8037760	in Dragon's Lair, I know that I have some trajectories that I can play with, where Sartre
8037760	8042800	realized he thought that he had no assembly, no memory, he could just leap across and do everything.
8043360	8048480	And Nietzsche said, okay, I realize I don't have full freedom, but I have some freedom.
8049200	8054080	And assembly theory basically says that says, if you have these constraints in your past,
8054080	8059440	they limit what you were able to do in the future, but you can use them to do amazing things. Let's
8059440	8065200	say I'm a poppy plant and I'm creating some opiates. The opiates are really interesting
8065200	8069680	molecules. I mean, they're obviously great for medicine, great cause, great problems in society.
8069680	8076560	But let's just imagine we fast forward a billion years, what will opiate the opioids look like
8076560	8081520	in a billion years? Well, we can guess because we can see how those proteins will evolve, and we can
8081520	8086800	see how the secondary metabolites will change. And but they can't go radical, they can't, they
8086800	8091520	can't suddenly become, I don't know, like a molecule that you find in an OLED in a display.
8092160	8096960	They will have some, they will be limited by their causal chain that produced them.
8096960	8101120	And that's what I'm getting at, saying you're, we're predicted, we are
8101760	8106480	unpredictably predictable, or predictably unpredictable, predictably unpredictable
8106480	8110640	within a constraint on the trajectory we're on. Yeah, so the predictably part is the
8110640	8115440	is the constraints of the trajectory. And the unpredictable part is the part that you still
8115440	8121520	haven't really clarified the origin of, of the little bit of freedom. Yeah. So you're, you're
8121520	8127600	just arguing, you're basically saying that radical freedom is impossible. You're, you're really
8127600	8131680	operating in a world of constraints that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory
8131680	8138480	of the chemistry that led to who you are. Okay. But, you know, even just a tiny bit of freedom,
8138960	8148240	even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages, if you can move around in that cage
8148240	8154880	a little bit, you're free. I agree. And so the question is in assembly theory,
8155520	8160320	if we're thinking about free will, where does the little bit of freedom come from? What is the
8160400	8168240	eye that can decide to be a rapper? What, why, what is that? That's a cute little
8168240	8174080	trick we've convinced each other of so we can do fun tricks at parties, or is there
8174080	8178080	something fundamental that allows us to feel free, to be free?
8178800	8183120	I think that that's the question that I want to answer. I know you want to answer it.
8183120	8188720	And I think it's so profound. I'd let me have a go at it. I would say that I don't
8188720	8192480	take the stance of Sam Harris, because I think Sam Harris, when he said, the way he says it is
8192480	8196160	almost, it's really interesting. I'd love to talk to him about it. Sam Harris almost thinks
8196160	8202560	himself out of existence, right? Because do you know what I mean? Yeah, well, I mean, he has
8202560	8207520	different views on consciousness versus free will. I think he saves himself with consciousness. He
8207520	8212240	thinks himself out of existence with free will. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I mean, there's no point,
8212240	8221760	right? He's a leaf floating on a river. Yeah. I think that he, he's, I don't know, I'd love
8221760	8225600	to ask him whether he really believes that and then we could play some games. Oh, yeah. No, no,
8225600	8229920	I then would say, I'll get him to play a game of cards with me. And I'll work out the conditions
8229920	8234000	on which he says no. And then I'll get him to the conditions he says yes. And then I'll trap
8234000	8238720	him in his logical inconsistency with that argument. Because at some point, at some point,
8238720	8244800	when he loses enough money, or the prospect of losing enough money, there's a way of basically
8244800	8251600	mapping out a series of, so what will is about, let's not call it free will, what will is about
8251600	8257840	is to have a series of decisions equally weighted in front of you. And those decisions aren't
8257840	8263920	necessarily energy minimization. Those decisions are a function of the model you've made in your
8263920	8270800	mind, you're in your simulation, and the way you've interacted in reality, and also other
8270800	8277360	interactions that you're having with other individuals and happenstance. And I think that
8277920	8284240	there's a little bit of delay in time. So I think what you're able to do is say, well,
8284240	8289920	I'm going to do the counterfactual. I've done all of them. And I'm going to go this way.
8290640	8294880	And you probably don't know why. I think free will is actually very complex interaction between
8296080	8300720	your unconscious and your conscious brain. And I think the reason why we're arguing about it
8300720	8308000	is so interesting. And we just, some people outsource their free will to that unconscious brain.
8308720	8313680	And some people try and overthink the free will in the conscious brain. I would say that
8314240	8318480	Sam Harris has realized his conscious brain doesn't have free will, but his unconscious brain does.
8318480	8321920	That's my guess, right? And that he can't have access to the unconscious brain.
8321920	8326320	And that's kind of annoying. And so he's just, he's going through meditation,
8326320	8332560	come to acceptance with that fact. Yeah. Which is maybe okay. But I do think that I have
8333520	8338080	the ability to make decisions and I like my decisions. In fact, I mean, this is an argument I
8338080	8344720	have with some people that some days I feel I have no free will and it's just an illusion.
8344720	8348320	And this is one, and it makes me more radical if you like, you know, as a,
8349440	8353520	I get to explore more of the state space and I'm like, I'm going to try and affect the world now.
8353520	8358480	I'm really going to ask the question that maybe I dare not ask or dare not or do the thing I dare
8358480	8365840	not do. And that allows me to kind of explore more. It's funny that if you truly accept that there's
8365840	8376320	no free will, that is a kind of radical freedom. It's funny, but you're, because the little bit
8376320	8383280	of the illusion in under that framework that you have that you can make choices, if choice is just
8383280	8388720	an illusion of psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want. That's the- But we don't, do we?
8388720	8393520	And I think- But because you don't truly accept that you think that there's
8393840	8400880	like, you think there's a choice, which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want.
8400880	8404560	Like you feel like there's some responsibility for making the wrong choice, which is why you
8404560	8411120	don't do it. But if you truly accept that the choice has already been made, then you can go,
8412000	8419680	I don't know what is the most radical thing. I mean, but I don't, I wonder what,
8419760	8426080	what am I preventing myself from doing that I would really want to do? Probably like humor stuff,
8426080	8434480	like I would, I would love to, if I could like save a game, do the thing, and then reload it later,
8434480	8440000	like do undo, it'd probably be humor, just to do something like super hilarious.
8442400	8447280	That's super embarrassing. And then just go, I mean, it's basically just fun. I would add more
8447280	8454480	fun to the world. I mean, I sometimes do that as I, you know, I sometimes, I try and, I try and
8454480	8459360	mess up my reality in unusual ways by just doing things because I'm bored, but not bored. I'm
8459360	8463440	not expressing this very well. I think that this is a really interesting problem that perhaps the
8463440	8468240	hard sciences don't really understand that they are responsible for because the question about
8468240	8473040	how life emerged and how intelligence emerges and consciousness and free will, they're all
8473040	8477840	ultimately boiling down to some of the same mechanics, I think my feeling is that they are
8478400	8484560	the same problem again and again and again, the transition from a, you know, a, a boring world
8484560	8488640	or a world in which there is no selection. So I wonder if free will has something to do with
8488640	8493280	selection and models and, and also the models you're generating the brain and also your, the
8493280	8497280	amount of memory, a working memory have available at any one time to generate counterfactuals.
8497280	8502400	Well, that's fascinating. So like the decision making process is a kind of selection and that
8502400	8508160	that could be just absolutely yet another, yet another manifestation of the selection mechanism
8508160	8512320	that's pervasive throughout the universe. Okay. That's fascinating to think about.
8514800	8519840	Yeah. There's not some kind of fundamental its own thing or something like that that is just
8519840	8526240	yet another example of selection. Yeah. And in the universe that's intrinsically open,
8526240	8529760	you want to do that because you generate novelty. You mentioned something about
8530640	8535680	do cellular automata exist outside the human mind in our little offline conversation.
8537040	8541280	Why is that an interesting question? So cellular automata complexity,
8542400	8547840	what's the relationship between complexity in the human mind and trees falling in the forest?
8548880	8554240	Infrastructure. So the CA, so when John von Neumann and Conway and Feynman were doing
8554240	8558160	CA, they were doing on paper. CA is cellular automata. Yeah. Just drawing them on paper.
8558800	8562480	How awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata on paper. Yeah.
8562480	8568720	And then they were doing a computer that takes like forever to print out anything and program.
8568720	8572480	Sure. People are not with the TikTok kids these days with the TikTok,
8573520	8578880	don't understand how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata arbitrarily changing the
8578880	8583920	rules as you want to the initial conditions and see the beautiful patterns emerge,
8583920	8587440	sing with fractals, all of that. Oh, I've got to, you've just given me a brilliant idea.
8587440	8590880	I wonder if there's a TikTok account that's just dedicated to putting out CA rules and
8590880	8596160	isn't, we should make one. 100%. And that will get millions of views.
8596160	8602720	Millions, yes. No, it'll get dozens. Just have them running. So look, I kind of,
8603680	8613600	CA, I love CA's. Sorry. Yeah, no. We just have to make one. I actually, a few years ago,
8614000	8618960	I made some robots that talked to each other, chemical robots that played the game of Hex,
8619920	8624160	invented by John Nash by doing chemistry and they communicated via Twitter,
8624800	8628880	which experiments they were doing. And they had a, they had a, they had a lookup table of
8628880	8632800	experiments and robot one said, I'm doing experiment 10. The other robot, okay, I'll do
8632800	8637840	experiment one then. And they communicated via Twitter and then. Publicly or GMs? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8637840	8641360	Oh, can you maybe quickly explain what the game of Hex is?
8641360	8646240	Yeah, so it's a basically a hexagonal board and you try and basically, you color each
8646240	8650480	hexing, each element on the board at each hexagon and you try and get from one side to the other
8650480	8654480	and the other one tries to block you. We, how are they connected? So what are the robots?
8654480	8659680	So it's a chemical. Yeah, let's go back. So the two robots, each robot was doing
8659680	8664080	dye chemistry. So making RGB, red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red, green, blue.
8664080	8669360	And they could just choose from experiments to do red, green, blue. Initially, I said to my group,
8669360	8672720	we need to make two chemical robots that play chess. And my group were like,
8672720	8676320	that's too hard. No, go away. But anyways, we had the robot.
8679040	8686000	People listening to this should probably know that Lee Cronin is an amazing group of brilliant
8686000	8692480	people. He's exceptionally well published. He's written a huge number of amazing papers. Whenever
8693040	8699360	he calls himself stupid and is a sign of humility. And I deeply respect that and
8699360	8703760	appreciate it. So people listening to this should know this is a, this is a world-class
8703760	8708160	scientist who doesn't take himself seriously, which I really appreciate and love. Anywho,
8709600	8717600	talking about serious science, we're back to your group rejecting your idea of chemical robots
8717680	8726160	playing chess via dyes. So you went to a simpler game of hex. Okay. So what else?
8726160	8731040	The team that did it were brilliant. I really take the, I think they still have PTSD from
8731040	8736640	doing it. Cause I said, this is a workshop. What I'd often do is I have about 60 people on my team.
8736640	8741040	And occasionally before lockdown, I would say, I'm a bit bored. We're going to have a workshop
8741040	8744720	on something. Who wants to come? And they're basically about 20 people turn up to my office.
8744720	8749360	And I say, we're going to do this mad thing. And then the, it would just self-organize. And
8749360	8753680	some of them would say, no, I'm not doing this. And then you get, you get left with the happy
8753680	8758000	dozen. And what we did is we built this robot and doing dye chemistry is really easy. You can
8758000	8762400	just take two molecules, react them together and change color. And what I wanted to do is have a
8762400	8767040	palette of different molecules. You could react commentarily and get different colors. So you
8767040	8772720	got two robots. And I went, wouldn't it be cool if the robots basically shared the same list of
8772720	8777440	reactions to do? And they said, oh, I'm, and because of, then you could do a kind of multi-core
8778160	8781920	chemistry, like they weren't, so you could have two chemical reactions going on at once. And
8781920	8786640	they could basically outsource the problem. But they're sharing the same tape. Exactly. So robot
8786640	8789520	one would say, I'm going to do, I'm going to do experiment one. And the other robot says,
8789520	8793520	I'll do experiment a hundred. And then they could cross it off. But I wanted to make it.
8793520	8798320	That's brilliant, by the way. That is genius. Sorry. Well, I wanted to make it groovier. And I
8798320	8804480	said, look, let's have them competing to make, so playing a game of hex. And so when the robot
8804480	8810640	does a, it does an experiment, and the more blue the dye, the more it gets to the chart, the higher
8810640	8815600	chance it gets to make the move it wants on the hex board. So if it gets a red color is like it's
8815600	8820160	gets down weighted in the other robot. And so what the robots could do is they play each player move.
8820880	8825200	And because the fitness function or the optimization function was to make the color blue,
8825200	8832000	they started to invent reactions we didn't weren't on the list. And they did this by not
8832000	8836960	cleaning, because we made cleaning optional. So when one robot realized if it didn't clean its
8836960	8840880	pipes, it could get blue more quickly. And the other robot realized that. So it was like getting
8840880	8848240	dirty as well. I didn't tell the consequences of super intelligence. Okay. But that was the game.
8848240	8852160	And we communicate through Twitter, though, they were doing it through Twitter and Twitter
8852160	8855280	bland them a couple of times. I said, come on, you've got a couple of robots doing chemistry.
8855280	8859280	It's really cool to stop banning them. But in the end, they had, we had to take them off Twitter
8859280	8863280	and they just communicated via a server, because it was just, there were people saying you can
8863280	8868080	still find it cronin lab one and cronin lab two on Twitter. And it was like make move, wait,
8868640	8876080	you know, mix A and B, wait 10 seconds, answer blue, you know, I really find it super compelling
8876080	8882320	that you would have a chemical entity that's communicating with the world.
8882960	8886480	That was one of the things I want to do in my origin of life reaction, right, is basically
8887040	8892800	have a, have a reactor that's basically just randomly enumerating through chemical space
8892800	8897600	and have some kind of cycle. And then read out what the molecules reading out using a mass
8897600	8903520	spectrometer, and then convert that to text and publish it on Twitter. And then wait until it says
8903520	8908160	I'm alive. I reckon that would get, I reckon that that Twitter account will get a lot of
8908160	8911520	followers. Yeah. And I'm still trying to convince my group that we should just make an origin of
8911520	8916320	life Twitter account where it's going blue and it's like, hello, testing. I'm here.
8917280	8920480	Well, I'll share it. I like it. I particularly enjoy this idea
8922880	8929200	of a non human entity communicating with the world via a human design social network. It's
8930160	8936960	quite a beautiful idea. How we were talking about
8938160	8942960	CAs existing outside the human mind. Yeah. So I really admire Stephen Wolfram. I think he was
8942960	8948160	a genius, clearly a genius. And trapped in is actually is like a problem with being so smart
8948160	8953760	if you get trapped in your own, you know, mind, right? And I've, I try to actually, I try to
8953760	8956880	convince Stephen that assembly theory wasn't nonsense. He was like, no, it's just nonsense.
8957680	8961280	I was a little bit sad by that. So nonsense applied, even if we applied to the simple
8962080	8965920	construct of a one dimensional cellular automata, for example. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean,
8965920	8970560	actually, maybe I'm doing myself a bit too down. It was, it was, it was just as a theory was coming
8970560	8974960	through and I didn't really know how to explain it. But, but we are going to use assembly theory
8974960	8980320	and CAs instead of automata. But I'm, I wanted to, what I was really curious about is why
8980960	8985440	people are marvel. I mean, you marvel at CAs and they're complex. And I said, well,
8985440	8989040	hang on that complexity is baked in because if you play the game of life
8989760	8995040	in a CA, you have to run it on a computer. You have to have a, you have to do a number of
8995040	8999760	operations put in the boundary conditions. So is it surprising that you get this structure out?
8999760	9005920	Is it manufactured by the boundary conditions? And, and it is interesting because I think
9007680	9013040	cellular automata running them is teaching me something about what real numbers are and aren't.
9013920	9017520	And I haven't quite got there yet. I was playing on the aeroplane coming over. I'm just realized
9017520	9021440	I have no idea what real numbers are really. And I was like, well, I do actually have some
9021440	9028000	notion of what real numbers are. And I think thinking about real numbers as functions,
9028800	9032800	rather than numbers is more appropriate. And then if you then apply that to CAs,
9033440	9039040	then you're saying, well, actually, why am I seeing this complexity in this, in this rule?
9039840	9044560	Is it, is it, you know, is it, is it, you've got this deterministic system,
9044560	9050640	and yet you get this incredible structure coming out? Well, isn't that what you'd get with any real
9050640	9056480	number as you, as you apply it as a function, and you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary
9056480	9062480	position? And I wonder if CAs are just helping me, well, my misunderstanding is CAs might be
9062480	9064960	helping me understand them in terms of real numbers. I don't know what you think.
9065280	9073520	Well, the function is, but the devil's in the function. Like, which is the function that's
9073520	9081520	generating your real number? Like that, it seems like it's very important, the specific
9081520	9086080	algorithm of that function, because some lead to something super trivial, some lead to something
9086080	9093600	that's all chaotic, and some lead to things that are just walked that fine line of complexity.
9094560	9099120	Yeah, I think we agree. So let's take it back a second. So take the logistic map or something,
9099120	9105600	logistic equation, where you have this equation, which is, you don't, you don't know what's going
9105600	9109680	to happen to n plus one. But once you've done n plus one, you know, full time, you can't predict it.
9110320	9116720	For me, CAs and logistic equation feel similar. And, and I think what's incredibly interesting,
9117280	9124960	and I share your kind of wonder at running a CA, but also I'm saying, well,
9124960	9128480	what is it about the boundary conditions and the way I'm running that calculation?
9128480	9133440	So in my group, with my team, we actually made a chemical CA. We made Game of Life. We actually
9133440	9137760	made a physical grid. I haven't been able to publish this paper. It's been trapped in purgatory
9137760	9142880	for a long time. But you wrote up a paper on how to do a chemical formulation of the game of life,
9143040	9146880	which we made a chemical computer and a little cells. And I was playing Game of Life.
9146880	9151120	With the BZ reactions, each cell would pulse on and off, on and off, on and off.
9151120	9156000	We have little stirra bars, and we have little gates. And we actually played Conway's Game of
9156000	9161840	Life in there. And we got structures in that, we got structures in that game from the chemistry
9161840	9165680	that you wouldn't expect from the actual CA. So that's kind of cool in that,
9166400	9171280	because they're, they're, they're interacting outside of the cells. So what's happening is
9171280	9176000	you're getting annoyed. So the thing is that you've got this BZ reaction that gives on off,
9176000	9180800	on off, on off, but there's also a wake. And those wakes constructively interfere,
9181360	9188960	and it's such a non-trivial way that it's a non-deterministic. And the non-determinism
9188960	9194080	in, in, in the system gives very rich dynamics. And I was wondering if I could physically make
9194080	9202320	a chemical computer with this CA that, that gives me something different. I can't get in a silicon
9202880	9208160	representation of a CA where all the states are clean, because you don't have the noise
9208960	9212000	trailing into the next round. You just have the state.
9212000	9217040	So the, the paper in particular, so that's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer to
9217040	9222160	construct a cellular automer and the famous one of Game of Life. But it's also interesting.
9223120	9228720	The really interesting scientific question of whether some kind of random perturbations or
9228720	9239840	some source of randomness can have a significant constructive effect on the complexity of the
9239840	9245760	system. And indeed, I mean, whether it's random or just non-deterministic, and can we bake in that
9245760	9251120	non-determinism at the beginning, you know, I wonder what, what is the, I'm trying to think
9251120	9258480	about what is the encoding space. The encoding space is pretty big. We have 49 starots of 49 cells,
9259040	9264560	49 chem bits, all connected to one another in like an analog computer, but being read out
9264560	9270160	discreetly as they come, the BZ reaction. So just to say the BZ reaction is a chemical oscillator.
9270160	9274800	And what happened in each cell is it goes between red and blue. So two Russians discovered it,
9274800	9278960	Beluzov-Zaposkinski. I think Beluzov first proposed it, and everyone said,
9278960	9282480	you're crazy, it breaks the second law. And Zaposkinski said, no, it doesn't break the second
9282480	9290240	law, it's consuming a fuel. And so, and then, and it's like, there's a lot of chemistry hidden
9290240	9294880	in the Russian literature, actually, because Russians just wrote it in Russian, they didn't
9294880	9299680	publish any English-speaking journals. It's heartbreaking, actually. Well, yeah, sad and
9300560	9304240	it's great that it's there, right? It's not lost. I'm sure we will find a way of translating it
9304240	9310400	properly. Well, the silver lining slash great or sadness of all of this is there's probably ideas
9311120	9318800	in English-speaking. Like, there's ideas in certain disciplines that if discovered by other
9318800	9324720	disciplines would crack open some of the biggest mysteries in those disciplines. Like, computer
9324720	9332000	science, for example, is trying to solve problems like nobody else has ever tried to solve problems,
9332720	9338400	as if it's not already been all addressed in cognitive science and psychology and mathematics
9338400	9344160	and physics and just whatever you want to economics even. But if you look into that
9344160	9350560	literature, you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas. Obviously, Russian is an interesting
9350560	9356720	case of that because there's a Lawson translation, but you said there's a source of fuel, a source of
9356720	9362400	energy. Yeah, yeah. So, the BZ reaction, you have an acid in there called Melonic Acid. Yeah.
9362400	9369680	And what happens is it's basically like a battery that powers it and it loses CO2. So,
9369680	9374320	decuboxlates. It's just a chemical reaction. What that means we have to do is continuously feed
9374320	9380800	or we just keep the BZ reaction going in a long enough time. So, it's like it's reversible in time.
9381360	9384160	But only like. Yeah.
9384160	9388960	Only like. But it's fascinating. I mean, the team that did it, I'm really proud of their
9388960	9394640	persistence. We made a chemical computer. It can solve little problems. It can solve
9394640	9398640	traveling salesman problems, actually. Nice. But like I say, it's-
9398640	9403120	But not any faster than the regular computer. Is there something you could do?
9403120	9408800	Maybe. I'm not sure. I think we can come up with a way of solving problems
9409680	9415920	also really complex hard ones. Because it's an analog computer and we can,
9417440	9420960	it can energy minimize really quickly. It doesn't have to basically go through every
9420960	9427840	element in the matrix. Like flip it. It reads out. So, we could actually do Monte Carlo
9427840	9433600	by just shaking the box. It's literally a box shaker. You don't actually have to
9433600	9437360	encode the shaking of the box in a silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around.
9437920	9442880	It's analog. It's natural. So, it's an organic computer.
9443440	9447360	Yeah. So, I was playing around with this and I was kind of annoying some of my colleagues.
9447360	9451360	I'm wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy, like quantum supremacy.
9451360	9457760	And I kind of calculated how big the grid has to be so we can actually start to solve problems
9457760	9463520	faster than a silicon computer. But I'm not willing to state how that is yet because I'm
9463520	9468480	probably wrong. It's not that it's any top secret thing is I want, I think I can make a
9468480	9472800	chemical computer that can solve optimization problems faster than a silicon computer.
9474000	9477760	That's fascinating. But then you're unsure how big that has to be.
9477760	9480800	Yeah. I think, I mean, it might be a big box hard to shake.
9480800	9484160	It might be exactly a big box hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy.
9485040	9490560	Did we answer the question about do cellular time exist outside the mind?
9491200	9497600	We didn't, but I would posit that they don't. But I think minds can, well...
9497600	9500480	So, the mind is fundamental. What's the...
9500480	9504960	What I mean is, well, I mean, sorry, let's go back. So, as a physical phenomena,
9504960	9511120	do CAs exist in physical reality? Right? I would say they probably don't exist outside
9511120	9514560	the human mind, but now we've constructed them. They exist in computer memories.
9514560	9519840	They exist in my lab. They exist on paper. So, they emerge from the human mind
9520560	9525760	I'm just interested in because Steven Wolfram likes CAs. A lot of people like CAs and likes to
9525760	9531920	think of them as minimal computational elements. I'm just saying, well, do they exist in reality
9531920	9535680	or are they a representation of a simple machine that's just very elegant to implement?
9537360	9539520	So, there's a platonic question, I guess. I mean, it's...
9541280	9544480	There's initial conditions. There's a memory in the system.
9545200	9550880	There are simple rules that dictate the evolution of the system. So, what exists?
9550880	9557040	The idea, the rules, the... Yeah, people are using CAs as models for things in reality to say,
9557040	9564400	hey, look, you can do this thing in a CA. And when I see this, I'm saying, oh, that's cool.
9564400	9567520	But what does that tell me about reality? Where's the CA in spacetime?
9567520	9572000	I see. Well, that's right. It's a mathematical object. So, for people who don't know cellular
9572000	9576880	automata, there's usually a grid where there's one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional.
9576880	9584000	And it evolves by simple local rules like you die or are born if the neighbors are alive or
9584000	9591840	dead. And it turns out if you have... With certain kinds of initial conditions and with
9591840	9598000	certain kinds of very simple rules, you can create arbitrarily complex and beautiful systems. And to
9598000	9609600	me, whether drugs are involved or not, I can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it,
9609600	9616720	how such complexity can emerge. It gives me almost like... People talk about religious experiences.
9617280	9626080	It gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse at the origin of this whole thing.
9626800	9635920	Whatever is creating this complexity from such simplicity is the very thing that brought my
9635920	9646720	mind to life. That's me, the human, our human civilization. And yes, those constructs are
9646720	9655280	pretty trivial. That's part of their magic is even in this trivial framework, you could see the
9655280	9660640	emergence or especially in this trivial framework, you could see the emergence of complexity from
9660640	9671760	simplicity. I guess what Lee, you're saying is that this is not... This is highly unlike systems
9671760	9678240	we see in the physical world, even though they probably carry some of the same magic mechanistically.
9679200	9685120	I mean, I'm saying that the operating system that a CA has to exist on is quite complex.
9686080	9690400	And so I wonder if you're getting the complexity out of the CA from the boundary conditions,
9690400	9695840	the operating system, the underlying digital computer... Oh, wow. Those are some strong words
9695840	9701360	against CA's then. Not again. I mean, I'm in love with CA's as well. I'm just saying,
9702160	9707120	they aren't as trivial as people think. They are incredible. To get to that richness,
9707120	9714880	you have to iterate billions of times and you need a display and you need a math coprocessor
9714880	9720560	and you need a von Neumann machine based on a Turing machine with digital error correction
9720560	9728080	and states. Wow. To think that for the simplicity of a grid, you're basically saying a grid is not
9728080	9732880	simple. Yeah. It requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life. Yeah.
9733360	9735360	Yeah.
9735360	9737280	Well then, what is simple?
9737280	9741200	That's all I wanted to say. I agree with you with the wonder of CA's, I just think. But remember,
9741200	9747360	we take so much for granted what the CA is resting on. Because von Neumann and Feynman
9747360	9751120	weren't showing, weren't seeing these elaborate structures. They could not get that far.
9753120	9754720	Yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind.
9754720	9756800	Yeah, exactly. The limitation of their pencil.
9757360	9764000	But I think that the question is whether the essential elements of the cellular automata
9765040	9772080	is present without all the complexities required to build a computer.
9774160	9779760	The reason I find it incredible is that my intuition is yes. It might look different.
9780720	9788880	There might not be a grid-like structure, but local interactions operating under simple rules
9789680	9796560	and resulting in multi-hierarchical complex structures feels like a thing that doesn't
9796560	9797840	require a computer.
9797840	9804800	I agree. But coming back to von Neumann and Feynman and Wolfram, their minds and non-trivial minds
9804800	9810000	to create those architectures and do it and to put on those state transitions.
9810880	9817760	I think that something that's really incredibly interesting that is understanding how the human
9817760	9820400	mind builds those state transition machines.
9821600	9828480	I could see how deeply in love with the idea of memory you are. It's like how much of E equals
9828480	9836160	mc squared is more than an equation. It has Albert Einstein in it.
9837680	9847600	You're saying you can't just say the equations of physics are a really good simple capture
9848480	9854320	of a physical phenomena. That equation has the memory of the humans.
9854960	9856080	Absolutely.
9858640	9865520	But I don't know if you're implying this. That's a beautiful idea, but I don't know
9866240	9870400	if I'm comfortable with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation.
9870880	9871360	No, it enhances it.
9871360	9873520	Because it's built on the shoulders, it enhances it.
9873520	9878640	I think it enhances it. That equation is a minimal compressed representation of reality.
9879200	9884960	We can use machine learning or Max Tecmark's AI Feynman to find lots of solutions for gravity,
9884960	9889280	but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find are the maximally compressed representations?
9890880	9896800	Yeah, but that representation, I guess the universe has the memory of Einstein with that
9896800	9902800	representation, but then you can now give it as a gift for free to other alien civilizations.
9902800	9904880	Einstein had to go through a lot of pain together, but it's a low memory.
9905520	9908320	I say that physics and chemistry and biology are the same discipline.
9910640	9914640	Laws in physics, there's no such thing as a law in physics, it's just low memory stuff.
9915440	9918720	Because you've got low memory stuff, things reoccur quickly.
9919680	9923840	As you get building more memory, you get to chemistry, so things become more contingent.
9923840	9927280	When you get to biology, more contingent still, and then technology.
9927280	9930400	So the more memory you need, the more your laws are local.
9931360	9935440	That's all I'm saying, and the less memory, the more the laws are universal,
9935440	9937600	because they're not laws, they are just low memory states.
9940080	9945520	We have to talk about a thing you've mentioned already a bunch of times, but
9946160	9954080	doing computation through chemistry, chemical-based computation, I've seen you refer to it as
9955040	9960320	in a sexy title of chem-putation.
9961360	9965360	What is chem-putation and what is chemical-based computation?
9966640	9974160	Chem-putation is a name I gave to the process of building a state machine to make any molecule
9974160	9982720	physically in the lab. As a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand, and they're quite hard.
9982800	9988960	Chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge, a lot of ambiguity. It's not possible to go uniform
9988960	9994960	me to the literature and read a recipe to make a molecule and then go make it in the lab every
9994960	10003520	time. Some recipes are better than others, but they all assume some knowledge, and it's not
10003520	10011120	universal what that is. So it's carried from human to human, some of that implicit knowledge.
10011200	10014800	You're saying, can we remove the humor from the picture? Can we program?
10015680	10017280	By the way, what is a state machine?
10018560	10026800	So a state machine is, I suppose, an object either abstract or mechanical, where you can do
10029360	10033600	a unit operation on it and flick it from one state to another. So a turnstile would be a
10033600	10038400	good example of a state machine. There's some kinds of states and some kind of transitions
10038480	10044880	between states, and it's very formal in nature in terms of, like, it's precise.
10044880	10051600	Yes, you can mathematically precisely describe a state machine. So a very simple Boolean
10052640	10059920	gates are a very good way of building logic-based state machines. Obviously, a Turing machine,
10059920	10065360	the concept of a Turing machine where you have a tape and a read head and a series of rules
10065360	10070640	in a table, and you would basically look at what's on the tape, and if you're shifting the tape
10070640	10074880	from left to right, and if you see a zero or one, you look in your lookup table and say,
10074880	10083600	right, I've seen a zero and a one, and then respond to that. So the turnstile would be,
10083600	10090720	is there a human being pushing the turnstile in direction clockwise? If yes, I will open,
10090720	10095040	let them go. If it's anti-clockwise, no. So yeah, so a state machine has some labels
10095040	10102720	and a transition diagram. So you're looking to come up with a chemical computer to form state
10102720	10110480	machines to create molecules, or what's the chicken and the egg? So a computation is not
10110480	10114320	a chemical computer, because we talked a few moments about actually doing computations with
10114320	10119600	chemicals. What I'm now saying is I want to use state machines to transform chemicals.
10120560	10125840	So build chemicals programmatically? Yeah. I mean, I get in trouble saying this. I said to my
10125840	10130560	group, I shouldn't say it, because I said, look, we should make the crack bot in the crack robot.
10134400	10137920	Crack bot. The robot that makes crack, but maybe we should scrub this from...
10141840	10146000	So maybe you can educate me on breaking bad with math, right?
10146000	10153280	Yeah. So in breaking bad... So you want to make basically some kind of mix of ex machina
10153280	10157520	and breaking bad? No, I don't. For the record, I don't. But I said...
10157520	10161200	You don't. I said, that's what I'm going to do once you release the papers.
10163680	10169600	I shave my head, and I'm going to live a life of crime anyway. I'm sorry.
10169600	10174560	No, no. So yeah, let's get back to... So indeed, it is about making drugs, but
10174560	10179760	importantly, making important drugs. All drugs matter.
10179760	10186640	Yeah. But let's go back. So the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog. There is no state
10186640	10194880	machine. And I wandered through the paper walls in the Japanese house a few years ago and said,
10194880	10199440	okay, hey, organic chemist, why are you doing this analog? And they said, well, chemistry is
10199440	10205120	really hard. You can't automate it. It's impossible. I said, but is it impossible?
10205120	10208480	I said, yeah. And they said, I got the impression they were saying it's magic.
10209360	10214240	And so when people tell me things are magic, it's like, no, no, they can't be magic, right?
10214240	10220800	So let's break this down. And so what I did is I went to my group one day about eight years ago
10220800	10225920	and said, hey, guys, I've written this new programming language for you. And so everything is
10225920	10230000	clear. And you have to, you're not allowed to just wander around the lab willy-nilly,
10230000	10233280	you have to pick up things in order, go to the balance at the right time,
10233280	10236880	and all this stuff. And they looked at me as if I was insane and basically kicked me out of the
10236880	10240880	lab and said, no, don't do that. We're not doing that. And I said, okay, so I went back the next
10240880	10246640	day and said, I'm going to find some money so we can make cool robots do chemical reactions.
10246640	10250240	And everyone went, that's cool. And so in that process,
10251200	10255680	the first to try to convert the humans to become robots. And next you
10255680	10259840	agree, you might as well just create the robots. Yes. But so in that, in that, the formalization
10259840	10263760	process. Yeah. So what I did is said, look, a chemical, to make a molecule, you need to do
10263760	10268000	four things abstractly. I want to make a chemical Turing machine. Because a Turing machine,
10268000	10271360	you think about this, imagine a Turing machine. Turing machine is the ultimate
10272400	10278560	abstraction of a computation. Because it's been shown by Turing and others that basically
10278560	10283280	a universal Turing machine should be able to do all computations that you can imagine. It's like,
10283280	10287760	wow, why don't I think of a Turing machine for chemistry? Let's think of a magic robot
10287760	10292800	that can make any molecule. Let's think about that for a second. Okay, great. How do we then
10292800	10297680	implement it? And I think it's right. So what is the abstraction? So to make any molecule,
10297680	10302080	you have to do a reaction. So you have to put reagents together, do a reaction in a flask,
10302800	10306400	typically, then you're after the reaction, you have to stop the reactions, you do what's called
10306560	10312160	a workup. So whatever, call it down, add some liquid to it, extract. So then after you do a
10312160	10316160	workup, you separate. So you then remove the molecules, separate them all out. And then
10316160	10322560	the final step is purification. So reaction, workup, separate purify. So this is basically
10322560	10328160	like my exactly like a Turing machine where you have your tape, you have your tape head,
10328160	10332720	you have some rules, then you run it. So I thought, cool. I went to all the chemists and said,
10332720	10339360	look, chemistry isn't that hard. Reaction, workup, separation, purification, do that in cycles,
10339360	10346000	forever, for any molecule, all the chemistry done. And they said, chemistry is that hard.
10346000	10350800	I said, but just in principle, and I got a few very enlightened people to say, yeah, okay,
10350800	10358400	in principle, but it ain't going to work. And this was in about 2013, 2014. And I found myself going
10358400	10362640	to an architecture conference almost by accident. It's like, why am I at this random conference
10362640	10368080	on architecture? And that was because I published a paper on inorganic architecture. And they said,
10368080	10372640	come to architecture conference, but the inorganic architecture is not nano architecture. And I went,
10372640	10377520	okay, and then I found these guys at the conference, 3d printing ping pong balls and shapes. And this
10377520	10381520	is 3d printing was cool. And it's like, this is ridiculous. Why are you 3d printing ping pong
10381520	10385200	balls? And I gave them a whole load of abuse, like I normally do when I first meet people,
10385200	10389600	how to win friends and influence people. And then I was like, Oh, my God, you guys are geniuses.
10390160	10393280	And so I got a got from they were a bit confused because I was calling them idiots and then call
10393280	10398080	them geniuses. It's like, will you come to my lab? And we're going to build a robot to do chemistry
10398080	10402160	with a 3d printer. And they said, Oh, that's cool. All right. So I had them come to the lab,
10402160	10407280	and we started to 3d print test tube. So you imagine, you know, 3d printer bottle, and then
10407280	10413280	and then in the and then use the same gantry to basically rather than to square out a plastic
10413280	10417520	out of a nozzle, have a little syringe and jump chemicals in. So we had the 3d printer because
10417520	10422400	simultaneously print the test tube and then put chemicals into the test tube. And then
10422400	10426960	was this really end to end? Yeah, I was like, that'll be because they've got gco to do it all.
10426960	10432000	I was like, that's cool. So I got my group doing this and I developed a bit and I realized that we
10432000	10437840	could take those unit operations. And we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves. And I realized
10437840	10442560	that I could basically take the literature. And I made the first version of the computer
10443200	10449280	in 2016, 17, I made some architectural decisions. So I designed the pumps and valves in my group,
10449280	10454880	I did all the electronics in my group, they were brilliant. I cannot pay tribute to my group enough
10454880	10458640	in doing this. They were just brilliant. And there were some poor souls there that said, Lee,
10459200	10463520	why are you making this design electronics? I'm like, well, because I don't understand it.
10464160	10466800	And they're like, so you're making his design stuff because you don't understand? I was like,
10466800	10471440	yeah, it's like, but can we not just buy some? I said, well, we can, but then I don't understand
10471440	10476240	how to, you know, what bus they're going to use and there's serial ports and all this stuff. I just
10476240	10481280	wanted, and I made, I came up with the decision to design a bunch of pumps and valves and use
10481280	10486720	power of the ethernet. So I got one cable for power and data, plug them all in, plug them all
10486800	10493040	into a router. And, and then I made the state machine. And there was a couple of cool things I
10493040	10501360	did. Oh, they did actually. We got the abstraction. So reaction, work, work up separation, purification.
10502480	10509680	And then I made the decision to do it in batch. Now it's in batch. All chemistry had been digitized
10509680	10514480	before apparently it was it's been done. But everyone been doing it in flow. And flow is
10514480	10519600	continuous. And there are infinities everywhere. And you have to just, and I realized that I could
10519600	10525760	actually make a state machine where I basically put stuff in the reactor, turn it from one state to
10525760	10531200	another state, stop it and just read it out. And okay, and I was kind of bitching it's electrical
10531200	10533840	engineer saying you have it easy, you don't have to clean out the electrons, you know,
10534720	10539200	electrons don't leave a big mess, they leave some EM waste. But in my state machine, I built in
10539200	10543200	cleaning. So it's like, we do all operation, then it cleans the backbone, then can do it again.
10543280	10549120	That's fascinating. So what we managed to do over a couple of years is, is develop the hardware,
10549120	10553520	develop the state machine. And we encoded three molecules, we did three, the first three, we did
10553520	10558960	nitole, sleeping drug, refinimide, anti-seizure and Viagra. You know, and I would like to make jokes
10558960	10564560	on the paper, it's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's very good. And then and then
10564560	10570560	in the next one, what we did said, okay, my poor organic chemist said, look, Lee, we've worked with
10570560	10576720	you this long, we've made a robot that looks like it's going to take our jobs away. And, and not
10576720	10580640	just take our jobs away that what we love in the lab, but now we have to become programmers,
10580640	10584000	but we're not even good programmers, we just have to spend ages writing lines of code
10584880	10591040	that are boring, and it's not as elegant. I went, you're right. So then, but I knew because I had
10591040	10596400	this abstraction, and I knew that there was language, I could suddenly develop a state machine
10596400	10602000	that would interpret the language, which was lossy and ambiguous, and populate my abstraction.
10602000	10606880	So I built a chemical programming language that is, is actually going to be recursively innumerable,
10606880	10609600	it's going to be a true and complete language, actually, which is kind of cool, which means
10609600	10615680	it's for me very viable. So where we are now is we can now read the literature using a bit of
10615680	10619360	natural language processing, it's not the best, the many other groups have done better job,
10619360	10624960	but we can use that language reading to populate the state machine, and basically add
10624960	10631280	subtract, there's, we got about a number of primitives that we, the, you know,
10631280	10635680	basically program loops that we dovetail together, and we can make any molecule with it.
10635680	10639760	Okay, so that's, that's a kind of program synthesis. So you start at like, literally,
10639760	10644320	you're talking about like a paper, like a scientific paper, that's being read,
10645280	10653360	yeah, natural language processing, extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions, and
10654320	10662000	the chemical molecules and compounds involved. And then that's, that in GPT
10663120	10669200	terms, serves as a prompt for the program synthesis, that's kind of trivial right now,
10669200	10673680	there you have a bunch of different like for loops and so on, that creates a program in this
10674400	10681360	chemical language, that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer, the computer,
10681680	10687120	yeah, computer, that works. Yeah, everything sounds better in your
10687120	10691760	British accent, but I love it. So the, into the computer, and that's able to then
10693280	10698560	basically be a 3D printer for these for molecules. Yeah, I wouldn't call it a 3D printer, I would
10698560	10702560	call it a universal chemical reaction system, because 3D printing gives the wrong impression,
10702560	10708000	but yeah, and, and it purifies. And the nice thing is that that code now that we call it
10708320	10716160	the KIDL code is, is really interesting, because now, so computation, what is computation?
10716160	10723520	Computation is what computing is to mathematics, I think. Computation is the process of taking
10723520	10728640	chemical code, and some input reagents, and making the same molecule, making the molecule
10729600	10734800	reproducibly every time without fail. What is computation? It's the process of taking a,
10734800	10740880	using a program to take some input conditions and give you an output, same every time, right,
10740880	10746400	reliably. So the, the problem is, now maybe you can push back and correct me on this.
10747360	10754080	So I know biology is messy. My question is how messy is chemistry? So the, if we use the analogy
10754080	10762960	of a computer, it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise, that it's repeatable,
10763760	10769360	it makes errors almost never. If it does the exact same way over and over and over and over.
10769360	10773760	What about chemistry? Is there messiness in the whole thing? It, can that be somehow leveraged?
10773760	10778160	Can that be controlled? Can that be that removed? Do we want to remove it from the system?
10778160	10784720	Oh, yes and no, right. This, is there messiness? There, there is messiness, because chemistry is
10784720	10789520	like you're, you're, you're doing reactions on, on billions of molecules, and they don't
10789520	10794400	always work, but you've got purification there. And so what we've found is at the beginning,
10794400	10798880	everyone said it can't work. It's going to be too messy. It will just fail. And I said, but
10798880	10802000	you managed to get chemistry to work in the lab. Are you magic? Are you doing something?
10802560	10806560	So I would say, now go back to the first ever computer or the ENIAC,
10807520	10814080	five million soldered joints, 400,000 valves exploding all the time. Was that, would you have
10814080	10820320	gone, okay, that's messy. So we've got the, and have we got the equivalent of the ENIAC in my lab?
10820960	10826080	We've got 15 computers in the lab now and they, are they unreliable? Yeah, they fall apart here
10826080	10832160	in there, but are they getting better really quickly? Yeah. Are they now able to reliably make,
10832160	10836320	are we at the point in the lab where there are some molecules we would rather make on the computer
10837280	10840400	than have a human being make? Yeah, we've just done, we've just made a
10840720	10848720	anti-influenza molecule and some antivirals, six steps on the computer that would take a human
10848720	10856080	being about one week to make arbidol of continuous labor. And all they do now is load up the reagents,
10856080	10861120	press go button and just go away and drink coffee. Wow. So this, I mean, and this is,
10861840	10866400	you're saying this computer is just the early days. And so like some of the criticism just
10866400	10870320	have to do with the early days. And yes, I would say there's something like this is
10872080	10878800	quite impossible. So the fact that you're doing this is incredible. Not impossible,
10878800	10884320	of course, but extremely difficult. It did seem really difficult. And I do keep pinching myself
10884320	10888640	when I go in the lab. I was like, is it working? Like, yep. And it's not, you know, it does clog.
10889200	10895280	It does stop. You got to clean. This is great. You know, but it's getting more reliable because
10895280	10900480	I made some, we just made design decisions and said, we are not going to abandon the abstraction.
10900480	10906800	Think about it. If the Von Neumann implementation was abandoned, I mean, think about what we do
10906800	10913840	to semiconductors to really constrain them to what we do to silicon in a fab lab. We take
10913840	10918880	computation for granted, silicon is not in its natural state. We are doping the hell out of it.
10918880	10923600	It's incredible what they're able to accomplish and achieve that reliability at the scale they do.
10923600	10929920	Like you said, that's after Moore's law what we have now. And where we, you know,
10931360	10935360	how it started, you know, we started at the bottom, now we're here.
10935360	10939440	We have only have 20 million molecules, well, say 20 million molecules in one database,
10939440	10944640	maybe a few hundred million in all the pharmaceutical companies. And those few hundred
10944640	10949520	million molecules are responsible for all the drugs that we've had in humanity except, you know,
10949520	10954320	biologics for the last 50 years. Now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print,
10955360	10958640	goes out of prints because there's only a finite number of manufacturing facilities in the world
10958640	10964320	that make these drugs. Is that a print? Yeah. It's the printing press for chemistry. Yeah.
10965040	10969840	And not only that, we can protect the KIDL so we can stop bad actors doing it. We can encrypt them.
10970480	10974480	And we can give people life. Yeah, that's the name of the programing language.
10974480	10978480	The KIDL is the name of the programming language and the code we give the chemicals.
10978480	10984560	So Kai, as in, you know, just for, it's like a, it's actually like an XML format. But
10984560	10990640	I've now taken it from script to a, to a fully expressible programming language so we can do
10990640	10994720	dynamics and there's four loops in there and conditional statements. Right. But the structure
10994720	11001280	it started out as a, like a, like an XML thing. Yeah. Yeah. And now we also, the chemist doesn't
11001280	11006160	need to program in KIDL. They can just go to the software and type in add A to B reflux,
11006160	11009280	do what they would normally do. And he just converts it to KIDL and they have a linter to
11009280	11015600	check it. An error correct. So how do you, you know, not with ASCII, but because it's a Greek
11015600	11021760	letter, how do you go with, how do you spell it? Just using the, the English alphabet.
11022960	11028160	XDL? XDL, or we use, we put in Kai. And it was named by one of my students. And I,
11028160	11031280	one of my postdocs many years ago, and I quite liked it. It's like,
11032240	11035520	it's important, I think, when the team are contributing to such big ideas,
11035520	11041040	because there are ideas as well. I try not to just rename, I didn't call it Cronin or anything
11041040	11047360	that, because they keep saying, you know, is a, is it the chemistry when they're putting stuff in
11047360	11050800	the computer? One of my students said, we are asking now, is it Cronin complete? And I was like,
11050800	11055760	what does that mean? And I said, well, can we make it on the damn machine? And I was like,
11055760	11060480	oh, is that a compliment or a, or a majority? But they're like, well, it might be both.
11060560	11067360	Yeah. So you tweeted, quote, why does chemistry need a universal programming language?
11067360	11074480	Question mark. For all the reasons you can think of, reliability, interoperability,
11074480	11080640	collaboration, remove ambiguity, lower cost, increased safety, open up discovery,
11080640	11086000	molecular customization, and publication of executable chemical code.
11086160	11094640	Which is fascinating, by the way, just publish code. And can you maybe elaborate a little bit
11094640	11101440	more about this KDL? What does the universal language of chemistry look like? A Cronin complete
11102640	11103440	language?
11103440	11109440	Well, it's a Turing complete language, really. But so what it has, it has a series of operators
11109600	11118240	in it, like add, heat, stir. So there's a bunch of just unit operations. And all it is, really,
11118240	11124000	is just, it's, with chemical engineers, when I talked about this, that you've just rediscovered
11124000	11129840	chemical engineering. And I said, well, yeah, I know. I said, well, that's trivial. I said, well,
11129840	11134880	not really. Well, yes, it is trivial. And that's why it's good. Because not only have we rediscovered
11134880	11138560	chemical engineering, we've made it implementable on the universal hardware that doesn't cost
11139360	11146800	very much money. And so the KDL has a series of statements like define the reactor. So defines
11147760	11154960	the reagents. So they're all labels. So you assign them. And what I also implemented at the beginning
11154960	11160800	is because I give all the hardware IP address, you put it on a graph. And so what it does is
11160800	11167200	like the graph is equivalent to the process of firmware, the processor code. So when you take
11167200	11172000	your KDL, and you go to run it on your computer, you can run it on any compatible hardware and
11172000	11176000	any configuration says, what's your, what's your graph look like? As long as I can solve the problem
11176000	11180320	on the graph with these unit operations, you have the resources available, it can compile,
11180320	11188560	chem piles. We can carry on for years. I mean, it is really, it's a compilation.
11189760	11196000	And what it now does is it says, okay, the problem we have before is it was possible to
11196080	11200400	do robotics for chemistry, but the robots were really expensive. They were unique.
11200400	11205920	They were vendor locked. And what I want to do is to make sure that every chemist in the world
11205920	11211120	can get access to machinery like this at virtually no cost, because it makes it safer.
11211680	11216160	It makes it more reliable. And then if you go to the literature and you find a molecule that
11216160	11220320	could potentially cure cancer. And let's say the molecule that could potentially cure cancer
11220320	11226400	takes you three years to repeat. And maybe a student finishes their PhD in the time,
11226400	11233360	and they never get it back. So it's really hard to, to kind of get all the way to that molecule,
11233360	11237680	and it limits the ability of humanity to build on it. If they just download the code and can
11237680	11244400	execute it, it turns, I would say the electronic laboratory notebook in chemistry is a data
11244400	11250160	cemetery, because no one will ever reproduce it. But now the data cemetery is a Jupyter
11250160	11254560	notebook, and you can just execute it and people can play with it. The access to it
11254560	11261440	reverses the magnitude is increased. We'll talk about the, so as with all technologies,
11261440	11264880	I think there's way more exciting possibilities, but they're also terrifying
11264880	11270160	possibilities. And we'll talk about all of them. But let me just kind of linger on the
11270160	11273600	machine learning side of this. So you're describing programming, but
11275360	11279280	it's a language. I don't know if you've heard about Open AI Codex, which is-
11279280	11280400	Yeah, I'm playing with it.
11280400	11282240	Hey, playing. Of course you are.
11286000	11288880	You really are Rick from Rick and Morty. This is great. Okay.
11290800	11294240	Except philosophically deep. I mean, he is, I guess, kind of philosophically deep too.
11294960	11301520	So for people who don't know GPT, GPT-3, it's a language model that can do natural language
11301520	11307040	generation. So you can give it a prompt and it can complete the rest of it. But it turns out
11307040	11311680	that that kind of prompt, it's not just completes the rest of it, it's generating
11314560	11319520	like novel sounding text. And then you can apply that to generation of other kinds of stuff.
11320480	11325920	So these kinds of transformer based language models are really good at forming
11327840	11335120	deep representations of a particular space, like a medium, like language. So you can then apply
11335120	11341680	the specific subset of language like programming. So you can have it learn the representation of
11341680	11347840	the Python programming language and use it to then generate syntactically and semantically correct
11349520	11354720	programs. So you can start to make progress on one of the hardest problems in computer science,
11354720	11359040	which is program synthesis. How do you write programs that accomplish different tasks?
11359600	11368640	So what OpenAI Codex does is it generates those programs based on a prompt of some kind.
11368640	11373120	Usually you can do a natural language prompt. So basically as you do when you program, you write
11373120	11380000	some comment, which serves the basic documentation of the inputs and the outputs and the function
11380000	11384960	of the particular set of code and it's able to generate that. The point being is you can generate
11384960	11394720	programs using machine learning using neural networks. Those programs operate on the boring old
11395600	11401600	computer. Can you generate programs that operate this guy be a clever version of programs for this
11401600	11408160	but can you write programs that operate on a computer? Yep. There's actually software out
11408160	11416240	there right now. We can go and do it. It's a heuristic. It's rule based. But we have what we've done
11416960	11424160	inspired by Codex actually is over the summer, I ran a little workshop. Some of my groups got
11424160	11430560	this inspired idea that we should get a load of students and ask them to manually collect data,
11430560	11440400	to label chemical procedures into QIDL. And we have a cool synth reader. So there's a bunch of
11440400	11446880	people doing this right now, but they're doing it without abstraction. And because we have an
11446880	11453520	abstraction that's implementable in the hardware, we've developed basically a chemical analog of
11453520	11460400	Codex. We say abstraction in the hardware. What do you mean? So right now,
11460400	11464880	a lot of people doing machine learning and reading chemistry and just saying, oh,
11464880	11470160	you've got all these operations, ad shake, whatever he, but because they don't have a uniform,
11471040	11475040	I mean, there's a couple of groups doing it, competitors actually, they're good, very good.
11475600	11487360	But they can't run that code automatically. They are losing meaning. And the really important
11487360	11492720	thing that you have to do is generate context. And so what we've learned to do with our abstraction
11492720	11500400	is make sure we can pull the context out of the text. And so can we take a chemical procedure
11500400	11505360	and read it and generate our executable code? Yes. What's the hardest part about that whole
11505360	11510480	pipeline from the initial text interpreting the initial text of a paper, extracting the
11510480	11516720	meaningful context and meaningful chemical information to then generating the program,
11516720	11522640	to then running that program in the hardware? What's the hardest part about that pipeline as we
11522640	11531280	look towards a universal Turing computer? So the hardest thing with the pipeline is that
11532480	11538640	the software, the model gets confused between some meanings, right? So if
11539760	11545200	chemists are very good at inventing words that aren't broken down, so I would, the classic word
11545200	11551040	that you would use for boiling something is called reflux. So reflux is you'd have a solvent in
11551040	11555920	the round bomb flask at reflux, it would be boiling, going up the reflux condenser and coming down.
11555920	11564240	But that term reflux to reflux could be changed, you know, to people often make up words, new words,
11564240	11570080	and then the software can fall over. But what we've been able to do is a bit like in Python,
11570800	11576240	or any programming language, is identify when things aren't matched. So you present the code,
11576240	11579920	and you say this isn't matched, you may want to think about this, and then the user goes and says,
11579920	11585440	oh, I mean reflux and just ticks a box and collects it. So what the codex or the chemx
11586800	11593520	does in this case, is it just, it suggests the first go, and then the chemist goes and
11593600	11599600	corrects it. And I really want the chemist to correct it, because it's not safe, I believe,
11599600	11604960	for to allow AI to just read literature and generate code at this stage.
11604960	11615600	Because now you're having actual, by the way, chemx, nice, nice name. So you are unlike,
11616400	11622800	which is fascinating. We live in a fascinating moment in human history. But yes,
11622800	11632800	you're literally connecting AI to some physical, and like, it's building something in the physical
11632800	11642080	realm, especially in the space of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly.
11642080	11647520	Yeah. Yeah, I would say that's right. And it's really important to understand those
11647520	11652560	labeling schemes, right? And one of the things I was never, I was always worried about the beginning
11652640	11658080	that the abstraction was going to fall over. And the way we did it was just by brute force to start
11658080	11661040	with, we just kept reading the literature and saying, is there anything new? Can we add a new
11661040	11667280	rule in? And actually, our QIDL language expand exploded. There were so many extra things we
11667280	11671520	had to keep adding. And then I realized the primitives still were maintained, I could break
11671520	11676720	them down again. So we get, it's pretty good. I mean, there are problems, there are problems of,
11676720	11680560	you know, interpreting any big sentence and turning it into an actionable code.
11680560	11684080	And the codex is not without its problems. You can, you can crash it quite easily, right? You
11684080	11691040	can generate nonsense. But boy, it's interesting. I would love to learn to program now using codex,
11692240	11696000	right? Just hacking around, right? And I wonder if chemistry in the future will learn to
11697120	11702640	do chemistry by just hacking around with the system, writing in different things. Because
11702640	11705840	the key thing that we're doing with the chemistry is that where a lot of
11705840	11711520	mathematical chemistry went wrong is people, and I think Wolfram does this in Mathematica,
11711520	11717440	he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom A or molecule A reacts with molecule B to
11717440	11723120	give molecule C. That's not what chemistry is. Chemistry is take, take some molecule,
11723120	11731040	take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it and then extract it. So the programming language
11731040	11737040	is actually with respect to the process operations. And if you flick in process space,
11737760	11743120	not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything. Because there's only a finite number of processes
11743120	11749040	you need to do in chemistry. And that, and that's reassuring. And so, so we're in the middle of it,
11749040	11754400	it's really exciting. It's not, you know, the be all in the end all, and there is like I say,
11754400	11758560	errors that can creep in. One day, we might be able to do it without human interaction,
11758560	11764160	you simulate it, and you'll know enough about the simulation that will, you know, the lab won't
11764160	11768880	catch fire. But there are so many safety issues right now that we've got to really be very careful,
11768880	11773200	you know, protecting the user, protecting the environment, protecting misuse. I mean,
11773200	11777520	there's lots to discuss, if you want to go down that route, because it's very, very interesting.
11777520	11785360	You don't want novachocks being made, or explosives being made, or recreational drugs
11785360	11791040	being made. But how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug that's going to be
11791040	11797360	important for them looking at their, you know, particular assay on a bad actor trying to make
11797360	11801920	methamphetamine? I saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor, but that's exactly what I'm
11801920	11806560	going to do. I'm trying to get the details of this so I can be first. Don't worry, we can protect you
11806560	11817280	from yourself. Okay. I'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope. Does this ultimately
11817280	11826000	excite you about the future? Or does it terrify you? So let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental.
11827040	11834000	It seems like you're at the cutting edge of progress that will have to happen,
11834000	11841680	that will happen, that there's no stopping it. And I, as we've been talking about, I see obviously
11841680	11849200	a huge number of exciting possibilities. So whenever you automate these kinds of things,
11849200	11855920	just the world opens up. It's like programming itself, and the computer, regular computer,
11855920	11863440	has created innumerable applications and made the world better in so many dimensions,
11863440	11868160	and it created, of course, a lot of negative things that we, for some reason, like the focus on,
11868960	11875280	using that very technology to tweet about it. But I think it made a much better world,
11875280	11883280	but it created a lot of new dangers. So maybe you can speak to when you have, when you kind of
11884000	11892720	stand at the end of the road for building a really solid, reliable universal computer,
11894400	11898160	what are the possibilities that are positive? What are the possibilities that are negative?
11898160	11902960	How can we minimize the chance of the negative? Yeah, that's a really good question. So there's
11902960	11910160	so many positive things from drug discovery, from supply chain stress, for basically enabling
11910160	11913920	chemists to basically build more productive in the lab, right? Where the computer's not
11913920	11917440	going to replace the chemist. There's going to be a Moore's law of molecules, right? There's
11917440	11921440	going to be so many more molecules we can design, so many more diseases we can cure.
11921440	11925520	So chemists in the lab, as researchers, that's better for science, so they can
11925520	11930640	build a bunch of, like they could do science at a much more accelerated pace. So it's not
11930640	11934800	just the development of drugs, it's actually like doing the basic understanding of the science of
11934800	11939280	drugs. And the personalization, the cost of drugs right now, we're all living longer, we're all
11939280	11944880	having more and more, we know more about our genomic development, we know about our predetermination,
11944880	11951360	and we might be able to, one dream I've got is like, imagine, you can work at your genome
11951360	11956240	assistant tells you you're going to get cancer in seven years time, and you have your personal
11956240	11961440	computer that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it, right? That's a really positive
11961440	11967760	idea. The other thing is, is when drugs, so right now, I think it is absolutely outrageous
11968560	11975280	that not all of humanity has access to medicine. And I think the computer might be able to change
11975280	11979680	that fundamentally because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured. So let's stop thinking
11979760	11986400	about manufacturing in different factories. Let's say that clinical grade computers or drug grade
11986400	11992560	computers will be in facilities all around the world, and they can make things on demand
11992560	11997120	as a function of the cost. Maybe people won't be able to afford the latest and greatest patent,
11997120	12001920	but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing and will basically democratize,
12002800	12007680	make available drugs to everybody that they need. And there's lots of
12008640	12014080	of really interesting things there. So I think that's going to happen. I think that now let's take
12015360	12020720	the negative. Before we do that, let's imagine what happened to go back to a really tragic
12020720	12026400	accident a few years ago, well, not an accident, an act of murder by that pilot on the, I think it was
12026400	12032560	Euro wings or Swiss wings off. But what he did is the plane took off. He waited till his pilot
12032560	12039520	went to the toilet. He was a co-pilot. He locked the door and then set the autopilot above the
12039520	12046480	Alps. He set the altimeter or the descend height to zero. So the computer just took the plane into
12046480	12053520	the Alps. Now, I mean, that was such a tragedy that obviously the guy was mentally ill, but it
12053520	12058400	wasn't just a tragedy for him. It was for all the people on board. But what if, and I was inspired
12058480	12065280	by this, and I thinking, what can I do to do, to anticipate problems like this in the computer,
12065280	12071200	had the software, and I'm sure Boeing and Airbus will be thinking, oh, maybe I can give the computer
12071200	12075680	a bit more situational awareness. So whenever one, some tries to drop the height of the plane,
12075680	12079280	and it knows above the Alps will just say, oh, no, computer says, no, we're not letting you do that.
12080480	12083920	Of course, he would have been able to find another way, maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or
12083920	12089520	something. But keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories that can go negative,
12089520	12096640	all those kinds of running into the Alps, and try to at least make it easy for the engineers
12096640	12101120	to build systems that are protecting us that. Yeah. And let's just think, so what are in the
12101120	12105040	computer world right now with KIDLs? Let's just not think about what I'm doing right now. What
12105040	12108800	I'm doing right now is it's completely open, right? Everyone's going to know KIDLs and be playing with
12108800	12112960	them, making them more easier and easier and easier. But what we're going to start to do,
12112960	12120800	it makes sense to encrypt the KIDLs in such a way you're, let's say you work for a pharmaceutical
12120800	12125120	company, and you have a license to make given molecule, where you get issued with a license
12125120	12128960	by the FDA or your local authority, and they'll say, right, your license to do it,
12128960	12134560	here it is, it's encrypted, and the KIDL gets run. So you have a license for that instance of use.
12134560	12139360	Easy to do. Computer science has already solved the problem. So the fact that we all trust online
12139360	12145840	banking, right, the right now, then we can secure it. I'm 100% sure we can secure the computer.
12146880	12152560	Because of the way we have a many, you know, it's like the same mapping problem that you,
12152560	12157120	to actually reverse engineer a KIDL will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key.
12158320	12164320	You know, brute force, it will be cheaper to just actually buy the regulated medicine.
12164320	12169280	And actually, people aren't going to want to then make their own fake pharmaceuticals,
12169280	12174720	because it'll be so cheap to do it. We'll drop the cost of access to drugs. Now what will happen?
12174720	12178880	Recreational drugs. People start saying, well, I want access to recreational drugs.
12179600	12184400	Well, it's going to be up to, it's going to accelerate that social discussion that's happening
12184400	12190240	in the US and Canada and in the UK, everywhere, right? Because cost goes down, access goes up.
12190240	12194720	Giving cannabis, THC, to some people who've got epilepsy isn't literally
12194720	12198960	forgive the term and no brainer, because these poor people go from seizures like
12198960	12201520	every day to maybe seizures just once every few months.
12202800	12206720	That's an interesting idea that tried to minimize the chance that it can get into
12206720	12212000	like the hands of individuals, like terrorists or people that want to do harm.
12213040	12217520	Now, with that kind of thing, you're putting a lot of power in the hands of
12218480	12224160	governments, in the hands of institutions. And so then emerge the kind of natural criticism you
12224160	12230080	might have of governments that can sometimes use these for ill, use them as weapons of war,
12230080	12239520	not weapons, not tools of betterment. So, and sometimes not just war against other nations,
12239520	12243200	but war against its own people, as has been done throughout history.
12244160	12248560	Well, I'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it, a decentralized peer-to-peer version
12249200	12252880	where, and what you have to do, I'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain,
12252880	12256800	but there is a way of maybe taking KydLs and put them in blockchain. Here's an idea,
12256800	12261920	let's just say, the way we do it in my lab right now is we go to the literature, we take a recipe
12261920	12267920	to make a molecule, convert that to KydL and diligently make it in the robot and validate it.
12268880	12273280	So, I would call mining, proof of work, proof of synthesis, right?
12273280	12274880	Proof of synthesis.
12274880	12278800	Yeah, yeah, but this is cool because suddenly, when you actually synthesize it,
12278800	12282160	you can get the analytical data, but there's also a fingerprint in there of the impurities
12282160	12287280	that get carried across, because you can never make something 100% pure. That fingerprint will
12287280	12291840	allow you to secure your KydL. So, what you do is encrypt those two things. So, suddenly,
12291840	12297760	you can have people out there mining, and what you could do perhaps is do the type of thing,
12298000	12303040	we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing should have been done in COVID,
12303040	12308000	where people are given the information. So, you have just been in contact with someone COVID,
12308000	12313440	you choose, I'm not telling you to stay at home, you choose, right? So, now, if we could imagine
12313440	12318480	a similar thing, like you have got access to these chemicals, they will have these effects,
12318480	12324240	you choose and publicize it, or maybe it's out somewhere, I don't know, I'm not a policy maker
12324320	12330640	on this. And my job here is to not just make the technology possible, but to have it as open as
12330640	12335760	a discussion as possible with people to say, hey, can we stop childhood mortality with this
12335760	12342320	technology? And do those benefits outweigh the one-off where people might use it for terrorism,
12342320	12347360	or people might use it for recreational drugs? Chemify, which is the name of the entity that
12347360	12352240	will make this happen, I think we have some social responsibilities as an entity to make sure that
12352240	12357440	we're not enabling people to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will. And what we have to do
12357440	12362160	is have a discussion with society, with the people that invest in this, with people that are going
12362160	12366720	to pay for this, to say, well, do you want to live longer? And do you want to be healthier?
12367440	12371680	And are you willing to accept some of the risks? And I think that's a discussion to have.
12371680	12377120	So, by the way, when you say personal drugs, do you mean the illegal ones? Or do you have a concern
12377120	12385840	of just putting the manufacture of any kind of legal drugs in the hands of regular people,
12385840	12389760	because they might, like dose matters, they might take way too much?
12389760	12396160	I mean, I would say, to be honest, the chances of computers being, well, should always never. So,
12396160	12398800	the fact I can now say this means it's totally going to come true, right?
12398800	12400800	Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to do it.
12400800	12405200	I cannot imagine that computers will be in people's houses anytime soon,
12405280	12411120	but they might be at the local pharmacy, right? And if you've got a drug manufacturing facility
12411120	12415440	in every town, then you just go and they give you a prescription and they do it in such a way,
12415440	12421120	they format it so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day. You get one manufactured
12421120	12424880	for you that has all the materials you need in the right distribution.
12424880	12429840	Got it. But you mentioned recreation drugs and the reason I mentioned it, because I know people
12429840	12436080	are going to speak up on this. If the drug is legal, there's, to me, no reason why you can't
12436080	12439280	manufacture, I mean, for recreation. I mean, you can do it right now.
12439280	12441040	What do you have against fun, Lee?
12444560	12449360	So, I mean, I'm a chemistry professor in a university who's an entrepreneur as well.
12449360	12452800	I just think I need to be as responsible as I can in the discussion.
12454160	12458640	Not sure, sure. But I know, so let me be the one that says there's nothing,
12458640	12463760	because you have said recreational drugs and like terrorism in the same sentence.
12463760	12464960	Yeah, yeah. Okay.
12464960	12471680	I think let's make sure we draw a line that there's real dangers to the world of terrorist,
12471680	12475200	of biowarfare, and then there's a little bit of weed.
12475840	12482880	So, I have, I mean, I think it's up to the society to tell his governments what it wants,
12482880	12489680	what's acceptable, right? And if it becomes, let's say that THC's become, you know, heavily
12490400	12495520	acceptable, and that you can modify them. So, let's say there's, let's say it's like blood type,
12495520	12501040	there's a particular type of THC that you tolerate better than I do, then why not,
12501040	12503040	why not have a machine that makes the one you like?
12503040	12503440	Yeah.
12503440	12504320	And then, and why not-
12504320	12505680	It's the perfect brownie.
12506880	12512240	And I think that that's fine. But I'm, you know, we're so far away from that.
12512240	12516160	I can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right? And I mean, it's reliability and all this
12516160	12520320	other stuff. But what I think is going to happen in the short term, it's going to turbo charge
12521440	12525360	molecular discovery, reliability, and that will change the world.
12525360	12529200	That's super exciting. You have a draft of a paper titled,
12529200	12532880	autonomous intelligent exploration, discovery and optimization of nanomaterials.
12533760	12537920	So, we are talking about automating engineering of nanomaterials.
12538800	12544080	How hard is this problem? And as we continue down this thread of the positives
12544800	12548880	and the worrisome, what are the things we should be excited about?
12549600	12554080	And what are the things we should be terrified about? And how do we minimize the chance of the
12556000	12557200	terrifying consequences?
12558000	12562640	So, in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting. So, the robot basically
12563280	12569200	is an embodied AI. I really, I really like AI in a domain specific way.
12569760	12575440	One of the, as you should say at this point, there was an attempt in the 60s, Joshua Leidenberg
12575440	12581280	and some really important people did this that made an AI to try and guess if organic molecules
12581280	12586320	in the mass spectrometer were alien or not. Yes. And they failed because they didn't have assembly
12586320	12593440	theory. Wait, what does assembly theory give you about alien versus human life?
12593440	12597440	Well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown, the degree of unknowns. You can fingerprint stuff.
12597440	12601360	They weren't looking at, they were trying to basically just look at the corpus of
12602080	12607040	complex organic molecules. So, when I was a bit down about assembly theory, because I couldn't
12607040	12613360	convince referees and couldn't convince computational people interested in computational
12613360	12619120	complexity, I was really quite depressed about it. And I mean, I've been working with Sarah Walker's
12619120	12623840	team and I think she, you know, I think she also invented assembly theory in some way. We can talk
12623840	12632320	about it later. When I found the AI not working for the Dendral project, I suddenly realized I
12632320	12639920	wasn't totally insane. Coming back to this nano robot, so what it does is basically like a computer,
12639920	12646000	but now what it does is it squirts a liquid with gold in it in a test tube, and it adds
12647280	12653120	some reducing agents, there's some electrons to make the gold turn into a nanoparticle.
12653120	12657120	Now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle, it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon. So it's a bit
12657120	12662240	like if you look at the sheen on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something. Those are the ways
12662240	12668480	of conducting electrons basically reflect light. What we did is we randomly squirt the gold,
12668480	12672640	the gold particle and the reducing agent in and we measure the UV, we measure the color.
12673360	12677920	And so what we do is we've got the robot has a mind. So it has a mind where
12678720	12684640	in a simulation, it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon, the color that comes out,
12684640	12689360	randomly generates imagines in its head. It then, well, the others, that's the imaginary side of
12689360	12694480	the robot and the physical side of the robot, it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color
12694560	12700320	and it uses a genetic algorithm and a map elite actually on it. And it goes around in cycles
12700320	12707840	and refines the color to the objective. Now we use two different points. We have an exploration
12708560	12714320	and optimization. They're two different. So the exploration just says, just do random stuff
12714320	12717360	and see how many different things you can get. And when you get different things,
12717360	12722480	try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper. And what it does after a number
12722480	12729040	of cycles is it physically takes a sample of the optimized nano material, resets all the
12729040	12735280	round bottom flasks, cleans them, and puts the seed physical seed back in. And what this robot
12735280	12742160	is able to do is is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions in just 1000 experiments in
12742160	12748000	three days. And it makes five generations of nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer in terms
12748080	12752240	of shape and color and definition. And then at the end, the output. So Kydial code.
12754080	12761600	Wow, it's doing the search for programs in the physical space. So it's doing a kind of reinforcement
12761600	12768800	learning with the exploration and optimization. And that Kydial will work on any computer or
12768800	12773440	any qualified heart. So now that's it. That's now that's a general piece of code that can
12773600	12780240	replicate somewhat, maybe perfectly what it created. That's amazing. That's incredible.
12780240	12784560	But the nanoparticles themselves are done. The robot has all the thinking. So we don't try and
12784560	12790080	imply any self replication or try and get the particles to make themselves, although it would
12790080	12795520	be cool to try. So well, there you go. That's that those are famous last words for the end of human
12795520	12803200	civilization would be cool to try. So is it possible to create molecules that start approaching
12803280	12810080	this question that we started this conversation, which which is the origin of life to start to
12810080	12817920	create molecules that have lifelike qualities. So have the replication have like complex start
12817920	12822800	to create complex organisms. So we have done this with the oxides. I talked about earlier
12822800	12827680	with them limping oxides and the rings and the bulls. And the problem is that that what they
12827840	12834400	do, they autocatalytically enhance one another. So they would, I guess you would call itself
12834400	12843200	replication. But because there's limited function and mutation, they're pretty dumb. So don't do
12843200	12852480	very much. So I think the prospect of us being able to engineer a nano material and nano material
12852480	12856960	life form in the short term, like I said earlier, my aim is to do this, of course, I mean, I'm,
12856960	12859600	you know, on one hand, I'm saying it's impossible. On the other hand, saying I'm doing it. So
12859600	12864320	which is Italy, you know, it's like, well, like, we're, I think we can do it, but only in the
12864320	12868960	robot. So the causal chain that's going to allow it is in the robot. These particles, if they do
12868960	12873760	start to self replicate, the system's going to be so fragile, that I don't think anything
12874800	12879280	dangerous will come out. It doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them as potentially, you know,
12880880	12884160	I mean, I don't want to scare people like gain of function, we're going to produce stuff that
12884160	12892560	comes out. Our number one kill switch is that we always try to search a space of objects that
12893200	12896800	don't exist in our reality, don't exist in the environment. So even if something got out, it
12896800	12901520	just would die immediately. It's like making a silicon life form or something, or, you know,
12902080	12906640	which is the opposite of oftentimes gain of function research just focused on like, how do
12906640	12912400	you get a dangerous thing to be closer to something that works with humans? Yeah. So
12912400	12919600	having jumped a human. So that's the one good mode to operate on is always try to operate on
12920960	12925600	chemical entities that are very different than the kind of chemical environment that humans
12925600	12930240	operate in. Yeah. And also, I mean, I'll say something dramatic, which may not be,
12931280	12938960	may not be true. So I should be careful. If let's say we did discover a new living system,
12939040	12944480	that it was made out of a shadow biosphere, and we just released it in the environment,
12944480	12952560	who cares? It's going to use different stuff. It'll just live. Just live? Yeah. I thought one
12952560	12957200	of my biggest fantasies is actually is like a planet that's basically half in the sun. It
12957200	12962080	doesn't rotate, right? And you have two different origins of life on that planet.
12963120	12967840	And they don't share the same chemistry. Yeah. And then the only way time they recognize each
12967840	12970800	other is when they become intelligent, they go, well, what's that moving? Yeah.
12972880	12978240	They co-evolve, and that's fascinating. I mean, so one fascinating thing to do is exactly what
12978240	12987600	you were saying, which is a life bomb, which is like try to focus on atmospheres or chemical
12987600	12996000	conditions of other planets and try within this kind of exploration optimization system,
12996000	13002240	try to discover life forms that can work in those conditions, and then you
13002800	13007200	send those life forms over there and see what kind of stuff they build up. Like you can do like a
13007200	13013360	large scale. It's kind of a safe physical environment to do large scale experiments. It's
13013360	13017680	another planet. Yeah. So look, I'm going to say something quite contentious. I mean,
13017680	13021360	Elon wants to go to Mars. I think it's brilliant wants to go to Mars, but I would counter that and
13021360	13028240	say, is Elon just obsessed with getting humanity off Earth? Or what about just technology? So if
13028240	13032640	we do technology, so Elon, I don't need to take a computer to Mars because he needs to manufacture
13032640	13037760	drugs on demand, right? Because you zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code. Or what
13037760	13043280	we do is we actually say, hang on, it's quite hard for humans to survive on Mars. Why don't we write
13043280	13048240	a series of origin of life algorithms where we embed our culture in it, right? It's a very Ridley
13048240	13055600	spot from Vethius, right? Yeah. Which is a terrible film, by the way, but anyway. And dump it on Mars
13055600	13061600	and just terraform Mars. And what we do is we evolve life on Mars that is suited to life on Mars.
13061600	13065680	Yeah. Rather than brute forcing human life on Mars. So one of the questions is,
13066800	13071120	you know, what is human culture? What are the things you encode? Some of it is knowledge. Some
13071120	13077360	of it is information. But the thing that Elon talks about, the thing I think about,
13077360	13085520	I think you think about as well is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human,
13086560	13092640	which is our particular kind of consciousness. So he talks about the flame of human consciousness.
13092640	13095440	Yeah. That's one of the questions is, can we
13098160	13105120	instill consciousness into other beings? Because that's a sad thought that whatever
13106000	13112560	this thing inside our minds that hopes and dreams and fears and loves can all die.
13113840	13119200	Yeah. But I think you already know the answer to that question. I have a robot lawn mower at home.
13120080	13126880	My kids call it CC, call cutter. It's a robot mow. And the way it works, it has an electric field
13126880	13132320	around the perimeter. And it just tell it the area. And it goes out and goes from its base
13132400	13137520	station just mows a bit, gets to the perimeter, detects, and then chooses a random angle,
13137520	13143280	rotates around and goes on. Yeah. But my kids call it call cutter. It's a she. I don't know why
13143280	13147760	it's a she. They just, they were, they were like, quite young. They called it, I don't want to be
13147760	13153600	sexist there. It could be a he, but they liked. They gendered the lawn mower. They gendered the
13153600	13159280	lawn mower. Okay. Yeah. Why not? But I was thinking this lawn mower, if you apply integrated information
13159280	13164800	theory to lawn mower lawn mowers conscious. Now information, integrated information theory
13165920	13169280	is that people say as a flawed way of measuring consciousness, but I don't think it is. I think
13169280	13175120	assembly theory actually measures consciousness in the same way. Consciousness is something that
13175120	13180960	has generated over a population of objects of humans. Consciousness didn't suddenly spring in.
13180960	13185360	Our consciousness is evolved together, right? The fact we're here and the robots we leave behind,
13186000	13191440	they all have some of that. So we won't lose it all. Sure, consciousness requires that we have
13191440	13196080	many models being generated. It's not just one domain specific AI, right? I think the way it
13196080	13201440	creates consciousness, I'm going to say unashainably, the best way to make a consciousness is in a
13201440	13206160	chemical system, because you just have access to many more states. And the problem right now,
13206160	13211600	we're making silicon consciousness. You just don't have enough states. So there are more
13212240	13216000	states, or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible in your brain than
13216000	13221200	there are atoms in the universe. And you can switch between them. You can't do that on a
13221200	13226800	Core i10. It's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors, but you can't reconfigure
13226800	13232960	them as dynamically. Well, you've shared this intuition a few times already that the larger
13232960	13240480	number of states somehow correlates to greater possibility of life. But it's also possible
13240480	13246000	the constraints are essential here. Yeah, yeah. I mean, but coming back to the you worry that
13246000	13255520	something's lost, I agree. But I think that we will get to an AGI. But I wonder if it's not,
13256080	13260400	it can't be separate from human, it can't be separate from human consciousness, because
13260400	13266400	the causal chain that produced it came from humans. So what I kind of try and suggest heavily to
13266480	13272960	people worry about the existential threat of AI saying, I mean, you put it much more elegantly
13272960	13278560	earlier, like we should worry about dark algorithms written by human beings on Twitter,
13278560	13284800	driving us insane, right? And doing acting in odd ways. Yeah, I think intelligence,
13284800	13293040	this is what I have been in eloquent in trying to describe it, partially because I try not to think
13293600	13297680	too deeply through this stuff, because then you become a philosopher, I still aspire to
13297680	13307600	actually building a bunch of stuff. But my sense is super intelligence leads to deep integration
13307600	13314320	into human society. So like intelligence is strongly correlated, like intelligence,
13314320	13321440	the way we conceive of intelligence materializes as a thing that becomes a fun
13321680	13329840	entity to have at a party with humans. So it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor,
13329840	13336880	like intelligence like knowledge, ability to do reasoning and so on, but also humor, emotional
13336880	13346880	intelligence, ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams, to play the game of human
13346880	13352720	civilization, the push and pull, the whole dance of it, the whole dance of life. And I think that
13352720	13359360	kind of super intelligent being is not the thing that worries me. I think that ultimately will
13359360	13366480	enrich life. It's again, the DOM algorithms, the DOM algorithms that scale in the hands of people
13366480	13372720	that are too don't study history, that don't study human psychology and human nature, just applying
13372800	13377920	too broadly for selfish near term interests. That's the biggest danger.
13378480	13384960	Yeah, I think it's not a new danger, right? I now know how I should use Twitter and how I
13384960	13390800	shouldn't use Twitter. I like to provoke people into thinking. I don't want to provoke people
13390800	13395600	into outrage. It's not fun. It's not a good thing for humans to do. And I think that when you get
13395600	13401040	people into outrage, they take sides. And taking sides is really bad. But I think that we're all
13401040	13406160	beginning to see this. And I think that actually, I'm very optimistic about how things will evolve.
13406160	13413200	Because, you know, I wonder how much productivity has Twitter and social media taken out of
13413200	13418800	humanity? Because how many now? I mean, so the good thing about Twitter is it gives power,
13418800	13425600	so it gives voice to minorities, right? And that's good, in some degree. But I wonder how much
13426560	13429760	voice does it give to all sorts of other
13431680	13436080	problems that don't need this emerge? By the way, when you say minorities, I think,
13437680	13442800	or at least if I were to agree with you, what I would say is minorities broadly defined in these
13442800	13452800	small groups of people that it magnifies the concerns of the small versus the big.
13452800	13459840	That is good to some degree. But I think, I mean, I have to be careful because I think I have a very,
13460800	13464960	I mean, I think that the world isn't that broken, right? I think the world is pretty cool place.
13464960	13471600	I think academia is really great. I think climate change presents a really interesting problem for
13471600	13477680	humanity that we will solve. I like how you said it's a pretty cool problem for civilization. It's
13477680	13485840	a big one. There's a bunch of really, really big problems that if solved can significantly improve
13485840	13491440	the quality of life for a large, that ultimately is what we're trying to do. Improve how awesome life
13491440	13496560	is for the maximum number of people. Yeah. And I think that the coming back to consciousness,
13496560	13502000	I don't think the universe is doomed to heat death, right? It's one of the optimists. That's why I want
13502000	13505760	to kind of nudge you into thinking that time is fundamental. Because if time is fundamental,
13505760	13511520	then suddenly you don't have to give it back. The universe just constructs stuff. And what
13511520	13515840	we see around us in our construction, I know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization
13515840	13521280	is. And I mean, look at the fundamentals. We're good until the sun expands, right?
13522000	13526400	We've got quite a lot of resource on earth. We're trying to be quite cooperative. Humans are nice
13526400	13533040	to each other when they're not under enormous stress. But coming back to the consciousness
13533040	13538880	thing, are we going to send human beings to Mars or conscious robots to Mars? Or are we going to
13538880	13544960	send some hybrid? And I don't know the answer to that question right now. I guess Elon's going
13544960	13551360	to have a pretty good go at getting there. I'm not sure whether I have my doubts, but I'm not
13551360	13557680	qualified. I'm sure people have their doubts that computation works. But I've got it working.
13558160	13566960	And most of the cool technologies we have today, and take for granted, like the airplane,
13566960	13573440	aforementioned airplane, were things that people doubted. Like majority of people doubted before
13573440	13579760	they came to life. And they come to life. And speaking of hybrid AI and humans, it's fascinating
13579760	13585280	to think about all the different ways that hybridization, that merger can happen. I mean,
13586160	13589440	currently I have a smartphone, so there's already a hybrid. But there's all kinds of
13589440	13595680	ways that hybrid happens, how we and other technology play together, like a computer.
13595680	13603360	How that changes the fabric of human civilization is wide open. Who knows? Who knows? If you remove
13606640	13612160	cancer, if you remove major diseases from humanity,
13612800	13618160	there's going to be a bunch of consequences we're not anticipating. Many of them positive,
13619120	13625440	but many of them negative. Many of them, most of them, at least I hope, are weird and wonderful
13625440	13631040	and fun in ways that are totally unexpected. And we sitting on a porch with a bottle of
13631040	13636400	Jack Daniels and a rock, we'll say, kids these days don't appreciate how hard we had it back in
13636400	13642880	the day. I got to ask you, speaking of nudging, you and Yosha Bach
13643680	13649840	nudge each other on Twitter quite a bit in wonderful intellectual debates. And of course,
13649840	13653680	for people who don't know, Yosha Bach is this brilliant guy. He's been on the podcast a couple
13653680	13661040	times. You tweeted, or he tweeted, Yosha Bach, everyone should follow him as well.
13661040	13668080	You should definitely follow Mr. Lee Cronin, Dr. Lee Cronin. He tweeted, dinner with Lee Cronin.
13668080	13673680	We discussed that while we can translate every working model of existence into a Turing machine,
13674320	13680320	the structure of the universe might be given by wakes of nonexistence in a pattern generated by
13680320	13688560	all possible automata, which exists by default. And then he followed on saying, face to face is
13688560	13697040	the best. So the dinner was face to face. What is Yosha talking about in wakes, quote, wakes of
13697040	13704240	nonexistence in a pattern generated by all possible automata, which exists by default.
13705440	13712240	So automata exists by default, apparently. And then there's wakes of nonexistence with the hells
13712960	13718960	nonexistence in the universe. And also in another conversation,
13720880	13726320	you tweeted its state machines all the way down, which presumably is the origin story of this
13726320	13734400	dinner discussion. And then Yosha said, again, nudging, nudging, nudging slash trolling.
13735440	13741600	Yosha said, you've seen the light, welcome friend. Many foundational physicists effectively believe
13741600	13747840	in some form of hypercomputation. Lee is coming around to this idea. And then you said,
13748480	13753120	I think there are notable differences. First, I think the universe does not have to be a computer.
13753120	13758560	Second, I want to understand how the universe emerges constructors that build computers. And
13758560	13768480	third is that there is something below church Turing. Okay. What the heck is this dinner
13768480	13775040	conversation about? Maybe put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit. Are there
13775040	13781760	interesting agreements or disagreements between Ewan and Joshua Bach that can elucidate some
13781760	13787040	of the other topics we've been talking about? Yeah. So Yash has an incredible mind and he has,
13787040	13795360	he's so well read and uses language really elegantly. It bamboozles me at times. So I'm
13796320	13803040	so often I'm using, I'm describing concepts in a way that I built from the ground up.
13803040	13807440	And so we misunderstand each other a lot. And he's floating in the clouds, is that what you're
13807440	13812160	saying? Something like, not quite, but I think so this concept of a Turing machine. So a Turing
13812160	13819040	machine, Turing machines, I would argue, and I think this is not the Turing machine, the universe
13819040	13823920	is not a Turing machine. Biology is not even a Turing machine, right? And because Turing
13823920	13828240	machines don't evolve, right? There's a, there is this problem that people see Turing machines
13828240	13832640	everywhere. But is an interest in the universe gave rise to biology that gave rise to intelligence
13832640	13837520	that gave rise to Alan Turing, who invented the abstraction of the Turing machine, and allowed
13837520	13844640	us to digitize. And, and so I've been looking for the mystery at the origin of life, the origin
13844640	13849920	of intelligence and the origin of this. And I, when I discussed with Yash, I think Yash, he was
13849920	13854160	saying, well, the universe of course, the universe is a Turing machine, of course, there's a,
13854160	13859040	there's a hyper computer there. And I think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms.
13859680	13864080	Because of course, it's possible for a Turing machine or computers to exist in the universe,
13864080	13869440	we have them. But what I'm trying to understand is, where did the transition of continuous to
13869440	13875520	discrete occur? And I've been, and this is because of my, my general foolishness of understanding
13875600	13885200	the continuous. But I guess what I'm trying to say is, there were constructors before there
13885200	13891840	were abstractors. Because how did the universe abstract itself into existence? And it goes
13891840	13895120	back to earlier saying, could the universe of intelligence have come first?
13895120	13897120	What's the constructor, what's an abstractor?
13897200	13904240	So the abstractor is the ability of, say, of Alan Turing and Goodall and Church
13905040	13912160	to think about the mathematical universe and to label things. And then from those labels to come
13912160	13918720	up with a set of axioms with those labels, and to basically understand the universe mathematically
13918720	13924640	and say, okay, I can label things. But where did the labeler come from? Where is the prime labeler?
13924720	13934400	Even if the universe is not a Turing computer, does that negate the possibility that a Turing
13934400	13939520	computer can simulate the universe? Like, just because the abstraction was formed at a later time,
13940880	13944720	does that mean that abstraction? This is to our cellular automata conversation.
13944720	13945200	Yeah.
13945200	13949280	You were taking away some of the magic from the cellular automata because very intelligent
13949280	13952240	biological systems came up with that cellular automata.
13952240	13956800	Well, this is where the existence is the default, right? The fact that we exist and we
13956800	13961040	can come up with a Turing machine, does that mean the universe has to be a Turing machine as well?
13961920	13966880	But can it be a Turing machine though? So there has to be in a canopy?
13966880	13976240	Can it be? Sure. I don't understand if it has to be or not. Can it be? But can the universe have
13976800	13981840	Turing machines in it? Sure. They do exist now. I'm wondering though,
13983760	13989360	maybe, and this is Ren, if things get really hairy, is I think the universe maybe in the past
13989360	13993200	did not have the computational power that it has now.
13997760	14003920	This is almost like a law of physics. So the computational power is not
14006960	14011840	you can get some free lunch? Yeah. I mean, the fact that we now, we sit here in this period
14011840	14015280	in time and we can imagine all these robots and all these machines and we built them.
14016000	14019680	And so we can easily imagine going back in time that the universe was capable of having them,
14019680	14025200	but I don't think it can. So the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally.
14025200	14029280	And I think that's why I don't want to go back to the time discussion, but I think it has some
14029280	14033840	relationship with it. The universe is basically smarter now than it used to be and is going to
14033840	14040480	continue getting smarter over time because of novelty generation and the ability to create
14040480	14045120	objects within objects within objects. You know, there's a perhaps as grounded in physics,
14045120	14051680	there's intuition of conservation that stuff is conserved. Like, you're not, you've always had
14051680	14057840	all everything, you're just rearranging books on the bookshelf through time.
14058480	14061600	So you're saying like new books are being written.
14061600	14065040	Which laws do you want to break? The origin of the origin of the Big Bang,
14065760	14068640	you had to break the second law because we got order for free. Yeah.
14069360	14072240	Well, what I'm telling you now is that the energy isn't conserved in the universe.
14073280	14075360	Oh, it's the second law. Okay, I got you.
14075360	14078000	So because, but not in a mad way.
14078000	14086400	Okay, so computation potentially is not conserved, which is a fascinating idea.
14086480	14092160	Intelligence is not conserved. Complexity is not conserved.
14094560	14100080	I suppose that's deeply connected to time being fundamental.
14100960	14106720	The natural consequence of that is if time is fundamental, and the universe is inflating in
14106720	14112640	time, if you like, then there are one or two conservation laws that we need to have a look at.
14112880	14118160	And I wonder if that means the total energy of the universe is actually increasing over time.
14118880	14125600	And I might, this may be completely ludicrous, but we do have all this dark energy that we have,
14125600	14130240	we have some anomalies, let's say, dark matter and dark energy. If we don't add them in,
14130800	14136560	galaxies, so dark matter, I think doesn't, doesn't hold, you know, you need to hold the galaxies
14136560	14140320	together. And there's some other observational issues. Could dark energy just be time?
14140960	14147680	So figuring out what dark energy is might give us some deep clues about this,
14150000	14152560	not just time, but the consequences of time.
14153120	14157280	So it could be that, I mean, I'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed in this
14157280	14163680	free lunch, but I'm saying if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric, and it appears to be,
14164640	14171600	and it's generating novelty, and it appears to, couldn't that just be a mechanistically how
14171600	14180000	reality works? And therefore, I don't really like this idea that the, so I want to live in
14180000	14186240	a deterministic universe that is undetermined. Right? The only way I can do that is if time
14186240	14191360	is fundamental. Because otherwise, it's all, all the rest of us just, it's just slight of hand,
14191360	14197360	because the physicists will say, yes, everything's deterministic, Newton is Newtonian mechanics
14197360	14203120	is deterministic, quantum mechanics is deterministic, let's take the Everettian view. And then basically,
14203120	14207920	we can just draw out this massive universe branching, but it closes again, we get it all back.
14207920	14213200	And don't worry, your feeling of free will is effective. But what the physicists are actually
14213200	14221200	saying is the entire future is mapped out. And that is clearly, problematical. And clearly,
14223280	14227280	because that's not so clear. Yeah, it's just, it's just problematic.
14228560	14233040	Yeah, yeah, so it's, because that maybe is just the way it is. It's problematic to you,
14233040	14236800	but the creature along the timeline. I want to reduce the number of beliefs I need to
14236800	14243120	understand the universe. So if time is fundamental, I don't need to have magic order at the beginning,
14243840	14248720	and I don't need a second law. But you do need the magical belief that time is fundamental.
14248720	14254240	Well, I need the, I need the observation that I'm seeing to be just the how it is all the way down.
14254240	14262000	But the earth also looks flat. If you, if you agree with your observation, so we can't necessarily
14262000	14266240	trust our observation. I know the earth isn't flat because I can send the satellite into space.
14266240	14270480	No, but now you see, now you're using the tools, the science and the technology.
14270480	14274080	But I'm using, what I'm saying, I'm going to do experiments that start to show.
14274960	14281120	I mean, I think that it's worth, so if you can't, so if I cannot do an experiment or
14281120	14285840	a thought experiment that will test this assumption, then the assumption is without
14285840	14292000	merit really in the end. You know, that's, it's fine. So that's a beautiful idea you hold yourself
14292000	14299280	to. That's, that's a, that's given that you think deeply in a philosophical way, you think about
14299280	14305600	some of these really important issues and you have theoretical frameworks like assembly theory.
14307120	14313200	It's really nice that you're always grounded with experiment. That's, that's so refreshing.
14313200	14320480	That's so beautifully refreshing. Now that we're holding you to the grounded and experiment
14320480	14324560	to the harsh truth of reality. Let me ask the big, the big ridiculous question.
14325280	14328960	What is the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life?
14328960	14335760	Why this time is fundamental. It's marching forward and along this
14336720	14344480	long timeline come along a bunch of descendants of apes that have come up with cellular automata
14344480	14351760	and computers and now computers. Why? I have so many different answers to this question.
14351760	14356400	It depends on, on what day I would say that given the way of the conversation we had today,
14356400	14362560	I'd say the meaning. Well, we make our own meaning. I think that's fine. But I think the universe wants
14362560	14369600	to explore every possible configuration that it's allowed us to explore. And this goes back to the
14369600	14374480	kind of question that you're asking about Yasha and the existence and non-existence of things,
14374480	14378400	right? So if the universe is a Turing machine is churning through a lot of states
14379360	14384240	and you think about combinatorial theory before assembly theory, so everything is possible.
14385120	14391280	What Yasha and I were saying is, well, not everything is, we don't see the combinatorial
14391280	14398400	explosion. We see something else. And what we see is evidence of memory. So there's,
14398400	14404000	there clearly seems to be some interference between the combinatorial explosion of things
14404080	14409440	and what the universe allows. And it's like this kind of constructive, destructive interference.
14410560	14417600	So maybe the universe is not just about, it is assembling objects in space and time.
14418160	14423680	And those objects are able to search more space and time and the universe is just infinitely
14423680	14429120	creative. And I guess I'm searching for why the universe is infinitely creative is infinitely
14429120	14433680	creative. And maybe the meaning is just simply to make as many objects create as many things as
14433680	14438560	possible. And I see a future of the universe that doesn't result in the heat there for the universe.
14438560	14444320	The universe is going to extract every ounce of creativity it can out of it because that's
14444320	14450400	what we see on earth, right? And if you think that almost like intelligence is not conserved that
14450400	14458560	maybe creativity isn't either, maybe like it's an infinite well. So like creativity is ultimately
14458640	14464400	tied to novelty. You're coming up with cool new configurations of things and maybe that just
14464400	14470720	can continue indefinitely. And this human species that was created along the way is probably just
14472320	14478560	one method like that's able to ask the universe about itself. It's just one way to explore
14478560	14484240	creativity. Maybe there's other meta levels on top of that. Like obviously as a collective
14484240	14491600	intelligence will create organisms, maybe there'll be organisms that ask themselves questions about
14491600	14499280	themselves in a deeper, bigger picture way that we humans do. First to ask questions about the
14499280	14504960	humans and then construct some kind of hybrid systems that ask themselves about the collective
14504960	14508960	aspect. Just like some weird stacking that we can't even imagine yet.
14508960	14513360	And that stacking, I mean, I've discussed this stacking a lot with Sarah Walker who's a professor
14513440	14522000	of physics and astrobiology at ASU. And we argue about how creative the universe is going to be
14522000	14527920	and is it just deterministic and all that because I think she's more of a free will thinker and I'm
14527920	14533280	of a less free will thinker, but I think we're beginning to converge and understanding that
14533920	14538080	because there's simply a missing understanding right now that we don't understand how the
14538080	14542960	universe, we don't know what rules the universe has to allow the universe to contemplate itself.
14543440	14548880	So asking the meaning of it before we even know what those rules are is premature, but my guess
14548880	14553840	is that it's not meaningless and it isn't just about that. And there are three levels of meanings.
14553840	14557280	Obviously the universe wants us to do stuff. We're interacting with each other. So we create
14557280	14562720	meaning in our own society and our own interactions with humanity. But I do think there is something
14562720	14570640	else going on. But because reality is so weird, we're just scratching at that. And I think that
14570640	14577280	we have to make the experiments better. And we have to perhaps join across not just for the
14577280	14581920	computation lists and what I tried to do with Yasha is meet him halfway. So what happens if I
14581920	14587120	become a computation list? What do I gain? A lot, it turns out, because I can make Turing machines
14587120	14591120	in the universe. Because on the one hand, I'm making computers, which are state machines inspired
14591120	14595840	by Turing. On the other hand, I'm saying they can't exist. Well, clearly, that's that I can't
14595840	14600320	have my cake and eat it. So there's something weird going on there. So then did the universe have to
14600320	14604240	make a continuous to discrete transition or is the universe just discrete? It's probably just
14604240	14611200	discrete. So if it's just discrete, then there are, I will then give Yasha his Turing like property
14611200	14615360	in the universe. But maybe there's something else below it, which is the constructor that constructs
14615360	14622400	the Turing machine, that then constructs, you know, is a bit like the, you generate a computing
14622400	14627840	system that then is able to build an abstraction that then recognizes, it can make a generalizable
14627840	14633760	abstraction because human beings with mathematics have been able to go on and build
14633760	14638720	physical computers, if that makes any sense. And I think that's the meaning. I think that's,
14638720	14643360	you know, as far as we can, the meaning will be further elucidated with further experiments.
14646720	14653920	Well, you mentioned Sarah, I think you and Sarah Walker are just these fascinating human beings.
14654880	14660080	I'm really fortunate to have the opportunity to be in your presence to study your work,
14660080	14666400	to follow along with your work. I'm a big fan. Like I told you offline, I hope we get a chance
14666400	14672080	to talk again with perhaps just the two of us, but also with Sarah, that's a fascinating dynamic
14673760	14678080	for people who haven't heard. I suppose on Clubhouse is where I heard you guys talk,
14678080	14683120	but you have an incredible dynamic. And I also can't wait to hear you and Yasha talk.
14683120	14689760	So I think if there's some point in this predetermined or yet to be determined future
14691440	14698080	where the three of us, you and Sarah or the four of us with Yasha, could meet and talk would be
14698080	14704480	a beautiful future. And I look forward to most futures, but I look forward to that one in particular.
14704480	14708160	Lee, thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today.
14708160	14709440	Thanks, Lex. It's been a pleasure.
14710400	14715440	Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lee Cronin. To support this podcast, please check
14715440	14720800	out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from the mad
14720800	14729280	scientist Rick Sanchez of Rick and Morty fame. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise,
14729280	14736400	you're just an inner chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows
14736400	14742000	you. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
