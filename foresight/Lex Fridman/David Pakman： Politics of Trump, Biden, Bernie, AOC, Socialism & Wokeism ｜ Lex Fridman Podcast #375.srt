1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
I tweet that and then I finish the day and I wake up the next morning and I glance at my phone.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are quote-tweeting it and demanding a retraction

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,760
and whatever. And I go, uh-oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,800
I then continue about my day. Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got a hundred messages

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,360
from, you should have aborted your son to, we're gonna find all of you to whatever else.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,760
My dad has no idea what's going on. He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have a hundred DMs

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,920
to everything else you can imagine. And I start to get emails about, you know,

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,400
your Jewish faith, this and that and the other thing. And so at that point to me,

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,640
I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse. And so I deleted the tweet.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,800
And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed,

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,400
yes, the attacks escalated. It went through Candace Owens and then at foxnews.com, Newsmax,

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,240
kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,520
The following is a conversation with David Pakman, a left-wing progressive political commentator

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,600
and host of the David Pakman show. I hope to continue to have many conversations on politics

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,880
with prominent, insightful, and sometimes controversial figures across the political

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,320
spectrum. David and I have been planning to speak for a long time and I'm sure we'll speak many

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,560
more times. This conversation was challenging, eye-opening, and fun. This is the Lex Rudman

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,240
podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,040
here's David Pakman. Are there interesting differences to you between terms like liberal,

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,160
Democrat, left-wing, leftist, progressive, socialist, communist, Marxist, far left,

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,160
center left, all of these labels? Is there interesting distinctions between them?

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,960
Yeah, there's two sets of distinctions. One is if you just want to say let's define each of these

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,080
as political terms, they're all different terms. You can be a progressive ideologically, but not

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,960
be a member of the Democratic Party. Many say the Democratic Party isn't even really very progressive,

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,720
so these are certainly terms that we could define in order to have a conversation about

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,120
the next thing, kind of as a precursor to a conversation. Sometimes the terms are used

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,440
in order to tag someone with a certain ideology that's not really linked to policy

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,200
or any particular political question, but they can be used positively or negatively to just kind

29
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,880
of say, here's the image of this individual that I have in my mind. So like Marxist is

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,320
right now very popularly being used by some on the right to attack Democrats. There's very

31
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,520
few actual Marxists, certainly not in positions of power in the United States, but even among the

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,400
general population. So I think it's important to distinguish, are we defining these terms because

33
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,600
we want to compare and contrast the ideas that a particular group might bring to the discussion,

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,160
or are we using them as insults or to stifle conversation? There are terms that can be used to

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,080
start conversation or to stop it. And the use of those terms is evolving rapidly month by month.

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,440
So the term leftist, I think, is a relatively popular term now to use in the negative context

37
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:38,160
to describe what an outraged left-wing commentator? I think what you're kind of grasping onto is that

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,360
there's probably some set of ideas that would apply to most of those who consider themselves to be on

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,040
the left. The discussion of how that term is mostly being used is not about policy ideas. You're

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,960
accurately identifying that. And it does seem like progressive is no longer being used as a smear

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,600
and leftist is being used as a smear more at this point. Okay. But sometimes some of these

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,440
terms are useful. Can we try to pick the terms that are useful, like liberal and progressive and

43
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:16,880
Democrat, liberal and progressive? Is there an interesting, definable distinction between liberal

44
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,280
and progressive to you? That's maybe one of the most interesting ones. 10 years ago, liberal often

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,760
meant what now we mean by progressive. More recently, the progressive socialist-leaning

46
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,600
part of the political spectrum has started to use liberal to mean Joe Biden, to mean someone who

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,040
is not really left enough. So liberal is very interesting because I remember talking with

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,080
my audience years ago, maybe eight years ago or something like that, where I identified I'm going

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,160
to now use the term progressive more commonly to describe my own beliefs because liberal has now

50
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,680
been made a smear, it's being shifted into something else, and it also means more of like a center left

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:10,160
politics. So it's changed in some sense by necessity, by force, and also because the spectrum has

52
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,880
shifted to some degree. So the term liberal has evolved. Now liberal meaning some kind of

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
embodiment of the mainstream Democratic party, almost? To some degree. Sometimes I'm called,

54
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm written off by, within my space, there are all sorts of shades of gray, which I'm sure we can

55
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,800
talk about, about where I am versus should be, could be, or am wrongly placed. And sometimes

56
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,080
an attack on me is he's just a lib, meaning I'm not left enough. I'm not progressive,

57
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,600
socialist, wherever else you want to go. So yeah, the problem with a lot of these terms and

58
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,280
they're used very casually by people who call into my show is that unless we actually define them

59
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,680
each time, they very often mean very different things to different people and often come with

60
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,640
an agenda attached to them. And so I find that they often stifle meaningful conversation rather

61
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:12,080
than encourage it. Do you sense that there's a drifting of what is the threshold to be a progressive

62
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,240
or is there, should we use progressive synonymously with Democratic socialist?

63
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,080
I think we should not use it synonymously with Democratic socialist. And this is where there's

64
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,600
another linguistic confusion and a political confusion. So we'll first talk about the linguistic

65
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,960
one. Social democracy versus Democratic socialism, very similar words in a different order. Okay.

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:46,640
My, the way I operate is Democratic socialism is actually a form of socialism where one would

67
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,720
seek to socialize ownership of the means of production as an example. Social democracy is a

68
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,160
very highly regulated form of capitalism, the likes of which we would see in Northern Europe,

69
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,800
Denmark, et cetera. These are very different things. I associate progressivism in 2023

70
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,960
with social democracy and would consider Democratic socialism a form of actual socialism that is

71
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,920
different. We're no longer talking about a capitalist organization of society.

72
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:22,160
So transition from one to the other is a fundamental shift in how society operates then?

73
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,720
Absolutely. And when you talk about social democracy, you're talking about socializing

74
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,240
a couple more things than we socialize in most modern capitalist countries. I had this

75
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,280
conversation with Patrick Bet David recently. Social democracy is, okay, we've socialized

76
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,960
the military already in the United States. We've socialized some healthcare in the sense of like

77
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,680
the VA and Medicaid, et cetera. We're talking about socializing a couple more things still in a

78
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,160
capitalist country. Democratic socialism would be something beyond that. And as someone who is not

79
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,560
a Democratic socialist myself, I'm maybe not the best advocate for explaining exactly how

80
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,040
that system would function, but it would have some version of socializing ownership of the

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,880
means of production, businesses, et cetera. So you mentioned you appeared on the PBD podcast

82
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:25,360
with Patrick Bet David. The debate was pretty intense. I should say, I personally enjoyed it.

83
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,960
I thought, actually, you did well. And I thought Patrick did well. It was a good conversation.

84
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,800
I think there was a little bit of tension. Yeah. And I thought that Patrick actually,

85
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,880
so I disagreed with the internet, I thought Patrick just took on a kind of devil's advocate.

86
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,280
He was purposely being stubborn to bring out the best in you. But the internet thought that

87
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,400
he's being stubborn, not being open to your ideas. I thought the tension between ideas,

88
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,960
I think a lot of the tension had to do probably with Donald Trump and Trump supporters.

89
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,320
That certainly could be the case. And people wrote to me the full gamut of everything you can

90
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,440
imagine from this was your best thing you've ever done in public to you got humiliated and

91
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
your mother should have aborted you. And everything in between. So take your pick. But

92
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,320
the most interesting feedback I got was from people who asked me after was it incredibly

93
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,000
tense and awkward and because it seemed so combative. And I think I'm so used to those

94
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,560
types of tensions in the discussions that I have, that it's very comfortable to me. It's not like

95
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,600
afterwards, it's there's a grudge or it's tense or whatever the case may be. I'm very comfortable.

96
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,680
I disagree with people and that's it. So I did not find anything that happened

97
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
inappropriate. I disagreed with a lot of the things he said, certainly.

98
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,080
So you've also spoken with Michael Knowles, I think about the idea of what is a woman.

99
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,840
Can you speak broadly about your conversations with the people you disagree with?

100
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,160
Some of the cases, it feels like it's gone wrong.

101
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,120
The conversations have gone wrong. Yeah.

102
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,680
Yeah. I mean, I think there's a couple different things and I'm the first to tell you that

103
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,560
depending on who I'm talking to, I go in with a different attitude about how, quote,

104
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,160
seriously I'm taking it in the sense of whether I think it's going to be a deep policy discussion

105
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,880
versus whether it's going to be more of a performance for an audience that is expecting

106
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,160
a certain thing. And I think there's different types of shows. When I was interviewed by this

107
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,720
guy, Jesse Lee Peterson in Los Angeles, it's very different, for example, than when I'm talking to

108
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,960
Patrick Bette David, just to give two examples. I think the reason I stopped doing the Michael

109
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,360
Knowles show was the number of threats I would get after the fact. That's really the reason.

110
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,760
I was glad to engage with him to the extent that the interviews were interesting and we could

111
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,240
organize it reasonably efficiently. But the reason I stepped away was sort of the aftermath.

112
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,200
But I did find him to be someone who was abundantly clear about his view and where he comes from.

113
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
And while I could not possibly disagree more with him in terms of politics and culture and

114
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,840
our backgrounds, everything is just so different, I found it easy to engage in the conversation

115
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,200
just because of how upfront and clear he was about what his beliefs were.

116
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,560
But the number of threats was too much. Yeah, it was just too much. And this,

117
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,480
I don't know how much you saw about this recent Twitter dust-up I was involved in that peaked

118
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,440
with Donald Trump Jr. tweeting about me and then declining from there.

119
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,080
Oh, let's talk through it. I didn't see it. I have to understand. The way you study Shakespeare,

120
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,920
I have to study your Twitter. I have to understand how much of a sarcasm.

121
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,400
It's mostly sarcasm. I mean, here's the thing. And I know that there are people who will say,

122
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,680
David, you're dealing with such serious issues. It's really not okay not to take everything

123
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,960
you do completely seriously. But my view is it's so incredible that I've between chance and timing

124
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,840
and so different things fallen into a position where this is what I do professionally and it's

125
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,960
a career and it's financially sustainable and all these different things. I don't want to end up

126
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,720
taking myself too seriously because I recognize the timing and luck and all of these other things.

127
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
And this could have gone a completely different way. So my approach to a lot of this is let's not

128
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,440
take ourselves too seriously. And in particular on Twitter, a platform that

129
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,560
the degree to which it should be taken very seriously maybe has changed over time. I'm always

130
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
sort of thinking a little bit tongue-in-cheek on Twitter.

131
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
So what happened with Donald Trump Jr.?

132
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,080
So...

133
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,360
Or the full arc of it.

134
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,560
Yeah, to give you a one-minute arc and then we can pick whichever parts we want. After

135
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,280
a mass shooting, now you might say there's like two or three a day. You're correct.

136
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:50,000
After the Nashville mass shooting at a Christian school, I tweeted snarkily tongue-in-cheek to

137
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,400
point that thoughts and prayers not only aren't particularly useful after a shooting,

138
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,200
they also don't prevent shootings, that there's some confusion about how there would be a shooting

139
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,880
at a Christian school, given that it is a place where prayer is taking place. I think I jokingly

140
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,400
said something like, were they not praying enough or correctly?

141
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,120
In my deep journalistic integrity.

142
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,840
You have it.

143
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,640
I have your tweet.

144
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,200
Beautiful.

145
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,760
Beautiful.

146
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,280
This is the only display of journalistic integrity I will show today. Okay.

147
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
And I have a couple of responses.

148
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,200
Beautiful.

149
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
And you deleted the tweet since then.

150
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
Which I regret.

151
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,040
Oh, interesting.

152
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
And we can talk about that.

153
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,040
I would love to, because it's such an interesting decision.

154
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,120
Because when you tweet something, one of the things I've also learned is you don't often

155
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,960
understand how it's going to be read. It's going to be analyzed like I mentioned Shakespeare.

156
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,120
Like there's certain, the use of certain words that you regret saying in a certain kind of way,

157
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,080
maybe just because it wasn't as eloquent as powerful, it didn't actually convey the thing,

158
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
or is the distraction to the main message, all that kind of stuff.

159
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay. The actual tweet is very surprising that there would be a mass shooting at a Christian

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,040
school, given that lack of prayer is often blamed for these horrible events.

161
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,400
Is it possible they weren't praying enough or correctly, despite being a Christian school?

162
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:25,760
And a lot of people quote, retweeted that, which I'm assuming was the criticism.

163
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,160
So Colin Wright wrote, I used to consider you a reasonable progressive, but you clearly

164
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,600
devolved into partisan hackery. I'm an atheist. It cannot begin to fathom using the murder of

165
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,720
children and adults at a Christian school as an opportunity to dunk on the concept of prayer.

166
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,400
And you responded, I'm dunking on the people who send thoughts and prayers

167
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,440
and do nothing else. And the shootings continue. Okay. I'm sure there's a lot of other interactions.

168
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
There's a few other 100,000 interactions.

169
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,240
So that you want the arc leading to the leading.

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,200
Yes, please. Sorry.

171
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,720
I just wanted to display the...

172
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,280
Do you know what time of day I tweeted the original one?

173
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,800
I feel like it was in the afternoon or evening on a Monday.

174
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,600
3.42 p.m. on 27th, March 27th.

175
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,960
Which was a Monday. Okay.

176
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,920
So basically, I tweet that and then I finish the day.

177
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,120
So you tweet and then you go on with your day.

178
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,320
I might have looked once at Twitter and it had 2000 likes and a few people saying,

179
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,040
this might have missed the mark, but it's sort of like it's one of my 20,000 tweets.

180
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
I don't know. I wake up the next morning.

181
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,960
My baby daughter did not sleep till 7.30 the way I would like.

182
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,920
So she's up at 6 a.m. and I get up and I'm just there starting to make breakfast.

183
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,720
And I glance at my phone and I'm starting to...

184
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
This was when verified meant a different thing than it means now.

185
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm seeing all these verified accounts that are quote tweeting it and demanding a retraction

186
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,240
and whatever. And I go, uh-oh, okay, this looks like it's getting some attention.

187
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,640
I then continue about my day.

188
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,400
Around noon, I hear from my dad that he got 100 messages from,

189
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,840
you should have aborted your son to, we're gonna find all of you to whatever else.

190
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,200
My dad has no idea what's going on.

191
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,960
He's like, I don't know what this is, but I have 100 DMs to everything else you can imagine.

192
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:27,040
And I start to get emails about your Jewish faith, this and that, and the other thing.

193
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,840
And so at that point, to me, I thought this is just going to get worse and worse and worse.

194
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,200
And so I deleted the tweet. And I really regret doing that because over the 48 hours that followed,

195
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,800
yes, the attacks escalated. It went through Candice Owens and then at FoxNews.com, Newsmax,

196
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,920
kind of peaking with Donald Trump Jr. And it was horrible. I mean, thousands and thousands of the,

197
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,400
okay. But once I told my audience about what happened, I got thousands of messages from

198
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:06,160
people saying, David, only someone who doesn't know you and is determined to interpret this in

199
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,480
the worst possible faith would think you're blaming kids who died for getting shot. Of course,

200
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,240
you weren't doing that. I wish you hadn't deleted it so that it would still be up and you would now

201
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,800
see the tide kind of turning on it. This was not a fun three days, regardless. But I do regret

202
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:32,320
having deleted it because I wanted to do the quickest thing I thought I could to get people

203
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,480
to stop trying to find family members and send them threats. And so around noon, that's what I did.

204
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,920
And the truth is the threats didn't stop anyway because everybody had screenshoted it.

205
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,080
And I do wish I had left it up.

206
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,400
And is there some degree, maybe stepping outside yourself, do you regret tweeting that?

207
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:59,360
In that, it feeds the mockery engine that fuels Twitter. So like, does that tweet really

208
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:10,640
represent what you believe? It absolutely represents the disgust with a politics that includes saying

209
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,920
we can't touch guns. We just, we can't. But we're willing to point to mental health or say we need

210
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:25,280
more prayer in schools or whatever. 1000 percent, it represents that view. Is it the type of snark

211
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,280
and sarcasm that I would use if given an hour to discuss the topic rather than whatever the

212
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,240
number of characters is now on Twitter? No, definitely not. And so I am very cognizant

213
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,440
of the fact that it was unnecessarily provocative how it was written.

214
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,640
I think I asked a similar question to Ben Shapiro. Do you worry that this style of presentation

215
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,000
can turn you from being a deeply thoughtful, objective political thinker to somebody who's

216
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,480
just a partisan hack or partisan, what's a good word, talking head?

217
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you mean with regard to Twitter or the format of my show in general?

218
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:14,160
So Twitter for now, let's start with Twitter for now. And can you silo your style of communication

219
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,680
on Twitter from being a virus that affects your mind?

220
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,840
Right. I don't have deep thoughts about the Twitter component beyond, I think,

221
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,280
across all sorts of disciplines. This is not the best way to most effectively solve problems

222
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
and figure out solutions to complex issues. You're talking about Twitter.

223
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,520
Now, right now I'm talking about Twitter. That being said, I think all of us, to some degree,

224
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,760
have to adapt our content to the platform that we're using in the same way that what I post to

225
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,360
YouTube is different than what I post to TikTok. What I post to Twitter is also different.

226
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:59,600
Do I think Twitter has been an unmitigated good for society? No. Have I chosen to step into

227
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,880
Twitter as one of the ways in which I get my message out with the good and the bad? Yes.

228
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,760
And I think that there is a deep conversation to be had there. I think zooming out a little bit

229
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
in terms of what I do, and I was hoping this would come up because I think it's really interesting,

230
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,680
I will often get emails from people who say two things. I will get the, you would have

231
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,000
such a bigger audience if you did X type emails. And usually they are plays to sensationalism,

232
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,520
salacious and titillating content, more pop culture stuff, et cetera. On the other hand,

233
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,280
it's folks who say, listen, what you're doing really isn't as serious as it could be. And it

234
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,960
seems like you could do something more serious. And you should consider doing deep dives. Once

235
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,720
it was do a deep dive into Calvin Coolidge. And I was like, nobody will watch that. So

236
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,520
it's not by accident that my show is the way it is, right? In an hour, I'm thinking of all the

237
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,080
platforms I'm on and I'm saying, okay, I want to do a relatively deep dive on the federal budget.

238
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,360
And I want to talk about some of the political tomfoolery going on within the post office.

239
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,400
And I'm going to do a segment about the wacky rally where Trump said crazy things and made

240
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,840
up three words and said he endorsed a candidate who's named, right? I'm crafting that in total

241
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,520
to find a balance between let's build this audience as much as I can in order to have a

242
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,440
bigger base to get my message out there and include the more serious stuff with the hope

243
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
that there's a little bit of something for everyone. And I'm finding a balance between those two

244
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,200
sides of the spectrum. It's a deliberate thing. And I'm aware that if I were producing my show

245
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
50 years ago, the balance would probably be different and it would probably change again.

246
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,000
If the show was audio only rather than having all these video platforms,

247
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,320
it would also be different. But it's a decision that's proactively made to try to get the best

248
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,360
and most out of the hour that I'm creating every day.

249
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:08,400
It just feels like there's an entire machine fed by Twitter and journalism that wants to divide

250
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,920
people and the drama of that division, highlighting the partisan division, the drama of that division

251
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,520
feels like it's a tension with objective clear thinking sometimes. And so that's the,

252
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:32,800
I worry that there's a drug to it. There's too much fun to mock ridiculous people on the other side.

253
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:41,280
I think you're right about that. And the fact that that is true to me supports,

254
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,840
I've talked with my audience about, you know, like the old food pyramid, which I guess was

255
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
like wrong, but let's imagine that there was a pyramid that made sense.

256
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,480
What's at the bottom bread?

257
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,600
I think like whole grains, maybe. I don't remember. It's been a while since I saw that.

258
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,440
Junk food is at the very top. I'm very open with my audience.

259
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,080
The vast majority of what I do is the top of that pyramid.

260
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,840
And I tell people very openly, I don't consume a lot of the type of content I produce.

261
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,240
And I think it's really important to, as a base, be doing critical thinking,

262
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,600
epistemology, how do we believe the things we believe, basics about the world.

263
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,880
After that, reading history, economics, philosophy, etc.

264
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,120
After that, now we're getting into current events, I would mostly be looking at consuming

265
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,520
primary source reporting, things like associated press, whatever. I know everybody will have a

266
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,280
different list of what counts there. After that is when I'd say indulge in some of the commentary

267
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:55,280
type stuff that I do. If you find that I'm thoughtful enough to make it into that,

268
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,680
but I'm very open. And really, what I try to do on my show often is,

269
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,000
in being that at the top of the pyramid, tell people there's all this other stuff

270
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,960
that should be forming your foundation that I hope you're consuming in addition to just

271
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
watching me. And I'm very open with my audience about that.

272
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,520
What about the shape, the dynamics, the characteristics of your audience? Is there

273
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,920
some degree to which you're through mocking maybe Republicans that there's a

274
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,440
lean to that audience and then you become captured by the audience? Do you worry about

275
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:37,440
the audience capture? I worry about it. I'm relatively comfortable that it's not shaping

276
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:45,040
the program to a great degree in the sense that at this point, I have a pretty good sense of the

277
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,400
things I can say that will upset what I might call my core audience. One of the interesting things

278
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,840
just to briefly go back to the Twitter thing was those people who were furious with me on Twitter

279
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,200
and they contacted my advertisers and some advertisers dropped me and on and on and on.

280
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,200
None of them are actually in my audience. None of them are regular consumers of my audience.

281
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,200
They were kind of weaponized against me by people who said, hey, look at this.

282
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,200
The people who follow Candace Owens on Twitter, other than for their kind of shock value,

283
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,760
they're not in my audience. And with my core audience, I know there are things I can talk

284
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,120
about that will generate displeasure, I guess you could say with my audience. Sometimes when

285
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,440
I touch the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, that will happen. Sometimes on vaccines,

286
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
there's a portion of my audience that is more generally skeptical of vaccines.

287
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,120
Sometimes on some foreign policy issues. Or I'm not a big fan of Marianne Williamson,

288
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,200
nor Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s challenges to Joe Biden, not because I love Joe Biden,

289
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,480
but because I don't consider them to be the most serious challengers. I know there's people in

290
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,200
my audience who don't like that. They get mad at me about that. And I'm totally okay with that

291
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,000
and that tension with my core audience. So in that sense, I don't feel as though I've had that

292
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,320
audience capture take place. But I know it can happen. And I'm very open to being told ways

293
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,280
in which it may be happening without me noticing. So I've made a call for questions on Reddit

294
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,080
for this conversation. There's a lot of good questions that I'll probably bring up. But

295
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,920
one of them was about Marianne Williamson asking why David thinks she is a garbage candidate,

296
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,040
which of course, I've never said, but perhaps you have more eloquently criticized. So let's

297
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,000
go there to the 2024 election. Okay. So Biden, Joe Biden officially announced that he's running

298
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,680
again. Donald Trump officially announced that he's running again. And if that's the matchup,

299
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,280
who do you think wins? If the elections held today, I think Biden.

300
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:03,200
What? Well, first of all, I believe he won last time. And if I start with the results from 2020,

301
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,080
and I think to myself, what has happened since then that would push or pull voters one way or

302
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,200
the other, I have a hard time making a case that Trump is in a better position today than he was

303
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,040
in November of 2020. So that's kind of my starting point, which is it's a rematch of an

304
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:31,600
election with a known outcome. What has changed? And I can't make a case for circumstances having

305
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,720
changed in Trump's favor to give a couple of state level examples. Florida seems to be kind of

306
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,240
moving more to the Republican side since 2020. But Trump won that state already in 2020. So it

307
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,080
wouldn't really change the outcome. Arizona was close. I think Arizona has moved to the left

308
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:56,000
since 2020. So I don't see Trump taking that one. Wisconsin, I think the same sort of thing applies.

309
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,840
So being very practical, that would be kind of the start of my reasoning.

310
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,960
Do you think Joe Biden is a better candidate now than he was in 2020?

311
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,440
I think he's a worse candidate. This is going to sound agist, but I think he's a worse candidate

312
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:25,280
in that he's even older and there already seems to be an appetite for younger candidates,

313
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:32,080
particularly on the Democratic voting side. So he's going to be four years older and in a sense

314
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:39,040
that could be a liability. However, he also is going to have four years of accomplishments. Now,

315
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,400
you might not like the things he's done in which case that would hurt him,

316
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,400
but he has started to accumulate a not insignificant number of accomplishments.

317
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,640
Some of the big things that are known, Inflation Reduction Act and COVID Stimulus,

318
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,200
but also less well-known things like a bunch of little tweaks to health care,

319
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,280
a bunch of little tweaks to student lending. There's been a lot of little things.

320
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,240
At the macro level, I don't actually think Joe Biden has that much to do with this the same way

321
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,960
I didn't credit or attack Trump for a lot of the macroeconomic stuff, but Inflation has started

322
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,160
to come down significantly. The stock market's quite steady, these sort of things. I think looking

323
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:24,160
historically, it's a pretty okay environment for Joe Biden with the exception that he was

324
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,680
already the oldest president to be inaugurated in 2021 and he would beat his own record in

325
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,880
January of 2025. And I just don't know how voters are going to see that.

326
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,680
So in terms of just a public human being, how would you compare Trump and Biden? So if I were

327
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:47,040
to give criticism towards Trump, it would be that his chaotic, maybe to the point of being

328
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,760
disrespectful to a lot of different groups, to a lot of different ideas, to a lot of different

329
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,320
nations and leaders and all that kind of stuff. And then the criticism towards Biden would be that

330
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:04,960
he may be perhaps because of age or any other kind of cognitive capabilities is not really there

331
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,960
mentally as in the way that perhaps you could say that Barack Obama was there,

332
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,760
just mentally being able to handle all kinds of aspects of being a public representative of a

333
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:25,600
nation to the world and to the people of that nation. So which in the competition of personality

334
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,160
flaws, which do you think is more powerful? You've laid out fair and I believe accurate

335
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:40,240
assessments of elements of both of those men. You haven't weighed in on to what degree you value

336
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,600
each of those assessments, which is where I think the kind of meat of this question really is.

337
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,800
I don't see, and I know that Biden's going to get us into World War III, World War III,

338
00:30:52,880 --> 00:31:00,480
doesn't seem to be happening. I don't see the Biden deficits you listed, which I agree with you on.

339
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:09,040
I don't see them as dangerous or threatening to the standing of the United States in this kind of

340
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:18,240
environment with our traditional Western allies and geopolitics, etc. in the way that the sort

341
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,360
of unhinged personality of Trump combined with his lack of knowledge about most issues

342
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,520
is a threat. So for me, if those two are the candidates, Biden would be my choice. Now,

343
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,960
are there people I would rather see on the Democratic side? Yes. If I knew the president

344
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,560
would be a Republican, can I think of better options than Trump? Absolutely. It's so funny

345
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,120
when in 2012 it was Obama versus Romney, the difference seemed so significant between them.

346
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,120
Thinking back, I'm sure I would disagree with Mitt Romney about tax rates and his views on LGBT,

347
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,960
or I know are different than mine, but it seems without looking at him with rose-colored glasses,

348
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,160
so comparatively benign given the four years of Trump. So that's kind of where I come down.

349
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,760
Even McCain and Obama, the differences seemed quite drastic. Yeah. McCain was interesting

350
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,360
because Palin, as his running mate, opened the door to the sort of cartoonish stuff that we've

351
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,840
started to see on the Republican side. Palin, Trump, Marjorie Taylor-Green, it started going in

352
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,120
that direction, which has made the party a bit of a joke. Aside from what you believe the tax rate

353
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,320
would be. You can say taxes are too high, but Jewish space lasers come on, but I agree with

354
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,760
you on McCain also. Going back to the political terms we talked about, where in that spectrum do

355
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:49,600
you place yourself today? Which of the label do you think captures your political views?

356
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,960
Progressive Social Democrat, which again, is a capitalist. I own my own business. I pay the

357
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,480
taxes I'm legally required to pay and not a penny more and all those things. That's where I place

358
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:09,520
myself. Would you place yourself to the left of Joe Biden? Yes. Where does the AOC fit into that?

359
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,400
That's a good question. What do you think about AOC as a candidate? Do you think she eventually

360
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:25,280
runs? I think that if she doesn't run into some kind of scandal, and I don't mean scandal in the

361
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:35,440
sense of some personal impropriety, but I mean some kind of major political problem, it seems that

362
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,600
she has the staying power to be an American elected politics for a long time. Whether she would even

363
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,720
want to be president versus maybe going to the Senate or being governor or whatever the case

364
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,080
may be, I have no idea what her ambitions are in that sense. But certainly, policy aside,

365
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:02,160
she has this combination of charisma, likeability to some, but also something about her personality

366
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,920
that angers the people who don't like her in a way that only fuels her presence,

367
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,840
which I think applies to Trump as well, that I do think that she has the potential to have

368
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,880
significant staying power in American politics. President, I don't know.

369
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,080
Do you think that's the future of political elections and politics in general,

370
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,280
is people who are able to skillfully piss off the other side, like AOC and Trump did?

371
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,080
I think it's an aspect of it. I think it's also understanding how to communicate policy ideas.

372
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Trump, I have things I can praise Trump about if we want to get to that segment at some point.

373
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,080
You let me know when that is, but I do think that there are some things Trump is very good at,

374
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,400
and this is why it's very hard for me to believe that Ron DeSantis has what it takes

375
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,960
to actually fight Trump in a national primary. And one of those things is

376
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,800
Trump has a, even though he often says very strange things, that if you transcribe them,

377
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,200
you go, what language is that? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. In the moment,

378
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,400
the way he relates to adversaries on stage, et cetera, is very good in that he is very much

379
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
aware of how it is going to be seen by the audience. And so that's why a lot of times it's

380
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
more about, doesn't matter that a word salad came out of his mouth, how he immediately responded

381
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,280
and related to the person, very good. So I think that knowing how to be good when clips are shared

382
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,200
all the time, often out of context, is extraordinarily important. Knowing how to use social media,

383
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,840
which every election cycle, that means something different. But understanding how to use social

384
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:44,720
media, very important. Those things are absolutely so important. And whether you're able to do a

385
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,040
deep dive on the deficit, it's certainly useful, but I would say it's a bad thing. It's becoming

386
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,480
less important in terms of figuring out who we want to represent us. So just lingering on the AOC,

387
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,160
and then maybe let's throw in Bernie Sanders on that. Yeah. So where do you place yourself and

388
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,440
how do you do the layout of the land of Bernie Sanders, AOC, Joe Biden, and David Backman?

389
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,600
My instinct is, and I'm going to answer it, the thing that makes this tough is Bernie says,

390
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,120
he's a democratic socialist. He ran as a social democrat. He didn't run on anything that was

391
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,960
really socialism. So I'm going by their public facing platforms.

392
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,440
I've been listening to him for many, many years and all the way back to the Tom Hartman show.

393
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,280
And I think using the terms as you've been using them, he has, I don't think ever been a

394
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:49,440
democratic socialist. I haven't heard him speak about socialism. I think I've heard him speak about

395
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,080
social programs and the value of social programs throughout the history of the United States and

396
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,960
how they've been beneficial. My understanding is very similar to yours, although there may be

397
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,680
stuff from the 70s where he really was talking about bona fide. We've all did some shit in the

398
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,840
70s. Yeah, you and I even who weren't around, we were doing stuff in the 70s. I feel like I would

399
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,760
did, yeah. My sense would be Biden is like center left, and then I'm to the left of that,

400
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,160
but maybe just inside of where AOC and Bernie are very, very similar to Bernie. I mean, I identify

401
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,160
with a lot of Bernie's ideas, maybe their implementation I'm more flexible on. I'll give you

402
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,640
one example, Medicare for all. One way of trying to get healthcare to everybody, which Bernie's

403
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,520
very big on, is you take the current Medicare program, you just eliminate the age limit,

404
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,520
make it available to everybody, pay for it through taxation. Interesting. However, I'm open to other

405
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,080
models if they get everybody healthcare, that is good quality and affordable. Singapore has

406
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,080
an interesting model, Germany has an interesting model. I am more agnostic about how we do it

407
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:06,080
than just saying, let's expand Medicare. Whether that puts me to the right of Bernie, I don't know,

408
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,040
but I'm not like exactly right there on it has to be Medicare for all.

409
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,120
Yeah, that's more of a, that's more just flexibility versus dogmatism. So I don't

410
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,960
know if that puts you to the left or to the right. I don't either. What do you think about

411
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,720
the term manipulation or the corruption in the DNC that perhaps tipped the scales against Bernie

412
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,840
in the election? Do you think there was such a thing? 2016 or 2020?

413
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,760
Both, I would say. In different, the dynamics there were different with Hillary Clinton and

414
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,160
the pressure from Hillary Clinton as a candidate and so on. Yeah, what, I mean,

415
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,440
was there, why didn't Bernie win? I guess there's one way to ask.

416
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,000
Okay. I think there's a couple of things here. First, the DNC, I'm not a Democrat,

417
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,280
just your audience may not know, I'm just an independent. I mostly vote for candidates that

418
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,520
end up being Democrats in local elections. Often there's no party designation. So, okay,

419
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,360
I'm obviously on the left, I'm not denying that, but the Democratic Party as an institution is

420
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,480
never really been interesting to me. You're still a rebel that resists belonging to any institution.

421
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,680
Exactly right, exactly right. And whether it matters, I don't know. The DNC and the RNC

422
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,840
really are organizations that to some degree exist to justify their own existence because

423
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:35,840
if they were no longer necessary, they would go away. And so they have to assert their value

424
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,160
and their importance. They do this in a number of different ways, organizing the way that the

425
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,640
nominee is chosen, the convention, working with states on everything from redistricting to whatever

426
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,040
else the case may be, setting the order of primaries and having some involvement in how

427
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,320
that's all going to happen. And also coordinating behind the scenes, I guess they would describe it

428
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,000
as making sure our candidates don't get in each other's ways. We might see it and say,

429
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,600
they're picking the winner. There's nothing illegal about them being involved in picking

430
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,120
the winner, but we might say it's not in people's interests. I think the 2020 primary was really

431
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:23,280
interesting. Bernie supporter, myself, I started telling my audience after a couple primaries and

432
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,120
even before based on polling and different things, I see a real uphill battle here for Bernie.

433
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,320
And it's really important. People in my audience are not the average union worker in Michigan

434
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,120
who is mostly working and raising a family and then goes to vote on primary day and goes to vote

435
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:45,760
on election day. If you spend a lot of time on Reddit and Twitter, you're going to have an inflated

436
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,760
sense of Bernie's popularity within the Democratic Party. That was my sense. And to some degree,

437
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,480
we saw that in certain states. I don't have the exact primary order and results in front of me

438
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,880
or in my head, but the big turning point was South Carolina. South Carolina was when Joe Biden,

439
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,040
one and one handily, understood to be because of the larger African-American population in South

440
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,320
Carolina. And right around that exact same time, I actually don't remember now, whether it was the

441
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,960
day after or the day before, some of the smaller Democratic candidates, smaller in terms of support,

442
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:31,360
got out and said, I'm endorsing Joe Biden. And to some degree, of course, it was all organized

443
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:37,680
and timed to help Joe Biden. There's no doubt about that. This is what the DNC does. It's hard

444
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,880
for me to be mad at the DNC because this is sort of like, if we believe they were there to be

445
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,320
unbiased arbiters and to stay as much on the side as possible, it would make sense to be furious

446
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,000
that they've gone against their stated kind of mandate. But we know that the DNC

447
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,240
negotiates and is working behind the scenes and has a favorite, that favorite was Hillary in 2016,

448
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,480
2020. So I share the frustration about the power that the DNC has, but for people who were saying

449
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,040
they did something illegal or whatever else the case may be, that doesn't seem to be the case.

450
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,800
But this is part of why, I mean, I would love there not to be this duopoly of Republicans and

451
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,120
Democrats. And there's probably four major changes that have to happen in order to make that a

452
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:30,240
reality. But I share the frustration of folks while recognizing that Reddit was not accurately

453
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,440
representing Bernie's level of popularity. Still, I wish that the bias wasn't towards the,

454
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,600
what could be negatively termed a deep state, towards the bureaucracy, towards the momentum

455
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,120
of the past, which I think Joe Biden kind of represents, versus new ideas, which is funny

456
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,880
to say that Bernie Sanders somehow represents new ideas, because he's also an older gentleman.

457
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,240
Well, it's a frame, it's a lot of framing. And the other aspect to that is, on paper,

458
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,440
Joe Biden's platform was arguably the most progressive of any Democratic candidate who

459
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,920
won the nomination. Now, of course, there were people who challenged the nominations who were to

460
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,360
Joe Biden's left. A lot of this is perspective. And that's how you end up saying the guy who's

461
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,200
a couple of years older than Biden is actually the guy with the fresh perspective, which is

462
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,760
interesting because I don't disagree with you. Yeah. And then you also have to say the perspective

463
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,960
doesn't always align with the policies. You're right. The actual policies of Joe Biden are different

464
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,560
than maybe the perception of Joe Biden. Or what he ran on. I mean, just two examples I would give

465
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,120
are, during his campaign, he played up a little bit his interest in doing student loan forgiveness

466
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,480
and something on cannabis. I never bought it. I told my audience, I think he's saying this stuff

467
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,280
because this is the way the tide is kind of, the wind is blowing and he's being advised to

468
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,960
say this stuff. I don't think he's going to do very much on either of these things. He did actually

469
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,360
do some student loan stuff. But that would be two examples, I think. Okay, let's go to the

470
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,480
something you alluded to, which is the pros and cons of a particular candidate. Well, what do you,

471
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:19,040
as a critic of Trump, what do you are the pros, the strengths of Donald Trump,

472
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,800
and what do you are as big as weaknesses? The strengths of Trump. Let's see how I can frame

473
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,160
them in a way that is both accurate and accurately assesses my feeling about it.

474
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,920
It could be taken out of context most masterfully through the clipping process.

475
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:44,080
Yes, Trump's strengths are mostly superficial and in terms of presentation. Trump was able to,

476
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,880
I call it a grift, some on the right say he's just so good at relating to different types of people.

477
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,080
Trump, as a rich guy from New York City, was able to convince people that he spent most of his life

478
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:05,200
trying to be kept isolated from, that he had their best interests in mind, that he knew

479
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,880
why they weren't doing well in the 2016 economy, and that he had solutions that he was going to

480
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,280
bring forward. The truth is, he never really liked those people, and as soon as they weren't useful

481
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,960
to him for a brief period of time, that love affair with his followers stopped, and then

482
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,640
now it's back that he needs them again, he didn't really understand the causes of the problems that

483
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,040
those folks were experiencing, and his solutions were laughable. Jared was going to solve the

484
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,920
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in year one, he was going to replace Obamacare in 2017,

485
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,200
things that were never going anywhere, anywhere. But what he did really well was,

486
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,640
he put up a united front of, I know what is ailing you, I know how to fix it, and I know how to fix

487
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,400
it, I guess because he's a businessman, and he's been above the fray of politics for so long,

488
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,640
knowing how to use political donations to his advantage, he called that smart, etc.

489
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,240
I think that's his greatest strength. Why do you say that the Jared plan for Israel-Palestine

490
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,720
and the plan for healthcare to improve Obamacare, why do you say that's laughable?

491
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,600
Well, only someone, I would include the North Korea plan as well, which I'm glad to talk about,

492
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:27,840
only someone who doesn't know anything about the size and scope of these issues

493
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,400
could so arrogantly say that they could solve them in that way and on that timeframe. I'm all

494
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:42,480
for optimism and bringing a new face to things, absolutely, without a doubt, but a wall with

495
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,720
Mexico that Mexico will pay for at the end of my first term. I know there are people who believed

496
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,120
it because they would call into my show and say, I'm voting for Trump because of it, but it's hard

497
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,880
to believe that anybody serious would fall for that unless you were deliberately wanting to just

498
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,080
believe whatever was being fed to you or you just hadn't ever thought about these issues before.

499
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,120
The healthcare plan, in 2017, they proposed one would have led to 24 million or so people ending

500
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,280
up without healthcare, didn't go anywhere because it was so terrible, and then in August of 2020,

501
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,600
Trump said, in two weeks, I'm going to finally have my healthcare proposal. It's 2023. We still

502
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,320
never got it. With all of these things when you think them through, it was just sort of arrogance,

503
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:32,560
and I get the perspective of, I want optimism and I liked that optimism. It worked. I mean, fair.

504
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,200
A lot of people saw it and liked it. As someone who followed a lot of those issues closely,

505
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,800
they seemed, of course, like impossible promises.

506
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,000
What's a double-edged sword? It's a pushback a little bit. If you look at the things I have

507
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,960
a little bit more knowledge about, which is the space of artificial intelligence,

508
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,280
there's a company called DeepMind and it's a company called OpenAI

509
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,320
that we'll laugh at for a long time when they were talking about that they're going to solve

510
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:07,360
intelligence. Now, they've made, especially DeepMind, and now most recently OpenAI with GPT,

511
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,600
they've made progress that most of the community would not have imagined they'd be able to make.

512
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,840
Everything from AlphaGo beating the World Go champion, just all the different

513
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,160
steps in progress they can get into were surprised to everybody, and they are legitimately

514
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,920
fearlessly pursuing the task of solving intelligence. The other aspect, he gets a lot of

515
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,960
criticism now, but another example is Elon Musk. I can say a lot of things like SpaceX,

516
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,000
so commercial space flight, he was laughed at for a long time that that's possible.

517
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,000
Same thing with autopilot in Tesla, autonomous vehicles, his approach was

518
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,400
harshly criticized by all the experts and still criticized, to this day, deeply criticized,

519
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,480
and I as a person that I believe objectively can look at the progress of autopilot as a

520
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,600
semi-autonomous vehicle system has been incredibly surprising. The reason I mention that is sometimes

521
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:23,840
it feels like you need the guy or the gal who makes those preposterous, ambitious statements,

522
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:31,680
we're going to solve healthcare this year. And then there's experts like yourself,

523
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,600
that are looking, thinking, have you read anything about the history of Israel-Palestine,

524
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:44,480
is a good example of that. Do you know there's a history there? Do you realize how complicated,

525
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,440
how many people have tried, how many people have failed, how many millions of people hate each other

526
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:58,240
in this little place, in this land? Sometimes the expertise can really weigh you down,

527
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,800
so to push back, sometimes you have to have the almost be naive and stupid and just rush in

528
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,840
with an optimism in order to actually make some progress.

529
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:13,520
I agree with you 100%. I think it's interesting that all of the examples you gave of successes

530
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,320
are from the technology space. Not politics yet.

531
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,200
Not from politics, which I mean, listen, I would love to be able to make headway on some of these

532
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,840
issues more quickly without a doubt. I do think at some point though, when it comes down to voting

533
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,960
and saying one of these people is going to be ostensibly in charge for four years through all

534
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,920
of the departments and secretaries and choices that they make, we do want to apply some level of

535
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,760
realism with the understanding that your examples are from the tech space and they're good examples.

536
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,000
There's no question about it. One thing I'll add to this, I recently read Bradley

537
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,760
Hope's new book about North Korea and it's really about an activist who doesn't even really matter,

538
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,000
but in the background of the book, it's written, much of what is written about happens during the

539
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,800
Trump era and when Trump did the first and then the second, I guess you'd call them summits with

540
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:12,720
Kim Jong-un. It actually did seem like to some degree, Trump's, we're going to handle this like

541
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:20,640
I do a business deal approach to Kim Jong-un. In some sense, it actually was logical because of

542
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,520
Kim Jong-un and the way that it was so ego-driven and they both as sort of authoritarian strongmen

543
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,000
types to different degrees wanted that. There was actually a kernel where I actually thought,

544
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,280
as I read it, Trump's initial idea wasn't crazy. The problem was he knew nothing about the backstory

545
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,400
of the relationship. He fell for all sorts of lies from Kim Jong-un and he made offers that

546
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,720
didn't make any sense to me. It fell apart. Fine. But that's an example where I think Trump's

547
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,640
personality was not actually at its base, the problem when it came to North Korea.

548
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,640
Well, there's other things of this nature that could go in, or some people argue,

549
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,920
goes into the strengths and pros of Donald Trump. For China, for example, terrorist on China.

550
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,800
Can you make the case that there's some positive outcomes of the way Donald Trump

551
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,200
acted with China? It's really tough. And I'll give you a couple reasons why.

552
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:19,600
Okay, then also cons. It's tough to make. So the China thing is really, so just very recently to

553
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,320
when we're recording this, Trump was on Fox News interviewed by a guy named Mark Levin.

554
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,720
And Trump proposed a new, I call it a conspiracy theory, maybe it will strike you as something

555
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:37,120
different about China, COVID and tariffs. And Trump's suggestion was that the tariffs

556
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:44,080
cost China so much money, China sent the US so much money in tariffs that they released COVID as

557
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:50,640
punishment. Now there's a couple problems with that. One, American companies pay the tariffs.

558
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,440
Trump still doesn't seem to know this. Trump seems to believe that when he puts a tariff on Chinese

559
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:04,320
imports, someone in China is cutting a check to the United States. American companies buy the

560
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,800
stuff from China, and then American companies cut a check to the United States for the tariff.

561
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,160
Trump doesn't seem to get that. But it still has a sting to the Chinese economy.

562
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,280
You can make the argument that if there is a suitable alternative domestically or from a

563
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,360
different country, that it will reduce imports, but it didn't happen. And we actually have reports

564
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:33,360
now that the tariffs on China cost about a quarter million American jobs. The other problem with

565
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:44,320
that idea is China created and released a virus in order to hurt you. But as of today, 5.7 of the

566
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:50,080
6.8 million deaths were in other countries. It's a very indirect way. You're mostly killing people

567
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:57,200
in other countries to hurt Trump. This is the sort of thing where when I think about how Trump

568
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,840
dealt with China, it's very scary. Because given another four years, who knows what he might do

569
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:11,280
if he still doesn't understand how tariffs work? Geopolitics operates in complicated ways with

570
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,080
carrots and sticks. Henry Kissinger has written quite a lot about this. In some sense, the positive

571
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:25,440
aspect here that Donald Trump is willing to take big risks in the game of geopolitics

572
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:33,120
with this giant superpower that is China. And a lot of others are too afraid, too afraid to call

573
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:41,280
them out, to come to the table and criticize. I certainly think that's an argument that can be

574
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:48,800
made. My question would be, what tangible positive outcomes did it lead to? And it's tough to identify

575
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,400
any. But I think it's a great thing. I mean, listen, one of the things you're kind of getting at,

576
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:01,200
maybe indirectly, is that there's been this sense that politics has been done very similarly for a

577
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,320
long time. And even between Democrats and Republicans, still, even with some policy

578
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:12,160
differences, there's still the kind of feeling that it's disconnected folks in DC mostly dealing

579
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,280
with issues that don't directly affect. I get that. I'm with you on that. I think the question

580
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,920
is to whether Trump's bluster was positive rather than extraordinarily humiliating in many ways.

581
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,720
I just come down on it was an absolute and total humiliation. But I understand that

582
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,080
you can recognize Trump doesn't know a lot of stuff, but his attitude was refreshing in some way.

583
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,000
That's a reasonable position for someone to take. I disagree with it, but I understand it.

584
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
But it's trying and feeling better than not trying.

585
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,520
This goes well beyond politics. Wayne Gretzky is waiting about this. Michael Jordan is waiting about

586
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,880
this. Is it better to have tried and failed than never? Is it better to have loved and lost

587
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,920
than never to have loved? I don't know. I mean, listen, we live through four years of Trump.

588
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,640
We know what that four-year term was like, and it's very hard for me to say that the things

589
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,160
he tried were overwhelmingly reasonable. But I get the point you're trying to make,

590
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,760
and I appreciate it. If we don't do any of it, then where do we end up? Sure. We know where we

591
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,080
ended up with Trump, and it was pretty embarrassing. Okay, let's linger on some more strengths.

592
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,400
We didn't start any new wars. Is there something to that?

593
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,960
Yeah, it's interesting. There's a few different approaches to dealing with that.

594
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:38,160
First, it's really important to remember that the counterpoint to that from the folks who like to

595
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,480
say that was that Hillary Clinton was going to start three wars. Sometimes they say four wars.

596
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:49,360
Sometimes they say five wars. Okay. The geopolitical situation during the four years that Trump was

597
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:55,680
in office, I don't know that they obviously lent themselves to wars that Trump just barely was able

598
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,960
to keep us out of. I think the Russia thing is interesting because now it's very popular to go

599
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:07,680
back and say, the reason Putin didn't do the Ukraine thing when Trump and to somehow give

600
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,880
Trump credit for that. There's a counterpoint to it, which is Putin under Trump, particularly if

601
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,480
Trump got four more years, would have been able to maybe consolidate power in other ways because

602
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,160
of his relationship with Trump. I'm not coming down on one side or the other. It's not my area

603
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,760
of expertise, but it's not the open shut slam dunk that Trump likes to say it is. Putin didn't

604
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,200
invade because he knew I would crush him. Okay. It's not obvious to me that there were imminently

605
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:45,120
wars that would have started during that time. That being said, for all the criticism of Obama

606
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:51,200
during Crimea, Trump seemed to just forget about that after all the criticism and say,

607
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,960
I'm not actually going to do anything about that. There are foreign policy criticisms that could be

608
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:03,120
made, but it is true. No new wars were started under Trump. I like that. I don't like wars.

609
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:08,240
What do you think about his handling of COVID? Can you say what are the pros and cons of his

610
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,760
handling of COVID? The con for him is he'd be president right now if he had handled it differently.

611
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,480
I think it's abundantly clear. Early on, and there's now a lot of really good reporting about

612
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,000
the conversations he was having with Jared Kushner and others. He became convinced either because

613
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,280
of things he was being told or because he decided this is the way it's going to be.

614
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,880
This is going to go away. Fine. It's in China. Okay. It's in China and Italy. Okay. We have 15

615
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,800
cases, but it'll soon be zero. We'll be opened by Easter of 2020. None of it happened.

616
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,480
If he had handled it in the following way, and I've said this to Rogan and I've said this to

617
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,080
Patrick Bet-David, and they tend to all see my side of this. If Trump had said, listen,

618
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,120
we don't know how bad this is going to be, but I care too much about the American people to

619
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:07,280
take a shot. It's not going to be two weeks. It's going to be a little bit, but I need your help.

620
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,880
We're going to bring everybody together. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican.

621
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,120
We're going to have MAGA masks, and you could have kept 50 cents on the dollar to pay off,

622
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:22,240
store me or whoever. But it would have been, I think he wins reelection because the perception

623
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:28,800
was, and reality is a version of that, the perception was that he was way too cavalier

624
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:36,720
about it early on. People died who didn't need to die. I think that it was arguably

625
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,880
the one area where he could have all but guaranteed that he was going to get himself

626
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,520
reelected. Well, to push back on that, I mean, because you mentioned sort of masks and lockdowns

627
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,080
kind of a solution to COVID. I didn't mention lockdowns, but I'm glad to talk about policy.

628
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:59,200
There's several solutions to a pandemic, broadly speaking, and one of them is vaccine,

629
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:07,120
and so you didn't mention that. He'd fast-tracked the development. His administration fast-tracked

630
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:12,320
the development of the vaccine, which, surprising, he didn't really take much credit for.

631
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,360
I think he did. I think he tried. There's a couple, there's a lot there.

632
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:23,200
Well, to me, it seems like you could make the case with the Trump hand gestures that

633
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,040
his decisions for fast-tracking the development of the vaccine saved tens of millions of lives.

634
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,360
You could, in the Trumpian way, make that case.

635
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,080
So a couple different things. I know you don't necessarily follow Trump's rallies as closely

636
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:46,320
as I do, and I'm jealous of you for that, but he did tout the vaccine stuff hugely for a while

637
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:54,000
until his audience turned against him, and then he had to draw this line where he was going,

638
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,920
I made the vaccines, which none of you have to take, by the way,

639
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,840
freedom. You don't have to take them, but it's fantastic, and nobody else could have done it,

640
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,920
but don't worry, nobody's going to make you take the vaccine. And he actually got booed at a couple

641
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,040
of his own rallies when talking about the vaccines. But let's back up a little bit.

642
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,920
Fast-tracking. My understanding of what he did is he did what any president in his situation would

643
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,400
do and what many world leaders elsewhere did as well, which is he agreed to pre-purchase supply

644
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,240
of vaccine in order to provide money to pharmaceutical companies to scale up the manufacturing,

645
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:34,080
which is absolutely fine. But he wants, one of the stories he tells is it usually takes

646
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:41,680
12 years to develop a vaccine. We did it in nine months, thanks to me. Decades of mRNA technology

647
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:48,320
being developed created the platform in which you can make a particular vaccine in nine months,

648
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,360
didn't have anything to do with Trump. He did pre-fund and say, we will buy huge supply,

649
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,240
and that provided liquidity to the pharmaceutical companies. But he also delegated control to

650
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:05,760
to people, to experts that enable that kind of fast-tracking of vaccines.

651
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,400
He was very eager for the FDA to approve it because he saw that there would be a political

652
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,400
benefit. And he didn't get in the way, I guess. He didn't get in the way. Fair. I think now we're

653
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,640
on the same page. He did not get in the way of vaccines being developed, which is good.

654
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,280
Presidents and bureaucracies have a way of getting in the way.

655
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,400
I don't disagree with that. I'm not aware of really any governments that got in the way.

656
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,680
I mean, it seemed given the global situation, everybody, European countries were pre-purchasing

657
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:39,920
vaccine. African countries were who were going to be later to receive vaccines, were partnering

658
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,560
with the European countries that had pre-purchased. But the most interesting thing about all of this

659
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:50,000
is Trump did play up the vaccines for a long time until his crowd didn't want to hear about it

660
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,040
anymore, which was crazy. It was sort of like he became a victim of the monster he created,

661
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,400
to some degree. One of the effects of all this that makes me truly sad is this division over

662
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,640
the vaccines has created distrust in science. And also what makes me sad is the scientific

663
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,640
leaders, Anthony Fauci, being one of the representatives of that community,

664
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:19,600
I would say completely dropped the ball. They spoke with arrogance.

665
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:26,240
They spoke down to people. They spoke in a way that a great scientist does not speak,

666
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:33,760
which is they spoke with certainty, without humility. They have all the wisdom and all

667
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,000
of us are too dumb to understand it, but they're going to be the parent that tells us exactly

668
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,600
what to do versus speaking to the immensity of the problem, the deep core of the problem,

669
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:50,800
being the uncertainty. We don't know what to do. The terrifying thing about the pandemic,

670
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,200
we don't know anything about it as it's happening. And so you have to make decisions. You have to

671
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:02,480
take risks about, well, maybe you have to overreact in order to protect the populace. But it's in the

672
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:09,760
face of uncertainty. They have to do that, not empowered by science somehow. And the deep

673
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:19,120
expertise that somebody like Anthony Fauci claims to have. I'm really troubled by the

674
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,600
distrust in science that resulted from that. And you have to blame the leaders to the degree.

675
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,800
Leaders take responsibility. And I think Anthony Fauci was the scientific leader behind

676
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:36,560
the American response to the pandemic. And I think he failed as a scientist, as a representative

677
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:45,120
of science. I don't know if interested is the right word, but the Fauci review

678
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,720
is less interesting to me in terms of what comes next than the first part you mentioned,

679
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,040
which is the distrust in science. And sometimes I'll get voicemails or emails from people in my

680
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:04,000
audience who say that I have had to backpedal on certain things related to this. And one of the

681
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,160
things I tried to do from the beginning was not speak in certain terms when we really didn't

682
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,360
have complete information. So there was this period where hydroxychloroquine was first sort

683
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:22,720
of mentioned as a possible treatment, prophylactic or proactive treatment for COVID or active treatment

684
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,600
for COVID, along with a bunch of other stuff. There was ivermectin, there was vitamin D,

685
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:34,960
there were all sorts of different things. And I tried to be careful to say, right now, we don't

686
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,800
have rigorous science that tells us that some of these things work. It doesn't mean that won't come

687
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,960
in the future, at which point, if there was something as cheap as hydroxychloroquine that

688
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:52,000
treated COVID effectively, unbelievable, fantastic. It's not, there's no way it ever will be determined.

689
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,800
We don't have that information right now. So it's not super wise right now to go and start

690
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:02,640
taking this stuff. We eventually learned, like with vitamin D, having an appropriate vitamin D

691
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,680
level does seem to be, based on what I most recently read, generally protective and a good

692
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:14,240
thing when it comes to infections of different, great. Okay, so that one we figured out.

693
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:21,200
One of the really difficult things is that the quote truth about the vaccines did change. And

694
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,920
the original, again, this is all, I don't pretend to be an expert, but just someone who's synthesizing

695
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:34,960
the medical data and writing about it. Originally, the first vaccine related to the wild type strain

696
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,160
did seem to be very effective, not only at preventing death and serious illness,

697
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,120
but also transmission. There were people then saying it doesn't prevent transmission.

698
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,200
Over time, as the variants came forward, the vaccine became less effective at that. At that

699
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,440
point, I started telling my audience something different because as far as I was concerned,

700
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,320
the reality on the ground had changed. In my mind, that's how science works. It's not backpedaling.

701
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,800
It's we're adjusting our beliefs to what is taking place in the real world.

702
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:13,120
Well, to be fair, the scientists, many of whom are my friends, virologists and biologists,

703
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:17,360
they have way more humility than people like Anthony Fauci who was speaking about this,

704
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,840
or the CEO of Pfizer who was speaking about this. This is the fundamental problem here,

705
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:30,480
is the way science works is there's usually a lot more humility and a lot more transparency about

706
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:38,000
what we know and what we don't know. And people like Anthony Fauci thought it would be beneficial

707
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,920
for the world if he speaks with more certainty. But because of the political division that formed

708
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,920
around that, that certainty resulted and became completely counterproductive, that people didn't

709
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,840
trust anything about the vaccine, didn't trust any institutions that contained the experts that

710
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,080
actually knew what they were doing, and basically didn't trust anything that was coming out of the

711
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:06,320
mouths of scientists, some large percentage of the population. So that made you completely

712
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:14,160
ineffective at scale as a society trying to respond to a terrible pandemic. And that's where I

713
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:20,800
put a lot of blame on leaders. So political leaders and scientific leaders are the ones that

714
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:27,280
should inspire us to all get together and respond. That should be the case for the pandemic.

715
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,560
That should be the case in the time of war, all this kind of stuff.

716
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,840
I generally agree with you. And for me, it's really about shared blame. And there were a lot

717
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,320
of different reasons why that the early communication wasn't good. Part of it was,

718
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:47,840
I mean, for me, I prefer accuracy rather than overconfidence. I would prefer, listen, we don't

719
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,840
really know right now whether masks do X or Y. What we do know is the supply is really limited

720
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,320
of this type of mask. We're going to try to keep them for the frontline workers. I love that.

721
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,480
That's the way I want to be communicated to. A call was made to do it differently,

722
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:07,440
which was to say the masks don't actually help. But the real reason is they want to keep them

723
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,400
for healthcare workers. And then later, the masks are what's going to solve. I'm with you 100%.

724
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,880
I think the other layer to it is you can't ignore the political situation at the time.

725
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,880
If Trump had one reelection and the vaccine distribution had taken place while Trump was

726
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,640
president rather than Biden, my belief is that the same number of Democrats would have gotten

727
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,680
vaccinated, but way more Republicans would have as well because they were following not science

728
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:40,480
but political leaders. And when it was Biden in DC instead of Trump, a lot of those people said,

729
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:45,360
I don't trust the vaccine. But wait, it's Trump's vaccine, I thought. Yeah, but something about the

730
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:49,840
way Biden's distributing it. So I do think you can't ignore that political layer. I agree with

731
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:55,360
you the communication was a disaster. Let me ask you about Joe Biden. What are the strengths

732
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,880
and weaknesses of Joe Biden? Weaknesses, I think, are some of the things you've identified.

733
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:11,120
He is not seen as high energy. He is not the same Joe Biden that debated Paul Ryan in 2012

734
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:20,640
and ran circles around him in just an incredible debate performance. He is not inspiring in the way

735
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,400
that someone like a Barack Obama was to people coming up and starting to get interested in

736
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:33,680
politics. I think a lot of those are fair criticisms. I think on policy, he's not interested in a lot

737
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:39,840
of the things that younger voters are interested in. I mentioned cannabis reform. I mentioned

738
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:48,320
student loans. So I think that that's a deficit for Biden. I think the upside to Biden is when it

739
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:55,120
comes to foreign policy, diplomacy, high-level negotiations, knowing how to engage with allies

740
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:00,880
in a productive way, it's tough to find someone with more experience than Biden. I know that there

741
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,680
are counterpoints to what I'm saying, and those include, that was the old Biden, the new Biden

742
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:10,400
doesn't have it. That includes, that's just a sign of rot because he's been around for so long.

743
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,440
Nobody should be around that long in politics. Perfectly reasonable criticisms to talk about.

744
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:22,800
But I do see that as one of his strengths. And he also is good at knowing when he can work with

745
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:30,240
Republicans and when he can't and not wasting more time than is sort of expected for posturing

746
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:35,760
reasons. And I think that that's a good thing. Do you think he's actually there? So in day-to-day

747
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:42,320
operational government, given his cognitive capabilities, do you think he is an active

748
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,560
and practicing executive? I don't know that I can say that it's because of what may be going on

749
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:56,640
cognitively, but my sense from the people I talk to is that he's very much involved in the highest

750
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:04,160
level geopolitical and big domestic economic stuff, but that a lot of the smaller issues that

751
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:09,200
presidents might or might not be in sort of plugged into, that he's not plugged into the

752
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,960
details of a lot of the lower level stuff. I mean, you could probably apply the same exact

753
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,000
criticism even more so towards the Donald Trump administration in terms of being a practicing

754
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,920
active executive who's paying attention. Like for example, like Vladimir Putin is somebody

755
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,640
who loves the role of the executive, has a huge amount of meetings, has constantly tracking

756
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,560
information about agriculture and all the different subsystems of government. Stalin,

757
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,480
funny enough, was also extremely good at this. So certain people just love the job of being an

758
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:53,520
executive. And I'm not sure if Donald Trump did and I'm not sure if Joe Biden in his current

759
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,200
state has the cognitive capability to. That's a good question. Kim Jong-un's another one,

760
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:06,720
by the way. There's videos of him examining a factory where they make plates and making very

761
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,560
specific comments about how the plates should be made. I think that in that case, there's a lot

762
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:16,560
of propaganda value to it. With Trump, I think you're probably right. He did get involved in

763
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,440
the minutiae of things. I mean, once he pulled out a weather map and with a Sharpie drew a

764
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,800
different hurricane path that was more politically convenient to him. That's pretty micro, saying

765
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,520
the weather channel is wrong. I see what you did there. Okay. So that's a micro. He went to

766
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,400
Puerto Rico and he gave out paper towels after a hurricane. Now he was shooting them like free

767
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,920
throws, which didn't look very good. So he will get involved in the micro when it's advantageous.

768
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,760
You know what I mean? But I do agree with you that he wants to just kind of make it so. Build

769
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,080
the wall. I don't know. Just build it. Figure it out. Get it done. Quick pause. Bath and break?

770
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:56,320
Sure. You're hilarious. And just for the sake of completeness, I should mention,

771
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:02,000
the subreddit wouldbiden has done. There's also what Trump has done, but it's not as active.

772
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,520
And it has like this master list of all the accomplishments. I recommend people look at it

773
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:14,400
because there's a kind of rigorous and interesting with links list of all the things he's done.

774
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:21,520
Just list some of them restored daily press briefings, cancel the Keystone pipeline, reverse

775
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,240
Trump's Muslim ban, required masks on federal property, rejoins the Paris climate agreement,

776
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:31,680
extends student loan payment freeze, extend eviction freeze, historic stimulus bill,

777
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:36,480
as you mentioned, ends funding for border wall, and so on and so forth DACA,

778
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,320
border strengthening of DACA, rejoins the World Health Organization. And the timing of this,

779
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:48,240
of course, is important. Yeah, several historic stimulus bills, which of course,

780
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,920
you could criticize or support, raise the minimum wage for federal contractors and federal employees

781
01:14:53,920 --> 01:15:02,560
for $15. There's a lot. There's a lot. It makes you realize with both Trump and Biden that there's

782
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:09,920
a bunch of small details that matter, like that matter on people's lives, like actual little

783
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:17,040
policies. Trump did a lot of stuff as far as I heard for the military, like not big stuff,

784
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:22,240
but small stuff. Yeah, I'd be curious what you're thinking of. I mean, I know one of the

785
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,520
big things under Trump was we're going to get trans people out of the military.

786
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,480
That's not what I was referring to. You weren't referring to that. Trump's hilarious with these

787
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,640
stories that he tells, and one of the stories, and you get to know them if you follow him at all,

788
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:41,760
he tells the story, you know, when I came into office, the generals came to me and they said,

789
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,640
sir, the cupboards are bare. We have no bullets. And so I rebuilt the military. You know, the

790
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,280
cupboards were bare when Obama left it and it was just terrible, but I rebuilt it and the generals,

791
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,960
I've got the best generals, they said, sir, it's incredible what you were able to do. You look

792
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,040
into it and it's like, yeah, that's not really true. Like it is true that there are armaments that

793
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,280
just like on a schedule do get replaced and that's part of the military industrial complex, but

794
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:08,480
there's nothing like special Trump really did. But these stories become, they take on like a life

795
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,560
of their own. And it's interesting to sometimes try to dig down and figure out like, was there any

796
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,200
policy connected to that? Or is that just a story? Do you think it's possible to have a good conversation

797
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:23,520
with each of them? Donald Trump and Joe Biden in a podcast context or in a debate context?

798
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,240
Absolutely. Yeah. You're saying like, could I with either of them? Oh, 100%.

799
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:33,200
Joe Biden too? Sure. Yeah. But can you dig into that a little more?

800
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,320
Well, I mean, I don't know what, I think there's maybe something implicit in your question,

801
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,800
but that's deeper about the nature of politics and politicians. Yes.

802
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:48,800
I think with either of them, I mean, the political differences wouldn't be an impediment to having

803
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:55,520
a good conversation with either of them. I think one of the things that's really tough in my experience

804
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:01,680
when talking to elected officials is they could be super interesting about 100 different topics,

805
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:09,120
but handlers decide or try to get you to talk about something you don't really care about and

806
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:14,720
something really narrow, which doesn't bring out your best nor their best. And that's a frustration.

807
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,640
But I think that given an unstructured three-hour conversation, I think it would be interesting

808
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:24,400
to talk to both. I mean, listen, with Biden, aside from his view on cannabis or whatever,

809
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:31,520
his background and the incredible unimaginable family tragedy that he had in his first wife

810
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:39,120
and multiple kids dying. I mean, it's just incredible. And with Trump, I think also you

811
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:42,720
could have an interesting conversation. Yeah, those are the human beings with a life story.

812
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,400
And they're some of the most successful humans who have ever lived to have

813
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,880
rose to this highest office in interesting complex ways. Yes.

814
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,680
I mean, one of the things I'm troubled by maybe you can speak to is why we're so negative

815
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:07,440
towards presidential candidates and presidents. Why? It's just they go through this shit storm,

816
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:13,520
no matter who they are. Yeah. They're like hated. Like all the conspiracy theories and just

817
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:20,560
the dynamics of how we talk about them is vicious. If you just look at reply,

818
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:28,160
Steven Barack Obama on Twitter, it's like, what is going on here? Why? Because we look at other

819
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:34,320
leaders and other spaces and we're generally positive about it. Yeah, there's a couple different

820
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,320
things. There's this dynamic, which is really unfortunate, which is you ask people, do you

821
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:46,000
approve of the job a particular president is doing? And very often, if at any point, while they were

822
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,920
in office, they did something you don't like, people will say, I don't approve. And so by its

823
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,920
nature, what that means is just like the longer you're in office, the lower your approval ratings

824
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:59,600
going to be. And very often, that's the way it works. I mean, there's major events like 9-11,

825
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,560
Spike George W. Bush's approval to an incredible level, then it came back down with the Iraq War.

826
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,440
But there's this unfortunate thing that when people are just asked,

827
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,040
you think Biden's doing a good job? If four months ago, Biden did something on healthcare

828
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,280
that somebody didn't like, even if you like most of it, a lot of people from that point forward

829
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:21,200
will say, I don't approve. They might still vote for them because they like him better than the

830
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:26,080
alternative or whatever. It's just the dynamic of politics. And I agree, it's very...

831
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,760
Does it have to be that way? Do you think?

832
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,640
I don't think it has to be that way. But to unwind it, so many things would have to change.

833
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:39,840
I think our election system is part of why politics is the way it is, where you have two choices,

834
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,880
and it's first past the post. And we have this electoral college, so that depending on which

835
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,280
state you vote in, the kind of meaning and significance of your vote is different. If you

836
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:54,640
vote in Montana, it's the Republican candidate, it's going to win, and that changes the dynamics.

837
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:01,280
I think that's part of it. I think that at a personal level, I've experienced this in my life

838
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:07,360
a lot. We've become, and by we, I mean people in the United States to some degree who talk

839
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,360
about this stuff, we've become uncomfortable when there is disagreement, and it bleeds over into,

840
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,760
now we can't have a normal interpersonal relationship anymore. I'm from Argentina,

841
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:24,160
and in Argentina, it's really common, even in my family. There are incredibly heated political

842
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,880
debates at the start, the middle, the end of some kind of gathering. But then everybody just goes

843
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:36,080
back to like, okay, we disagree on some things, but that's okay. And we can now go and finish

844
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,040
cooking the beef or whatever it is that we're doing. And I experienced this even with people who

845
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:46,320
come up to me on the street, and they go, just earlier today, a guy came up to me and he said,

846
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:52,560
RFK all the way, baby, talking about Bobby Kennedy Jr. And I just kind of, I said, oh,

847
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,840
all right, let's see what happens. And then there was another moment where the guy ended

848
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,520
up standing next to me for maybe longer than he thought, and I could tell this guy's getting so

849
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,280
awkward because it was an utterance he thought that would just be on the fly and he'd be gone.

850
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:09,760
But now we're standing next to each other waiting for our sandwiches. It's like no big deal. It's

851
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,280
just, oh, okay, you like Bobby Kennedy Jr. I don't plan to vote for it. It's fine. And that's like

852
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,720
a socio-cultural thing. I think there's lots of other countries. I've spent time in Italy. I have

853
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:25,040
relatives in Israel where like shouting at each other is sort of like normal. And then you just

854
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,680
go back and finish them. It sounds like shouting. I'm sort of exaggerating, but very animated,

855
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:34,480
what seemed like big disagreements. And then everybody's cool. I wish it were more normal.

856
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:40,880
So maybe the mechanism of going from shouting to being cool again needs to improve. Because maybe

857
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,760
we can't solve the shouting at each other. Maybe not. So maybe we need to somehow figure out the

858
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,960
de-escalation, like making up. I've had a few recent fights with friends like that.

859
01:21:51,600 --> 01:22:03,920
For politics. No. But political style, emotionally drenched stuff. And it was interesting to go

860
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,960
through that full process and then make up at the end, but it was a process. And it was a process

861
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:16,000
that required being in person and talking through it. And it was stressful, the whole thing. And

862
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,200
maybe because most of our interactions are online, we don't get a chance to do that in person,

863
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:26,160
making up again. I don't know, but do you think it's a feature or a bug of the system that we're

864
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:33,920
so, we just hate the powerful? You mentioned the online part. You mentioned it earlier perfectly,

865
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:41,520
which is you take contentious political issues. You create a platform that rewards

866
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:47,760
controversy and disagreement and limits the number of characters you can use to express yourself.

867
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,640
You kind of throw it into a baking dish and mix the entire thing up. It's complete and total chaos.

868
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,200
And one of the things that I've talked before about all the angry emails and threats and stuff

869
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,480
that I get, I'm acutely aware that if I had in person conversations with most of these people,

870
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,840
the conversations would basically be like, oh, we have different views about how to solve some

871
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:16,000
of the problems we're facing. We probably agree about what the problem is. And we probably share

872
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,600
many values. But on these particular four issues, we may have very different views. But that's okay.

873
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:30,000
Online, that's not the case. And it leads to the mess that we get ourselves in. But I think

874
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,840
that it's a feature of a lot of the systems that are being used to disseminate information.

875
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:42,800
Again, let me linger on that. Do you regret some of the mockery and the snark you use on Twitter

876
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,080
and even in your show that feeds that division?

877
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:55,840
I don't regret it in the sense that it's a calculated part or tool that I use in addition to

878
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:01,120
figuring out how to simplify complicated concepts and choosing stories that I think are

879
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:08,480
underrepresented. It's all part of the package of what I'm doing. I recognize that my show is not

880
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:17,520
the audio visual version of a peer reviewed, randomized controlled trial about views on abortion

881
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,840
or whatever the case. I'm very much aware of that. But I don't regret including it as a tool

882
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,840
that I've used to build the community in some total that I've built over the last more than

883
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:35,040
10 years. I guess I could ask about the different trajectories you think your show might take. So

884
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,400
the dynamic you had with Donald Trump Jr. and maybe Candice Owens is the more appropriate

885
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:47,440
comparison. Are you okay having that dance for the next few years between you and Candice Owens

886
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:54,640
and just the mockery, the division that's a part of that process and taking part in that?

887
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:06,800
I'm fine with it in the sense of personally, I tolerate it well until it crosses the line

888
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:14,480
and people pull my family in. If we set the family stuff aside, just in the digital space,

889
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:19,440
you're okay with that. Now the truth is Candice Owens has had me blocked for years up until

890
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,960
this incident. She unblocked me. She unblocked me just to tweet about what I tweeted about.

891
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,440
I don't know the backstory of that genuinely. I have no idea. So I don't have a sense that

892
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,160
she's super interested in engaging with me on that. But all of these people, I mean, Candice

893
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,560
Owens is welcome on my show anytime. Don Jr. is welcome on my show anytime. It's been a decade

894
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:44,880
since I had Ben Shapiro on. He's welcome anytime. I'm glad to have these conversations and I think

895
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:50,480
it's an important thing. And also, I wish that everybody was willing to have the conversations

896
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,800
in good faith rather than as performance. It's not even really performance art,

897
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,680
rather than being simply performative for an audience that you have.

898
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:04,640
In terms of your motivations, do you worry about the effects of something you spoke about offline

899
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:12,560
or the YouTube algorithm? Are you driven by the number of views your videos get?

900
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:18,800
Or are you driven by something else? So in my world, I guess I would say,

901
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:27,520
the number of views that any platform generates is a metric that I can choose how to interpret.

902
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:32,160
I can choose to interpret it as I've created content that's interesting to people

903
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:37,520
or I've created content that's really angering people and that's why they're showing up. They

904
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,360
don't actually like it. It's because they're angry or whatever else the case may be. But

905
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,000
it is true that there are algorithmic changes that can take place. Something happened in early

906
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,200
January that affected us on YouTube or there are periods on TikTok where you can tell we're

907
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:56,560
doing all the same things, something has happened and then you never usually figure out what it is.

908
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:02,560
So for me, it's sort of just like a general tool to see what is the level of interest in what I'm

909
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,600
doing and are the numbers so out of whack with what I would expect that I should look into whether

910
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,520
something deeper is happening. Has there been some change to an algorithm or whatever the case

911
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:18,480
may be? I had a debate once with someone who accused me of using clickbait to generate views

912
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,800
and we had a really interesting conversation where I said, tell me really what you mean by that.

913
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:29,680
Is your argument that I'm using titles that don't actually represent what's in the video?

914
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,640
No, what's in the title is in the video. I go, okay, so it's not that the title is dishonest.

915
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:39,840
Are you saying I'm deliberately picking titles that will garner a larger audience?

916
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,800
And they said, yeah, that's kind of what I mean. And I said,

917
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,480
isn't that kind of what we're all doing? The alternative would be choosing titles

918
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:50,480
to generate a smaller audience, which seems like a real kind of waste of time. So

919
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,760
I'm trying to navigate and play the game in a way that's comfortable,

920
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,160
but use the metrics more as a tool than as something to obsess over.

921
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:07,280
Nevertheless, the metrics are what they are and that they are able to affect your psyche.

922
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,080
It's very difficult, which is why I have a Chrome extension that hides all the views and all that

923
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:21,680
on YouTube for me. It's difficult not to let it affect how you think about ideas.

924
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:27,280
So maybe your extensive exploration of a particular topic like healthcare

925
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:32,400
generated very few views. It's difficult for you to still care about healthcare.

926
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:39,440
There's some aspect of the human mind that starts being affected by those views. And I think that's

927
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:47,040
a really dangerous thing. Mostly it's probably beneficial because it probably makes you a better

928
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:53,200
presenter. If you do care about a topic a lot, you become more charismatic, more you learn

929
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:59,440
sort of in Jimmy, Mr. Beast, the way how to present the ideas better. But it also can affect

930
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,520
which topics you choose to cover, what you choose to think about those topics,

931
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:09,360
audience capture those topics. And that's a really scary effect. I'm really worried about my own

932
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:16,800
mind in that. So I run from that aggressively. One of the things that I include in my overall

933
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:23,040
approaches, I don't think about any one clip. I think about an entire show or a week of shows

934
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:30,240
or a month of shows. And so it's less about does anyone clip do well. My view going in is

935
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,880
I'm going to do stuff that won't do that well, but I think it's really important to do. And I

936
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,400
want to make it part of my show. And so when I did a clip with 10 ideas for reducing gun violence,

937
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,720
I know that that's not going to get 500,000 or a million views. I know it's just not going to.

938
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:52,160
And the first day it'll get 12,000 and I'll go, I don't care. That's fine. There's a group of people

939
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:56,800
in my audience that values this stuff. And I want to keep doing this stuff. I'll end up surprised

940
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:03,600
sometime. And two weeks later has 150,000 views because it started being shared. Great. But I

941
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:10,320
don't go into it thinking these all need to be home runs by that metric. I always go in saying I

942
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:14,880
want to put out a diversity of content, including stuff that is less titillating and salacious,

943
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:21,200
but is important to do. It's more researched, etc. And so that's the way I try to resist exactly

944
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:25,280
what you're talking about. And I think you have to probably know yourself. For me, metrics,

945
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:29,840
I just like numbers too much. And for me, metrics do affect me. That's just why I don't pay attention

946
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:36,960
at all. I would love to hire somebody in the team who cares because we currently have folks who

947
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:43,360
just all of us just don't care because he probably is good to care enough to kind of just do good

948
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:49,280
thumbnails and this kind of stuff to pay attention. But to me personally, I just find inner peace and

949
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:56,320
focus if I don't think about the numbers at all. Because I find myself... I just remember a long

950
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:04,320
time ago when I started a podcast, I would think that I failed if it didn't do well. Like if I didn't

951
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,880
celebrate the person well enough, I didn't do a good job enough of a conversation. Well,

952
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:14,560
that's not necessarily at all what that means. It's hard not to... This is tough stuff. I mean,

953
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:22,160
yeah, I know exactly what you're saying. And part of it is... I mean, it starts in my... You have a

954
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:26,800
little bit of a different situation than me because you're doing long form conversations with people

955
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:31,520
and the prep is a little bit different. One of the things in my space because I'm reacting mostly

956
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,360
to what's going on in the news and then also picking topics to dive into a little bit more deeply

957
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:41,360
is I have very little control over the news cycle. And there is a meta metric or a macro

958
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:47,920
metric that affects me that will quadruple my audience and then take 75% of it away,

959
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:54,480
which is the seasonality of election cycles. And the first few election cycles, it's very tough

960
01:31:54,480 --> 01:32:00,000
because I go, it's October. I'm like, at this rate, we're going to have 20 million subscribers by

961
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,320
the next... These numbers are unbelievable. And then it's January 30th, the inauguration's over,

962
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:12,960
the debate is about the debt ceiling and nothing's going on. And I go, nobody's watching my content.

963
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:19,360
I must have forgotten to upload a... Something must be wrong. It's completely beyond my control.

964
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:24,320
So I just... And I think part of what you're saying is I try to focus on the things I can control

965
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,280
and understand those that I really have no control over whatsoever and try not to worry about them.

966
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:37,120
And try to do the things that make you happy at the end of the day. You mentioned RFK, the guy you

967
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:43,040
met. What do you think about some of the other candidates outside of Joe Biden in the Democratic

968
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:49,520
Party, RFK Jr.? What do you think of him as a candidate? I've met him. We once had dinner and

969
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:55,920
we have a number of friends in common, which is what makes this a little more awkward. But I think

970
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:03,760
his campaign is basically sort of like a chaos candidacy to raise awareness and maybe raise

971
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,640
money either for his book or his anti-vaccine organization, Children's Defense Fund, I believe

972
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:13,840
it's called. I think there's some reporting that Steve Bannon really liked the idea of him running

973
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:19,760
as a Democrat, again, to just generate chaos. I don't find it super interesting. I don't find

974
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:28,400
it worthy of that much discussion. Smart guy, nice guy, has been doing anti-vaccine work that I

975
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:33,440
don't find particularly inspiring for a long time. So it's not just anti-COVID vaccine? It's more

976
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:37,440
broader than that? He's been in that space long before the COVID vaccines. Yeah. Yeah, I don't

977
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:43,840
find it super interesting. Well, he also wrote the book The Real Anthony Fauci. Is that the name

978
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:49,200
of the book? Did he write that? That's interesting. I don't know. I'm not sure about that. I'm aware

979
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:55,680
of that book. I didn't know he wrote it. I think, but it's been on my reading list to get... I've

980
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:02,400
been trying to get a good balanced reading list about the COVID pandemic to understand what the

981
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:09,920
hell happened. And anytime I start to try to go into that place, I'm exhausted by it. Well,

982
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,520
it's interesting to me that you wouldn't wait longer before delving into those books to have

983
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:24,880
maybe a more clear hindsight. But I think this is a pretty good time. You don't think so. It depends

984
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:30,160
on your goals. If you're thinking of it as a historical event, yes, you should probably wait

985
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:38,400
longer. But if you're thinking about understanding what is broken about our system that we responded

986
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:44,000
so poorly, that there was so much division, what is broken about our political system that

987
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:50,320
it didn't unite us. It divided us. Who's to blame? There's probably a lot of different

988
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:55,120
narratives. But I feel like the more you learn about this, the better you can understand. I read

989
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,440
on just Vladimir Putin, I read like five biographies already, maybe more.

990
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:06,800
Just it helps to really understand the people involved, the organizations involved. I don't

991
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:12,720
know. Everything from the scientists to the political leaders. It felt like the blog posts and

992
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:17,360
the tweets didn't quite cap it. They didn't quite cap it. No, one of the things I read a ton,

993
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:24,080
I don't read any modern political books, so I don't read the memoirs of elected officials.

994
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:30,320
I just feel like I get enough of it in my job. So my reading list is just other things. It's

995
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:36,560
history, it's narrative nonfiction, economics, et cetera. And that's my bias because I'm so

996
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,560
overloaded with a lot of the stuff you're talking about. I haven't read any of Obama's books.

997
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,400
I didn't read John Bolton's book. I don't read any of that stuff,

998
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,720
although I'm sure there is value to be gleaned from it.

999
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,640
What about the other candidate that, according to the subreddit, and as you mentioned,

1000
01:35:54,640 --> 01:36:01,760
you've criticized a little bit, Marianne Williamson. Do you think, what are the pros and cons of her

1001
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:08,880
as a candidate? This is another area where many in my audience really are angry with me. I don't

1002
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,680
find her candidacy super interesting. I'll tell you the pros and the cons as I see them.

1003
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:18,560
I do think that we have elected officials in the US, particularly presidents,

1004
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:25,360
from a really narrow range of backgrounds. So it's lawyers and sometimes business people,

1005
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:30,560
very, very often lawyers. I think we would benefit from a much greater diversity of backgrounds.

1006
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:36,320
And I once said, and that would include people from education, people from the science world,

1007
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:40,240
people with backgrounds maybe running nonprofits, et cetera. Now, Marianne Williamson did, I guess,

1008
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:44,720
at one point, run some kind of small nonprofit. And some in my audience thought that credential alone

1009
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:49,840
would make me fall head over heels in love with the idea of a Marianne candidacy. I've interviewed

1010
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:57,840
for her. It's just not for me is the way I like to say it. The background of the woo-woo type stuff

1011
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:04,640
is a bit off-putting to me. I understand that someone with literal Christian Bible beliefs

1012
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:11,040
that also I don't like, maybe I'm more willing to accept, as most of our presidents, of course,

1013
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:17,120
have had those views because they're otherwise more qualified. But some of the things that she

1014
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:23,440
says just strike me as, I just don't know. I'll give you an example. When she was on with Russell

1015
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:29,360
Brand, she said, there's no such thing as clinical depression. It just means someone in a clinic

1016
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:34,720
told you you have depression. I don't believe that to be the case. I think we have an understanding.

1017
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:38,160
There's two types of depression. There's like a genetic predisposition depression.

1018
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:43,680
There's like a acute something's happening in my life, temporary depression. When she was asked

1019
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:49,760
about it recently, she said, I didn't mean it. I was just trying to impress Russell Brand.

1020
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:55,440
I don't know if I'm more bothered by the thing she first said or by the fact that she wanted to

1021
01:37:55,440 --> 01:38:01,200
impress Russell Brand. But it's just like, it's just really not for me. And I agree with her on,

1022
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:06,400
we need to take the climate more seriously. We need to expand access to health. I'm with

1023
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:11,840
all of that stuff. Now, I want to say one other thing about this. Anybody who wants to run should

1024
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:18,720
run. I am not suggesting there should be an uncontested primary for Joe Biden. Absolutely.

1025
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,320
So you think it should be contested? Well, what I mean by contested is so there's two

1026
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:26,560
parts to what we mean by contested. Will the DNC organize debates? And we'll get to that in a second.

1027
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:32,000
But should anybody who's on the left get out of the way because Joe Biden is president and he's

1028
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,680
running for reelection? Absolutely not. The question about, should there be debates? I would

1029
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:44,240
like there to be debates. The DNC pretty clearly isn't going to organize them. I think if you did

1030
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:49,520
them, you would have to say at what polling level do you qualify? And I don't know exactly where you

1031
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,400
put that number. But I think it would be a great thing to put Joe Biden on a stage with, if you

1032
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,280
can get what, 6%, 8%. I'm not really sure what the number would be. I'm totally all for that.

1033
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,600
Why is a set of candidates, at least from my perspective, so weak?

1034
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,480
Do you have an understanding of this? There's a lot of different answers to this.

1035
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,720
One aspect to this, which I think is more of a socio-cultural thing, which I've recently

1036
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:21,360
read about to some degree, is the job actually turns off the people who would be best at it

1037
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,560
because of what you need to do to become president. And it includes

1038
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:32,640
all but completely abandoning your existing day-to-day life job, which you may depend on,

1039
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:40,560
and family to some degree. It's horribly negative, as we already talked about. And at the end of all

1040
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,520
of that, you either lose and then have to rebuild, and maybe you're not in a position to be able to

1041
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,840
do that, or you win. And then now you've got four years of being one of the most hated people,

1042
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,320
no matter how good a job you do. So I think by its nature, it turns off a lot of people that

1043
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:02,160
would otherwise be good. I also think that there's a lot of posturing from within the parties about,

1044
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:06,720
well, you might be good, but it's not your time yet, so you should wait. And then let's talk about

1045
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:10,640
maybe a Senate seat here and there. So it's like a company, essentially, and they're figuring out

1046
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:15,920
where they want to place people. I think all of these things make it so we end up with candidates

1047
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:21,360
most people aren't super thrilled with. So it's difficult for somebody who's young or an outsider

1048
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:28,720
to quickly become a candidate? I think that that's true. And I think also, in a lot of ways, it's

1049
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:34,080
just not... I mean, would you want to be president? No. I mean, I can't because I wasn't born in the

1050
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:40,400
U.S., so it's easy for me to say, but... If everyone says no, then we'll get the people that we have.

1051
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,080
No, I understand that. So I would love to help somehow.

1052
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,600
Sure. And I feel like there's not even a mechanism for helping, except through the

1053
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:55,360
democratic, through the voting process. But I'm just annoyed how little technology there is in

1054
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,720
the whole process, how little innovation there is in the whole process, all of this.

1055
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:07,200
The sad thing is this is written about a lot, which is there's this thing called political

1056
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:14,160
hobbyism. And I think there's a good chance that some of the people in my audience are political

1057
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:21,200
hobbyists in the sense that they follow this stuff as entertainment to some degree. And I've written

1058
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:27,280
a lot about how... I've read a lot and talked a lot about how, okay, we vote every two years or

1059
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:32,000
every four years in our local elections, et cetera. And then we think about politics all the time.

1060
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:37,520
Neil Postman wrote about this in his book, Amusing Ourselves to Death. But what are you actually

1061
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:43,120
going to do about the kids starving in this country and the nuclear buildup in that country?

1062
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:48,480
It's okay. If everybody refocused their attention on their immediate communities, and that could mean

1063
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:53,520
any number, it could mean the town or city you live in, or it might mean an athletic club or

1064
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:58,160
whatever. If everybody, this time they spent on political hobbyism, they moved somewhere else,

1065
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:01,440
which might put me out of a job, that's okay. I'm willing to lose my job because I think it

1066
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:06,160
would be so beneficial. Then our communities would just be that much better, because you can

1067
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,560
actually affect change in a much more tangible way locally, whether it's... People talk about

1068
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:17,120
potholes, but other things as well. Yeah. And I wish our system was more amenable to that kind

1069
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:23,440
of contribution, hopefully through the digital space it would be. Let me ask you about on the

1070
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:30,080
Republican side, Ron DeSantis, what do you think of him as a candidate running against Donald Trump?

1071
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:36,480
I think in the couple of weeks before our discussion today, his campaign, which hasn't

1072
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:43,520
even started, has sort of started to implode. And this was something that I started thinking about

1073
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:49,760
in September, October. He really doesn't seem ready for prime time in the sense that just being

1074
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,200
confronted, and confronted's not even the right word, just being asked about some topics he didn't

1075
01:42:55,200 --> 01:43:02,640
really seem to want to talk about, he responded in such a sort of disproportionate, unhinged way

1076
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:08,640
during his recent trip to Asia. He was asked about, why aren't you or why are you responding,

1077
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:14,160
but in this weird way to Trump's attacks on you? And he went into this weird bobblehead thing with

1078
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:18,880
a weird smile, and something came out that didn't make any sense, and he sort of got mad at the

1079
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:23,760
reporter. And it was just like, if you can't handle that, you can't be on a debate stage with

1080
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:28,080
Donald Trump. And again, for all my criticisms of Trump, the guy gets you on a debate stage,

1081
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:34,080
he can make you look pretty silly. He was recently asked about his role at Guantanamo Bay when he

1082
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:40,640
was an officer in, I forget, which branch of the armed forces. And he just sort of attacked

1083
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:46,640
the journalist asking the question, and it just looked very bad. And there are increasingly big

1084
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:50,560
Republican donors who are not fans of Trump, and we're sort of hoping to put their eggs in the

1085
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,080
Ron DeSantis basket, who are saying, this guy just doesn't have what it takes, I don't think he can

1086
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:59,520
do it. So I don't know if DeSantis will be able to get away. Once you're polling 20-something,

1087
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,400
like he is, and you haven't even announced, it's very attractive. And he probably to some degree

1088
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:10,720
is thinking, if I wait till 20-28, I might not have this opportunity again. But Trump's polling

1089
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:17,440
52-53, which means even if DeSantis gets all of the current non-Trump vote, he has to figure out

1090
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,800
how to take something more from Trump. I just don't know how he does it.

1091
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:25,360
First of all, the implosion aspect, that's part of the process, isn't it? You kind of implode

1092
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:30,320
a bunch of times. And then rebuild yourself.

1093
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,280
And rebuild them because the new cycle kind of forgets.

1094
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:39,200
It's possible. The problem is, the first debate is in August. So that's only a few months away.

1095
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:47,120
And the decision's going to have to be made pretty soon. And unless he can get a new momentum going,

1096
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:51,600
I just don't know how he gets what he needs in order to really have a shot.

1097
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,920
So would anyone else run against Donald Trump?

1098
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,360
It's very tough right now. I mean, there are other people running. There's this guy Vivek

1099
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:02,560
Ramaswamy who's running. Nikki Haley is running. Her campaign basically dead on arrival.

1100
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,800
Trump actually does better in polls the more people run. When it's just him and DeSantis,

1101
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:14,400
that's the best scenario for DeSantis. It's not great for DeSantis, but it's certainly better.

1102
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,760
But I think the difficulty is, this is a question for Republicans to figure out.

1103
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:24,800
The people who rightly recognized in 2016 that this guy is not good for their party

1104
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:31,760
still believe this guy's not good for their party. But many of them recognize that most of the voters

1105
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:38,000
are still behind him. You can always say it's early. His polling doesn't really mean anything.

1106
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,240
Anything could happen. Something major would have to happen for Trump to lose that lead.

1107
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:46,640
If he got more, if he was arrested two more times and had more indictments and it just

1108
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,480
became like, this guy can't even campaign because he's so busy going from court to court,

1109
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:54,000
maybe that would make a difference. It's really tough to imagine.

1110
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:58,880
You said that there are three categories of people who vote Republican,

1111
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:04,800
and that Trump introduced the fourth one. Can you go through the four categories?

1112
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,320
Sure. So you've got your pro-business low tax Republicans. These are mostly people like Mitt

1113
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:14,800
Romney. Mitt Romney has a bit of the social conservatism as well. He's Mormon and that's

1114
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,480
there. But Mitt Romney primarily, particularly as a Northeast sort of Republican, I mean,

1115
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:23,680
I know Utah, but Governor of Massachusetts, he is like a low tax pro-business type guy.

1116
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:30,160
You've got your libertarian type Republicans who are primarily about freedom and liberty.

1117
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:34,160
Often they are actually more socially liberal where they go, I don't care about gay marriage,

1118
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:41,280
I don't care so much about abortion. And that overlapped a little bit with the Tea Party

1119
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,440
movement in 2010, although Tea Party did have a religious component, but sort of like the

1120
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:49,600
libertarian freedom minded folks. And then the religious conservatives, people that support

1121
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:55,840
candidates like Josh Hawley or Ted Cruz, et cetera, where their big thing are social issues.

1122
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:02,000
Often they actually want Christianity being civil government. They don't want separation

1123
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,240
of church and state. Those are traditionally the three Republican groups. The one that Trump

1124
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:10,720
introduced was people who just didn't really pay attention to politics, but either followed

1125
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:19,040
celebrity or had grievances that they didn't yet have a scapegoat for and were sort of right-leaning

1126
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:24,560
culturally, even though they didn't attribute that to Republicanism. And Trump was able to

1127
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,600
bring them into politics often for the first time as voters. They could be part of any of

1128
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:35,440
those three groups if they get more into politics or kind of be their own thing. But they're more

1129
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,680
kind of like cult of personality. I'm here for Trump types.

1130
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:44,160
Did it have to do anything about the culture wars and the identity politics, all that kind of stuff?

1131
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:50,240
Yeah. I mean, so in 2016, when Trump mobilized them, those weren't really issues the way they are now.

1132
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,960
So I think at that time, it certainly was not a factor.

1133
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,200
What was the mobilizing issue? I don't know. It was just anti-Hillary in 2016.

1134
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:06,880
He did a good job on anti-Hillary, but a lot of it was identifying real economic problems, wage

1135
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:12,720
depression, lack of jobs in parts of the country, Ohio and Indiana. Trump rightly identified. We

1136
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:17,200
have an issue here. We don't have enough entrepreneurship, et cetera. But there was also a

1137
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:22,960
lot of scapegoating that was China and people coming through the US-Mexico border were popular

1138
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,440
scapegoats for a lot of those problems. This gets us kind of to populism.

1139
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:35,840
Populism is a rhetoric, and populism as a rhetoric doesn't necessarily come with particular policies.

1140
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:43,600
You can be a user of populist rhetoric and propose solutions that would be more aligned

1141
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:49,120
with Bernie or Tucker Carlson. Populists will often identify the plight of the middle class.

1142
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:55,360
The difference would be Bernie will say, we've got to put some restrictions on how much

1143
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:00,240
billionaires can make, and we've got to reinvest in these social programs.

1144
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:07,600
Tucker will say, BLM taking your house and a brown person from Mexico taking your job

1145
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:13,280
are what we need to deal with. So the populist rhetoric can lend itself to very different

1146
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,320
policy, and Trump used that very effectively in 2016.

1147
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:22,960
Why do you think Hillary Clinton was hated as intensely as she was by a certain percent

1148
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:28,720
of the population? It feels like that's the first election I witnessed where there's a lot of hate.

1149
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:37,600
Maybe I'm misremembered. I don't remember Obama. I don't remember the degree of hate.

1150
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,520
There was conspiracy theories that he wasn't born in this country, but I don't remember

1151
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:47,040
hate towards Obama. Record death threats under Obama more than any previous president.

1152
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:51,840
Towards him. Yeah. Do you mean more hate between voters?

1153
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:58,400
Between voters, between voters, but that's I guess what I was speaking to, but that hate was

1154
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:06,240
directed towards the narrative, the thread that connected all of that in 2016 was Hillary Clinton.

1155
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:13,760
Few different things. And I'm not ranking these. These are just all things that come to mind.

1156
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:20,640
One is Hillary Clinton had been around in the political space for a long time,

1157
01:50:21,200 --> 01:50:27,200
from her time as First Lady, through a senator, secretary of state, etc. So I think that

1158
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:34,880
there was enough time for different groups to develop an antipathy towards her for different

1159
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:44,320
reasons. So time. Secondly, Trump's branding of her as crooked was very effective where there

1160
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:49,600
were so many people demanding that she be imprisoned. If you ask them what is the crime,

1161
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:54,240
they don't know. But she should definitely be locked up. That became a very big thing.

1162
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:04,320
The email story, as it were, and James Comey doing a second public event about that investigation,

1163
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,840
even though there wasn't any actual news about it, just doing a second event about it at the last

1164
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:13,840
minute, I think hurt her and also generated some hate. And I don't find Hillary Clinton to be

1165
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:19,280
particularly likable, although I voted for her. I thought she was the better candidate. And I think

1166
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:25,200
that there are others who also didn't find her particularly likable. Those are a lot of impediments

1167
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:29,520
to becoming president. I was trying to understand why there's so many conspiracy theories about

1168
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:36,800
Clintons in general, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. And maybe I'm not researched well enough.

1169
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:42,560
Of the why of it? The why of it, actually, the extent of the conspiracy theories,

1170
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:47,360
the conspiracy theories that they've killed a lot of people, this kind of stuff.

1171
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,000
It's hard for me to speak to them because I'm aware that they exist, but I'm not an expert in

1172
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,680
them because they seem so obviously baseless to the degree that I've researched them a little bit,

1173
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,320
and then I move on. And it's been years since I've looked at this stuff. I know there's the Seth

1174
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:08,480
Rich one and there's the Clinton body count one. I think there's one connected to Epstein,

1175
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:13,520
if I recall correctly. There's all sorts of these different ones. Without speaking to any of them

1176
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:19,280
specifically because I'm not the expert on Clinton conspiracies, it does seem as though

1177
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,120
this stuff for so long has generated an audience. I mean, I remember in the supermarket

1178
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:30,160
when Bill Clinton was president at the checkout seeing the tabloids and there were stuff about

1179
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:36,000
Hillary birthing alien baby. It seems like it's been titillating to people for a very long time.

1180
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:42,320
Well, another question from Reddit speaking of aliens. I would be curious to hear David's views

1181
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:48,160
on conspiracies and conspiracy theories, the extent to which real conspiracies happen,

1182
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:54,400
and why conspiracies that have little evidence behind them managed to be so compelling to people

1183
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:01,440
regardless. Also, please bring up aliens and UAPs. Okay. Where do we start? The conspiracy. What?

1184
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:10,240
So, what in general, as a person who thinks about politics, thinks about this world,

1185
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:16,400
like where do conspiracy theories fit in for you? I think there have been conspiracies. And by

1186
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:23,040
conspiracies, I'm using a colloquial definition, which is basically individuals working together

1187
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:32,800
to, in a clandestine way, impact or affect some kind of event or phenomenon very, very broadly.

1188
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:39,920
I mean, certainly that those things have happened. To jump around to some of the things that were

1189
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:46,800
in there, I think the reason that conspiracy theories are so compelling is that it's really

1190
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:55,040
tough for a lot of people to accept there are random events, not predictable specifically,

1191
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,200
at a stochastic level, we might be able to predict them, but specifically unpredictable,

1192
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:06,720
bad events in many ways. I could be the victim of one or you could or my family could. That's

1193
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:12,480
really scary to a lot of people, understandably so. And for some people, it's less scary and more

1194
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:18,880
soothing in a way to say there aren't really random events like this. Somebody planned it,

1195
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:23,520
and if we had just known who planned it, it just could have been stopped because we would have

1196
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:31,520
known exactly when. That's just a psychological level easier to accept for people. And I get that

1197
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:37,520
to some degree because, listen, it's not the most exciting thing that everything can just

1198
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:42,640
be going fine and something absolutely horrible happens and kills who knows some number of people.

1199
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:48,400
So I think that's the biggest attractor to a lot of these conspiracy theories. It doesn't apply

1200
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:53,600
to all of them though. But yeah, but there's still a basic understanding of human nature where

1201
01:54:55,280 --> 01:55:02,160
some people are greedy and want power and are corrupted by power. So there's these compelling

1202
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:12,720
narratives that stick that, I don't know, the vaccine is an opportunity for a powerful

1203
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:19,360
billionaire to implant chips into you so you can control you further. Right. It doesn't seem,

1204
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,480
what do I want to say? It's like, for some reason, that doesn't seem as crazy as it should.

1205
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:35,920
Because you think maybe Hollywood contributes to that. But you think, yeah, you could imagine

1206
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:42,880
an evil person, a person that wants more control, more power, and is also at the same time able to

1207
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,440
convince themselves, as history shows, that they're actually have the best interest of the populace

1208
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:53,040
in mind, that they're trying to do good for the world. So they do evil while trying to do good.

1209
01:55:53,040 --> 01:56:00,080
And you can kind of imagine it. So it's like, why not? And you listen to people in power,

1210
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:10,880
authorities, they kind of look and sound shady. The transparency, especially the older ones,

1211
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:16,480
I think younger folks are better at being real and transparent and just revealing their flaws

1212
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:20,800
in the basic humanity. But people that are a little bit older in the positions of power,

1213
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:26,240
they're more polished. It feels like they're presenting a narrative where the truth is hidden

1214
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:33,280
in the shadows. I don't think there's anything wrong with suspecting. Maybe a public figure

1215
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:39,120
isn't giving me the full story, totally reasonable thing to question. I don't think there's anything

1216
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:46,000
wrong with exploring a lot of these different things. I think the problem becomes, and I know

1217
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,640
you've talked about this in so many different ways with other guests, the problem becomes when we

1218
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:56,640
lose a shared understanding of how we would assess whether any of these things are true.

1219
01:56:57,200 --> 01:57:04,880
And then both alleged evidence and an absence of evidence both become supportive of the conspiracy

1220
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:09,520
theory. Because if there's bad evidence, you manipulate it and say it's good evidence. If

1221
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:14,000
there's no evidence, you say the evidence was obviously hidden by the people who carried out

1222
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,480
the thing or whatever. So unless we can have a shared understanding of how we would determine

1223
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,120
what's true, these are common conversations often between atheists and religious folks.

1224
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:29,040
How can we determine, is my faith in something or my desire for something to be true a good

1225
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:32,240
way to evaluate whether it is true? They're really similar questions.

1226
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:37,520
Well, let me ask you about Trump on that front. About the election, 2020 election,

1227
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:43,200
maybe the better question is about January 6th. Do you think January 6th was a big deal?

1228
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,320
I do.

1229
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,240
How big of a deal?

1230
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:47,680
Compared to what?

1231
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:50,000
Civil War.

1232
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,200
I think it was less of a big deal than the Civil War.

1233
01:57:55,200 --> 01:58:00,400
It's a very interesting thing, though, because we have not only the event, that's clever,

1234
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:07,760
actually. It's not only the event, but it's what led up to it and what has happened since and did

1235
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:18,240
it change what is considered on the table that citizens can, should or might do if they disagree

1236
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:23,280
with the results of an election? So I think that there are further reaching consequences than just

1237
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:29,120
was the six-hour period on January 6th, a bigger or smaller deal than the Civil War,

1238
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:36,240
and there's so much wrapped up into it. Many conspiracy theories flowed from January 6th as

1239
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:41,840
well. 60 Minutes recently featured a guy named Ray Epps, who was targeted by some on the right,

1240
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,880
claiming that he was an instigator or an agent of the FBI or something along those lines.

1241
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:53,280
There were people claiming that no real, it was like a no true Scotsman sort of thing, like

1242
01:58:53,280 --> 01:59:00,160
Trump supporters wouldn't riot. So by definition, it must have been Antifa, police let him in,

1243
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:03,360
or police were, you know, all these different things. I think it was a big deal in a lot of

1244
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:09,360
ways because it completely made us have to go back to the top to say, okay, what are the parameters

1245
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:15,680
of valid discussion and activism in the United States? But what aspect of the January 6th

1246
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:25,360
was bad for you? Well, I mean, if you're thinking from a big philosophical political

1247
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:33,200
perspective, so presumably the number of people hurt and the number of people who died

1248
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:40,480
is not the only metric to consider here. Absolutely. I think the sum total of what it means

1249
01:59:41,120 --> 01:59:46,880
about how the United States operates is what's most concerning, and I'll kind of just like

1250
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:54,560
flesh it out a little bit. So summer of 2020, Trump's already saying they're going to cheat.

1251
01:59:55,440 --> 02:00:01,520
Now, the polling is close, but it shows that Biden's in a good position. People aren't happy

1252
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:07,280
with Trump. Any reasonable person would look and say it's going to be close, but Biden certainly

1253
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,880
wouldn't be a crazy thing if Biden won. Trump's already saying they're going to

1254
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:14,000
cheat with mail-in ballots, or they're going to cheat with early voting, or they're going to

1255
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
cheat with machines, or we should do only in person, or whatever else the case may be.

1256
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:24,640
We have the election. We knew in certain states how the vote count was going to go,

1257
02:00:24,640 --> 02:00:28,800
some states stopped counting at 10 p.m., some states count all of the mail-in stuff up front,

1258
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:35,120
some don't. Everything was completely predictable. At 2 a.m., Trump comes out and says,

1259
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:40,640
I won. Okay, but where are you getting that, sir? As he claims people always refer to him,

1260
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:47,040
where are you getting that? And with that statement, immediately we see that there is a

1261
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:52,560
large portion of this country that either is unable or unwilling to say, wait a second,

1262
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:59,200
the polling all said this was a real possibility. The counting schedules are all being adhered to.

1263
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:07,440
But Trump won. That doesn't make any sense. That doesn't happen. It builds. People are donating

1264
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:12,960
millions to Trump for supposed audits, which nobody can define, and lawsuits, which go nowhere,

1265
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:17,600
and it builds and builds and builds. And we have a total separation from a factual reality.

1266
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:23,360
There's no reason to think, by December 1, give three weeks to look through some of this stuff.

1267
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:28,720
By December 1, there's no reasonable case to be made that Trump actually won. But it doesn't end

1268
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:35,600
there. It goes into maybe we can just send different electors, even though Biden won Arizona.

1269
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:39,280
Let's just send, I don't remember how many electors it is in Arizona. Let's just send

1270
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:43,760
Republican electors to say we vote for Trump. But that's not democracy. That's not the way

1271
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:50,480
the system works. Let's make sure we're ready. Ready for what exactly? And then it builds to

1272
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:57,520
maybe Mike Pence can just prevent Biden from being president, or maybe we can just interfere in

1273
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:04,080
this other way. And then it gets to let's break into the Capitol. It's the height of saying

1274
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:11,920
we no longer comport ourselves attached to what is a verifiable factual reality.

1275
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:19,920
And when we no longer do that, we're also willing to commit crimes, property crimes,

1276
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:25,760
violent crimes, different degrees, in order to try to have something other than democracy.

1277
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,600
It wouldn't be democracy if any of those things had happened.

1278
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:36,080
Yeah, I think it's not the height of it. I think there's still a case to be made that that

1279
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:44,240
did not leave the realm of protest versus a violation of the principles of democracy.

1280
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:52,000
So to me, the height of what could happen on January 6th is if Donald Trump was much

1281
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,600
better executive, he could take control of the military.

1282
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:00,480
If it had succeeded. No, not even succeeded. The attempt would have been more

1283
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:08,480
empowered. I understand. So like the way not to bring up Hitler every other word,

1284
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:13,440
which is something your subreddit also told me not to do. It's kind of an important figure.

1285
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:17,680
It's interesting to study that moment in history because it reveals so much about human nature

1286
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:21,760
and that all of us are capable of good and evil. But thank you to your subredditor or

1287
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:26,480
redditor for your contribution to the conversation. I will keep bringing up

1288
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:31,040
Hitler and the Third Reich and I'll keep bringing up Stalin. There's so much to learn from that.

1289
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:40,720
Anyway, an effective practice authoritarian could roll the tanks out into the city streets

1290
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:51,760
to establish order and in so doing pause the process of democracy as opposed to a few protesters

1291
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:58,640
breaking in to a questionably protected building. I agree that what you're saying would be worse.

1292
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:03,440
I don't want to use it to minimize what the protesters were intent on doing. They failed,

1293
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:09,040
fortunately. To you, the intention was there. Well, the intention was Trump should remain

1294
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:13,760
president. That's the intention. And to what lengths they would have been willing to go if

1295
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:19,840
by the evening, early evening, they were sort of forced out. I don't know. I agree with you

1296
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:24,480
that Trump trying to use the military would absolutely be worse. There's these reports

1297
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:27,760
that he tried to seize voting machines, which is kind of funny because it's like,

1298
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:31,680
once you get the machine at Mar-a-Lago, what do you do with it exactly? I don't know. There's

1299
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:37,280
like a comedic element to Trump sitting around with voting machines. But he did float trying to

1300
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:42,560
do some other things. I don't believe there's reporting that he actually tried to use the

1301
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:47,920
military. I wanted to what degree this opened the door to further things like this with other

1302
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:56,320
candidates, even in the Democratic Party also. Do you think there would be more and more

1303
02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:02,000
questioning of the election results? There has been already. It's very clearly the playbook.

1304
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,840
Kerry Lake lost. She ran for governor in Arizona, 2022. She lost. What I mean by that is her

1305
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:13,200
opponent received more votes. It's like very clear what it means that she lost. She insists to this

1306
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:20,560
day that she won, to this day. She did the same grift Trump did about donate. We've got a case.

1307
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:27,920
We won in the case. You didn't win. They just set a court date. Lies upon grift upon lies.

1308
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:36,240
They did it then. It's extraordinarily saddening, but it seems like this is now going to be part

1309
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:38,480
of the playbook. Do you think people on the left will start doing it?

1310
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:44,800
I don't have a reason to believe that that is going to happen, but I'm not going to say it never

1311
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:49,120
could. It certainly could. People on the left could start using it as a tactic. Right now,

1312
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:53,520
there's not a sign that that's going to happen, but it's certainly good. My expectation is,

1313
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:59,040
and I'm not a betting man, but I would bet money. If Joe Biden loses in November of 2024,

1314
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:05,840
he will say, I lost. He will call the winner. He will concede and he will leave the White House

1315
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:11,520
in an orderly fashion. You don't think there will be claims of a hacked election? The ability to

1316
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:19,200
hack elections is becoming more and more effective with the developments on the artificial intelligence

1317
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:26,160
side. The difficulty is you're basically saying, will something happen without me knowing anything

1318
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:30,800
about the election? Imagine there really was evidence of a hacked election. Then I would want

1319
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:36,320
those claims to be made, but the way elections have gone in the past, I don't expect that that's

1320
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:41,280
a claim that would be made. No. Speaking of evidence of things that were claimed,

1321
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:51,120
what do you think about the Hunter Biden laptop? Or as you tweeted, the laptop from hell TM.

1322
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:57,600
To what degree was this laptop story important and to what degree was it not?

1323
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:07,440
At this point, I have said many times, if there is any reason to believe that Hunter Biden, Joe

1324
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:15,760
Biden, Naomi Biden, Jill Biden, Hillary, Obama, Doug, and if there's any evidence any of them

1325
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:21,920
committed a crime, they should be investigated, they should be charged, and they should be tried.

1326
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:28,080
Period. The Hunter Biden laptop thing has been floating around for so long,

1327
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:39,760
and we still have zero actual pieces of evidence of any crime, particularly involving Joe Biden.

1328
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:46,320
There's the claim from some that references to the big guy are about Joe Biden getting 10%

1329
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:50,960
for some illicit. It's been years they've been saying this, they've not been able to bring forward

1330
02:07:50,960 --> 02:08:00,560
any evidence on it. My assessment of the Hunter Biden laptop is, it seems to mostly be a story

1331
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:08,560
about nude images released without someone's consent, which is illegal in most states and violates

1332
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:15,280
Twitter's own policies. That's the main story to me. Beyond that, I don't know how many people

1333
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:19,600
have a copy of this hard drive at this point. Rudy had it. Tucker, do you remember when Tucker,

1334
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:27,680
this is unbelievable. Tucker said that he mailed himself a copy, a USB stick,

1335
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:34,080
and it got lost in the mail. You have the mother load proving the criminality of Joe and Hunter

1336
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:38,960
Biden. You just dropped it off with a stamp and it got lost in the mail. You don't have a backup

1337
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:44,640
copy. I'm ready for the evidence to come forward. Hunter Biden has nothing to do with Joe Biden's

1338
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:49,600
administration, but as a person who, if he committed a crime, charge him, investigate him,

1339
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:54,720
whatever. It's almost getting satirical, the degree to which they're talking about the Hunter

1340
02:08:54,720 --> 02:09:00,720
Biden laptop. What do you think about the social media aspect of this, that story got censored?

1341
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:07,120
What do you think about censorship in general on social media, that that story, during an

1342
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:15,440
important time in the electoral process, got censored? As a matter of principle, I think we

1343
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:21,120
have to define what we mean by censorship, but I'm against censorship short of illegal content,

1344
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:26,160
I guess is the way I would put it. I do respect the company's right to have terms of service and

1345
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:30,960
to enforce them, as long as they're not illegal. If Twitter were to say, we don't publish content

1346
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:39,520
from Jewish people, okay, now we've got a problem on our hands. But what is dubious to me is the

1347
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:46,400
claim that had people been able to see Hunter Biden's genitals, they would have voted for Trump,

1348
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:52,160
which I know it's like, David, you're making light of and, but at the end of the day,

1349
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:57,360
what exactly is the claim that if you had known more about Hunter Biden, I guess,

1350
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:01,840
allegedly hiring prostitutes and having a drug problem and seeing pictures,

1351
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:06,640
you wouldn't have voted for Joe Biden? I mean, I know me as a voter, I don't feel that way.

1352
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:15,760
I think it's less about the content of the story and about the actions of a social media company

1353
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:21,920
to control what you see and what you don't see. So you could imagine a social media company like

1354
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,800
Facebook and Twitter making the same kind of decision about a more impactful story than

1355
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:32,320
if you dick pics on a laptop. Well, I think if that happened, then my view might be different,

1356
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:36,560
right? But I do, my general view, though, on the Hunter Biden story is,

1357
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:43,440
had the articles not contained those images that were illegal in many states and violated

1358
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:47,600
Twitter's policies, I would say publish it. Absolutely. I don't think it would have had

1359
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:52,000
an impact, but I would be in favor of it being, of the links being allowed 100%.

1360
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:57,120
Okay. You mentioned Tucker. What do you think about Tucker getting fired from Fox?

1361
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:01,280
You're a media person that works independently. Yes.

1362
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:06,000
Tucker was a media person who doesn't work independently. Right.

1363
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,680
Yeah, what do you think about that particular situation? Is it representative of some big

1364
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:17,840
shift that's happening in mainstream media? What would the shift be?

1365
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:23,920
Basically, mainstream media freaking out because the funding is getting less and less and less

1366
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:29,280
and less, and there's going to give more power to individual commentators. Basically,

1367
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:33,200
Tucker Carlson just starting a podcast. So, a YouTube channel.

1368
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:37,680
I think that's what he should do. I think that's the most profitable path rather than maybe going

1369
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:42,960
to work for Newsmax or whatever the case may be. But the firing fundamentally was not a politically

1370
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:48,480
oriented firing that suggests Fox News is changing its tune politically in any way. There's no

1371
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:53,840
evidence of that whatsoever. Tucker Carlson basically became a legal problem for Fox News.

1372
02:11:53,840 --> 02:12:01,360
There's really four points to it. One is the $787.5 million settlement with Dominion, partially

1373
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:07,920
was because of the claims that went out on Tucker Carlson's program. So, to some degree,

1374
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:15,440
Tucker's program was a prominent node of the problematic claims that became the subject

1375
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:19,120
of the lawsuit. That's number one. Number two, Smartmatic, which is another voting machine

1376
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:24,960
company, still has a similarly sized lawsuit against Fox News based on the exact same sorts

1377
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,840
of claims. It may cost Fox News again. So, this is now two problems that Tucker's a big contributor

1378
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:36,240
to. Number three, former Tucker staffer has brought a lawsuit, and I don't remember the

1379
02:12:36,240 --> 02:12:41,840
exact claims, but I know that there are claims of different types of discrimination. It seems

1380
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:46,880
like it has legs and that may be a third payout related to Tucker Carlson. And based on the 60

1381
02:12:46,880 --> 02:12:52,320
minutes piece from a few weeks ago, Ray Epps saying Tucker ruined his life by fomenting conspiracies

1382
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:59,600
about him around January 6. That's ripe for another lawsuit. So, to me, Tucker's firing was a risk

1383
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:05,920
mitigation strategy of many that will be employed as these lawsuits come forward.

1384
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:10,960
There's no evidence that it's because Fox didn't like. And what we mean by that,

1385
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,960
are we talking about Rupert Murdoch doesn't like or the, I don't know. But I don't have

1386
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,280
any reason to believe it's because Tucker's ideas were no longer welcome on Fox. Certainly,

1387
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:25,200
the audience liked them. So, interesting. It's not even about the ratings. It's about just the

1388
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:31,120
legal costs. Fox is interesting. The ratings question is interesting because Fox, unlike

1389
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:38,320
most other or every other cable news channel, they negotiate a fee from every cable subscriber.

1390
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:42,560
If you have Fox News as a channel, even if you don't watch it, Fox gets a little bit of money.

1391
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:48,240
They are dramatically less dependent on ad revenue than CNN and MSNBC. So, the ratings

1392
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:51,040
question is an interesting one, but Fox's position is different on that.

1393
02:13:52,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Another question from Reddit. Both sides are the same in quotes. Is a meme notion that has spread

1394
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:05,520
far and wide in American political discourse on the internet? To what extent do you agree or

1395
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:11,760
disagree with this notion? And why do you think it is so popular? Now, this Reddit comment also

1396
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:17,280
says that podcasts like Russell Brand and Joe Rogan or the legendary comic George Carlin are

1397
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:24,560
examples of big proponents of this notion, all of which I kind of disagree with. Russell Brand,

1398
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:32,960
Joe Rogan and George Carlin claim that both sides are the same and use that. All politicians are

1399
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:39,840
crooked and they suck and this kind of thing. I don't know if that's true. Maybe George Carlin.

1400
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:46,880
Anyway, let's leave that aside. To what degree do you agree with this notion that both sides

1401
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:53,280
are the same? Left and right, the crooked corrupt politicians, they do what politicians do.

1402
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:57,840
I don't agree that it's the same. I think there are different factions that like to say that

1403
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:05,920
for different reasons. There are some individuals who want to present themselves as kind of being

1404
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:10,480
above the fray of partisan politics. And so, I call it enlightened centrism.

1405
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:15,520
Do you mean that positively or negatively? No, I mean it negatively. Yeah, it's a bit

1406
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:22,240
of a pejorative. The idea that I am not going to fall for being a Democrat or a Republican,

1407
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:29,120
I can see that these are just two sides of the same coin, equally bad, lying to everyone. Okay,

1408
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:33,680
so that's one, it's sort of like it's popular at dinner parties in some circles to go,

1409
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:40,080
both all these politicians left and right. So that's one side of it. The other side of it is that

1410
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:50,080
it's often used when your side has really stepped in it. It's a popular way to acknowledge

1411
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:56,560
that your side has done something wrong. But while framing it as it's not uniquely wrong,

1412
02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:00,720
and it's not worse than what anybody else does. And I find that it's one of the

1413
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:08,560
lamest and most kind of cringe-inducing things to hear because of the what comes next.

1414
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:16,320
And usually what comes next is not a good, accurate criticism of something that took place

1415
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:21,280
and a discussion of how to solve a real problem that we have. I find it a conversation stifler.

1416
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:26,320
It also is used to kind of suppress voter turnout, not actively. It's not that the people who say

1417
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:31,600
that go around saying don't vote. But the idea, of course, is the more people that believe that it

1418
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:36,160
doesn't really make a difference who you vote for, it's going to suppress voter turnout. And I want

1419
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:40,080
voter turnout to be as high as possible, not as low as possible. So I also dislike it for that

1420
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:46,640
reason. So is it possible to say that one side is worse than the other in modern current political

1421
02:16:47,520 --> 02:16:54,720
climate? Listen, I'm a person on the left. I'm not pretending to come here as not knowing that my

1422
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:58,800
view is biased because I'm a person of the left. If you ask Ben Shapiro, he'll tell you something

1423
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:06,400
different. I think in 2023, some total, the influence of the American right wing, if the

1424
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:13,120
American right wing were to get everything it wants, it would be a horrifying reality. If the

1425
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:18,880
left were to get everything it wants, we'd have to figure out a few things, including exactly how

1426
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:25,520
we pay for certain programs. But they're mostly noble goals. And I believe that they are more

1427
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:32,160
supportive of an individual self determining what they want to do in life and how they want to live

1428
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:37,280
and is more in line with the idea of freedom and liberty than what the right is currently

1429
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:42,800
proposing. That's my view. And of course, people will disagree with me all day. No, we get to

1430
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:46,960
freedom and liberty the way that the right wants to do it. Okay, well, we can have that conversation.

1431
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:55,840
So I think you've implied in your answer, it was kind of focused on policy. It felt like it was

1432
02:17:55,840 --> 02:18:00,960
focused on policy. There's other stuff that people worry about, particularly with the left.

1433
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:09,600
What maybe termed the woke mind virus. Where have I heard who's using that term a lot now?

1434
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:16,640
I'm trying to think. I'm not sure. I'm not sure where it comes up. But the cultural aspect of

1435
02:18:16,640 --> 02:18:25,120
this, that if you give a lot of power to people on the left, as you gave as an example, there would

1436
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:33,200
be a lot of kind of censorship and suppression of speech and a kind of dividing up of a society of

1437
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:40,400
who's allowed to basically a reallocation of resources not based on merit, but based on some

1438
02:18:40,400 --> 02:18:46,320
kind of high ethical notions of what is right. And only a very small percentage of the population

1439
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:53,040
gets to decide what is what is fair, what is right, which is, you know, we already have a

1440
02:18:53,040 --> 02:19:00,880
small portion of the population deciding fair. I don't know how many different ways I can say

1441
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:06,240
kind of a negative characterization of folks on the left when we're now comparing it,

1442
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:12,000
just as a to play devil's advocate. So is that something that you worry about? So setting policies

1443
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:19,600
aside, wokeism, how big of a problem is it? This is a great conversation. So two sides of it.

1444
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:27,120
Okay. We have new polling that seems to suggest so-called wokeism is kind of more popular in

1445
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:32,000
the United States than anti-wokeism. And I'll tell you what I mean by that. This is the less

1446
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:37,040
interesting part. We'll go to the more interesting part second. Sometimes what people mean by wokeism

1447
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:47,520
is an overreaction to a perceived injustice that goes beyond what would be fair and equitable.

1448
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:51,920
There was this really interesting poll and it asks questions like, for example,

1449
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:58,000
do you believe society has gone too far, not far enough, or just about the right amount,

1450
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:06,560
in dealing with issues affecting the trans community? The woke position, which is society

1451
02:20:06,560 --> 02:20:12,880
hasn't gone far enough, was far more popular than we've gone too far. Now the right wing media

1452
02:20:12,880 --> 02:20:17,360
narrative is we've gone way too far. This is out of control. And there are lots of other

1453
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:23,360
similar answers. It's not a huge margin. A lot of these are like 58 to 42, 60 to 40. It's not

1454
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:29,920
like 90 to 10. But by a small margin, the so-called woke perspective of we actually haven't yet done

1455
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:36,240
enough to fix some of these issues is a little bit more popular. So if we went back to DeSantis,

1456
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:41,600
this is part of why I think DeSantis' anti-woke agenda may just be a political misstep.

1457
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:47,920
That's a really interesting result. I wonder how the questions are framed. But it's still

1458
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:56,480
interesting, nevertheless, no matter what, to hear that people are majority of people in America

1459
02:20:56,480 --> 02:21:01,680
are woke, not in the negative sense of the word. The poll didn't use the term woke, right? This

1460
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:07,360
is a critical thing. Let's use the term woke positively. The term has kind of been perverted

1461
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:11,920
four years ago when the term was started to be used, I would have said, oh, yeah,

1462
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:19,200
woke just means like I have become aware of problems that are bigger than any one person

1463
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:26,160
can fix for themselves that relate to the system. And we might disagree on which problems fall

1464
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:31,440
into that category, but it was kind of benign. I think now it just means like outrageously

1465
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:38,320
left wing, maybe even with socialist or Marxist undertones, it's becoming a pejorative at this.

1466
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:45,760
But also like bullies. Sure, censors. Yeah, but people that go around calling others racist,

1467
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:56,560
sometimes oftentimes without any proof of or justification. Fair. But that's a few folks

1468
02:21:56,560 --> 02:22:01,120
on Twitter, you're saying like the polling is starting to show that like, no, they're still

1469
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:08,160
most Americans still care about these issues and want to want to want to improve, want to make

1470
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:12,080
progress. I think that's the case. And they want to do it in a genuine way that doesn't suppress

1471
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:17,520
or oppress anybody. But now let me get to like to what degree do I think that actual when it goes

1472
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:23,840
too far is a problem. It absolutely exists. We can find instances of where this exists on the left.

1473
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:31,520
I've been told many times that as a Jewish, Argentinian immigrant to the United States,

1474
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:41,920
I actually don't qualify as oppressed enough because Jews are privileged now in the U.S.

1475
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:47,440
and my family had just enough money to leave Argentina. So there's this kind of like oppression

1476
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:52,640
Olympics thing where I've been told you don't get to comment, for example, like a topic in the

1477
02:22:52,640 --> 02:23:01,200
Latino community now is, are you familiar with Latin X? In Spanish, there's an analogous movement

1478
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:09,440
where words by their nature sort of like have a gender. So like the word for friend is amigo.

1479
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:15,920
But if it's a woman, you would say amiga. So right from there, you can tell the gender that

1480
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:22,240
we're talking about. And if it's a mixed group, you say amigos. It's the male with an S,

1481
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:26,400
but it could include both. There's a movement now which wants to do away with that and put the

1482
02:23:26,400 --> 02:23:34,080
letter E in. It's a new word. It's a gender neutral word. Amigos, totally new. I don't like that.

1483
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:39,040
And I don't know anyone. No one in my family uses it. And I think it's kind of like a strange

1484
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:45,920
imposition from someone kind of with a solution in search of a problem. I've been told you moved

1485
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:49,600
to the U.S. long ago and like your English is good and like you look wide and said like you

1486
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:54,800
don't get to weigh in on that. That, I think, is an example, if I understand correctly, of the

1487
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:59,200
type of thing you're talking about. I'm kind of being bullied. I'm fine. I'm surviving fine, but

1488
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:03,680
I'm being bullied over it and disqualified and saying you don't get to speak on this issue.

1489
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:10,080
All of those examples, all of that stuff, I am completely against and I tell people on the left,

1490
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:14,320
we're actually hurting our own movement with this stuff. I just don't think it's as big

1491
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:18,880
as some others believe. You don't think it's an existential threat to

1492
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:24,640
our civilization in the West? No, I don't. And I mean, look, we've got a Biden administration.

1493
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:30,960
I see Biden as center left. Those who see Biden as extreme far left. This stuff has played

1494
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:34,880
almost no role whatsoever in the first two plus years of his administration.

1495
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:37,200
Were there people that see him far left as far left?

1496
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:42,480
There's people on the right who, I mean, Trump says Biden's a Marxist socialist communist.

1497
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:48,320
I haven't heard that because I don't think that would stick very much.

1498
02:24:48,400 --> 02:24:49,760
He says it at every rally.

1499
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,080
Which I also tell us that you don't watch these things.

1500
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:58,480
I love how deeply researched you are in Trump. I can only imagine how good your

1501
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:01,200
Trump impression is at this point. It's not very, sadly, it's not good.

1502
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:02,080
It's not, all right.

1503
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:07,280
No, and I'll say one other thing on that. Take trans because just to talk about it a little

1504
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:12,640
bit, we haven't dealt with it much. The trans issue has become huge, I believe, because the

1505
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:16,720
right is obsessed with it. The right is very much not concerned with gay men anymore. It used to

1506
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:21,760
be that gay men is like, oh, we have to stop gay men from adopting and unnatural and pedophiles.

1507
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:29,200
Now it's trans, it's drag shows, et cetera. I do think that there is a fair question to say,

1508
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:38,000
how do we deal with trans women in a very small short list of sports? That's real.

1509
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:46,000
My view, though, is I go, okay, we have all issues. We have issues related to gender and

1510
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:53,280
sexual orientation. We have issues related to trans. Within that, we have specifically sports.

1511
02:25:53,280 --> 02:26:01,920
You can eliminate from that trans men. Nobody's worried about biological women who are trans.

1512
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:06,720
And then when you say it's only in certain sports that it matters, hey, I'm right there.

1513
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:11,680
I think it's a complicated question. I don't know how we deal with it. I would ask leagues

1514
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:16,640
that have experienced with this already and whatever. The problem I have is pretending that

1515
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:26,080
the vanguard of left-wing politics right now is trying to force trans women into sports.

1516
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:31,760
It's just not the big issue that the right is reacting as if it were.

1517
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:40,400
But perhaps because of the right, it's forcing the left to continue discussing it. I mean,

1518
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:46,960
I feel like even in institutions, even at universities, it feels like these ideas of

1519
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:54,800
diversity, inclusion, and equity are taking some of the air out of the room of what a university

1520
02:26:54,800 --> 02:27:03,200
should also care about, which is merit. And it feels like reprioritization is going a little

1521
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:10,080
too far the other way, meaning prioritizing this kind of amorphous concept of diversity

1522
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:17,280
is moving away, is giving power to people that don't care about merit, and it just want to bully

1523
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:29,680
people with a big stick that says racism or sexism or anti-diversity. And it kind of suffocates the

1524
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:37,840
people that care about merit, about meritocracy, about inspiring people from all kinds of backgrounds

1525
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:41,840
to succeed. And it's just you kind of observe that. I'm sure that happens in all kinds of

1526
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:46,160
institutions. And the concern, I think the people that are concerned about wokeism

1527
02:27:46,160 --> 02:27:51,760
are concerned about at scale, what impact does that have on a society when there's so much

1528
02:27:51,760 --> 02:28:00,560
conversation about racism and oppression, not to talk about merit, like who's the actual good

1529
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:05,600
person in the room, the best person in the room. Generically, that's a concern to me. The degree

1530
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:12,000
to which it's happening at different institutions, I think is worthy of exploration. I know people

1531
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:17,360
who work in academia that are getting out of academia because they don't like the environment

1532
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:21,600
on their campuses for exactly the reason you're saying. So it exists. There's no question about

1533
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:27,280
it. I also think that the idea of a perfect meritocracy is maybe not necessarily the goal,

1534
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:34,320
in the sense that when you talk about perfect meritocracy, someone wrote a book about this

1535
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:38,560
who I interviewed about a year and a half ago, whose name escapes me. There are problems with

1536
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:48,560
perfect meritocracy. I think what we want to do is generate roughly equal opportunity for people,

1537
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:54,640
understanding that there is going to be an outcome on a gradient or a bell curve, allowing people,

1538
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:59,040
generally speaking, to determine the path that they want to take and giving them,

1539
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:05,600
if it's possible, the ability to pursue that without suppressing, limiting. I mean,

1540
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:10,640
this is like relatively uncontroversial stuff among, I would argue 95% of the left

1541
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:15,200
with the caveats of what you're talking about, which I agree exist.

1542
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,360
It would be nice to know the actual data. Sometimes people blow stuff out of proportion.

1543
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:25,520
What is, it's hard to measure how much self-censorship happens at university campuses.

1544
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:30,480
That's true. I think also it's sort of like the pit bull bite stories thing,

1545
02:29:30,560 --> 02:29:35,600
where when a pit bull bites a person, it's more likely to be reported on

1546
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:42,000
because it fits a certain narrative. There are right-wing publications that are very

1547
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:48,240
interested in making this seem as if it is an epidemic. I'm the first to say it is happening

1548
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:52,800
to a degree. I don't know the degree that it's happening to. I know a lot of people in academia,

1549
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:54,720
only a couple of them say that it's an issue.

1550
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:59,120
Would they say it though if they believed it?

1551
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,480
I think they would say it to me. These are just personal contacts.

1552
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:03,760
It's not like I'm going to go blabbing.

1553
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:09,520
To push back, I kind of agree with you, but at the same time, most, I mean,

1554
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:14,960
I'm deeply connected in academia of a huge number of colleagues. Most people

1555
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:20,480
self-censor by not thinking about it at all. They're like, screw it.

1556
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:21,280
That's deeper.

1557
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:25,680
Whatever. I'm just going to focus on the thing I love doing, which is the work,

1558
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:33,200
and they don't think about, they basically remove themselves from politics and social issues,

1559
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:37,040
and they just kind of say, I'm going to do my engineering. I'm going to do my mathematics.

1560
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:41,440
Sure. The problem with that is it's kind of, you can't go anywhere further to figure it out.

1561
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:44,480
It's sort of like there's this funny clip where Jordan Peterson says,

1562
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:48,240
even atheists are actually religious. They just don't know it. It's like,

1563
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:52,800
it's hard to test that. I don't know. Okay. I mean, I don't, but it's a fair point.

1564
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:56,960
That means there may be some people, if it has become so toxic for some people,

1565
02:30:56,960 --> 02:31:01,040
they may have repressed it way down into their subconscious, but I don't know how we would

1566
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:05,760
know that. But you know symptoms of it because when certain people speak up,

1567
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:13,520
kind of lightly, and then a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old responds and is outraged,

1568
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:20,080
the fact that the administration listens to that 19 and 20-year-old and then reprimands

1569
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:26,080
whoever spoke up a little bit, that's a really dangerous sign to me. And I don't really care

1570
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:31,200
about these, like, so I'm more with you. I don't think it's a big issue, but then I notice it.

1571
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:36,240
I wonder, wait a minute, would this kind of environment allow a young Noam Chowsky to be

1572
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:43,600
around? With this environment allow, like, I don't know, like what tenure was designed for,

1573
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:49,680
which is to have controversial thinkers and not kind of weird controversial things,

1574
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:53,440
but really people that challenge things that should be challenged.

1575
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:59,920
Yeah. I sympathize with that significantly. I always try to look at specific examples.

1576
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:03,920
And sometimes I'll look at people, I'll ask for them and people will send me five.

1577
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:08,720
And one of them is a legit bona fide example of what we're talking about. And four are kind of like,

1578
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,640
there was a complaint and it was investigated, but the teacher's tenure was never in jeopardy.

1579
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:21,120
And I don't know that I chalk this up to a big woke event. What do you think the kind of apparatus

1580
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,400
of the four-year degree in college is going to look like in 20 years?

1581
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:31,840
Oh, that's, I mean, we're like, day by day, that seems to be changing with GPT. I don't know if

1582
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:36,400
you've gotten a chance to interact with chat GPT. Absolutely. My entire show now is written by chat

1583
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:45,520
GPT. I mean, there's a, that's partially a joke. It is only because it stopped looking at the

1584
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:49,920
internet in 2021. If it was current, I could completely just tune it out. No, I'm kidding,

1585
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:55,760
but it's a fascinating tool. And it's changing the nature of how we do homework assignments,

1586
02:32:55,760 --> 02:33:00,480
it's changing the nature of how we learn, how we look up new information, how we explore

1587
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:07,520
information, how we care about things we're interested in. I think it, I don't think we'll have

1588
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:14,400
value for a university degree in 20 years the way we do now. I just think it changes everything. I

1589
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:22,400
think language models. I mean, Google search has already, and Wikipedia has already transformed,

1590
02:33:22,400 --> 02:33:29,120
I would say, our civilization, but it's, there was still a value for basic education. I don't,

1591
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:36,560
I think that starts to dissipate with chat GPT. So I don't, I don't know. I really, I really don't

1592
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:41,280
think there's a university the way we think of a university in 20, 20, 30 years. I mean,

1593
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:46,320
I have a personal interest in it, in that my daughter is 10 months old. And I'm doing the 529

1594
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:52,880
account, I'm going through the motions as if, but I also recognize, you know, if she went to the

1595
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:59,680
schools I went to, just with the rate of tuition increase, you're talking 200K a year by the time

1596
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:05,440
she's 18. And what happens with wages relative to that, this is like separate from the technological

1597
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:13,120
thing. And in my mind, I'm thinking, is this going to continue being the right path? What I would

1598
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:19,840
love to see is so many people that I interact with just by virtue of what I do, have no foundation

1599
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:24,080
in critical thinking, epistemology, philosophy, or media literacy. And

1600
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:31,600
if there were some way to make that the core of some basic education that everybody's receiving,

1601
02:34:32,560 --> 02:34:39,280
which goes beyond, you know, chat GPT can do so many things, but I've not yet seen good examples

1602
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:45,520
of how it can teach you to think. Maybe you have a different view on how chat GPT can teach a user

1603
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:51,680
to think, but those skills seem to be so lacking in so many of the people I interact with. If there's

1604
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:56,800
any positive change to come from a changing dynamic with higher education, I wish it would be to go

1605
02:34:56,800 --> 02:35:04,400
in that direction. Well, no, chat GPT is actually much better at helping me think than any educator,

1606
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:08,800
even books that I've encountered, because it's very good at presenting the full picture,

1607
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:14,880
even better than a lot of Wikipedia articles, you know, on questions like the virus leak from

1608
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:20,480
a lab, the COVID leak from a lab. This just presents to you all the different hypotheses,

1609
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:27,280
the amount of evidence available to it. It's like a full, calm, objective picture of it.

1610
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:31,440
There's no partisanship. It's like a really nice list of things that's available.

1611
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:38,400
But I guess what I mean is, does it tell you how as a thinking human, you should evaluate the

1612
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:42,000
strength of each of the paragraphs it presents to you? You can literally ask the question.

1613
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:45,520
You can ask it to do it. Oh, fair. Okay. And then it's actually a fun,

1614
02:35:46,720 --> 02:35:53,280
it's fun to ask chat GPT that question, because you get good answers. And so you basically

1615
02:35:54,400 --> 02:36:02,880
have a kind of socratic, like a deep, intimate, like great podcast style conversation with an AI

1616
02:36:02,880 --> 02:36:09,280
system every single day, for as many hours as you want, especially as it improves and as the

1617
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:14,240
interfaces by which you communicate with a thing improves. So yeah, I think, I think it will do

1618
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:20,240
exactly that, which is teach you how to think, because you will offload the memory effects

1619
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:29,440
and equations and whatever else school teaches you, you'll offload that to AI. And instead,

1620
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:35,920
you'll be using your human mind, which is what it for now is uniquely good at, which is asking good

1621
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:42,240
questions, thinking through the complexities of issues when there's multiple perspectives on it,

1622
02:36:42,240 --> 02:36:46,000
all of that. Well, then I stand corrected, maybe then I don't know what college is going to be in

1623
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:52,880
20 years. Well, but you were sort of commenting, I see to the financial aspect of it, like, why does

1624
02:36:52,880 --> 02:37:00,400
it even make sense? Yeah. I'm thinking about the transformative effects of AI and what starts

1625
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:08,720
to ask, what is even education? Right. What are you supposed, what is the purpose of education?

1626
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:13,520
So one is to give you kind of a background knowledge on a bunch of different topics,

1627
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:17,680
but the other is to discover the thing you're truly passionate about, and the thing you're

1628
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:22,640
really good at, such that you can make money, and you can contribute to society and have a

1629
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:28,880
fulfilling life. Yeah, and also learning to interact with other people, relationships are built,

1630
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:34,640
socializing, and so many other things as well. But is that, you know, that is the big value of

1631
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:39,840
university? Yeah. And maybe you should be called something else. Can you get that for less than

1632
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:44,400
200K a year somewhere else? Yeah, no, it's a fair question. Kind of social club. And you know, one

1633
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:48,800
of the things I think about also is people who are well connected, I mean, this has always been,

1634
02:37:48,800 --> 02:37:54,480
this isn't new, right? But if you're well connected, and you have a sort of drive towards

1635
02:37:54,480 --> 02:37:58,480
entrepreneurship and doing your own thing, and you're not pursuing a field that is very licensing

1636
02:37:58,480 --> 02:38:04,800
dependent like medicine or law, getting started four years earlier with some internships can be

1637
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:10,080
a privilege in some cases. But again, that path is available to the people that would likely do

1638
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:15,520
well regardless of whether they went to college. And so it's a very privileged, self-selected group

1639
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:24,000
anyway. Another question from Reddit. Ask David to explain why American-style libertarianism

1640
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:30,000
is an unserious philosophy. I don't know what they mean by American-style libertarianism.

1641
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:38,080
I've talked before about these kind of utopian libertarians where, you know, we have, we don't

1642
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:45,760
have police. You just kind of like hire a for-profit company if you want protection. And if there's a

1643
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:50,720
conflict between two of these private security companies, then I don't know, you figure it out

1644
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:55,920
somehow. So it's almost like anarchism. So take care of that. Yeah. If by, I don't know what the

1645
02:38:55,920 --> 02:39:01,360
question means by that American-style libertarianism. But in general, my problems with libertarianism

1646
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:08,320
as it is often presented come from the work of sociology as well as human psychology,

1647
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:13,520
which is the reality that once you get a group that's bigger than 150 people,

1648
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:20,080
you really have to start centralizing some decisions unless you're going to subdivide

1649
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:26,480
the 150 endlessly into 275s that now no longer have contact. But then that's not really one

1650
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:32,320
society. Now it's two. I've not seen good evidence. And I've read a fair bit about this that once you

1651
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:38,720
get beyond 150, you can keep all decisions decentralized. And once you say some things

1652
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:44,560
need to be centralized, then it's a matter of how you do it. And it's going to be some version

1653
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:49,680
of government that conflicts with aspects of libertarianism. Well, it could be companies,

1654
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:55,520
right? It could be more market-driven, which is the idea of anarchism that you're not,

1655
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:59,760
you don't give any centralized entity a monopoly over violence.

1656
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:08,560
You know, and then if you think that the markets are efficient at delivering, especially in this

1657
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:16,480
21st century and beyond, where a market could have perfect information about people. So one

1658
02:40:16,480 --> 02:40:20,800
of the issues is that you can manipulate markets because there's not perfect information. But now

1659
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:30,240
in a digital age, we can be higher bandwidth participants in the market. So if you're choosing

1660
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:34,720
between different security companies or you're choosing between different providers of different

1661
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:41,120
services, you could do so more efficiently and more effectively in the digital space.

1662
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:48,400
So you could kind of imagine it, but we haven't successfully done it without governments.

1663
02:40:48,400 --> 02:40:55,520
Yeah. And I think there's a practical, once you get beyond 150, you also start specializing.

1664
02:40:56,720 --> 02:41:01,040
It just is a matter of fact, you don't have, everybody isn't growing their own food. Some

1665
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,600
people grow the food and other people do other things. And you come across a lot of the problems

1666
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:10,960
that started at the agricultural revolution. And whether you say that it's a company that's

1667
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:16,320
solving it or a government, the problems are going to be very similar. And I've not read

1668
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:19,680
anything that to my satisfaction explains how you deal with that.

1669
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:24,160
Well, there's underlying principles of libertarianism, which is putting priority at the

1670
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:30,480
freedom of the individual, right? And that's a compelling notion.

1671
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:35,440
Yeah. Whenever I do these various political compass things that put you on two axes,

1672
02:41:35,440 --> 02:41:41,920
on the authoritarian libertarian axis, I am way down on the libertarian side as a left libertarian.

1673
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:50,560
So my tendencies are always anti-authoritarian and towards that option when it makes sense.

1674
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:54,800
So I sympathize with that a lot. Another question from Reddit,

1675
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:58,880
ask David what issues he disagrees with you on. Is there something?

1676
02:41:58,880 --> 02:42:03,760
I have no idea. Okay, that's great. There you go. There's no issues. Perfect agreement.

1677
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:08,800
What's your view on Tesla? That's a good opportunity to ask. What do you think is

1678
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:15,840
the strengths and weaknesses of Elon Musk? You mentioned Twitter, have you paid your $8?

1679
02:42:15,840 --> 02:42:19,600
I have not paid my $8. I don't see the point in paying for it. I have no problem paying for

1680
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:27,040
services. I use a ton of services. I'll try the free. I'll go to the paid. Right now, so the way

1681
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:35,360
I used to use the verified feed was I would post a tweet and then the next day when I review what's

1682
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:38,800
going on in my social media, I would look at the replies to the tweet, which would give me a mix

1683
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:44,080
of replies from verified and unverified people. But then I would also look at the verified and see

1684
02:42:44,080 --> 02:42:52,480
who that are verified public folks have responded to me or maybe I want to engage with whatever

1685
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:57,920
the case may be. I don't even understand why I would look at the verified feed anymore. So I

1686
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:03,680
never do because it's random folks who I don't know. It sort of lost its utility to me.

1687
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:10,080
Oh, yeah. Sorry to interrupt. But the idea is if everybody who's human pays the $8,

1688
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:14,240
it shows to you that it's not bots. It's at least humans.

1689
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:17,600
From the reports about the number of people that have bought the blue checkmark,

1690
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:22,880
I think we may be a thousand years from enough signups in order to make that sort of like a

1691
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:26,800
reality. That was the idea. That was the idea. It's an interesting idea. Honestly,

1692
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:34,080
for my experience, obviously, I was seeing all sorts of attack comments, some of which were,

1693
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:38,240
I'm sure, from bots. But I'm ignoring all of those comments anyway. So it really didn't affect

1694
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:42,400
my experience that much. I mean, here's the thing about Elon. And I say this, people sometimes

1695
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:48,720
are like, David, you obviously hate Elon or you obviously love Elon. I was an investor in Tesla

1696
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:55,760
starting in 2015. I've since sold all my shares. Great run. I'm on my second Tesla right now.

1697
02:43:56,560 --> 02:44:01,600
I probably won't get a third one because I think that electric vehicle technology

1698
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:07,600
is now maturing such that when my lease is up, I'm going to have many more options with the

1699
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:11,200
range and charging network that's important to me. But I could be wrong. Maybe, you know, I don't

1700
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:16,720
know. I have no, the cult of personality around people, they mean nothing to me. So for me,

1701
02:44:16,720 --> 02:44:24,160
it's just like people are people. Nobody has only good ideas. Fine. I think that what Elon Musk did

1702
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:29,360
accelerating and pushing forward the battery and electric vehicle technology is unbelievable.

1703
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:38,400
It's a one person wrecking ball in the best sense of saying, we're not going to slow play this and do,

1704
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:45,600
okay, now Toyota hasn't actually entered, but now whoever, we've got a 90 mile range car and

1705
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:50,480
next year it'll be 110. And it's just like, we're doing this right now. You can compete or you can

1706
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:56,800
opt out and look at what's happened. Fantastic. On the Twitter side of things, I don't really get

1707
02:44:56,800 --> 02:45:03,200
the whole plan. I don't know if it started maybe as kind of a goof of some kind and it developed

1708
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:08,320
into, I guess I have to buy it. And I think something about it ended up with, there was a

1709
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:12,000
clause invoked where I think he did try to get out of buying it, but then was forced to to some

1710
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:17,840
degree. Yeah, he was forced. The way Twitter used to work was you followed people. And when you

1711
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:22,400
looked at your feed, you either saw the posts from the people you were following in reverse

1712
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:28,640
chronological order or posts from the people you followed algorithmically tailored to what

1713
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:35,280
you're most likely to want to see. And if you didn't follow someone, you generally wouldn't

1714
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:40,480
see their posts unless it was like a sponsored tweet or someone you follow quoted or retweeted them.

1715
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:48,080
Fine. The for you feed, TikTok, I believe first had a so-called for you feed. The idea is this is

1716
02:45:48,080 --> 02:45:54,480
stuff you might like based on, I don't know what, either demographic data about you, your other

1717
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:59,680
habits, whatever. And so it's useless to me. It's just basically mostly right-wing content that

1718
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:04,880
is not interesting to me. Why do you think that is? I mean, so the signals that are used to generate

1719
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:14,000
the for you page is looking at all your likes, all your comments, all your blocks and mutes,

1720
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:19,040
and all that. I mean, I don't know what I was looking at. Okay. So it's supposed to be very

1721
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:23,760
pleasant for you. I'm sure other people go, wow, this for you thing is awesome. Like if you had

1722
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:29,760
insert some right-wing or sitting here, they would go, Twitter used to suppress right-wing voices.

1723
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:34,400
And now finally, they're getting the fair shake that they deserve in the for you feed.

1724
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:41,200
Okay. I mean, I wonder if there's left-wing folks setting their feelings of Elon aside

1725
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:45,680
that are enjoying the for you page. That's a really important question because it's supposed to be

1726
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:48,320
people on the left and people on the right should be enjoying the for you page.

1727
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:54,880
Sure. Yeah. I mean, so for me, my thought on Elon is some incredible successes. I don't know about

1728
02:46:54,880 --> 02:47:01,840
Twitter. I do think that I don't believe Elon is a right-winger. And when you see interviews with him,

1729
02:47:03,440 --> 02:47:10,320
certainly, at least socially and in many ways culturally, seems very moderate or even

1730
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:14,160
somewhat on the left in my experience. So I don't think it's Elon's a right-winger. I don't that's

1731
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:20,640
not an interesting critique. It does seem though that throughout the Twitter escapade, he certainly

1732
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:26,560
ended up closer to some voices that may be influencing him in a particular way.

1733
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:32,880
That's giving some people that impression. But as far as the Elon hate or the Elon love,

1734
02:47:33,440 --> 02:47:37,600
it's just a person who's done some interesting things, some of which I like and some of which

1735
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:48,160
I could kind of leave aside. I have seen folks drift towards the right more

1736
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:53,200
in response to just the viciousness of attacks from the left.

1737
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:59,200
Like who? Well, Elon. So you do think he's drifted towards the right?

1738
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:08,720
So I don't think at the core, but I think on the surface. I think Joe Rogan has as well

1739
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:15,200
on the surface because maybe you can correct me, but it feels like people on the left attack

1740
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:25,120
more viciously. That has not been my experience. Let me know because my sense was that they

1741
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:31,120
attack people on the left viciously as well. Left attacks its own because you're not progressive

1742
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:36,320
enough. It's just this kind of bullying that happens very intensely.

1743
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:46,080
No, you're 100% right that when the left has attacked me, it's almost as vicious as when

1744
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:52,800
the right attacks me. The difference in my experience is it's a smaller contingent on the

1745
02:48:52,800 --> 02:48:57,760
left that's willing to levy those attacks against me, but I'm on the left. So to some degree,

1746
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:03,680
you could say, well, that's to be expected. There is toxicity on the left.

1747
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:08,080
But it's intense, isn't it? And that's what I mean. The attacks on people who are on the left,

1748
02:49:09,280 --> 02:49:13,200
you're not left enough. Yeah, that's no. And it is a small number of people.

1749
02:49:13,200 --> 02:49:21,600
I can't deny that that is absolutely a real phenomenon. And depending on what sort of

1750
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:28,080
topics you take on publicly, you are going to suffer the wrath of that to a greater or lesser

1751
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:33,040
degree. But with all of these things, what I always go back to is, I probably would have

1752
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:36,960
more disagreements with Rogan today than the last time I was on his show, which was at the beginning

1753
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:43,040
of the pandemic. And I've done clips critical of things that he has said, substantive, of course.

1754
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:48,960
To me, it's sort of like, oh, yeah, I could sit down with him and do a podcast and it would be

1755
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:53,200
zero big deal. And I would tell him, I stand by everything I said about what you said. And I

1756
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:57,840
would say it to you right now. There are people who write to me and go, oh, man, things must be

1757
02:49:57,840 --> 02:50:03,680
really, really tense now. If you were to, Rogan would never have you on because you disagree.

1758
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:07,760
He loves you. I'm sure he's just not thinking of me. I'm not the most important thing to Joe

1759
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:13,760
Rogan. I think both of us would be able to sit down and talk about every one of my criticisms.

1760
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:18,000
It would not be taken personally. And then we would move on and it would be the next day.

1761
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:22,080
You get attacked a lot. How do you not let that break you mentally?

1762
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:32,080
I don't know. So let's see. I try to, I mean, I'm in a toxic space. The news and politics,

1763
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:36,560
partisan news and politics, partisan news and politics on the internet with a social media

1764
02:50:36,560 --> 02:50:41,440
component, just completely and totally toxic. From a personal perspective, when I'm done producing

1765
02:50:41,440 --> 02:50:46,960
my last show of the week until Monday, I try to completely tune out from news and politics

1766
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:53,520
altogether and also make an effort to just not look at feedback and what's going on.

1767
02:50:53,520 --> 02:51:01,600
I also really limit my visibility. I don't need to read every comment. I don't need to

1768
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:07,200
look at every email or every tweet. I have 15 minutes each day where I go through my social

1769
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:13,440
media platforms, look at generally what has the reaction been, maybe include that in my assessment

1770
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:17,360
of how I want to tackle a certain issue if I missed a good point or something like that and

1771
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:21,120
basically try to move on. When something like we've talked about at the beginning happens,

1772
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:25,680
it becomes obsessive. I mean, it's unhealthy, right? Where I'm going, oh my God, who's attacking

1773
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:31,840
me now and scrolling? It becomes, you know, I'm sweating. It's horrible. But I think just like

1774
02:51:31,840 --> 02:51:37,760
limiting exposure to that and remembering that it is impossible to please everybody. And so I'd

1775
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:46,080
really rather have fresh, genuine views each day rather than views that are sort of restricted

1776
02:51:46,080 --> 02:51:49,520
and flattened by what I perceive to be people's preferences.

1777
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:55,680
So just can you speak a little more to the full process of creating the David Backman show?

1778
02:51:57,760 --> 02:51:59,840
You're doing five shows a week?

1779
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:04,560
I have the Letterman schedule, which means I do five shows in four days. I shoot Monday to

1780
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:10,640
Thursday, but we're doing five episodes. Basically, our guests we schedule in advance.

1781
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:17,520
I'm picking six to eight stories each day that are like I said, a blend of stuff I think will be

1782
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:23,600
interesting, things I want to talk about, and things where it's being discussed at one layer

1783
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:28,640
and I want to go deeper on it and I feel like I'm able to do that. I choose those stories in the

1784
02:52:28,640 --> 02:52:33,120
morning, record in the early afternoon, and we put the show out by that afternoon.

1785
02:52:34,080 --> 02:52:40,320
What's the preparation? What's the how do you take notes? Are you on a sheet of paper?

1786
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:45,280
No sheets of paper anymore. I used to do sheets of paper. I found something about it,

1787
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:51,360
like at work, the tactile nature of it. It became inconvenient for sharing the notes with my team.

1788
02:52:51,360 --> 02:52:57,360
But basically, we use a wiki type system. It's called Media Wiki, which is basically like a

1789
02:52:57,360 --> 02:53:03,120
Wikipedia clone. Old school. Yeah, old school. So we can have pages for every guest, every topic.

1790
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:06,960
Oh, that's interesting. I haven't heard that. Yeah. I don't know anyone else who's using it. It

1791
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:13,520
works really well. It's so fast and it takes up almost no space. So it just is a really good tool.

1792
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:19,920
When my team, when we book a guest and they have notes from the publicist, they'll put it in there

1793
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:25,120
and then I can access it. So I'm basically working off of notes rather than a script. I'll pull any

1794
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:34,000
audio-visual stuff that I want so that that's available. And it's really a very seamless,

1795
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,280
you know, we're doing this every day, four days a week. And so we have it down to a well-oiled

1796
02:53:37,280 --> 02:53:44,800
machine. Where do you get ideas from? Everywhere. I have a bunch of subreddits that I follow that I

1797
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:50,800
think are talking about interesting things. I have a curated list for which I still use Twitter,

1798
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:55,680
and it is very good for this. It's a curated private list of journalists that I think are

1799
02:53:55,680 --> 02:54:02,400
doing interesting work. So I'll see what's there. Look at the sort of standard news reporting,

1800
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:10,240
wire services, AP and Reuters. Glance at what? Everything from Drudge to CNN to whoever is

1801
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:17,200
covering that day. Look at Google News. How do you try to fact check stuff on your show?

1802
02:54:17,280 --> 02:54:22,240
So like is there sources or is there a process? I always try to get to a primary source first

1803
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:28,720
and foremost for the facts of the story. And then I'll use other tools for background research.

1804
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:36,880
Oftentimes Wikipedia's footnotes, I find to be useful tools. Chat GPT is a good one. You really

1805
02:54:36,880 --> 02:54:41,920
have to fact check it, but it'll give you ideas of where to do the fact checking, which I think is

1806
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:45,680
fantastic. Sometimes it gives me information that's flat out wrong. And when you ask for the source,

1807
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:50,880
it's like, oh, yeah, that actually is not real, which is, hey, it's part of the process.

1808
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:56,320
And then when there's like an expertise type of thing, if it's a breaking legal matter,

1809
02:54:56,320 --> 02:55:00,800
I'll just call like a friend who's a lawyer or call a friend who's a doctor or something like that.

1810
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:06,880
If it lends itself to that. Let me ask you about the nature of truth. Do you think it's

1811
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:11,760
becoming more and more difficult to know what is true and will become continuously,

1812
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:15,280
continue to get more difficult, especially with GPT?

1813
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:23,360
I think the big difficulty is in getting people to agree as to what is a statement of fact

1814
02:55:23,360 --> 02:55:29,360
and what is a statement of opinion. I think once we can do that, reasonable people can more or

1815
02:55:29,360 --> 02:55:34,880
less agree on how to get to the truth. Or if we can't get to it, at least figure out how we would

1816
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:38,720
if the information were available. But the bigger challenge I'm having is

1817
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:44,640
someone will call in with an opinion, but say they want to talk about fact.

1818
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:50,320
And I have to explain to them, you're talking about an opinion and not a fact. And this goes

1819
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:56,240
back to the lack of critical thinking and lack of media literacy. But that's the bigger challenge

1820
02:55:56,240 --> 02:55:59,440
for me right now. But I mean, I think the big statements are always going to be

1821
02:56:00,160 --> 02:56:11,520
somewhat opinions. Like was the 2020 election fair? I think any answer to that is an opinion.

1822
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:14,960
Disagree. If we define fair.

1823
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:23,840
Well, yes. So then I don't think it's possible to define fair in a way that's not several paragraphs

1824
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:32,000
where each sentence now has facts, right? So what do you mean by fair? Is it who can show up

1825
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:38,880
to vote? What was the process of how easy it is to vote? Was there actual cheating going on?

1826
02:56:38,880 --> 02:56:42,720
And different like what is the evidence of that cheating? You have to actually get to the actual

1827
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:48,720
like details of a thing. High level, you know, everything is just going to be an opinion, it

1828
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:56,480
feels like. And you can approximate that to be like, it's a well-founded opinion. Well,

1829
02:56:56,480 --> 02:57:01,440
most of science is an opinion, even physics is an opinion. So like, I think there's a threshold

1830
02:57:01,440 --> 02:57:08,240
beyond which an opinion becomes like, this is a pretty reliable thing to assume for now that

1831
02:57:08,240 --> 02:57:15,440
that's okay. So let me revise. So I think maybe better said, I think that the difficulty,

1832
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:23,360
I mean, the process you described is probably the right process and it's exhausting for mundane

1833
02:57:23,360 --> 02:57:31,360
things and that causes major problems. If we were to say, is it better for the economy to have

1834
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:39,840
a tax rate on people making over a million dollars that's 20% or 50%? Okay. What do we mean by better

1835
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:45,360
for the economy? It's not an overwhelming task to decide on that. We could say, well, we'll say it's

1836
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:49,760
better for the economy by looking at what was the unemployment rate based on the tax rate on

1837
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:55,600
million, you know, people earning a million a year and what was GDP and whatever. Okay. We've

1838
02:57:55,600 --> 02:58:02,880
agreed. This is a statement. We are now in the realm of just determining what is given the parameters

1839
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:09,120
that we've established. I think that that's relatively doable. The issue is with the bigger

1840
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:14,880
ones like you're talking about where what do we mean by a fair election and fair in whose eyes and

1841
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:21,200
but I am with you that it often devolves into a conversation about opinions about what is fair

1842
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:28,000
rather than an ascertainment of the facts. Yeah. And it feels like maybe avoiding some

1843
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:33,440
of these big, maybe there's some trigger words too, maybe avoiding them allows you to actually

1844
02:58:33,440 --> 02:58:39,520
talk about the facts and through that educate yourself and learn about like whether the virus

1845
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:45,600
leaked from a lab or not. To me was always a super interesting question. I don't know why

1846
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:50,720
everybody got super touchy about it. Mostly people I know, colleagues, biologists thought

1847
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:58,400
it's pretty good likelihood that it leaked from a lab given everything. They just didn't the evidence

1848
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:03,760
is not there for a either one. And so like you should be able to just openly talk about it.

1849
02:59:03,760 --> 02:59:08,960
Unless you're in the high political office where there could be geopolitical consequences to your

1850
02:59:08,960 --> 02:59:12,240
statements. But in general, it's an interesting question. You should be able to talk about it.

1851
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:16,160
But there's no, first of all, there's not many facts around there, unfortunately.

1852
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:21,920
And a lot of very conclusive statements about especially in the early days were just opinions.

1853
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:28,000
And so you have to the idea of what is true and not becomes a little

1854
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:31,840
even mentioning the word truth in that context. It feels

1855
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:39,440
divisive. Yeah, I completely agree with you, which is strange. You think it shouldn't.

1856
02:59:39,440 --> 02:59:45,120
One of the really good opening questions that I've had work to my advantage when talking with

1857
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:50,400
people who I know disagree with me about a contentious topic is how do you think we would

1858
02:59:50,400 --> 02:59:58,400
figure out X? And it often gets people thinking first collaboratively. And obviously we might

1859
02:59:58,400 --> 03:00:02,560
have very different opinions. But with something like the COVID lab leak, I think it's an interesting

1860
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:07,520
one. Because if you say, okay, maybe it leaked, maybe it didn't. How would we figure that out?

1861
03:00:07,520 --> 03:00:12,240
Who would we trust to weigh in on that? What evidence would count? Now we're kind of on the

1862
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:18,720
same team. And then if we can establish that, then we're on a search for a capital T truth together

1863
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:23,200
or whatever. It's kind of pie in the sky. But in some conversations, I've actually had success with

1864
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:29,360
that. And then you can kind of realize if there's no amount of evidence that's going to prove

1865
03:00:29,360 --> 03:00:34,720
a show to you that you're wrong in your current opinion, that that's probably a really bad sign

1866
03:00:34,720 --> 03:00:38,720
for you. It's a waste. It may be a waste to pursue the conversation further at that point.

1867
03:00:40,720 --> 03:00:45,760
So, okay, you think Trump was a good president. How do you determine that? And what evidence

1868
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:50,160
might exist that would change your mind? There is no evidence. Trump was the best president ever.

1869
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:51,680
I think the conversation is probably done.

1870
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:53,120
Except Abraham Lincoln.

1871
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:59,440
You mentioned Israel-Palestine. Well, what do you think about the situation in Israel-Palestine?

1872
03:00:59,440 --> 03:01:03,920
Something you've thought about, spoken about for quite a time. Do you think we'll ever see peace

1873
03:01:03,920 --> 03:01:08,720
in this part of the world? I don't know. I mean, I could say yes.

1874
03:01:08,720 --> 03:01:09,840
That's an honest answer.

1875
03:01:09,840 --> 03:01:17,360
I could say yes. One of the problems is, and I'll give, you may not know that

1876
03:01:18,320 --> 03:01:23,760
there are people on the left of my audience who call me a Netanyahu shill,

1877
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:30,000
even though I've never been a supporter of Netanyahu and I'm on the left. I just don't think

1878
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:37,920
that some of the kind of black and white characterizations about Israel are even remotely

1879
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:43,520
accurate. And I think most people, it's become a sort of litmus test. Are you criticizing Israel

1880
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:46,960
enough? Are you showing us that you're actually left-wing? I don't do any of that stuff.

1881
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:49,200
I should really look at the situation for what it is.

1882
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:54,160
That's become a litmus test in American politics, in the spectrum of American politics.

1883
03:01:54,160 --> 03:02:05,200
Yes. My view, big picture, is that I don't think we're going to really get anywhere

1884
03:02:06,080 --> 03:02:13,680
until some pre-negotiated terms are set and the parties to do the negotiating

1885
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:19,200
are all good faith parties. For example, I don't think Israel's right-wing party,

1886
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:26,240
Likud, is a particularly good faith arbiter of peace because I think Likud benefits from

1887
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:31,600
their not being peace and the threat of violence. And there is violence. It's not just the threat

1888
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:37,680
of violence. I don't think Hamas is going to be an arbiter of peace for the Palestinian people

1889
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:42,880
either. I think the Palestinian Authority is a question mark. I'm not sure. So I think that

1890
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:48,800
there need to be some preconditions that would need to be set with regard to everything from

1891
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:56,320
settlements to a lot of this minutia. Big picture, though, if I imagine what the most likely solution

1892
03:02:56,320 --> 03:03:00,240
looks like, it doesn't mean it's a perfect solution. And obviously, it's a solution many people will

1893
03:03:00,240 --> 03:03:06,480
say it's not going to happen. I think it's a solution where the borders are similar to what

1894
03:03:06,480 --> 03:03:13,600
was being discussed in the Clinton era to some degree. As many of the settlements as possible

1895
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:18,800
have to go, understanding that some of the bigger ones are just not going to go. And there's going

1896
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:24,800
to have to be meaningful land swaps with which Yasser Arafat seemed to be amenable to when he

1897
03:03:24,800 --> 03:03:31,680
weighed in on it. I believe it was in the 90s. The topic of the Temple Mount and Jerusalem,

1898
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:39,360
is a complicated one. But I think that almost certainly East Jerusalem is going to have to be

1899
03:03:39,360 --> 03:03:45,520
part of an eventual Palestinian state. We can go as far as we want to with a lot of this stuff.

1900
03:03:45,520 --> 03:03:50,880
What role does U.S. have to play in this coming to the table with good faith parties?

1901
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:56,960
I don't know whether I go back and forth between believing that the U.S. should play a big role,

1902
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:04,560
to the U.S. should play essentially no role whatsoever. Because, of course, of the funding

1903
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:12,480
of Israel that the U.S. provides, it's not that I have a personal problem with American involvement

1904
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:16,880
and somebody like Bill Clinton was arguably relatively well positioned to try to make something

1905
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:22,880
happen. Will it be seen as credible on the global stage? And that's, I think, the most

1906
03:04:22,880 --> 03:04:27,920
important thing. Because at the end of whatever negotiation takes place, both sides need to agree

1907
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:33,440
that this is where we are renouncing all past claims. And in the future, if there's a disagreement,

1908
03:04:33,440 --> 03:04:37,680
we can't go back to that thing from the 80s or the 90s. That's just like a critical piece of this.

1909
03:04:37,680 --> 03:04:46,480
Yeah. It has to be stable and materialized into something stable over years.

1910
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:56,240
Yes. Another difficult conflict going on in the world is the war in Ukraine. What do you think

1911
03:04:56,240 --> 03:05:02,560
about the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022? I don't pretend to be an expert on this

1912
03:05:02,560 --> 03:05:06,960
issue. I think you probably know more about this than I do, just from the brief conversation we

1913
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:13,680
had before we started filming. My view as a general observer of geopolitics and the way that

1914
03:05:14,640 --> 03:05:20,480
this part of the world is related to American presidents over the last several cycles is I

1915
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:26,320
don't think it's controversial to say that this was a war of aggression, an invasion of aggression,

1916
03:05:26,320 --> 03:05:37,360
an act of aggression by Vladimir Putin. I do believe that if Trump had been re-elected,

1917
03:05:38,320 --> 03:05:43,040
Putin may have seen himself as having other tools with which to try to

1918
03:05:44,480 --> 03:05:50,800
expand influence that may have been different than geographic pursuits, geographic pursuits.

1919
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:59,680
But we don't know that for sure. I also have a really hard time imagining what the end of this

1920
03:05:59,680 --> 03:06:09,840
looks like. That's very scary because sometimes the most benign end seems to be that Putin ends

1921
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:18,800
up out of power either through no longer being alive or deposed in some way. It doesn't feel like

1922
03:06:18,800 --> 03:06:23,520
that latter is super likely. The former, there's reports about his health. I don't know how accurate

1923
03:06:23,520 --> 03:06:31,280
they are. It's just hard to imagine a face-saving exit that is going to be even remotely...

1924
03:06:32,800 --> 03:06:38,640
What's the word? It's not even a question of acceptable. It's not satisfying either. Just

1925
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:44,320
not tragic, I guess is what I'm looking for. In terms of Putin speaking to the Russian

1926
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:49,680
people and being able to figure out what to say, what kind of narrative to say why this word made

1927
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:57,440
sense. Yes. The same with the Ukrainian side to figure out how to exit this war. Yes. I mean,

1928
03:06:57,440 --> 03:07:04,160
to some degree, it requires Russian troops leaving Ukraine and that is somewhat under the

1929
03:07:04,160 --> 03:07:11,520
control. Of course, it's not up to Ukraine whether the initiative continues. But what I

1930
03:07:11,520 --> 03:07:18,480
am not thrilled with are some of the reflexive... If Trump had been in power instead of Joe Biden,

1931
03:07:19,440 --> 03:07:28,000
a lot of the reflexive comments about, oh, if you say Ukraine is just acting defensively,

1932
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:31,920
you're supporting neo-Nazis or some of these things that have come out of the American

1933
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:37,520
Republican Party seem both wacky and like they would be saying completely different things if

1934
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:41,840
Trump happened to be in the Oval Office. They're really proxy attacks on Joe Biden.

1935
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:47,200
Well, that in some sense, Ukraine is also kind of political litmus test

1936
03:07:48,240 --> 03:07:52,560
of how you speak about it. I think because of the huge amount of funding that's going

1937
03:07:53,360 --> 03:08:01,840
from US to Ukraine, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that this

1938
03:08:01,840 --> 03:08:06,320
topic has become politicized already. 100%. There are people like Marjorie Taylor-Green

1939
03:08:06,320 --> 03:08:11,440
and others saying, we should be doing nothing for Ukraine. Zelensky is a comedian and we're

1940
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:18,240
supporting neo-Nazis. That's it, full stop. And you either subscribe to that or you don't. And it

1941
03:08:18,240 --> 03:08:25,600
very quickly becomes as partisan as so many other issues. And it's really the most disappointing

1942
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:30,800
thing is that some of these issues become incredibly divisive, but they're simple. Like,

1943
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:35,040
for example, a conspiracy theory that we know isn't true. It shouldn't be divisive because

1944
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:40,800
it's so simple. Other issues become divisive and they are simplified, but in reality,

1945
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:45,280
they're extraordinarily complex. And you lose the ability to talk about the complexity

1946
03:08:45,280 --> 03:08:49,280
because they're becoming partisan. Do you think there will always be war in the world?

1947
03:08:49,920 --> 03:08:54,400
As a bunch of folks on the subreddit that were interested in your different complex

1948
03:08:54,400 --> 03:09:00,240
perspectives on foreign policy. So let's talk about war. When you look at the war in Ukraine,

1949
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:06,400
you look at what's going on in Israel in the past time. You look at the wars across the world.

1950
03:09:06,400 --> 03:09:11,440
Do you think there will always be war? As a redditor put it, is it a necessary evil

1951
03:09:11,440 --> 03:09:18,000
in the game of geopolitics? I used to have what I now believe is an extremely naive perspective,

1952
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:27,520
which is that if intelligent aliens arrived here, it would be so momentous for homo sapiens

1953
03:09:27,520 --> 03:09:33,920
that all of our differences would immediately be exposed to so insignificant, we would never fight

1954
03:09:33,920 --> 03:09:39,280
again and we would realize that intelligent life. And then I spoke to people who deal in space

1955
03:09:39,280 --> 03:09:44,560
exploration and other scientists and they all said, David, that's extraordinarily naive. There

1956
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:50,000
would be a period during which this was as momentous as you're imagining and then it would become

1957
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:56,640
normal and then we would go back to many of the same conflicts that we have now, sectarian, etc.

1958
03:09:56,640 --> 03:10:05,280
I think that in all likelihood, there will always be conflict between factions, whether it's what

1959
03:10:05,280 --> 03:10:11,280
we currently think of as war, probably not. I mean, it seems as though the tactics will evolve

1960
03:10:11,920 --> 03:10:16,880
and it will be less about missiles and I don't know where it's going to go. I don't know whether

1961
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:22,320
it's going to become more biological or cyber or certainly something we haven't even considered yet,

1962
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:26,880
but I think there will always be conflicts we would refer to in that way.

1963
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:32,480
Do you agree with Chomsky on his general harsh criticism of U.S. foreign policy in war,

1964
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:38,800
that many actions, military actions in the United States are criminal in nature,

1965
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:41,440
almost terrorist in nature?

1966
03:10:41,440 --> 03:10:49,040
I am not, it's been a decade or more since I've read any Chomsky and I don't keep up with everything

1967
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:54,320
that he has recently said, so I don't want to mischaracterize any of it.

1968
03:10:54,320 --> 03:11:02,400
In general, Americans are sold the view that we're the good guys spreading freedom across the world

1969
03:11:02,400 --> 03:11:07,680
and Chomsky takes a perspective that, yeah, but if you look at the number of civilians you kill

1970
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:11,440
while doing it, it's incomparable to any other military actions across the world.

1971
03:11:11,440 --> 03:11:17,440
Right, so I very much disagree with those who take the view that the U.S. is this

1972
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:24,720
wonderful global police force that's spreading democracy and fixing problems very, very much

1973
03:11:24,720 --> 03:11:30,160
wrong. I think where I've had disagreements with Chomsky in the past is more he frames,

1974
03:11:30,160 --> 03:11:36,880
he seems to frame the U.S. as a uniquely bad actor in some of these cases, and I think it's

1975
03:11:36,880 --> 03:11:44,480
more an outcropping of the size and wealth of the U.S. and less about uniquely negative intentions,

1976
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:48,800
and so I think that would be my general disagreement with Chomsky based on stuff I

1977
03:11:48,800 --> 03:11:53,680
read a decade ago. Well, he says that he lives in the United States, he's an American,

1978
03:11:53,680 --> 03:11:58,240
and so he feels his focus of criticism should be in America, and I think that's one of the great

1979
03:11:58,240 --> 03:12:05,200
things about being an American and being in America is the freedom to criticize harshly.

1980
03:12:05,200 --> 03:12:08,320
Sure. While being a university professor, by the way,

1981
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:14,000
he's basically the embodiment of why 10 years are a really valuable thing.

1982
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:21,040
I agree. Whether you agree with him or not. Question from Reddit. Ask David what he plans

1983
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:26,160
for his garden this year. Is this a joke or is this a- It's not a joke. I got into gardening a

1984
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:32,880
few years ago. Honestly, I'm with the baby, I can't do a garden this year, and I have a lot

1985
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:38,160
of travel coming up, so everything would die, but I did start to try to figure out gardening.

1986
03:12:38,160 --> 03:12:43,760
If you're stressed by the toxicity of the social media world, gardening is a great hobby. It really

1987
03:12:43,760 --> 03:12:48,800
is, but it is extraordinarily time-consuming, so I have no garden planned this year.

1988
03:12:49,760 --> 03:12:57,920
Other books or maybe movies in your life that had a big impact on you, you're thinking about that

1989
03:12:57,920 --> 03:13:05,920
diet. Has there been stuff you read? Forget about even just books like blogs or writers or

1990
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:13,280
just sources of information that molded you into the intellectual,

1991
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:19,680
into the political thing that you are. It's so hard. This is sort of like you

1992
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:25,280
win an Oscar and you want to make sure you thank all the right people. I read so much and have

1993
03:13:25,280 --> 03:13:32,640
been reading for so long that it's really hard to say, but I think certainly, for me, narrative

1994
03:13:32,640 --> 03:13:42,160
nonfiction has been a fantastic genre to learn not only about history, but also about people and

1995
03:13:42,160 --> 03:13:48,080
psychology. Very often, when people say, I don't really read, what can you recommend to me that

1996
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:55,360
might be interesting? Depending on knowing them to some degree, I'll give recommendations there.

1997
03:13:55,360 --> 03:14:00,160
In terms of just things I picked up recently that I think are interesting,

1998
03:14:01,360 --> 03:14:08,800
I've been reading a bunch of Neil Postman. I read a Jenny O'Dell has a new book on time and

1999
03:14:08,800 --> 03:14:15,840
the concept of saving time, spending time, etc. She just published it. Super interesting. I just

2000
03:14:15,840 --> 03:14:24,480
read Lansing's book about the Shackleton voyage in Antarctica in 1914, 15, and 16. Super interesting.

2001
03:14:24,640 --> 03:14:28,560
I'm really all over the map. I have that one on audiobook. I've been meaning to listen to it.

2002
03:14:28,560 --> 03:14:34,400
It's very interesting and it seems inconceivable how these guys survived. It's completely inconceivable

2003
03:14:34,400 --> 03:14:42,080
and yet they did. It kind of inspires you to think of space exploration and taking on similar

2004
03:14:42,080 --> 03:14:47,440
kinds of risky and dangerous journeys. In narrative nonfiction, I grew with you very much. I've been

2005
03:14:47,440 --> 03:14:54,160
reading a lot of 20th century history about Stalin and about Hitler. Rise and Fall of the

2006
03:14:54,160 --> 03:15:00,480
Third Reich. I've read twice now and I recommend it. What did you get out of reading at the second time?

2007
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:14,400
So, the second time I listened to the audiobook as I ran, I get the same thing from it as I get,

2008
03:15:14,400 --> 03:15:21,920
maybe reading Man's Search for Meaning, which is all the troubles of day to day in the modern

2009
03:15:21,920 --> 03:15:30,480
world kind of fade away and dissipate when I'm thinking about the, you know, basically the

2010
03:15:30,480 --> 03:15:37,920
embodiment of evil at scale at that recent time in human history. So, it makes me sort of appreciate

2011
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:43,040
all the, it fills me with gratitude to have all the freedoms, all the just simple joys of life that

2012
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:51,600
we have today. And I think the second time I was, as I was reading it, because William Shire was there,

2013
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:55,920
he's the author, he was there through the whole thing, you start to pick up little details as

2014
03:15:55,920 --> 03:16:04,240
opposed to like big things, you start to pick up the little quirks of how history turns and just

2015
03:16:04,240 --> 03:16:10,160
like these little events. You notice of the dynamics between people in a room during a meeting

2016
03:16:10,240 --> 03:16:14,480
with Hitler. You just notice these little things that are mentioned because he was either there

2017
03:16:14,480 --> 03:16:20,400
directly or heard it the next day. So, you get, that's why to me, Rise and Fall, the third rank

2018
03:16:20,400 --> 03:16:27,840
is interesting is because it's by a guy who's there, who's reporting on it, versus a sort of a

2019
03:16:27,840 --> 03:16:34,080
more distant, displaced retelling. And I also like biographies, I'm a big fan of biographies.

2020
03:16:34,640 --> 03:16:38,720
And Walter Isaacson has just written some incredible ones. There's Steve Jobs and

2021
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:44,880
Einstein, all that kind of stuff. Victor Frankel's book is one I've read a bunch of times. And it's

2022
03:16:44,880 --> 03:16:49,360
so short. And you know, reading in general, I know a lot of people who read way more than I do.

2023
03:16:49,360 --> 03:16:53,280
And I also know a lot of people who don't read at all. I mean, they haven't read a book since

2024
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:59,040
college, essentially. To me, it's almost like the amount I get from it, it's almost like a secret

2025
03:16:59,120 --> 03:17:04,960
weapon, where when I think, you know, in two or three or 400 pages, which I can read in whatever,

2026
03:17:04,960 --> 03:17:10,480
10 days or however long it takes reading 30 pages a day, the amount of information

2027
03:17:11,280 --> 03:17:17,040
insights into so many aspects of the human psyche that I can get, it's sort of like,

2028
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:21,200
it's not like I'm in a competition for anything in particular with anybody, I just do my show.

2029
03:17:21,200 --> 03:17:26,160
But it's sort of like, if I'm reading dozens of books a year, and you're reading zero,

2030
03:17:26,880 --> 03:17:32,880
I'm exposed to so many different things and ideas that are not even in your universe. It just

2031
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:38,560
seems like the power of reading just seems overwhelming. I had speaking or getting attacked.

2032
03:17:38,560 --> 03:17:46,480
I had a fun time getting attacked a few months ago for publishing a reading list. So I'm reading

2033
03:17:46,480 --> 03:17:53,680
at least a book a week. I read 18 or 19 books from the beginning of the year. You got attacked for

2034
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:59,520
the books you chose or for this? I don't know for what, but it became quite viral. Attacked for

2035
03:17:59,520 --> 03:18:06,640
reading. That's something. So basically what happened is that people, I actually don't,

2036
03:18:07,280 --> 03:18:12,400
it's not worth folks who know, know, fair, folks who don't, don't even worry about it.

2037
03:18:12,400 --> 03:18:19,280
It's the, what I really loved about being attacked for it is it shows you can get attacked for anything.

2038
03:18:19,280 --> 03:18:24,400
Apparently. It's, so it's not like I did something wrong. It was kind of a beautiful thing. It was

2039
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:33,600
just the most intensely beautiful display of absurdity of Twitter and the internet,

2040
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:36,960
that there would be, there were articles written about me with the book list.

2041
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:45,120
There's no bad books on it. The thing I was being mocked for is reading Dostoevsky, reading stuff

2042
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:52,400
that sounds like a high school reading list. Oh, I see. Or all these kinds of aspects of the

2043
03:18:52,400 --> 03:18:59,440
reading list, which doesn't stand up to any sort of legitimate kind of criticism. But the fact that

2044
03:18:59,440 --> 03:19:04,400
people are just looking for single words or single aspects of a tweet and so on to criticize.

2045
03:19:05,360 --> 03:19:11,200
It actually forced me to, because I released a video about, you know, summarizing my take

2046
03:19:11,200 --> 03:19:15,680
away from, from one of the books and I've been meaning to do more and more. But every time I

2047
03:19:15,680 --> 03:19:22,400
start to like, want to record it, I have this negative feeling. They kind of ruin the fun

2048
03:19:22,400 --> 03:19:28,000
of sharing with others. I know exactly what you're talking about. My advice on that is don't do it.

2049
03:19:28,880 --> 03:19:32,720
Just don't record it. Yeah. Because, and, and is that what you basically, yeah.

2050
03:19:32,720 --> 03:19:38,160
But I, I think time cures it. But for now, I decided not to. Yes. It's just until I'm,

2051
03:19:38,960 --> 03:19:44,320
until I feel joy when I do it. Yeah. We are in such a privileged position to even be able to do this

2052
03:19:44,320 --> 03:19:51,200
sort of thing, right? I have taken on projects and then it sort of sounds good or I end up doing it

2053
03:19:51,200 --> 03:19:55,440
because there's some third party that brings the idea and I feel like I can't really say no or

2054
03:19:55,440 --> 03:19:59,840
whatever. And then when I get in front of the camera or I have to write something for a while,

2055
03:19:59,840 --> 03:20:06,800
I did a newspaper column that I hated doing. I realized that I'm ruining the exact thing

2056
03:20:06,800 --> 03:20:11,200
that I have worked to build, which is that I can just do whatever I want. Why am I doing this?

2057
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:16,160
And sometimes it takes me a week to realize it. Sometimes it takes me a year, but just don't do

2058
03:20:16,160 --> 03:20:21,120
it. That's the, in this case in particular, it's also the, there's a private thing I enjoy, which

2059
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:28,080
is reading. Right. And if sharing that private thing you enjoy is not fun, then just don't share it.

2060
03:20:28,800 --> 03:20:35,120
That that's, yeah, there's certain things, there's certain private things that should remain private.

2061
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:41,440
That's like, which is one of the first things ever. I'm the same person privately as I am publicly,

2062
03:20:41,440 --> 03:20:46,480
but the books, it's like, man, I don't get to share. I guess through these conversations I can

2063
03:20:47,360 --> 03:20:52,400
share some of the stuff I'm reading and enjoying it because it sucks. It sucks to get

2064
03:20:52,400 --> 03:20:56,400
attacked for stuff and it sucks to get attacked for stuff you love.

2065
03:20:56,400 --> 03:21:02,560
Yeah, especially reading. I mean, it's, you know, that's the bottom of the barrel. I have these ideas

2066
03:21:02,640 --> 03:21:08,160
where I'll go, you know, maybe for my next thing, I'll go from politics, which is so toxic,

2067
03:21:08,160 --> 03:21:12,560
I'll go to travel blogging because I, there's so many travel bloggers I follow and there's

2068
03:21:12,560 --> 03:21:18,160
so many interesting places. And then I go, wait a second, I like traveling and just hanging out.

2069
03:21:18,160 --> 03:21:22,000
Now traveling is going to be my job and now I've got to bring two cameras with me and I've got to

2070
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:26,000
get shots and I've got to film my food and I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to do what

2071
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:30,720
I'm doing, but then I'll travel when I want to take a vacation. And of course, some of it could

2072
03:21:30,720 --> 03:21:37,840
be fun. I mean, I have to say when I did one video on a book in 1984, I really enjoyed it,

2073
03:21:37,840 --> 03:21:45,680
the whole process was fun. It was, I don't think I've ever thought as hard about a book when I

2074
03:21:45,680 --> 03:21:50,880
had to make a video about it because I had to like, you know, I read 1984, I don't know many times,

2075
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:59,360
probably five, 10 times. I don't remember. I read Animal Farm way more. But I don't think, I was like,

2076
03:21:59,360 --> 03:22:03,600
what do I think about? Like what are the key takeaways for me? I didn't really know. Like

2077
03:22:03,600 --> 03:22:07,360
if you asked me what I think about, even Animal Farm, because I haven't done that one, and I've

2078
03:22:07,360 --> 03:22:13,040
read that one, I don't know, over 50 times, it's probably my favorite book is like, I would have

2079
03:22:13,040 --> 03:22:18,640
to struggle and making a video about it, basically a little mini lecture, forced me to actually have

2080
03:22:18,640 --> 03:22:24,080
an opinion about the details of it and to do enough research to think like, okay, what is the

2081
03:22:24,080 --> 03:22:28,960
historical context of this book? I mean, it allowed me to say interesting and to think interesting

2082
03:22:28,960 --> 03:22:35,040
stuff about the book. I found it to be really rewarding to basically the old Feynman thing,

2083
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:40,960
one of the best ways to learn is to teach. Yeah, I can't think of one thing I would say

2084
03:22:40,960 --> 03:22:45,120
about Animal Farm. And I read it again, not that long ago, but I don't know what comment

2085
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:49,440
you're gonna have. You kind of have a generic comment about like authoritarianism and so on,

2086
03:22:49,440 --> 03:22:55,120
whatever. Yeah. But there could be interesting quirks of the book and the characters and how

2087
03:22:55,840 --> 03:23:01,520
corruption happens. You could say all kinds of stuff that it may be contrasting it. Like,

2088
03:23:01,520 --> 03:23:10,640
even when 1984 allowed me to contrast with Brave New World and how that 1984 was politicized

2089
03:23:10,640 --> 03:23:14,000
and how it's used by the Republican Party of today, like you could say a lot of interesting

2090
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:17,920
stuff if you like to think about it and write it down or sheet of paper, maybe you don't need to

2091
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:24,480
make a video about it. So I found it to be really rewarding in general. So I probably will do more

2092
03:23:24,560 --> 03:23:28,560
of it. But not always. Not as a main profession, just like with the travel blogging. I agree with

2093
03:23:28,560 --> 03:23:33,360
that. I mean, you get threatened a lot. You get attacked a lot online. Do you think about your

2094
03:23:33,360 --> 03:23:38,880
mortality? Well, the other day I went to the doctor and he said, you know, next physical,

2095
03:23:38,880 --> 03:23:43,840
we're going to be talking about a lot of new things. And so I was thinking about it a lot

2096
03:23:43,840 --> 03:23:51,200
that day. Yeah. No, I mean, it's funny. I recently did a bunch of estate stuff. Yeah.

2097
03:23:51,280 --> 03:23:57,360
And when you have intellectual property, there's a question of like, okay, I have my assets, but

2098
03:23:57,360 --> 03:24:05,600
also if I died tomorrow, especially in a particularly fiery death, my YouTube channel would probably,

2099
03:24:05,600 --> 03:24:09,760
for a while, generate more money because it would be like, oh my goodness, this person died in a

2100
03:24:09,760 --> 03:24:14,080
terrible, what happens with a future revenue stream and all these different things? And it

2101
03:24:14,080 --> 03:24:19,680
got me thinking about legacy and about the fact that people who do this sort of thing, it's kind

2102
03:24:19,680 --> 03:24:25,840
of a new thing in a sense. And so, you know, if you work at ABC News, at some point you just retire

2103
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:32,000
and someone else fills in for you, how does my career wind down given like, I don't actually

2104
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:39,440
know the answer. I'm not sure. What is it? I just one day stop posting videos, but all my content

2105
03:24:39,440 --> 03:24:46,320
stays up, getting fewer and fewer views, or do I delete everything? Do I, I don't know. What is

2106
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:50,720
I mean, so my trip to Ukraine, because I knew I was going to the front,

2107
03:24:50,720 --> 03:24:57,120
is the first time I did a recorded video if I die. Oh, and I posted it and I give instructions to

2108
03:24:58,480 --> 03:25:04,320
folks what to do. So like, there's a closure. Yeah. But it's an interesting process. Like,

2109
03:25:04,320 --> 03:25:10,720
what happens to your, at which point does GPT take over and continue tweeting for David Packard?

2110
03:25:10,720 --> 03:25:15,040
Well, the tweeting I care less about right now, unless blue becomes something unbelievable,

2111
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:19,680
I'm less worried about Twitter. But some of my audience members have been saying, you know,

2112
03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:26,000
some of these tools, David, are getting good enough that we could clone your voice and also

2113
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:32,320
make it match video. And with scripts, you could just keep pumping out content,

2114
03:25:32,320 --> 03:25:36,080
even if you were gone. And I said, now that I'm interested in that I want to learn more about.

2115
03:25:37,760 --> 03:25:42,400
Boy, it's going to be a weird future. What advice do you have to young folks

2116
03:25:43,120 --> 03:25:47,920
that are facing this future? Almost always, it's some version of

2117
03:25:49,120 --> 03:25:54,800
start right away. And that applies in so many different ways. So if you're thinking about,

2118
03:25:54,800 --> 03:26:00,160
oftentimes the context is people want to do what I do. And I always say, do not sit around for a

2119
03:26:00,160 --> 03:26:06,720
year thinking about lighting. This is how you never do anything. And I dozens of people who I

2120
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:11,760
felt obligated to talk to on the phone because of a personal connection, I go through all the advice

2121
03:26:12,400 --> 03:26:17,760
and I can tell they're not going to do it. They just they're it's already sounding too complicated.

2122
03:26:17,760 --> 03:26:21,440
And so instead, they'll sort of say, well, I got to get the right lighting and the right room and

2123
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:26,560
the best thing you can do no matter what you're doing is just start right away. And that applies

2124
03:26:26,560 --> 03:26:30,720
in this business. And in whatever else you're doing, if you want to learn a new thing, find a new

2125
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:36,640
hobby, the ability to get data right away about what's working, what's not working and whether

2126
03:26:36,640 --> 03:26:42,320
you even like this approach that you're taking is so valuable. And it will allow you to iterate.

2127
03:26:42,320 --> 03:26:46,400
And the sooner you do it, the cost to a change of direction will also be lower.

2128
03:26:47,200 --> 03:26:51,280
If there's any I don't do like self help or generic advice type stuff. But the one thing

2129
03:26:51,280 --> 03:26:57,360
that applies in so many situations is situations is just try it right away and iterate from there.

2130
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:03,440
Yeah, start today, and then do it every day. Or decide, hey, you know what I figured out,

2131
03:27:03,440 --> 03:27:09,840
I don't actually want to do it. Yeah, and iterate. Yeah. Well, usually you'll discover you do.

2132
03:27:12,240 --> 03:27:16,160
You think we'll make it out of the century? Humanity? Human civilization?

2133
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:19,840
Out of the select to 2100. Yeah, how much we got? 80 years?

2134
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:25,840
Yeah, 77. I think we're going to make it. You think so? Yeah.

2135
03:27:25,840 --> 03:27:28,000
What are the biggest threats facing our civilization?

2136
03:27:28,960 --> 03:27:38,800
If it's not wokeism, it's hard to say. I actually think that if you believe

2137
03:27:39,840 --> 03:27:47,520
that we are on an inflection point of sorts in changes to society and acceleration of technology,

2138
03:27:47,520 --> 03:27:54,480
et cetera, I think it's really tough to know in 2090 what will actually be the biggest threat.

2139
03:27:54,480 --> 03:28:01,920
So I don't know. It's so cliche to say nuclear and climate change and another pandemic.

2140
03:28:01,920 --> 03:28:06,720
Technologically, our world might look so different that it's almost unimaginable.

2141
03:28:06,720 --> 03:28:13,520
What it means to be human is unimaginable. And also, the degree that we make progress out into

2142
03:28:13,520 --> 03:28:19,040
space is also unimaginable. I think space is super interesting. And there's people on both

2143
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:24,240
the left and right who for different reasons are kind of not into the whole space exploration thing.

2144
03:28:24,480 --> 03:28:29,600
The people I hear from, the ones on the right, think it's just kind of dumb. The ones on the

2145
03:28:29,600 --> 03:28:35,840
left think it's an excuse not to fix problems here. And also, they say it's the plaything of

2146
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:41,760
billionaires, which is another funny kind of concept. Yeah, I mean, someone's got to pay for it.

2147
03:28:43,520 --> 03:28:47,200
Why not be people who have a lot of money to... It could either be billionaires

2148
03:28:47,200 --> 03:28:54,160
or governments that are trillionaires. Somebody has to pay for big, ambitious moonshot projects.

2149
03:28:54,160 --> 03:29:02,080
To me, the most interesting thing is that in getting closer to the next step of space exploration,

2150
03:29:02,080 --> 03:29:08,320
we may well learn things that can then be used to improve circumstances here. For me, it's not

2151
03:29:08,320 --> 03:29:15,840
one or the other. And I recently read a long piece about why not Mars, because it's terrible in

2152
03:29:15,840 --> 03:29:21,840
every way for supporting life. Okay, so that's one perspective. But still, in so exploring,

2153
03:29:22,560 --> 03:29:27,920
who knows what we might end up learning? So, I'm big on it. I don't share the view of some on

2154
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:32,560
the left about it. So, I guess to add to your advice, young people, if a thing seems terrible,

2155
03:29:32,560 --> 03:29:37,280
you still might want to consider doing it. I would say so. Yeah. How many things have...

2156
03:29:37,280 --> 03:29:46,000
I mean, listen, there are so many trips where the day before, I say, why am I doing this?

2157
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:52,080
The jet lag. I've got to do this and that. And now, if my guest host falls through,

2158
03:29:52,080 --> 03:29:58,240
I should just stay and work. And I go, hold on. You do this every time. Just go. You never

2159
03:29:58,240 --> 03:30:01,920
regret it. You learn something. You try something. I never regret the trip.

2160
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:09,920
This hopefully applies to the conversation we had today. David, I'm a big fan of yours. Thank you

2161
03:30:09,920 --> 03:30:14,560
so much for talking today. Thank you for being patient with me. We tried to talk earlier.

2162
03:30:15,520 --> 03:30:20,560
Please continue doing what you're doing. Please continue being objective and thoughtful and

2163
03:30:21,280 --> 03:30:24,480
fearless on the internet. Thank you. Big fan of yours as well. I appreciate it.

2164
03:30:25,520 --> 03:30:29,760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Pakman. To support this podcast,

2165
03:30:29,760 --> 03:30:34,640
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from

2166
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:41,040
Mahatma Gandhi. What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans, and the homeless,

2167
03:30:41,680 --> 03:30:47,760
whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or in the holy name of

2168
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:56,960
liberty or democracy? Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
