1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
I remember the reaction where he had drawn these characters and he was slowly moving around and like people had no experience with 3D navigation.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,760
It was all still keyboard. We didn't even have mice set up at that time, but slowly moving, going up, picked up a key, go to a wall.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,440
The wall disappears in a little animation and there's a monster like right there and he practically fell out of his chair.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,440
It was just like, ah, and games just didn't do that.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:32,040
You know, the games were, the gods eye view, you were a little invested in your little guy, you can be like, you know, happy or sad when things happen,

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,840
but you just did not get that kind of startle reaction.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,240
You weren't inside the game.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Something in the back of your brain, some reptile brain thing is just going, oh shit, something just happened.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,040
And that was one of those early points where it's like, yeah, this is going to make a difference.

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
This is going to be powerful and it's going to matter.

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:59,040
The following is a conversation with John Carmack, widely considered to be one of the greatest programmers ever.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:09,040
He was the co-founder of id Software and the lead programmer on several games that revolutionized the technology, the experience and the role of gaming in our society,

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,040
including Commander Keen, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:27,040
He spent many years as the CTO of Oculus VR, helping to create portals into virtual worlds and to define the technological path to the metaverse and meta.

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,040
And now he has been shifting some of his attention to the problem of artificial general intelligence.

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,040
This was the longest conversation on this podcast at over five hours.

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,040
And still, I could talk to John many, many more times and we hope to do just that.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
This is the Lexington podcast.

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,040
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,040
And now, dear friends, here's John Carmack.

21
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,040
What was the first program you've ever written?

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Do you remember?

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Yeah, I do.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:12,040
So I remember being in a Radio Shack going up to the TRS-80 computers and learning just enough to be able to do 10-print John Carmack.

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:23,040
And it's kind of interesting how, of course, I've, you know, Carnegie and Enrichie kind of standardized Hello World is the first thing that you do in every computer programming language and every computer,

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,040
but not having any interaction with the cultures of Unix or any other standardized things, it was just like, well, what am I going to say?

27
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
My name.

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
And then you learn how to do go to 10 and have it scroll all off the screen.

29
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
And that was definitely the first thing that I wound up doing on a computer.

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Can I ask you a programming advice?

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,040
I was always told in the beginning that you're not allowed to use go-to statements.

32
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
That's really bad programming.

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Is this correct or not?

34
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Jumping around code.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Can we look at the philosophy and the technical aspects of the go-to statement that seems so convenient, but it's supposed to be programming?

36
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Certainly back in the day, in basic programming languages, you didn't have proper loops.

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
You didn't have four-wiles-and-repeats.

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,040
You know, that was the land of Pascal for people that kind of generally had access to it back then.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
So you had no choice but to use go-tos.

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,040
And as you made what were big programs back then, which were a thousand line basic program, is a really big program.

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
They did tend to sort of degenerate into madness.

42
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
You didn't have good editors or code exploration tools.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:31,040
So you would wind up fixing things in one place, add a little patch, and there's reasons why structured programming generally helps understanding.

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
But go-tos aren't poisonous.

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Sometimes they're the right thing to do.

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Usually it's because there's a language feature missing like nested breaks or something where it can sometimes be better to do a go-to cleanup or go-to error rather than having multiple flags, multiple if statements littered throughout things.

47
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
But it is rare.

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,040
I mean, if you grep through all of my code right now, I don't think any of my current code bases would actually have a go-to.

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:06,040
But deep within sort of the technical underpinnings of a major game engine, you're going to have some go-tos in a couple places probably.

50
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Yeah, the infrastructure on top of like the closer you get to machine code, the more go-tos you're going to see, the more of these like hacks you're going to see.

51
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Because the set of features available to you in low-level programming languages is limited.

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:31,040
So print John Carmack, when is the first time, if we could talk about love, that you fell in love with programming?

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,040
You said like this is really something special.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:42,040
It really was something that was one of those love at first sight things where just really from the time that I understood what a computer was.

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:50,040
I mean, I remember looking through old encyclopedias of the black and white photos of the IBM mainframes with the real-to-real tape decks.

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:05:05,040
And for people nowadays, it can be a little hard to understand what the world was like then from information gathering where I would go to the libraries and there would be a couple books on the shelf about computers and they would be very out of date even at that point.

57
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Just not a lot of information, but I would grab everything that I could find and, you know, devour everything.

58
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Whenever Time or Newsweek had some article about computers, I would like cut it out with scissors and put it somewhere.

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,040
It just, it felt like this magical thing to me, this idea that the computer would just do exactly what you told it to.

60
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:31,040
I mean, and there's a little bit of the genie monkey's paw sort of issues there where you'd better be really, really careful with what you're telling it to do.

61
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
But it wasn't going to back talk you.

62
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
It wasn't going to have a different point of view.

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
It was going to carry out what you told it to do.

64
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,040
And if you had the right commands, you could make it do these pretty magical things.

65
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,040
And so what kind of programs did you write at first?

66
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
So beyond the print John Carmack.

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:56,040
So I can remember as going through the learning process where you find at the start you're just learning how to do the most basic possible things.

68
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,040
And I can remember stuff like Superman comic that Radio Shack commissioned to have.

69
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:12,040
It's like Superman had lost some of his super brain and kids had to use Radio Shack TRS-80 computers to do calculations for it to help him kind of complete his heroics.

70
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:20,040
And I'd find little things like that and then get a few basic books to be able to kind of work my way up.

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
And again, it was so precious back then.

72
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,040
I had a couple books that would teach me important things about it.

73
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,040
I had one book that I could start to learn a little bit of assembly language from.

74
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,040
And I'd have a few books on basic and some things that I could get from the libraries.

75
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,040
But my goals in the early days was almost always making games of various kinds.

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I loved the arcade games and the early Atari 2600 games.

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,040
And being able to do some of those things myself on the computers was very much what I aspired to.

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,040
And it was a whole journey where if you learn normal basic, you can't do any kind of an action game.

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
You can write an adventure game.

80
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,040
You can write things where you say, what do you do here?

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I get sword, attack troll, that type of thing.

82
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,040
And that can be done in the context of basic, but to do things that had moving graphics.

83
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,040
There were only the most limited things you could possibly do.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,040
You could maybe do breakout or pong or that sort of thing in low resolution graphics.

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:25,040
And in fact, one of my first sort of major technical hacks that I was kind of fond of was on the Apple II computers.

86
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,040
They had a mode called low resolution graphics where of course all graphics were low resolution back then.

87
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:37,040
But regular low resolution graphics, it was a grid of 40 by 40 pixels normally.

88
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
But they could have 16 different colors.

89
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:45,040
And I wanted to make a game kind of like the arcade game Vanguard, just a scrolling game.

90
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,040
And I wanted to just kind of have it scroll vertically up.

91
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
And I could move a little ship around.

92
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,040
You could manage to do that in basic, but there's no way you could redraw the whole screen.

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:02,040
And I remember at the time just coming up with what felt like a brainstorm to me where I knew enough about the way the hardware was controlled,

94
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,040
where the text screen and the low resolution graphics screen were basically the same thing.

95
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,040
And all those computers could scroll their text screen reasonably.

96
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,040
You could do a listing and it would scroll things up.

97
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:19,040
And I figured out that I could kind of tweak just a couple things that I barely understood to put it into a graphics mode.

98
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,040
And I could draw graphics and then I could just do a line feed at the very bottom of the screen.

99
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,040
And then the system would scroll it all up using an assembly language routine that I didn't know how to write back then.

100
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:37,040
So that was like this first great hack that sort of had analogs later on in my career for a lot of different things.

101
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
So I found out that I could draw a screen.

102
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
I could do a line feed at the bottom.

103
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
We would scroll it up once.

104
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I could draw a couple more lines of stuff at the bottom.

105
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:53,040
And that was my first way to kind of scroll the screen, which was interesting in that that played a big part later on in the idSoftware days as well.

106
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:04,040
So do efficient drawing where you don't have to draw the whole screen, but you draw from the bottom using the thing that was designed in the hardware for text output.

107
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Yeah.

108
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Where so much of, until recently, game design was limited by what you could actually get the computer to do.

109
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Where it's easy to say, like, OK, I want to scroll the screen.

110
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
You just redraw the entire screen at a slight offset.

111
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
And nowadays, that works just fine.

112
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Computers are ludicrously fast.

113
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,040
But up until a decade ago or so, there were all these things everybody wanted to do.

114
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:42,040
But if they knew enough programming to be able to make it happen, it would happen too slow to be a good experience, either just ridiculously slow or just slow enough that it wasn't fun to experience it like that.

115
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:51,040
So so much of kind of the first couple of decades of the programming work that I did was largely figuring out how to do something that everybody knows how they want it to happen.

116
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,040
It just has to happen two to ten times faster than sort of the straightforward way of doing things would make it happen.

117
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:06,040
And it's different now because at this point, lots of things you can just do in the most naive possible way and it still works out.

118
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,040
You don't have nearly the creative limitations or the incentives for optimizing on that level.

119
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
And there's a lot of pros and cons to that.

120
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:23,040
But I do generally, I'm not going to do the angry old man shaking my fist at the clouds bit where back in my day, programmers had to do real programming.

121
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,040
It's amazing that you can just kind of pick an idea and go do it right now.

122
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:35,040
And you don't have to be some assembly language wizard or deep GPU arcanist to be able to figure out how to make your wishes happen.

123
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Well, there's still, see, that's true.

124
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:49,040
But let me put on my old man with a fist hat and say that probably the thing that will define the future still requires you to operate at the limits of the current system.

125
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
So we'll probably talk about this.

126
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:03,040
But if you talk about building the metaverse and building a VR experience that's compelling, it probably requires you to not to go to assembly or maybe not literally,

127
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,040
but sort of spiritually to go to the limits of what the system is capable of.

128
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,040
And that really was why virtual reality was specifically interesting to me where it had all the ties to.

129
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:24,040
You could say that even back in the early days, I have some old magazine articles that's talking about DOOM as a virtual reality experience back when just seeing anything in 3D.

130
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:29,040
So you could say that we've been trying to build those virtual experiences from the very beginning.

131
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:41,040
And in the modern era of virtual reality, especially on the mobile side of things, when it's standalone, you're basically using a cell phone chip to be able to produce these very immersive experiences.

132
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
It does require work.

133
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:53,040
It's not at the level of what an old school console game programmer would have operated at where you're looking at hardware registers and you're scheduling all the DMA accesses.

134
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,040
But it is still definitely a different level than what a web developer or even a PC steam game developer usually has to work at.

135
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
And again, it's great.

136
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,040
There's opportunities for people that want to operate it either into that spectrum there and still provide a lot of value to the world.

137
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Let me ask you sort of a big question about preference.

138
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
What would you say is the best programming language?

139
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Your favorite, but also the best.

140
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,040
You've seen throughout your career, you're considered by many to be the greatest programmer ever.

141
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I mean, it's so difficult to place that label on anyone.

142
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
But if you put it on anyone, it's you.

143
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,040
So let me ask you these kind of ridiculous questions of what's the best band of all time.

144
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,040
But in your case, what's the best programming language?

145
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Everything has all the caveats about it.

146
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Nowadays, I do program a reasonable amount of Python for AIML sorts of work.

147
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm not a native Python programmer.

148
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
It's something I came to very late in my career.

149
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
I understand what it's good for.

150
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
But you don't dream in Python.

151
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I do not.

152
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:10,040
And it has some of those things where there's some amazing stats when you say if you just start, if you make a loop, a triply nested loop and start doing operations in Python,

153
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:17,040
you can be thousands to potentially a million times slower than a proper GPU tensor operation.

154
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
And these are staggering numbers.

155
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,040
You know, you can be as much slower as we've almost gotten faster in our pace of progress and all this other miraculous stuff.

156
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,040
So your intuition is about inefficiencies within the Python sort of?

157
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,040
It keeps hitting me upside the face where it just, it's gotten to the point now I understand.

158
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,040
It's like, OK, you just can't do a loop if you care about performance in Python.

159
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:47,040
You have to figure out how you can reformat this into some big vector operation or something that's going to be done completely within a C++ library.

160
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,040
But the other hand is it's amazingly convenient.

161
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,040
And you just see stuff that people are able to cobble together by just import a few different things.

162
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,040
And you can do stuff that nobody on Earth could do 10 years ago.

163
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,040
And you can do it in a little cookbook thing that you copy pasted out of a website.

164
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
So that is really great.

165
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,040
When I'm sitting down to do what I consider kind of serious programming, it's still in C++.

166
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:18,040
And it's really kind of a C flavored C++ at that where I'm not big into the modern template metaprogramming sorts of things.

167
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I see a lot of train wrecks coming from some of that over abstraction.

168
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:33,040
I spent a few years really going kind of deep into the kind of historical Lisp work and Haskell and some of the functional programming sides of things.

169
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,040
And there is a lot of value there in the way you think about things.

170
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:50,040
And I changed a lot of the way I write my C and C++ code based on what I learned about the value that comes out of not having this random mutable state that you kind of lose track of.

171
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Because something that many people don't really appreciate till they've been at it for a long time is that it's not the writing of the program initially.

172
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
It's the whole lifespan of the program.

173
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,040
And that's when it's not necessarily just how fast you wrote it or how fast it operates, but it's how can it bend and adapt as situations change.

174
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:24,040
And then the thing that I've really been learning in my time at Meta with the Oculus and VR work is it's also how well it hands off between a continuous kind of revolving door of programmers taking over maintenance and different things and how you get people up to speed in different areas.

175
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
And there's all these other different aspects of it.

176
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,040
C++ is a good language for handover between engineers.

177
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Probably not the best.

178
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:53,040
And there's some really interesting aspects to this where in some cases languages that are not generally thought well of for many reasons like C is derided pretty broadly that, yes, obviously all of these security flaws that happen with the memory and unsafeness and buffer overruns and the things that you've got there.

179
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:08,040
But there is this underappreciated aspect to the language is so simple, anyone can go and if you know C, you can generally jump in someplace and not have to learn what paradigms they're using because there just aren't that many available.

180
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,040
I think there's some really, really well written C code.

181
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:21,040
I find it great that if I'm messing around with something an open BSD say, I mean, I can be walking around in the kernel and I'm like, I understand everything that's going on here.

182
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:29,040
It's not hard for me to figure out what I need to do to make whatever change that I need to.

183
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:37,040
While you can have more significant languages, like it's a downside of Lisp where I don't regret the time that I spent with Lisp.

184
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,040
I think that it did help my thinking about programming in some ways.

185
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:57,040
But the people that are the biggest defenders of Lisp are saying how malleable of a language it is that if you write a huge Lisp program, you've basically invented your own kind of language and structure because it's not the primitives of the language you're using very much.

186
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
It's all of the things you've built on top of that.

187
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:07,040
And then a language like Racket, kind of one of the more modern Lisp versions, it's essentially touted as a language for building other languages.

188
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:27,040
And I understand the value of that for a tiny little project, but the idea of that for one of these long term supported by lots of people kind of horrifies me where all of those abstractions that you're like, OK, you can't touch this code till you educate yourself on all of these things that we've built on top of that.

189
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:35,040
And it was interesting to see how when Google made go, a lot of the criticisms of that are it's like, wow, this is not a state of the art language.

190
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,040
This language is just so simple and almost crude.

191
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,040
And you could see the programming language people just looking down at it.

192
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:49,040
But it does seem to be quite popular as basically saying this is the good things about C. Everybody can just jump right in and use it.

193
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,040
You don't need to restructure your brain to write good code in it.

194
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,040
So I wish that I had more opportunity for doing some work in go.

195
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Rust is the other modern language that everybody talks about that I'm not fit past judgment on.

196
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,040
I've done a little bit beyond Hello World.

197
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,040
I wrote some like video decompression work in Rust just as an exercise.

198
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,040
But that was a few years ago and I haven't really used it since.

199
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,040
The best programming language is the one that works generally that you're currently using.

200
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Because that's another trap is in almost every case I've seen when people mixed languages on a project, that's a mistake.

201
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I would rather stay just in one language so that everybody can work across the entire thing.

202
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,040
And we have, I get meta, we have a lot of projects that use kind of React framework.

203
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,040
So you've got JavaScript here and then you have C++ for real work.

204
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,040
And then you may have Java interfacing with some other part of the Android system.

205
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
And those are all kind of horrible things.

206
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,040
And that was one thing that I remember talking with Boz at Facebook about it where like,

207
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,040
man, I wish we could have just said we're only hiring C++ programmers.

208
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:08,040
And he just thought from the Facebook meta perspective, well, we just wouldn't be able to find enough with the thousands of programmers they've got there.

209
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:15,040
It is not necessarily a dying breed, but you can sure find a lot more Java or JavaScript programmers.

210
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,040
And I kind of mentioned that to Elon one time and he was kind of flabbergasted about that.

211
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:28,040
It's like, well, you just, you go out and you find those programmers and you don't hire the other programmers that don't do the languages that you want to use.

212
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:37,040
But right now, I guess, yeah, they're using JavaScript on a bunch of the SpaceX work for the UI side of things when you go find UI programmers, they're JavaScript programmers.

213
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:47,040
I wonder if that's because there's a lot of JavaScript programmers, because I do think that great programmers are rare, that it's not, you know,

214
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:56,040
if you just look at statistics of how many people are using different programming languages, that doesn't tell you the story of what the great programmers are using.

215
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,040
And so you have to really look at what you were speaking to, which is the fundamentals of a language.

216
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
What does it encourage you?

217
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,040
How does it encourage you to think what kind of systems does it encourage you to build?

218
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:15,040
There's something about C++ that has elements of creativity, but forces you to be an adult about your programming.

219
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Well, it expects you to be an adult.

220
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
It does not force you to.

221
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:29,040
So it brings out people that are willing to be creative in terms of building large systems and coming up with interesting solutions,

222
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:39,040
but at the same time have the sort of the good software engineering practices that amend themselves to real-world systems.

223
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Let me ask you about this other language, JavaScript.

224
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,040
So if we, you know, aliens visit in thousands of years and humans are long gone,

225
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,040
something tells me that most of the systems they find will be running JavaScript.

226
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I kind of think that if we're living in a simulation, it's written in JavaScript.

227
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:08,040
You know, for the longest time, even still, JavaScript didn't get any respect,

228
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,040
and yet it runs so much of the world and an increasing number of the world.

229
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Is it possible that everything will be written in JavaScript one day?

230
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,040
So the engineering under JavaScript is really pretty phenomenal.

231
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:29,040
The systems that make JavaScript run as fast as it does right now are kind of miracles of modern engineering in many ways.

232
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:36,040
It does feel like it is not an optimal language for all the things that it's being used for

233
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:45,040
or an optimal distribution system to build huge apps in something like this without type systems and so on.

234
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:50,040
But I think for a lot of people, it does reasonably the necessary things.

235
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
It's still a C-flavored language.

236
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,040
It's still a braces and semicolon language.

237
00:21:55,040 --> 00:22:02,040
It's not hard for people to be trained in JavaScript and then understand the roots of where it came from.

238
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I think garbage collection is unequivocally a good thing for most programs to be written in.

239
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:15,040
It's funny that I still, just this morning, I was on, I was seeing a Twitter thread of a bunch of really senior game dev people

240
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,040
arguing about the virtues and costs of garbage collection.

241
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,040
You will run into some people that are top-notch programmers that just say,

242
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,040
no, this is literally not a good thing.

243
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Oh, because it makes you lazy?

244
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
Yes, that it makes you not think about things.

245
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
And I do disagree.

246
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:37,040
I think that there is so much objective data on the vulnerabilities that have happened in C and C++ programs,

247
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,040
sometimes written by the best programmers in the world.

248
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,040
It's like nobody is good enough to avoid ever shooting themselves in the foot with that.

249
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
You write enough C code, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot.

250
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,040
And garbage collection is a very great thing for the vast majority of programs.

251
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,040
It's only when you get into the tightest of real-time things that you start saying it's like,

252
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,040
no, the garbage collection has more costs than it has benefits for me there,

253
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,040
but that's not 99 plus percent of all the software in the world.

254
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,040
So JavaScript is not terrible in those ways.

255
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,040
And so much of programming is not the language itself.

256
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,040
It's the infrastructure around everyone that surrounds it,

257
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,040
all the libraries that you can get and the different ways you can deploy it,

258
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
the portability that it gives you.

259
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,040
And JavaScript is really strong on a lot of those things,

260
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,040
where for a long time, and it still does if I look at it,

261
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,040
the web stack about everything that has to go when you do something really trivial in JavaScript

262
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,040
and it shows up on a web browser to kind of x-ray through that

263
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,040
and see everything that has to happen for your one little JavaScript statement

264
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,040
to turn into something visible in your web browser.

265
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,040
It's very, very disquieting, just the depth of that stack

266
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:59,040
and the fact that so few people can even comprehend all of the levels that are going on there.

267
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,040
But it's again, I have to caution myself to not be the in the good old days old man about it

268
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,040
because clearly there's enormous value here.

269
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,040
The world does run on JavaScript to a pretty good approximation there

270
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
and it's not falling apart.

271
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,040
There's a bunch of scary stuff where you look at console logs

272
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,040
and you just see all of these bad things that are happening,

273
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
but it's still kind of limping along and nobody really notices.

274
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,040
But so much of my systems design and systems analysis goes around.

275
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,040
You should understand what the speed of light is,

276
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,040
like what would be the best you could possibly do here.

277
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,040
And it sounds horrible, but in a lot of cases,

278
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:44,040
you can be a thousand times off your speed of light velocity for something

279
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
and it's still be okay.

280
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
And in fact, it can even sometimes still be the optimal thing in a larger system standpoint

281
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,040
where there's a lot of things that you don't want to have to parachute in someone like me

282
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,040
to go in and say, make this web page run a thousand times faster.

283
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:08,040
Make this web app into a hardcore native application that starts up in 37 milliseconds

284
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,040
and everything responds in less than one frame latency.

285
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,040
That's just not necessary.

286
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,040
And if somebody wants to go pay me millions of dollars to do software like that

287
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,040
when they can take somebody right out of a boot camp and say, spin up an application for this,

288
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,040
often being efficient is not really the best metric.

289
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,040
It's like that applies in a lot of areas where it's kind of interesting

290
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,040
how a lot of our appliances and everything are all built around energy efficiency,

291
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,040
sometimes at the expense of robustness in some other ways or higher costs in other ways

292
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:47,040
where there's interesting things where energy or electricity could become much cheaper in a future world

293
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,040
and that could change our engineering trade-offs for the way we build certain things

294
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,040
where you could throw away efficiency and actually get more benefits that actually matter.

295
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,040
That's one of the directions I was considering swerving into was nuclear energy

296
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
when I was kind of like, what do I want to do next?

297
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:10,040
It was either going to be cost-effective nuclear fission or artificial general intelligence.

298
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:18,040
And one of my pet ideas there is like, people don't understand how cheap nuclear fuel is

299
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:24,040
and there would be ways that you could be a quarter of the efficiency or less,

300
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:31,040
but if it wound up making your plant 10 times cheaper, that could be a radical innovation and something like that.

301
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,040
So there's some of these thoughts around direct fission energy conversion, fission fragment conversion

302
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,040
that maybe you build something that doesn't require all the steam turbines and everything

303
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
even if it winds up being less efficient.

304
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,040
So that applies a lot in programming where it's always good to know what you could do

305
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,040
if you really sat down and took it far because sometimes there's discontinuities

306
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
around user reaction times.

307
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:02,040
There are some points where the difference between operating in one second and 750 milliseconds,

308
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
not that huge.

309
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,040
You'll see it in web page statistics, but most of the usability stuff, not that great.

310
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:13,040
But if you get down to 50 milliseconds, then all of a sudden this just feels amazing.

311
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,040
It's just like doing your bidding instantly rather than you're giving it a command,

312
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,040
twiddling your thumbs, waiting for it to respond.

313
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,040
So sometimes it's important to really crunch hard to get over some threshold,

314
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,040
but there are broad basins in the value metric for lots of work

315
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
where it just doesn't pay to even go that extra mile.

316
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,040
And they're craftsmen that just don't want to buy that and more power to them.

317
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,040
If somebody just wants to say, no, I'm going to be, my pride is in my work.

318
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm never going to do something that's not as good as I could possibly make it.

319
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,040
I respect that and sometimes I am that person,

320
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,040
but I try to focus more on the larger value picture and you do pick your battles

321
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,040
and you deploy your resources into play that's going to give you sort of the best user value in the end.

322
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Well, if you look at the evolution of life on Earth as a kind of programming effort,

323
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,040
it seems like efficiency isn't the thing that's being optimized for.

324
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Like natural selection is very inefficient, but it kind of adapts

325
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,040
and through the process of adaptations, building more and more complex systems

326
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,040
that are more and more intelligent, the final result is kind of pretty interesting.

327
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,040
And so I think of JavaScript the same way.

328
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,040
It's like this giant mess that things naturally die off if they don't work

329
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,040
and if they become useful to people, they kind of naturally live

330
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
and you build this community, large community of people that are generating code

331
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,040
and some code is sticky, some is not and nobody knows the inefficiencies

332
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,040
or the efficiencies or the breaking points like how reliable this code is

333
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,040
and you kind of just run it, assume it works and then get unpleasantly surprised

334
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,040
and then that's very kind of the evolutionary process.

335
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,040
So that's a really good analogy and we can go a lot of places with that

336
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,040
where in the earliest days of programming when you had finite,

337
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
you could count the bytes that you had to work on this,

338
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,040
you had all the kind of hackers playing code golf to be one less instruction

339
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,040
than the other person's multiply routine to kind of get through

340
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,040
and it was so perfectly crafted.

341
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
It was a crystal piece of artwork when you had a program

342
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,040
because there just were not that many, you couldn't afford to be lazy in different ways

343
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,040
and in many ways I see that as akin to the symbolic AI work

344
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,040
where again, if you did not have the resources to just say,

345
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,040
well, we're going to do billions and billions of programmable weights here,

346
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,040
you have to turn it down into something that is symbolic and crafted like that

347
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:55,040
but that's definitely not the way DNA and life and biological evolution and things work.

348
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,040
On the one hand, it's almost humbling how little programming code is in our bodies.

349
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
We've got a couple billion base pairs

350
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,040
and it all fits on a thumb drive for years now

351
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,040
and then our brains are even a smaller section of that.

352
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,040
You've got maybe 50 megabytes and this is not like Shannon Limit

353
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,040
perfectly information dense conveyances here.

354
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
It's like these are messy codes.

355
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
They're broken up into amino acids.

356
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:27,040
A lot of them don't do important things or they do things in very awkward ways

357
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,040
but it is this process of just accumulation on top of things

358
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:37,040
and you need scale, both you need scale for the population for that to work out

359
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,040
and in the early days in the 50s and 60s,

360
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,040
the ancient era of computers where you could count

361
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,040
when they say like when the internet started even in the 70s,

362
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
there were 18 hosts or something on it.

363
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
It was this small finite number

364
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,040
and you were still optimizing everything to be as good as you possibly could be

365
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,040
but now it's billions and billions of devices and everything going on

366
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,040
and you can have this very much natural evolution going on

367
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,040
where lots of things are tried, lots of things are blowing up,

368
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,040
venture capitalists lose their money when a startup invested in the wrong tech stack

369
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,040
and things completely failed or failed to scale

370
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
but good things do come out of it

371
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,040
and it's interesting to see the mimetic evolution of the way different things happen

372
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
like mentioning Hello World at the beginning.

373
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
It's funny how some little thing like that

374
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
where everybody, every programmer knows Hello World now

375
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,040
and that was a completely arbitrary sort of decision

376
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,040
that just came out of the dominance of Unix and C

377
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,040
and early examples of things like that.

378
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,040
So millions of experiments are going on all the time

379
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,040
but some things do kind of rise to the top and win the fitness war

380
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,040
for whether it's mind space or programming techniques or anything.

381
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Like there's a site on Stack Exchange called Code Golf

382
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,040
where people compete to write the shortest possible program for a particular task

383
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
in all the different kinds of languages

384
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,040
and it's really interesting to see folks kind of

385
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,040
that are masters of their craft really play with the limits of programming languages.

386
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,040
It's really beautiful to see and across all the different programming languages

387
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
you get to see some of these weird programming languages

388
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
and mainstream ones,

389
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,040
the difference between Python 2 and 3,

390
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,040
you get to see the difference between C and C++ and Java

391
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
and you get to see JavaScript, all of that.

392
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:39,040
And it's kind of inspiring to see how much depth of possibility

393
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,040
there is within programming languages that Code Golf kind of tasks reveal.

394
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Most of us if you do any kind of programming

395
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,040
with the boring kind of very vanilla type of code,

396
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
that's the way to build large systems

397
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,040
but it's nice to see that the possibility of creative genius

398
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,040
is still within those languages, it's laden within those languages.

399
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,040
So given that you are once again one of the greatest programmers ever,

400
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
what do you think makes a good programmer?

401
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Maybe a good modern programmer.

402
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:17,040
So I just gave a long rant slash lecture at Meta to the TPM organization

403
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,040
and my biggest point was everything that we're doing

404
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,040
really should flow from user value, all the good things that we're doing.

405
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
It's like we're not technical people,

406
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,040
it's like you shouldn't be taking pride just in the specific thing

407
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
like Code Golf is the sort of thing, it's a fun puzzle game

408
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
but that really should not be a major motivator for you.

409
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,040
It's like we're solving problems for people

410
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
or we're providing entertainment to people,

411
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,040
we're doing something of value to people

412
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
that's displacing something else in their life.

413
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,040
So we want to be providing a net value over what they could be doing

414
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
but instead they're choosing to use our products.

415
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,040
And that's where, I mean it sounds triter corny

416
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,040
but I fundamentally do think that's how you make the world a better place.

417
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,040
If you have given more value to people than it took you and your team to create

418
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
then the world's a better place.

419
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,040
People have gone from something of lesser value

420
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,040
chosen to use your product and their life feels better for that

421
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
and if you've produced that economically, that's a really good thing.

422
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,040
On the other hand, if you spent ridiculous amounts of money

423
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
you've just kind of shoveled a lot of cash into a woodchipper there

424
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
and you should maybe not feel so good about what you're doing.

425
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,040
So being proud about like a specific architecture

426
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,040
or specific technology or a specific code sequence that you've done

427
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,040
it's great to get a little smile like a tiny little dopamine hit for that

428
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,040
but the top level metric should be that you're building things of value.

429
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Now you can get into the argument about how you, you know, what is user value

430
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
how do you actually quantify that

431
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
and there can be big arguments about that

432
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
but it's easy to be able to say,

433
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,040
okay this pissed off user there is not getting value from what you're doing.

434
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
This user over there with the big smile on their face

435
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,040
the moment of delight when something happened

436
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
there's a value that's happened there.

437
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,040
I mean, you have to at least accept that there is a concept of user value

438
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,040
even if you have trouble exactly quantifying it

439
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,040
you can usually make relative arguments about it.

440
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,040
Well, this was better than this, we've improved things.

441
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,040
So, you know, being a servant to the user is your job when you're a developer

442
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,040
you want to be producing something that other people are going to find valuable

443
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,040
and if you are technically inclined then finding the right levers to be able to pull

444
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,040
to be able to make a design that's going to produce the most value

445
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
for the least amount of effort

446
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,040
and it always has to be kind of divide, there's a ratio there where you

447
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
it's a problem at the big tech companies

448
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,040
you know, whether it's, you know, MetaGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon

449
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,040
companies that have almost infinite money

450
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,040
I mean, I know their CFO will complain that it's not infinite money

451
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
but from most developer standpoints it really does feel like it

452
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,040
and it's almost counterintuitive that if you're working hard as a developer on something

453
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,040
there's always this thought, if only I had more resources

454
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,040
more people, more RAM, more megahertz, then my product will be better

455
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,040
and that sense that at certain points it's certainly true

456
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
that if you are really hamstrung by this

457
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,040
removing an obstacle will make a better product, make more value

458
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,040
but if you're not making your core design decisions

459
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,040
in this fiercely competitive way where you're saying

460
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,040
feature A or feature B, you can't just say let's do both

461
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
because then you're not making a value judgment about them

462
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
you're just saying well they both seem good

463
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,040
I don't want to necessarily have to pick out which one is better

464
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,040
or how much better and tell team B that

465
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,040
sorry we're not going to do this because A is more important

466
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,040
but that notion of always having to really critically value

467
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,040
what you're doing, your time, the resources you expend

468
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,040
even the opportunity cost of doing something else

469
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
that's super important

470
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,040
Well let me ask you about the big debates that you're mentioning

471
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,040
of how to measure value

472
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:19,040
is it possible to measure it kind of numerically

473
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,040
or can you do the sort of Johnny Ive, the designer route

474
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,040
of imagining sort of somebody using a thing

475
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
and imagining a smile on their face

476
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,040
imagining the experience of love and joy that you have

477
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
when you use the thing

478
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
that's from a design perspective

479
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,040
or if you're building more like a lower level thing

480
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,040
for like Linux you imagine a developer that might come across this

481
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,040
and use it and become happy and better off because of it

482
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,040
so where do you land on those things

483
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,040
is it measurable, so I imagine like Meta and Google

484
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
will probably try to measure the thing

485
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
they'll try to, it's like you try to optimize engagement or something

486
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
let's measure engagement

487
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
and then I think there is a kind of

488
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,040
I mean I admire the designer ethic of like

489
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,040
think of a future that's immeasurable

490
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
and you try to make somebody in that future

491
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
that's different from today happy

492
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,040
so I do usually favor

493
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,040
if you can get any kind of a metric that's good

494
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
by all means listen to the data

495
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
but you can go too far there

496
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
where we've had problems where it's like

497
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
hey we had a performance regression

498
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
because our fancy new telemetry system

499
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
is doing a bazillion file rights

500
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
to kind of archive this stuff

501
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
because we needed to collect information to determine

502
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,040
if we were doing, you know, if our plans were good

503
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,040
so when information is available

504
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
you should never ignore it

505
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
for actual users using the thing

506
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
human beings using the thing

507
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
large number of human beings

508
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
and you get to see sort of at large numbers

509
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
so there's zero to one problem of when you're doing something really new

510
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
you do kind of have to make a guess

511
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,040
but one of the points that I've been making at Meta

512
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,040
is we have more than enough users now

513
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,040
that anything somebody wants to try in VR

514
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,040
we have users that will be interested in that

515
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,040
who do not get to make a completely green field blue sky pitch

516
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
and say I'm going to do this

517
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
because I think it might be interesting

518
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
I challenge everyone

519
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
there are going to be people

520
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,040
whether it's, you know, working in VR on your

521
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
like on your desktop replacement

522
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,040
or communicating with people in different ways

523
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
or playing the games

524
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,040
there are going to be probably millions of people

525
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
or at least if you pick some tiny niche

526
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
that we're not in right now

527
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
there are still going to be thousands of people out there

528
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
that have the headsets

529
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
that would be your target market

530
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
and I tell people

531
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
pay attention to them

532
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
don't invent fictional users

533
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
don't, you know, make an Alice Bob Charlie

534
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,040
that fits whatever matrix of tendencies

535
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,040
that you want to break the market down to

536
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
because it's a mistake to think about imaginary users

537
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
when you've got real users

538
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
that you could be working with

539
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,040
but, you know, on the other hand

540
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,040
there is value to having a kind of wholeness

541
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
of vision for a product

542
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,040
and companies like Meta have, you know

543
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
they understand the trade-offs

544
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
where you can have a company like SpaceX

545
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,040
or, you know, Apple and the Steve Jobs era

546
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,040
where you have a very powerful leading personality

547
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
that I, you know, that can micromanage

548
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
at a very low level and can say

549
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
it's like, no, that handle needs to be different

550
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,040
or that icon needs to change the tint there

551
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
and they clearly get a lot of value out of it

552
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
they also burn through a lot of employees

553
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
that have horror stories to tell about

554
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
working there afterwards

555
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
my position is that

556
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,040
you're at your best when you've got a leader

557
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,040
that is at their limit of what they can kind of comprehend

558
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
of everything below them

559
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
and they can have an informed opinion

560
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
about everything that's going on

561
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
and you take somebody, you've got to believe

562
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,040
that somebody that has 30, 40 years of experience

563
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
you would hope that they've got wisdom

564
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,040
that just out of boot camp person

565
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
contributing doesn't have

566
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
and that if they're like, well, that's wrong there

567
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
you probably shouldn't do it that way

568
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
or even just don't do it that way

569
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
do it another way

570
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
so there's value there

571
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
but it can't go beyond a certain level

572
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
I mean, I have Steve Jobs stories of him

573
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
saying things that are just wrong

574
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,040
right in front of me about technical things

575
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
because he was not operating at that level

576
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
but when it does work

577
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,040
and you do get that kind of passionate leader

578
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
that's thinking about the entire product

579
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
and just really deeply cares about

580
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,040
not letting anything slip through the cracks

581
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I think that's got a lot of value

582
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
but the other side of that is the people saying

583
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
that, well, we want to have these independent teams

584
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
that are bubbling up the ideas

585
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
because it's almost

586
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
it's anti-capitalist or anti-free market

587
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,040
to say it's like I want my great leader

588
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,040
to go ahead and dictate all these points there

589
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
where clearly free markets bring up things

590
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
that you don't expect

591
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,040
like in VR we saw a bunch of things

592
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
like it didn't turn out at all the way

593
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,040
the early people thought were going to be the key applications

594
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,040
and things that would not have been approved

595
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,040
by the dark cabal

596
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,040
making the decisions about what gets into the store

597
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,040
turn out to in some cases be extremely successful

598
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
so I definitely kind of wanted to be

599
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
there's a point where I did make a pitch

600
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,040
it's like, hey, make me VR dictator

601
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
and I'll go and get shit done

602
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,040
and that's just, it's not in the culture at Metta

603
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
and they understand the trade-offs

604
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
and that's just not the way

605
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
that's not the company that they want

606
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
the team that they want to do

607
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
It's fascinating because VR

608
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
and we'll talk about it more

609
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,040
it's still unclear to me

610
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,040
in what way VR will change the world

611
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
because it does seem clear that VR will

612
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
somehow fundamentally transform this world

613
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
and it's unclear to me how

614
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,040
let me know when you want to get into that

615
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,040
hold on a second

616
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,040
stick to the you being the best programmer ever

617
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,040
in the early days when you didn't have

618
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
adult responsibilities of leading teams

619
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
and all that kind of stuff

620
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,040
and you can focus on just being a programmer

621
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
what did the productive day

622
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,040
in the life of John Carmack look like

623
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,040
how many hours of the keyboard, how much sleep

624
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,040
how much source of calories that fueled the brain

625
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,040
what was it like, what time did you wake up

626
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,040
so I was able to be remarkably consistent

627
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,040
about what was good working conditions for me

628
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
for a very long time

629
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
I was never one of the programmers

630
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,040
that would do all-nighters going through

631
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
work for 20 hours straight

632
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,040
it's like my brain generally starts turning to mush

633
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,040
after 12 hours or so

634
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,040
but the hard work is really important

635
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
and I would work for decades

636
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,040
I would work 60 hours a week

637
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,040
I would work a 10 hour day, 6 days a week

638
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
and try to be productive at that

639
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
now my schedule shifted around a fair amount

640
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
when I was young without any kids

641
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,040
any other responsibilities

642
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
I was on one of those cycling schedules

643
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
where I'd kind of get in an hour later

644
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040
each day and roll around through the entire time

645
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
and I'd wind up kind of pulling in

646
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,040
at 2 or 3 in the afternoon sometimes

647
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
and then working again past midnight

648
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,040
or 2 in the morning

649
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,040
and that was when it was just me

650
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
trying to make things happen

651
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,040
and I was usually isolated off in my office

652
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
people generally didn't bother me much

653
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,040
and I could get a lot of programming work done

654
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
that way

655
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
I did settle into a more normal schedule

656
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
when I was taking kids to school

657
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,040
and things like that

658
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
So kids were the forcing function

659
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,040
that got you to wake up at the same time

660
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
It's not clear to me that there was

661
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
much of a difference in the productivity

662
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
with that

663
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
where I kind of feel

664
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
if I just get up when I feel like it

665
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
it's usually a little later each day

666
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,040
but I just recently made

667
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
the focusing decision to try to push my schedule

668
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
back a little bit earlier to

669
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,040
getting up at 8 in the morning

670
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
and trying to shift things around

671
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
I'm often doing experiments

672
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,040
with myself about what should I be doing

673
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,040
to be more productive

674
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,040
and one of the things that I did realize

675
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
was happening in recent months

676
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,040
where I would go for

677
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,040
a walk or a run

678
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,040
I cover like four miles a day

679
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
and I would usually do that

680
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,040
just as the sun's going down

681
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,040
here in Texas now

682
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,040
and it's still really damn hot

683
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,040
but I'd go out at 8.30 or something

684
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,040
and cover the time there

685
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,040
and then the showering

686
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
and it was putting a hole in my day

687
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
where I would have still a couple hours

688
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
after that

689
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
and sometimes my best hours were at night

690
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,040
when nobody else is around

691
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,040
nobody's bothering me

692
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,040
but that hole in the day was a problem

693
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,040
so just a couple weeks ago

694
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,040
I made the change to go ahead

695
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,040
and say alright I'm going to get up a little earlier

696
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
I'm going to do a walk or get out there first

697
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
so I can have more uninterrupted time

698
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,040
so I'm still playing with factors like this

699
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,040
as I kind of optimize my work efforts

700
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,040
but it's always been

701
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
it was 60 hours a week

702
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
for a very long time

703
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
to some degree I had a little thing

704
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,040
in the back of my head where I was almost jealous

705
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,040
of some of the programmers

706
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
that would do these marathon sessions

707
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
and I had like Dave Taylor

708
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
one of the guys that he had

709
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
he would be one of those people

710
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
that would fall asleep under his desk sometimes

711
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
and all the kind of classic hacker tropes

712
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,040
about things

713
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
and a part of me was like

714
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
always a little bothered that that wasn't me

715
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
that I wouldn't go program

716
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,040
20 hours straight

717
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
because I'm falling apart

718
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,040
and not being very effective after 12 hours

719
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,040
I mean yeah 12 hour programming

720
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
that's fine when you're doing that

721
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,040
but you're not doing smart work

722
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,040
much after

723
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
at least I'm not

724
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
but there's a range of people

725
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,040
I mean that's something that a lot of people

726
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
don't really get in their gut

727
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,040
where there are people

728
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
that work on four hours of sleep

729
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
and are smart

730
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
and can continue to do good work

731
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,040
but then there's a lot of people

732
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
that just fall apart

733
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,040
so I do tell people that

734
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,040
I always try to get eight hours of sleep

735
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
it's not this

736
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,040
you know push yourself harder

737
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
get up earlier

738
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,040
I just do worse work

739
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
where I know there's

740
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,040
you can work a hundred hours a week

741
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,040
and still get eight hours of sleep

742
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
if you just kind of prioritize things correctly

743
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
but I do believe in working hard

744
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
working a lot

745
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
there was a comment that

746
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
Game Dev made that

747
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
that I know there's a backlash

748
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,040
against really hard work

749
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,040
in a lot of cases

750
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
and I get into online arguments

751
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,040
about this all the time

752
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,040
but it was basically saying

753
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,040
yeah 40 hours a week

754
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,040
that's kind of a part-time job

755
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
and if you were really in it

756
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,040
you're doing what you think is important

757
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,040
what you're passionate about

758
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,040
working more gets more done

759
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,040
and it's just really not

760
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,040
possible to argue with that

761
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,040
if you've been around the people

762
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,040
that work with that level of intensity

763
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
and just say

764
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
it's like no

765
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
they should just stop

766
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
and we had

767
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,040
I kind of came back around to that

768
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
a couple years ago

769
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,040
where I was using the fictional example of

770
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,040
alright

771
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,040
some people say

772
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,040
they'll say with a straight face

773
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,040
they think no

774
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,040
you are less productive

775
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,040
if you work more than 40 hours a week

776
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,040
and they're generally misinterpreting things

777
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
where your marginal productivity

778
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
for an hour after eight hours

779
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
is less than in one of your peak hours

780
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
but you're not literally getting less done

781
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
there is a point where you start breaking things

782
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,040
and getting worse

783
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,040
worse behavior and everything out of it

784
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,040
where you're literally going backwards

785
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,040
but it's not at eight or ten or twelve hours

786
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,040
and the fictional example I would use was

787
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
imagine there's an asteroid

788
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,040
coming to impact

789
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
to crash into earth

790
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,040
destroy all of human life

791
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,040
do you want

792
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,040
Elon Musk

793
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,040
or the people working at SpaceX

794
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,040
that are building the interceptor

795
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
that's going to deflect the asteroid

796
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
do you want them to clock out at five

797
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,040
because damn it

798
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,040
they're just going to do worse work

799
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,040
if they work another couple hours

800
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,040
and you know it seems absurd

801
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
and that's a hypothetical though

802
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,040
and everyone can dismiss that

803
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
but then when coronavirus was hitting

804
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
and you have all of these medical personnel

805
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,040
that are clearly pushing themselves

806
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,040
really really hard

807
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
and I'd say it's like

808
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
okay

809
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,040
do you want all of these scientists

810
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,040
working on treatments and vaccines

811
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,040
and caring for all of these people

812
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,040
are they really screwing everything up

813
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,040
by working more than eight hours a day

814
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,040
and of course people say

815
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,040
I'm just an asshole to say something like that

816
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,040
but it's the truth

817
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,040
working longer gets more done

818
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,040
so that's kind of

819
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,040
the layer one

820
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
but I'd like to also say that

821
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,040
at least I believe

822
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
depending on the person, depending on the task

823
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,040
working more

824
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,040
and harder

825
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,040
will make

826
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,040
you better for the next week

827
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,040
in those peak hours

828
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,040
so there's something about

829
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,040
a deep dedication to a thing

830
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
that

831
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,040
kind of gets deep in you

832
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
so the hard work isn't just about

833
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,040
the raw hours of productivity

834
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,040
it's the

835
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,040
it's the thing it does to you

836
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,040
in the weeks

837
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,040
and months after too

838
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
you're tempering yourself in some ways

839
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,040
and I think you know it's like

840
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,040
you know dreams of sushi

841
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,040
if you really dedicate yourself completely

842
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
to making the sushi

843
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
to really putting in the long hours

844
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,040
day after day after day

845
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,040
you become a true craftsman

846
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,040
of the thing you're doing

847
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,040
now there's of course discussions about

848
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,040
are you sacrificing a lot of personal relationships

849
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,040
are you sacrificing a lot of other possible

850
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,040
things you could do with that time

851
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,040
but if you're talking about purely

852
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,040
being

853
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
a master

854
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,040
of your art

855
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,040
that more hours isn't just about

856
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,040
doing more

857
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,040
it's about becoming better at the thing you're doing

858
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
and I don't gain say anybody that

859
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,040
wants to work the minimum amount

860
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,040
they've got other priorities in their life

861
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
my only argument that I'm making

862
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
it's not that everybody should work hard

863
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
it's that if you want to accomplish something

864
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
working longer and harder

865
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
is the path to getting it accomplished

866
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,040
well let me ask you about this then

867
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,040
why the mythical

868
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,040
work-life balance

869
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
for an engineer it seems like

870
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
that's one of the professions

871
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
for a programmer

872
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,040
where

873
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,040
working hard does lead to

874
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,040
greater productivity in it

875
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,040
but it also raises the question

876
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,040
of

877
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,040
personal relationships

878
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,040
and all that kind of stuff family

879
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,040
how are you able to

880
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,040
find work-life balance

881
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,040
you can give maybe even outside yourself

882
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,040
have you been able to arrive

883
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,040
at any wisdom on this

884
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,040
part in your years of life

885
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
I do think that there's a wide range of people

886
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,040
where different people have different needs

887
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,040
it's not a one size fits all

888
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,040
certainly what works for me

889
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,040
I can tell enough

890
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,040
that I'm

891
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
different than a typical average person

892
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,040
in the way things impact me

893
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
the things that I want to do

894
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,040
my goals are different

895
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,040
my endeavors to impact things

896
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,040
are different where

897
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
I have literally never

898
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,040
felt burnout and I know

899
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,040
there's lots of brilliant smart people

900
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,040
that do world-leading work

901
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
that get burned out and

902
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,040
it's never hit me

903
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,040
I've never been at a point where

904
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,040
I'm like

905
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
I just don't care about this

906
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,040
I don't want to do this anymore

907
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,040
but I've always had the flexibility

908
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,040
to work on lots of interesting things

909
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
and have a great time working on that

910
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
and so much of that

911
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,040
so much of the ability to actually work hard

912
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
is the ability to have multiple things

913
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,040
to choose from and to use

914
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,040
your time on the most appropriate thing

915
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,040
there are time periods

916
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,040
where it's the best time

917
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
for me to read a new research paper

918
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,040
that I need to really be thinking hard about it

919
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,040
then there's a time that maybe I should just

920
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,040
scan and organize my old notes

921
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,040
because I'm just not on top of things

922
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,040
then there's the time that

923
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,040
let's go bang out a few hundred lines

924
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
of code for something

925
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,040
so switching between them

926
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
has been real valuable

927
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,040
so you always have kind of joined

928
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,040
your heart for all the things you're doing

929
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,040
and that is the kind of work-life

930
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,040
balance as a first step

931
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,040
so you're always happy

932
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,040
well happy

933
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
a lot of people would say that often

934
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,040
I look like kind of a grim person

935
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,040
with just sitting there with a neutral expression

936
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,040
or even like knitted brows and a frown

937
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,040
on my face as I'm staring at something

938
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,040
that's what happiness looks like for you

939
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,040
yeah it's kind of true

940
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
where that's like okay I'm pushing

941
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,040
through this I'm making progress here

942
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,040
I am you know

943
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,040
I know that doesn't work for everyone

944
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,040
I know it doesn't work for most people

945
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
but what I am always trying to do

946
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
in those cases is I don't want to let

947
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,040
somebody that might be a person like that

948
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,040
be told by someone else that

949
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,040
no don't try it don't even try

950
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,040
that out as an option where

951
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,040
I you know work-life balance

952
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,040
versus kind of your life's work

953
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,040
where there's a small subset

954
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
of the people that can be very happy

955
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
being obsessive about things

956
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,040
and you know obsession

957
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,040
can often get things done

958
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,040
that just practical, prudent

959
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
pedestrian work won't

960
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,040
or at least won't for a very long time

961
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
there's legends of

962
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,040
your nutritional intake

963
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,040
in the early days

964
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,040
what can you say about

965
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
being a program

966
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,040
as a kind of athlete

967
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,040
so what

968
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
what was the nutrition that fueled

969
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,040
I have never been that great

970
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,040
on really

971
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
paying attention to it where

972
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,040
I'm good enough that I don't eat a lot

973
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
you know I've never been like a big heavy guy

974
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,040
but it was

975
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,040
interesting where one of the things that I can remember

976
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
being an unhappy teenager not having

977
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
enough money and like one of the things

978
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
that bothered me about not having enough money

979
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
is I couldn't buy pizza whenever I wanted to

980
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,040
so I got rich and then

981
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,040
I bought a whole lot of pizza

982
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,040
that was the defining like that's what being rich felt like

983
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,040
there was a lot of little things

984
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,040
like I could buy all the pizza and comic books

985
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,040
and video games that I wanted to

986
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,040
and it really

987
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,040
didn't take that much

988
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,040
but the pizza was one of those things

989
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,040
and it's absolutely true that for a long time

990
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,040
it did software I had a pizza

991
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,040
delivered every single day you know the delivery guy

992
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,040
knew me my name

993
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,040
and I didn't find out until years later

994
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
that apparently I was such a good

995
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
customer that they just never raised

996
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,040
the price on me and I was using this

997
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
six year old price for the pizzas that they

998
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
were still kind of sending my way every day

999
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
so you were doing

1000
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,040
eating once a day

1001
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,040
or were you... it would be spread out

1002
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,040
you know you have a few pieces of pizza you have some more later on

1003
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,040
and I'd maybe have something at home

1004
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,040
it was one of the nice things

1005
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,040
that Facebook meta is

1006
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,040
they do they feed you quite well you get

1007
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
a different

1008
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
I guess now it's doordash sorts of things delivered

1009
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
but they take care of making sure that everybody

1010
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,040
does get well fed

1011
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,040
and I probably had better food those

1012
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
six years that I was working in the meta office

1013
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
there than I used to before

1014
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,040
but I

1015
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,040
it's worked out okay for me my health has always been good

1016
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,040
I get a pretty good amount of exercise

1017
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,040
and I don't

1018
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,040
eat to excess and I avoid a lot of other

1019
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,040
kind of not so good for you

1020
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,040
things so I'm still doing quite well

1021
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,040
did you have

1022
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,040
a kind of

1023
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,040
I don't know

1024
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,040
spiritual experience with food

1025
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,040
or coffee or any of that kind of stuff

1026
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,040
I mean

1027
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,040
the programming experience with music

1028
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,040
or

1029
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,040
like I listen to brown noise on a program

1030
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,040
or like creating an environment

1031
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,040
and the things you take into your body

1032
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
just everything you construct

1033
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,040
can become a kind of ritual that

1034
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,040
empowers the whole process the program

1035
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,040
relationship with pizza or

1036
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,040
it would really be with Diet Coke

1037
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,040
there still is that sense of

1038
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,040
drop the can down crack open the can

1039
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,040
of Diet Coke alright now I mean business

1040
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,040
we're getting to work here

1041
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,040
still to this day

1042
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,040
is Diet Coke a still partner

1043
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,040
yeah probably 8 or 9 a day

1044
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,040
nice okay

1045
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,040
what about your setup

1046
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,040
how many screens

1047
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,040
what kind of keyboard is there something interesting

1048
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,040
what kind of IDE

1049
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,040
Linux what operating system

1050
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,040
laptop or any interesting

1051
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,040
thing that brings you joy

1052
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,040
so I kind of migrated cultures

1053
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,040
where early on through all of game dev

1054
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,040
there was sort of one culture there

1055
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,040
which was really quite distinct from the more

1056
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,040
the Silicon Valley venture

1057
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,040
you know culture for things

1058
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,040
it's their different groups and they have

1059
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,040
pretty different mores and the way they think about things

1060
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,040
where and I still do

1061
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,040
think a lot of the big companies can learn

1062
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,040
can learn things from

1063
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,040
the hardcore game development side of things

1064
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,040
where it still boggles my mind

1065
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,040
how hostile

1066
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,040
to debuggers and IDEs

1067
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,040
that so much of them

1068
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,040
the kind of big money get billions of dollars

1069
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,040
Silicon Valley venture backed

1070
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,040
funds are

1071
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,040
sorry so you're saying like

1072
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,040
big companies like Google and Meta are hostile

1073
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,040
to they are not big on

1074
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,040
debuggers and IDEs like

1075
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,040
so much of it is like emacs BIM

1076
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,040
for things and we just assume

1077
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,040
that debuggers don't work

1078
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,040
most of the time for the systems

1079
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,040
and a lot of this comes from a sort of

1080
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,040
Linux bias on a lot of things

1081
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,040
where I did come up through

1082
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
the personal computers and then the DOS

1083
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,040
and then I am windows

1084
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,040
and it was

1085
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
Borland tools and then visual studio

1086
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
and

1087
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,040
you appreciate the buggers

1088
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,040
very much so I mean a debugger is how you

1089
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,040
get a view into a system that's too complicated

1090
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,040
to understand I mean anybody that thinks

1091
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,040
just read the code and think about it

1092
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,040
that's an insane statement in the

1093
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,040
you can't even read all the code on a big system

1094
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,040
you have to do experiments

1095
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,040
on the system and doing that

1096
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,040
by adding log statements

1097
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,040
recompiling and rerunning it

1098
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,040
is an incredibly inefficient way of doing it

1099
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
I mean yes you can always

1100
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,040
get things done even if you're working with stone

1101
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,040
knives and bear skins that's

1102
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,040
that is the mark of a good programmer is

1103
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,040
that given any tools you will figure

1104
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,040
out a way to get it done but

1105
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,040
it's amazing what you can do with

1106
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,040
sometimes much much better tools

1107
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,040
where instead of just going through this

1108
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,040
iterative compile run

1109
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,040
debug cycle and you have the

1110
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,040
you have the old Lisp direction of like

1111
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,040
you've got a REPL and you're working interactively

1112
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
and doing amazing things there but

1113
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,040
in many cases a debugger as a very powerful

1114
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,040
user interface that can

1115
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,040
stop examine all the different things in your

1116
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
program set all these different breakpoints

1117
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,040
and of course you can do that with GDB

1118
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,040
or whatever there but

1119
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,040
this is one of the user interface fundamental

1120
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,040
principles where when something is

1121
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,040
complicated to do you won't

1122
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,040
use it very often there's people

1123
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,040
that will break out GDB when they're at

1124
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,040
their wits end and they just have beat

1125
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,040
their head against a problem for so long

1126
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,040
but for somebody that kind of grew

1127
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,040
up in game dev it's like they were running into

1128
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,040
the debugger anyways before they even knew

1129
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,040
there was a problem and you would just

1130
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,040
stop and see you know what was happening

1131
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,040
and sometimes you could fix things even before

1132
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
you you know even

1133
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,040
before you did one compile cycle you could

1134
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,040
be in the debugger and you'd say well I'm just

1135
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,040
going to change this right here and yep

1136
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,040
that did the job and fix it and go on

1137
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,040
and for people that don't know GDB is

1138
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,040
sort of popular I guess Linux

1139
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,040
debugger

1140
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,040
primarily for C++

1141
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
they handle most of the languages but

1142
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,040
it's you know it's based on C as the

1143
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,040
original kind of Unix heritage

1144
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,040
and it's kind of like command line it's not user friendly

1145
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,040
it's not it doesn't allow for clean

1146
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,040
visualizations and you're exactly right

1147
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,040
so that you're using this kind of debugger

1148
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,040
usually when you're at what's end

1149
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,040
and there's a problem that you can't figure out

1150
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,040
why by just looking at the codes if to

1151
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,040
find it that's how I guess

1152
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,040
normal programmers use it but you're

1153
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
saying there should be tools that kind of

1154
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
visualize and help you as

1155
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,040
part of the programming process

1156
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,040
just the normal programming process

1157
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,040
to understand the

1158
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,040
code deeper. Yeah when I'm working on

1159
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,040
like my CC++ code

1160
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,040
I'm always running it from the debugger

1161
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,040
you know just I type in the code

1162
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:49,040
I run it many times the first thing I

1163
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,040
do after writing code is

1164
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,040
set a breakpoint and step through the function

1165
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,040
now other people will say it's like oh I do that in my head

1166
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,040
well your head is a faulty

1167
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,040
interpreter of all those things there

1168
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,040
and I've written brand new code

1169
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,040
I want to step in there and I'm going to single

1170
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,040
step through that examine lots of things

1171
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,040
and see if it's actually doing what I expected

1172
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,040
it to. It is

1173
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,040
a kind of companion

1174
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,040
the debugger like

1175
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,040
you're now coding in an interactive way with another

1176
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,040
being

1177
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,040
the debugger is a kind of dumb

1178
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,040
being but it's a reliable being

1179
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,040
that is an interesting question of what role

1180
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,040
does AI play in that kind of

1181
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
with codex and these kind of

1182
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,040
ability to generate

1183
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,040
code might be you might

1184
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,040
start having tools that

1185
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,040
understand the code in interesting

1186
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,040
deep ways that can work with you.

1187
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,040
I mean there's a whole spectrum there

1188
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,040
from static code analyzers

1189
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,040
and various kind of dynamic tools

1190
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,040
they're up to AI that can

1191
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,040
conceivably grok these programs that

1192
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,040
literally no human can understand

1193
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,040
they're too big, too intertwined, too

1194
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,040
interconnected but it's not beyond

1195
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,040
the possibility of understanding

1196
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,040
it's just beyond what we can hold

1197
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,040
in our heads as kind of mutable state

1198
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,040
while we're working on things

1199
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,040
and I'm a big proponent

1200
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,040
again of things like static analyzers

1201
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,040
and some of that stuff where

1202
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,040
you'll find some people that don't like

1203
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,040
being scolded by a program

1204
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,040
for how they've written something where

1205
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,040
it's like oh I know better and sometimes

1206
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,040
you do but that was something that

1207
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,040
I was it was very

1208
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,040
very valuable for me when

1209
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,040
not too many people get an opportunity

1210
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,040
like this to have this is almost one of those

1211
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,040
spiritual experiences as a programmer and

1212
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,040
awakening to

1213
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,040
the id software code bases were a couple

1214
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,040
million lines of code and

1215
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,040
at one point I had used a few of the

1216
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,040
different analysis tools but

1217
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,040
I made a point to really

1218
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,040
go through and scrub the code base

1219
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,040
using every tool that I could find

1220
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,040
and it was eye-opening where we had

1221
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,040
a reputation for having some of the

1222
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,040
most robust strongest code

1223
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,040
where there were some great things

1224
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,040
that I remember hearing from

1225
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,040
Microsoft telling us about crashes on XBox

1226
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,040
and we had this tiny number that they said

1227
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,040
were probably literally hardware

1228
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,040
errors and then you have other

1229
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,040
significant titles that just have

1230
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,040
millions of faults that are getting recorded

1231
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,040
so I was proud of our code on a lot

1232
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,040
of levels but when I took this

1233
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:11,040
code analysis squeegee through

1234
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,040
everything it was

1235
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,040
it was shocking how many

1236
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:17,040
errors there were in there things

1237
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,040
that you can say okay this was this was

1238
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,040
a copy paste not changing something right

1239
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,040
here lots of things that were

1240
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,040
the most the most common problem

1241
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,040
was something in a printf

1242
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,040
format string that was the wrong data type

1243
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,040
that could cause crashes there and

1244
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,040
you really want the warnings for things like

1245
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,040
that then the next most common was

1246
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,040
missing a check for null that could actually

1247
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,040
happen that could blow things up and

1248
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,040
those are obviously like top CC

1249
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,040
plus plus things everybody has those problems

1250
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,040
but the long tail of all

1251
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,040
of the different little things that could go wrong

1252
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,040
there and we had good programmers

1253
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:51,040
and my own code so that I'd be looking at

1254
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,040
it's like oh I wrote that code that's definitely

1255
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,040
wrong we've been using this for

1256
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,040
a year and

1257
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,040
it's this somewhere you know this

1258
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,040
mine sitting there waiting for us to step on

1259
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,040
and

1260
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,040
it was humbling it was and I

1261
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,040
reached the conclusion that

1262
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,040
anything that can be syntactically

1263
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,040
allowed in your language

1264
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,040
if I'm it's going to show up

1265
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,040
eventually in a large enough code base

1266
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,040
I you're not going to good intentions

1267
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,040
aren't going to keep it from happening

1268
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,040
you need automated tools and guard

1269
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,040
rails for things and those start with

1270
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,040
things like static types and or even

1271
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,040
type hints in the more dynamic languages

1272
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,040
but the people that

1273
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,040
rebel against that that basically

1274
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,040
say that slows me down

1275
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,040
doing that there's something to that I get

1276
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,040
that I've written you know I cobbled things

1277
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,040
together in a notebook I

1278
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,040
like wow this is great that it just happened

1279
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,040
but yeah that's kind of sketchy but it's working

1280
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,040
fine I don't care it does come back to

1281
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,040
that that value analysis

1282
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,040
where sometimes it's right to not care

1283
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,040
but when you do care

1284
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
if it's going to be something that's going to

1285
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,040
live for years and it's going to have other people

1286
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,040
working on it I and it's going to be

1287
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,040
deployed to millions of people

1288
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,040
then you want to use all of these tools

1289
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,040
you want to be told it's like no you

1290
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,040
screwed up here here and here and that does

1291
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,040
require kind of an ego check about

1292
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,040
things where you have

1293
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,040
to to be open to the fact

1294
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,040
that everything that you're doing is just littered

1295
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,040
with flaws it's not that oh you

1296
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,040
occasionally have a bad day it's just

1297
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,040
whatever stream of code you output

1298
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,040
there's going to be a statistical regularity

1299
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,040
of things that you just make mistakes

1300
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,040
on and I

1301
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,040
and I do think there's the whole

1302
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,040
argument about test-driven design

1303
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,040
and unit testing versus kind

1304
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,040
of analysis and different things

1305
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,040
I am more in favor of the analysis

1306
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,040
and the stuff that just like you can't run

1307
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,040
your program until you fix this rather

1308
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,040
than you can run it and hopefully

1309
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,040
a unit test will catch it in some way

1310
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,040
yeah in my private code

1311
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,040
I have asserts everywhere

1312
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,040
just there's something

1313
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,040
pleasant to me

1314
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,040
pleasurable to me about sort of the

1315
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,040
dictatorial rule of like

1316
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,040
this should be true at this point

1317
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,040
in too many

1318
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,040
times

1319
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,040
I've made mistakes

1320
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,040
that shouldn't have been made

1321
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,040
and I would assume

1322
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,040
I wouldn't be the kind of person that would make that mistake

1323
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,040
but I keep making that mistake therefore

1324
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,040
an assert really catches me

1325
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,040
really helps all the time

1326
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,040
so my code I would say like

1327
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,040
10 to 20 percent of my private code

1328
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,040
just for personal use is probably

1329
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,040
and there are active comments

1330
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,040
one of those things that in theory

1331
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,040
they don't make any difference to the program

1332
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,040
and if it was all operating the way

1333
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,040
you expected it would be then

1334
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,040
they will never fire

1335
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,040
but even if you have it right

1336
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,040
and you wrote the code right initially

1337
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,040
then circumstances change

1338
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,040
the world outside your program changes

1339
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,040
and in fact that's one of the things where

1340
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,040
I'm kind of fond

1341
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,040
in a lot of cases of static array size

1342
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,040
declarations where I went through this

1343
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,040
period where it's like okay now we have general

1344
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,040
collection classes we should just make everything

1345
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,040
variable because

1346
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,040
I had this history of in the early days

1347
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,040
you get doom which had

1348
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,040
some fixed limits on it then everybody started

1349
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,040
making crazier and crazier things and they kept bumping

1350
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,040
up the different limits this many lines

1351
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,040
this many sectors

1352
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,040
and it seemed like a good idea

1353
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,040
well we should just make this completely generic

1354
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,040
it can go kind of go up to whatever

1355
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,040
and

1356
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,040
there's cases where that's the right thing to do

1357
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,040
but it also the other

1358
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,040
aspect of the world changing around you

1359
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,040
is it's good to be informed

1360
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,040
when the world has changed more than you thought

1361
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,040
it would and if you've got a continuously

1362
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,040
growing collection you're never going to

1363
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,040
find out you might have this quadratic

1364
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,040
slowdown on something where you thought

1365
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,040
oh I'm only ever going to have a handful

1366
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,040
of these but something changes

1367
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,040
and there's a new design style and all of a sudden

1368
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,040
you've got 10,000 of them

1369
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,040
so I kind of like in many cases

1370
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,040
picking a number

1371
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,040
of some nice brown power of 2 number

1372
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,040
and setting it up in there

1373
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,040
and having an assert saying it's like hey

1374
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,040
you hit this limit

1375
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,040
you should probably think are the choices that you've

1376
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,040
made around all of this still relevant

1377
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,040
if somebody's using 10 times

1378
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,040
more than you thought they would

1379
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,040
yeah this code was originally written

1380
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,040
with this kind of world view

1381
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,040
with this kind of set of constraints

1382
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,040
you were thinking of the world in this way

1383
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,040
if something breaks

1384
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,040
that means you got to rethink the initial stuff

1385
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,040
and it's nice for it to

1386
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,040
for it to do that

1387
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,040
is there any stuff like keyboard

1388
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,040
or monitors

1389
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,040
I'm fairly pedestrian on

1390
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,040
a lot of that where I did move

1391
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,040
to triple monitors like in the last several

1392
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,040
years though I had been dual monitor

1393
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,040
for a very long time and

1394
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,040
and it was one of those things where

1395
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,040
probably years later than

1396
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,040
I should have I'm just like well the video cards now

1397
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,040
generally have three output ports

1398
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,040
I should just put the third monitor up there

1399
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,040
that's been a pure win I've been very happy with that

1400
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,040
but no

1401
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,040
I don't have fancy keyboard or mouse

1402
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,040
or anything

1403
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,040
the key things is an IDE that has

1404
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,040
helpful debuggers has helpful tools

1405
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,040
so it's not the emacs

1406
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,040
vim route and then die coke

1407
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,040
yeah so I did spend you know I

1408
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,040
spent one of my week long retreats

1409
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,040
where I'm like okay I'm going to make myself

1410
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,040
use it was actually

1411
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,040
classic vi which I know people will say you should never

1412
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,040
have done that you should have just used vim

1413
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,040
but you know I gave it the good try

1414
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,040
it's like okay I'm being in

1415
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,040
kind of classic Unix developer mode

1416
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,040
here and I worked

1417
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,040
for a week on it I used

1418
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,040
Anki to like teach myself the

1419
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,040
the different little key combinations for

1420
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,040
things like that and in the end it was just like

1421
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,040
alright this was kind of like my

1422
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,040
Civil War reenactment phase you know it's

1423
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,040
like I'm going out there doing it like they used to

1424
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,040
in the old days and it was kind of fun

1425
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,040
in that regard so many people right now

1426
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,040
screaming

1427
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,040
as they're listening to this so again the

1428
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,040
out is that this was not modern vim

1429
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,040
but still I yes

1430
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,040
I was very happy to get back to

1431
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,040
my visual studio at the end

1432
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,040
yeah I'm actually I struggle with this a lot

1433
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,040
because

1434
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,040
so use a kinesis keyboard and

1435
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,040
I use emacs primarily

1436
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,040
and I feel like

1437
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,040
I can exactly as you said

1438
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
I can understand the code I can navigate the

1439
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,040
code there's a lot of stuff you could build

1440
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,040
within emacs with using lisp

1441
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,040
you can customize a lot of things for yourself

1442
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,040
to help you

1443
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,040
introspect the code like to help

1444
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,040
you understand the code and visualize different

1445
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,040
aspects of the code you can even run the buggers

1446
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,040
but it's work

1447
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,040
and the world moves past you

1448
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,040
and the better and better ideas that constantly

1449
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:23,040
being built and that

1450
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,040
puts a kind of

1451
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,040
I need to take the same kind of

1452
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,040
retreat as you're talking about but now

1453
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,040
I'm still fighting the Civil War

1454
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,040
I need to kind of move into the 21st century

1455
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,040
and it does seem like the world is

1456
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,040
or a large chunk of the world is moving

1457
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,040
towards visual studio code which is

1458
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,040
kind of interesting to me against the javascript

1459
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,040
ecosystem on the one hand

1460
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,040
and IDs are one of those

1461
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,040
things that you want to be infinitely

1462
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,040
fast you want them to just kind of

1463
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,040
immediately respond

1464
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,040
and like I mean heck I've got there's someone

1465
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,040
I know I'm an old school game dev guy

1466
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,040
that still uses visual studio 6

1467
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,040
and on a modern computer

1468
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,040
everything is just absolutely

1469
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,040
instant on something like that

1470
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,040
because it was made to work on a computer that's

1471
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,040
10,000 or 100,000

1472
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,040
times slower so just everything happens

1473
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,040
immediately and all the

1474
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,040
modern systems just feel

1475
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,040
you know they feel so crufty when

1476
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,040
it's like oh why is this refreshing the screen

1477
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,040
and moving around and updating over here

1478
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,040
and something blinks down there and you should

1479
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
update this and there's

1480
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,040
you know there are things that

1481
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,040
we've lost with that incredible flexibility

1482
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,040
but

1483
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,040
lots of people get tons of value from it

1484
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,040
and I am super happy that that seems

1485
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,040
to be winning over even a lot of the old

1486
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,040
Vim and Emacs people that they're kind of like

1487
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,040
hey visual studio codes maybe you know

1488
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,040
not so bad I am

1489
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,040
that may be the final peacekeeping solution

1490
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,040
where everybody is reasonably

1491
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,040
happy with something like

1492
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,040
that. So can you explain

1493
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,040
what a .plan file is and

1494
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,040
what role that played in your life

1495
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,040
does it still continue to play a role?

1496
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,040
Back in the early early days of

1497
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,040
grid software one of

1498
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,040
our big things that was unique with what we

1499
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,040
did is I had adopted

1500
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,040
next stations or kind of next

1501
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,040
step systems from Steve Jobs's

1502
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,040
out in the

1503
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,040
out in the woods away from Apple company

1504
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,040
and

1505
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,040
they were basically it was kind of

1506
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,040
interesting because I did not really have a background

1507
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,040
with the Unix system so many of the people

1508
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,040
they get immersed in that

1509
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,040
in college and

1510
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,040
you know and that's you know that

1511
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,040
a lot of cultural expectations for them

1512
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,040
and I didn't have any of that

1513
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,040
but I knew that

1514
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:33,040
my background was I was a huge Apple 2

1515
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
fanboy I was always

1516
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,040
a little suspicious of the Mac I was

1517
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,040
not really what I what kind of I wanted

1518
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,040
to go with

1519
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,040
but when Steve Jobs left Apple

1520
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,040
and started next this computer

1521
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,040
did just seem like one of those amazing things

1522
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,040
from the future where it had all of this cool

1523
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,040
stuff in it and we were still

1524
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,040
back in those days working on DOS

1525
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,040
everything blew up you had reset buttons

1526
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,040
because your computer would just freeze

1527
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,040
if you're doing development work literally

1528
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,040
dozens of times a day your computer was just

1529
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,040
rebooting constantly and so this idea

1530
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,040
of yes any of the

1531
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,040
the Unix workstations would have given a

1532
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,040
stable development platform where

1533
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,040
you don't crash and reboot all the time

1534
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,040
but next also had

1535
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,040
this really amazing graphical

1536
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,040
interface and it was great for building

1537
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,040
tools and it used

1538
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,040
Objective-C as the kind of an interesting

1539
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,040
oh wow

1540
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,040
the next was Unix based

1541
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,040
it's that Objective-C so it has a lot of the

1542
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,040
elements that became Mac

1543
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,040
I mean the kind of reverse acquisition of Apple

1544
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,040
by next where that took over

1545
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,040
and became what the modern Mac

1546
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,040
system is and defined some of the developer

1547
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,040
like

1548
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,040
the tools and the whole community

1549
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,040
yeah you've still got if you're programming

1550
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,040
on Apple stuff now there's still all these NS

1551
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,040
somethings which was originally next

1552
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,040
step objects of different kinds of things

1553
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,040
but one of the aspects

1554
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:53,040
of those Unix systems

1555
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,040
was they had this notion of

1556
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,040
a dot plan file where

1557
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,040
a dot file is an invisible

1558
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,040
file usually in your home

1559
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:03,040
directory or something and there was a trivial

1560
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,040
server running on most Unix systems

1561
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,040
at the time that

1562
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,040
when somebody ran a trivial

1563
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,040
little command called finger

1564
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,040
you could do finger and then somebody's

1565
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
address it could be anywhere on the internet

1566
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,040
if you were connected correctly

1567
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,040
and all that server would do was

1568
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,040
read the dot plan file

1569
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,040
in that user's home directory

1570
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,040
and then just spit it out to you

1571
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,040
and originally the idea was that could be

1572
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,040
whether you're on vacation what your current

1573
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,040
project was it's supposed to be like

1574
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,040
the plan of what you're doing

1575
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,040
and people would use it for

1576
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,040
various purposes but all it did

1577
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,040
was dump that file

1578
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,040
to the terminal of whoever issued

1579
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,040
the finger command

1580
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,040
and at one point

1581
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,040
I started just keeping a list

1582
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,040
of what I was doing in there

1583
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,040
which would be what I was working on in the day

1584
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,040
and I would have this little

1585
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,040
syntax I kind of got to myself about

1586
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,040
here's something that I'm working on

1587
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,040
I put a star when I finish it

1588
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,040
I could have a few other little bits of punctuation

1589
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,040
and at the time it was

1590
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,040
it started off as being just like my to-do list

1591
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,040
and it would be these

1592
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,040
trivial obscure little things like

1593
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,040
I fixed something

1594
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,040
with collision detection code

1595
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,040
and the fireball do something different

1596
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,040
and just little one-liners

1597
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,040
that people that were following the games

1598
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,040
could kind of decipher

1599
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,040
but I did wind up

1600
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,040
starting to write much more in-depth things

1601
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,040
I would have little notes

1602
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,040
of thoughts and insights

1603
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,040
and then I would eventually start having little essays

1604
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,040
I would sometimes dump into the .plan files

1605
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,040
interspersed with the work logs

1606
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,040
of things that I was doing

1607
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,040
so in some ways it was like a super early

1608
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,040
protoblog where

1609
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,040
I was kind of dumping out what I was working on

1610
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,040
but it was interesting enough that

1611
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,040
there were a lot of people

1612
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,040
that were interested in this

1613
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,040
so most of the people didn't have Unix workstation

1614
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,040
so there were the websites

1615
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,040
back in the day that would follow the doom and quake development

1616
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,040
that would

1617
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,040
basically make a little service that would go grab

1618
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,040
all the changes and then people could just get it

1619
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,040
with a web browser and there was a period

1620
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,040
where like all of the little

1621
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,040
kind of Dallas gaming diaspora

1622
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,040
of people that were at all in that orbit

1623
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,040
there were a couple dozen

1624
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,040
.plan files going on which was

1625
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,040
and this was some years before

1626
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,040
blogging really became kind of a thing

1627
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,040
and it was kind of a

1628
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,040
a premonition of

1629
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,040
sort of the way things would go and there was

1630
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,040
it's all been collected

1631
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,040
it's available online in different places

1632
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,040
and it's kind of fun to go back and look through

1633
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
what I was thinking

1634
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,040
what I was doing in the different areas

1635
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,040
Have you had a chance to look back? Is there some interesting

1636
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,040
very low level specific

1637
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,040
to do items

1638
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,040
maybe things you've never completed

1639
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,040
all that kind of stuff and high level

1640
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,040
philosophical essay type of stuff

1641
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,040
there's some good stuff

1642
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,040
on both where

1643
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,040
a lot of it was low level nitpicky

1644
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,040
details about game dev

1645
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,040
and I've learned

1646
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,040
enough things where there's no project

1647
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,040
that I worked on that I couldn't go back

1648
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,040
and do a better job on now

1649
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,040
I mean you just you learn things hopefully

1650
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,040
if you're doing it right you learn things as you get older

1651
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,040
and you should be able to do a better job

1652
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,040
at all of the early things

1653
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,040
and there's stuff in

1654
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,040
Wolfenstein Doomquake that's like oh clearly

1655
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,040
I could go back and do a better job

1656
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,040
at this whether it's something in the rendering

1657
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,040
engine side or how I implemented

1658
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,040
the monster behaviors

1659
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,040
or managed resources or anything like that

1660
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,040
Do you see the flaws in your thinking now?

1661
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,040
Yeah I do

1662
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,040
I mean sometimes I'll get the

1663
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,040
I'll look at it and say yeah I had a pretty clear

1664
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,040
view of I was doing good work there

1665
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,040
and I haven't really

1666
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,040
hit the point where

1667
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,040
there was another programmer, Graham Divine

1668
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,040
he had worked at id and

1669
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,040
7th guest and he made some

1670
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,040
comment one time where he said he looked back at some of his

1671
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,040
old notes and he was like wow I was

1672
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,040
really smart back then

1673
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,040
and I don't hit

1674
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,040
that so much where I mean I look at it

1675
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,040
and I always know that yeah

1676
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,040
there's all the you know with aging you get

1677
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,040
certain changes in how you're

1678
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,040
able to work problems but all of the

1679
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,040
problems that I've worked I

1680
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,040
you know I'm sure that I could do a better

1681
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,040
job on all of them. Oh wow

1682
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,040
so you can still step right in if you could travel

1683
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,040
back in time and talk to that guy

1684
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,040
you would teach him a few things. Yeah absolutely

1685
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:15,040
that's awesome

1686
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,040
What about the high level philosophical stuff?

1687
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,040
Is there some insights that

1688
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,040
stand out that you remember?

1689
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,040
There's things that

1690
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,040
I was understanding about

1691
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,040
development and I

1692
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,040
in the industry and so on that were

1693
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,040
in a more primitive

1694
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,040
stage where

1695
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,040
I definitely learned a lot

1696
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,040
more in the later years about

1697
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,040
business and organization

1698
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,040
and team structure

1699
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,040
there were

1700
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,040
I mean there were definitely things that I was

1701
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,040
not the best person

1702
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,040
or even a very good person about managing

1703
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,040
like how a team should

1704
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,040
operate internally, how people should work together

1705
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,040
I was just

1706
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,040
you know just get out

1707
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,040
of my way and let me work on the code

1708
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:01,040
and do this and more and more

1709
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,040
I've learned how

1710
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,040
in the larger scheme of things

1711
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,040
how sometimes relatively

1712
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,040
unimportant some of those things are where it is

1713
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,040
this user value generation

1714
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,040
that's the overarching

1715
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,040
importance for all of that and I

1716
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,040
didn't necessarily have my eye on that ball

1717
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,040
correctly through a lot of my

1718
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,040
you know my earlier years

1719
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,040
and there's things that

1720
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,040
you know I could have gotten more

1721
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,040
out of people handling things in different ways

1722
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,040
I am you know I could have made

1723
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,040
you know in some ways more

1724
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,040
successful products by following things

1725
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,040
in different ways there's mistakes that we

1726
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,040
made that we couldn't really have

1727
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,040
known how things would have worked out but

1728
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,040
it was interesting to see in later years companies

1729
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,040
like Activision showing that hey you really

1730
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,040
can just do the same game

1731
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,040
make it better every year and you can

1732
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,040
look at that from a negative standpoint and say

1733
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,040
it's like oh that's just being derivative and all that

1734
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,040
but if you step back again

1735
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,040
and say it's like no are the people buying it

1736
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,040
still enjoying it are they enjoying it more

1737
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,040
than what they might have bought otherwise

1738
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,040
and you can say no that's

1739
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,040
that's actually a great value creation

1740
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,040
engine to do that if you're in a position

1741
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,040
where you can

1742
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,040
you know don't be forced into reinventing

1743
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,040
everything just because you think that you need

1744
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,040
to

1745
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,040
you know lots of things about

1746
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,040
business and team stuff that could be done

1747
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,040
better but the technical work

1748
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,040
the kind of technical visionary type stuff

1749
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,040
that I laid out I still feel pretty good

1750
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,040
about there are some classic old

1751
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,040
ones about my defending of OpenGL

1752
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,040
versus D3D

1753
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,040
which turned out

1754
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,040
to be one of the more probably important

1755
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,040
momentous things there where

1756
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,040
it never it was always

1757
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,040
a rearguard action on Windows where

1758
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,040
Microsoft was just not going to let

1759
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,040
that win but when I look back

1760
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,040
on it now that fight

1761
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,040
to keep OpenGL relevant for

1762
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,040
a number of years there meant

1763
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,040
that OpenGL was there when

1764
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,040
mobile started happening and

1765
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,040
OpenGL ES was the thing that

1766
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,040
drove all of the acceleration

1767
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,040
of the mobile industry and it's

1768
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,040
really only in the last few years

1769
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,040
as apples moved to metal and some of

1770
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,040
the other companies have moved to Vulcan

1771
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,040
that that's moved away but

1772
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,040
really stepping back and

1773
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,040
looking at it's like yeah I sold tens

1774
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,040
of millions of games for different things

1775
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,040
but billions

1776
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,040
and billions of devices wound up

1777
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,040
with an appropriate

1778
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,040
capable graphics API

1779
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,040
do in no small part

1780
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,040
to me thinking that that was really important

1781
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,040
that we not just

1782
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,040
give up and use Microsoft's

1783
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,040
at that time

1784
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,040
really terrible API.

1785
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,040
The thing about Microsoft is the APIs don't stay

1786
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,040
terrible. They were terrible at the start

1787
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,040
but a few versions on

1788
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,040
they were actually quite good and there was a completely

1789
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,040
fair argument to be made that

1790
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,040
by the time DX9 was out

1791
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,040
it was probably a better programming environment

1792
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,040
than OpenGL but it was still

1793
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,040
a wonderful good thing

1794
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,040
that we had an open standard that could

1795
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,040
show up on Linux and Android

1796
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,040
and iOS and eventually WebGL

1797
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,040
still to this day so

1798
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,040
that was one

1799
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,040
that would be on my greatest hits list of things

1800
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,040
that I kind of pushed with. The impact it had

1801
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:07,040
on billions of devices yes

1802
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,040
so let's talk about it

1803
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,040
can you tell the origin story of idsoftware?

1804
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,040
Again

1805
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,040
one of the greatest game developer companies

1806
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,040
ever it created

1807
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,040
Wolfenstein 3D

1808
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,040
games that define

1809
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,040
my life also in many ways

1810
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,040
as a thing that made me realize what computers are capable

1811
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,040
of in terms of graphics

1812
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,040
in terms of performance

1813
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,040
it just unlocked something deep

1814
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,040
in me in understanding

1815
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,040
what these machines are all about as games can do that

1816
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,040
so Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake

1817
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,040
and just all the

1818
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:41,040
incredible engineering innovation that went into

1819
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,040
that. So how did it all

1820
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,040
start?

1821
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,040
So I'll caveat up front that I usually

1822
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,040
don't consider myself the

1823
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,040
historian of the software side of

1824
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,040
things. I usually do

1825
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,040
kind of point people at John Romero

1826
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,040
for stories about the early days

1827
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,040
where

1828
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,040
I've never been like I've commented that

1829
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,040
I'm a remarkably unsentimental person

1830
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,040
in some ways where I don't really

1831
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,040
spend a lot of time unless I'm explicitly

1832
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,040
prodded to go back and think about the

1833
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,040
early days of things and

1834
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,040
I didn't

1835
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,040
necessarily make the effort to

1836
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,040
archive everything exactly in my brain

1837
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,040
and the more that I work on machine learning

1838
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,040
and AI and the aspects of memory

1839
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,040
and how when you go back and polish certain

1840
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,040
things it's not necessarily exactly

1841
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,040
the way it happened but

1842
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,040
having said all of that from

1843
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,040
my view the way everything happened

1844
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,040
that led up to that was

1845
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,040
after I was

1846
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,040
an adult and kind of taking

1847
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,040
a few college classes deciding to drop

1848
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,040
out I was doing

1849
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:43,040
hardscrabble contract

1850
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,040
programming work really struggling to

1851
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,040
kind of keep groceries and pay my rent

1852
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,040
and things and the company

1853
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,040
that I was doing the most work for was

1854
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,040
a company called Softdisk Publishing

1855
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:55,040
which had the

1856
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,040
Sounds Bizarre Now business model

1857
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,040
of monthly subscription software.

1858
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,040
Before there was an internet

1859
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,040
that people could connect to and get software

1860
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,040
you would pay

1861
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,040
a certain amount and every month they would send

1862
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,040
you a disk that had some random software

1863
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,040
on it and people that were into

1864
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,040
computers thought this was kind of cool

1865
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,040
and they had different ones for the Apple 2

1866
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,040
the 2GS, the PC, the Mac,

1867
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,040
the Amiga

1868
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,040
lots of different things here so quirky little

1869
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,040
business but I was doing a lot

1870
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:25,040
of contract programming for them where

1871
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,040
I'd write tiny little games and

1872
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,040
sell them for $300, $500

1873
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,040
and one of the things

1874
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,040
that I was doing again

1875
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,040
to keep my head above water here was

1876
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,040
I decided that I could make

1877
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,040
one program and I could

1878
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,040
port it to multiple systems

1879
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:43,040
so I would write a game like

1880
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,040
Dark Designs or Catacombs

1881
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:47,040
and I would develop it on the Apple 2

1882
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,040
the 2GS and the IBM PC

1883
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,040
which apparently

1884
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,040
was the thing that really kind of

1885
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,040
piqued the attention of the

1886
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,040
people working down there like Jay Wilbur

1887
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,040
was my primary editor and Tom Hall

1888
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,040
was a secondary editor

1889
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,040
and they kept asking me it's like hey

1890
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,040
you should come down and work for us here

1891
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,040
and I

1892
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,040
pushed it off a couple times because I was

1893
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,040
really enjoying my freedom of kind of being

1894
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,040
off on my own even if I was barely

1895
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:15,040
getting by I loved it I was

1896
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,040
doing nothing but programming all day

1897
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,040
but I did have enough

1898
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,040
close scrapes with like damn I'm just

1899
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,040
really out of money that maybe I should

1900
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,040
get an actual job

1901
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,040
rather than contracting these kind of one at

1902
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,040
a time things and Jay Wilbur

1903
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,040
was great he was like fed exing me the checks

1904
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,040
when I would need them to kind of

1905
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,040
get over whatever hump I was at

1906
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,040
so I took the

1907
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,040
I finally took them up on their offer to come

1908
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,040
down to Shreveport Louisiana

1909
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,040
I was in Kansas City at the time

1910
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,040
drove down

1911
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,040
to through the Ozarks and everything

1912
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,040
down to Louisiana

1913
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,040
and saw the soft disk

1914
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,040
offices went through talked to a bunch of

1915
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,040
people met the people I had been working

1916
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,040
with remotely at that time

1917
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,040
but the most important thing for me was

1918
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,040
I met two programmers

1919
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,040
there John Romero and Lane Roth

1920
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,040
that for the first time ever I had met

1921
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,040
programmers that knew more

1922
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,040
cool stuff than I did where

1923
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,040
the world was just different back then I

1924
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,040
was in Kansas City it was one of those

1925
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,040
smartest kid in the school does all the

1926
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,040
computer stuff the teachers don't have anything

1927
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,040
to teach him but all I had to learn from

1928
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,040
was these few books at the library

1929
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,040
it was not much at all

1930
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,040
and there were some aspects of programming

1931
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,040
that were kind of black magic to me

1932
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,040
like it's like oh he knows how to format

1933
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,040
a track on I am you know on a

1934
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,040
low-level drive programming

1935
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,040
interface and this was

1936
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,040
I was still not at all

1937
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,040
sure I was going to take the job but I met

1938
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,040
these awesome programmers that

1939
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,040
were doing cool stuff and my Romero had

1940
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,040
worked at Origin Systems and he had done

1941
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,040
like you know so many different games

1942
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,040
ahead of time

1943
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,040
that I did kind of quickly decide like yeah

1944
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,040
I'll go take the job down there

1945
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,040
and I

1946
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,040
settled down there moved in

1947
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,040
and started working on more little projects

1948
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,040
and the first kind of

1949
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,040
big change that happened down there

1950
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:05,040
was the company wanted to make a gaming

1951
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,040
focused a PC gaming focused

1952
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,040
subscription just like all their other

1953
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,040
was the same formula that they used for

1954
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,040
everything pay a monthly fee

1955
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,040
and you'll get a disc with

1956
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,040
one or two games just every month

1957
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,040
and no choice in what you get but we think

1958
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,040
it'll be fun and that was the model they

1959
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,040
were comfortable with and said all right

1960
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,040
we're going to start this gamers edge department

1961
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,040
and all of us that were

1962
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,040
interested in that like me Romero

1963
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,040
I Tom Hall was kind of helping

1964
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,040
us from from his side of things

1965
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,040
Jay would peak in and we had a few other

1966
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,040
programmers

1967
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:39,040
working with us at the time and we were going

1968
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,040
to to just start making games

1969
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,040
just the same model

1970
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,040
and we dived in and it was

1971
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,040
fantastic you know you have to make new games

1972
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,040
every month every month

1973
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,040
yeah and this

1974
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,040
in retrospect looking back at it

1975
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,040
that sense that I had done all this contract

1976
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,040
programming and John Romero had done

1977
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,040
like far more of this where he had done

1978
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,040
one of his teaching himself efforts

1979
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,040
was he made a game for every letter of the alphabet

1980
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:05,040
that sense of like I'm just going to go make

1981
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,040
26 different games give him a different

1982
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,040
theme and you learn

1983
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,040
so much when you go through and you

1984
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,040
crank these things out like on a

1985
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,040
bi-weekly monthly basis something like that

1986
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,040
start to finish it's not like an

1987
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,040
idea it's not just

1988
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,040
from the very beginning to the very end

1989
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,040
it's done

1990
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,040
it has to be done there's no delaying

1991
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,040
it's done and you've got deadlines

1992
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,040
and that kind of

1993
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:31,040
rapid iteration pressure cooker

1994
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,040
environment was super important

1995
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,040
for all of us developing the skills

1996
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,040
that I you know that brought us

1997
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,040
to where we eventually went to I mean

1998
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,040
people would say like in the history of the Beatles

1999
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,040
like it wasn't them being the Beatles

2000
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,040
it was them playing all of these other

2001
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,040
you know early works that that opportunity

2002
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,040
to craft all of their skills before they were

2003
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,040
famous that was very

2004
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,040
critical to their later successes

2005
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,040
and I think there's a lot of that here

2006
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,040
where we did these games that

2007
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,040
nobody remembers lots

2008
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,040
of little things that contributed

2009
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,040
to building up the skill set for the things that

2010
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,040
eventually did make us famous

2011
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,040
and just to ask you wrote the

2012
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,040
gambler I had to

2013
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,040
write it in a month just

2014
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,040
make money and nobody

2015
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,040
remembers that probably because he had to

2016
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,040
figure out because it's literally

2017
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,040
he didn't have enough

2018
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,040
time to write it fast enough

2019
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,040
to come up with hacks

2020
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,040
literally

2021
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,040
pressure and limitation of resources

2022
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,040
is surprisingly

2023
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,040
important and it's

2024
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,040
counterintuitive in a lot of ways where you just think

2025
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,040
that if you've got all the time in the world

2026
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,040
and you've got all the resources in the world

2027
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,040
of course you're going to get something better

2028
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,040
but sometimes it really does work out that

2029
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,040
you know innovations

2030
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,040
and other necessity and you know where you can

2031
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,040
resource constraints and you have to do

2032
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,040
things when you don't have a choice

2033
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,040
it's surprising what you can do.

2034
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,040
Is there any good games written in that time

2035
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,040
would you say? Some of them are still fun to go back

2036
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,040
and play where you get the

2037
01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,040
they were

2038
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,040
all about kind of the more modern term is

2039
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,040
game feel about how just the exact

2040
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,040
feel that things it's not the grand

2041
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,040
strategy of the design but how

2042
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,040
running and jumping and shooting

2043
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,040
those things I feel in the

2044
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,040
in the moment and some of those are still

2045
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,040
if you sat down on them you kind of go

2046
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,040
it's a little bit different it doesn't have the same

2047
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,040
movement feel but you move over and you're like

2048
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,040
bang jump bang it's like

2049
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,040
hey that's kind of cool still

2050
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,040
so you can get lost in the rhythm of the game

2051
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,040
like is that what you mean by feel

2052
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,040
just like

2053
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,040
there's something about it that pulls you in

2054
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,040
nowadays again people talk about

2055
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,040
compulsion loops and things where it's that

2056
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,040
that sense of exactly

2057
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,040
what you're doing what your fingers are doing on

2058
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,040
the keyboard what your eyes are seeing

2059
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,040
and they're going to be the sequences of things

2060
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,040
grab the loot shoot the monster jump

2061
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,040
over the obstacle get to the end of the level

2062
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,040
these are eternal aspects of game design

2063
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,040
in a lot of ways but

2064
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,040
there are better and worse ways to do all of

2065
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,040
them and we did so many of these

2066
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,040
games that it was I we got

2067
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,040
a lot of practice with it

2068
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,040
so one of the kind of weird things

2069
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,040
that was happening at this time is John

2070
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,040
Romero was getting some

2071
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,040
some strange fan mail and back

2072
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,040
in the days this was before email

2073
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,040
so we literally got letters sometimes

2074
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,040
and telling him it's like oh I want

2075
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
to talk to you about your games I want to

2076
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,040
reach out different things

2077
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,040
and I eventually

2078
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,040
turned out that these were all coming from

2079
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
Scott Miller at Apigee Software

2080
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:25,040
and he was

2081
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,040
reaching out through he didn't think he could

2082
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,040
contact John directly that he would get

2083
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,040
intercepted so he was trying to get him to

2084
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,040
contact him through like back channel

2085
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,040
fan mail because he basically was

2086
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,040
saying hey I'm making all this money

2087
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,040
on shareware games I want

2088
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,040
you to make shareware games because

2089
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,040
he had seen some of the games that Romero

2090
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,040
had done and

2091
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,040
you know we looked at Scott Miller's

2092
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,040
games and we didn't think they were

2093
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,040
very good I am we're like

2094
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,040
that can't be making the kind of money

2095
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,040
that he's saying he's making ten grand or something

2096
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,040
I am off of this game

2097
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,040
and we really thought that he was full of

2098
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,040
shit that it was a lie trying to get

2099
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,040
I had to get him into this

2100
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,040
but so that was kind of going on at

2101
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,040
I am you know at one level

2102
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,040
he was and it was funny the moment

2103
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,040
when Romero realized that he had some of

2104
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,040
these letters pinned up on his wall like all of his

2105
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,040
fans and then we noticed that they all had the same

2106
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,040
return address with different names on them

2107
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,040
which was a little bit of a two-edged sword

2108
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,040
there trying to

2109
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,040
figure out the puzzle laid out before

2110
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,040
him yeah what happened after I kind

2111
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,040
of coincident with that was

2112
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,040
I was working on a lot of the new technologies

2113
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,040
where

2114
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,040
I was now full on the IBM PC

2115
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,040
for the first time where I was really

2116
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,040
a long hold out on Apple II forever

2117
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,040
and I you know I loved my Apple II

2118
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,040
it was the computer I was wished I had when I was

2119
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,040
growing up and when I finally did have one

2120
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,040
I was I was kind of clinging on

2121
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,040
to that well-passed it's sort of good use

2122
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,040
by the best computer ever made you would you say

2123
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,040
I wouldn't

2124
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,040
make judgments like that about it

2125
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,040
but it was positioned in such a way especially

2126
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,040
in the school systems that it impacted

2127
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,040
a whole lot of American

2128
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,040
programmers at least where

2129
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,040
there was programs that the Apple II's got

2130
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,040
into the schools and they had enough

2131
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,040
capability that lots of interesting things

2132
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,040
happened with them you know in Europe

2133
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,040
it was different you had your Amiga's and

2134
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:13,040
Atari's and you know I'm

2135
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,040
acorns in the UK and things that

2136
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,040
that had different things but in the United States

2137
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,040
it was probably the Apple II made the most

2138
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,040
impact for a lot

2139
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,040
of programmers of my generation

2140
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,040
but so I was really digging into

2141
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,040
the IBM and this was

2142
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,040
even more so with the total focus

2143
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,040
because I had moved to another city where I

2144
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,040
didn't know anybody that I wasn't working with

2145
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,040
I had a little apartment

2146
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,040
and then at Softisk again the things

2147
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,040
that that drew me to it I had

2148
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,040
a couple programmers that knew more than I

2149
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,040
did and they had a library

2150
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,040
they had a set of books and

2151
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,040
a set of magazines they had a couple years of

2152
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,040
magazines the old Dr. Dobbs Journal

2153
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,040
and all of these magazines that had

2154
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,040
information about things

2155
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,040
and so I was just

2156
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,040
in total immersion mode it was

2157
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,040
eat, breathe, sleep, computer programming

2158
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,040
particularly the IBM for

2159
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,040
everything that I was doing

2160
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:05,040
and I was digging into a lot of these

2161
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,040
low-level hardware details that people

2162
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,040
weren't usually paying attention to

2163
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:11,040
the way the IBM EGA

2164
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,040
cards worked

2165
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,040
which was fun for me I hadn't had experience

2166
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,040
with things at that level

2167
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,040
and back then you could get

2168
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,040
hardware documentation just down at the register

2169
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,040
levels this is where the CRTC

2170
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,040
register is this is how the color

2171
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,040
registers work and how the different things

2172
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,040
are applied and they were designed for

2173
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,040
a certain reason they were designed

2174
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,040
for an application they were had an intended

2175
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,040
use in mind but I was

2176
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,040
starting to look at other ways

2177
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,040
that they could perhaps be exploited that they weren't

2178
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,040
initially intended for.

2179
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,040
Could you comment on like first of all

2180
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,040
what operating system was there what what

2181
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,040
instructions that was like what

2182
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,040
what are the what are we talking about?

2183
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,040
DOS and x86 so 16-bit

2184
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,040
8086 the two

2185
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,040
86's were there and three 86's

2186
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,040
existed they were rare

2187
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:59,040
we had a couple for our development systems

2188
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,040
but we were still targeting

2189
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,040
the more broad I

2190
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,040
it was all DOS 16-bit

2191
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,040
none of this was kind of DOS extenders

2192
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,040
and things. How different is it from the systems

2193
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,040
of today's it's kind of the precursor

2194
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,040
that's similar? Very little

2195
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,040
if you open up command.exe

2196
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,040
on or com on

2197
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,040
windows you see some of the remnants

2198
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,040
of all of that but it was a different world

2199
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:23,040
it was the 640k is enough

2200
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,040
world and nothing was protected

2201
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,040
it crashed all the time you had

2202
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,040
TSR's or terminate and stay

2203
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,040
resident hacks on top of things

2204
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:33,040
that would cause configuration problems

2205
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:35,040
all the hardware was manually

2206
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,040
configured in your auto-exec

2207
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,040
so it was a very different world

2208
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,040
but the code is still the same similar

2209
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,040
you would still write it my earliest

2210
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,040
code there was written in Pascal that was

2211
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:47,040
what I had learned

2212
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,040
between basic

2213
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:51,040
and C++ there was Pascal

2214
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,040
when basic assembly language

2215
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,040
some of my intermediate

2216
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,040
stuff was well you had to for performance

2217
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,040
basic was just too slow

2218
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,040
most of the work that I was doing as a contract

2219
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:03,040
programmer in my teenage years

2220
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,040
was assembly language

2221
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,040
you wrote games in assembly?

2222
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,040
yeah complete games

2223
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,040
in assembly language

2224
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,040
and it's thousands and thousands of lines

2225
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,040
every letter acronyms for the

2226
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,040
instructions

2227
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,040
you don't earn the once again

2228
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,040
greatest programmer ever labeled

2229
01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,040
without being able to write a game in assembly

2230
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,040
but that's again everybody wrote there

2231
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,040
everybody serious wrote their games in assembly language

2232
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,040
it was kind of a

2233
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,040
everybody serious

2234
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,040
it was an outlier to use Pascal

2235
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,040
a little bit where there was one famous

2236
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,040
program called wizardry

2237
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,040
it was one of the great early role playing games

2238
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,040
that was written in Pascal

2239
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,040
but it was almost nothing

2240
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,040
used Pascal there but I did learn Pascal

2241
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,040
and I remember doing all of my

2242
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,040
like to this day I sketch in data structures

2243
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,040
when I'm thinking about something

2244
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,040
I'll open up a file

2245
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,040
and I'll start writing struct definitions

2246
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,040
for how data is going to be laid out

2247
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:59,040
and Pascal was kind of formative to that

2248
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,040
because I remember designing my RPGs

2249
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,040
in Pascal record structures

2250
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,040
and things like that

2251
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,040
and so I had gotten a Pascal compiler

2252
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,040
for the Apple 2GS that I could work on

2253
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,040
the first IBM game that I developed

2254
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,040
I did in Pascal

2255
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,040
and that's actually kind of an interesting story

2256
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,040
again talking about the constraints

2257
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:19,040
and resources where

2258
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,040
I had an Apple 2GS I didn't have an IBM PC

2259
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,040
I wanted to port my

2260
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,040
applications to IBM

2261
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:27,040
because I thought I could make more money on it

2262
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,040
so what I wound up doing

2263
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,040
is I rented a PC for a week

2264
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,040
and bought a copy of

2265
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,040
Turbo Pascal and so I had

2266
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:37,040
a hard one week and this was cutting into

2267
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,040
a minimal profit margin I had there

2268
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,040
but I had this computer for a week

2269
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,040
I had to get my program ported

2270
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,040
before I had to return the PC

2271
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,040
and that was kind of the first thing

2272
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,040
that I had done on the IBM PC

2273
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,040
and what led me to taking the job at Softisk

2274
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,040
and Turbo Pascal

2275
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,040
how's that different from regular Pascal

2276
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,040
is it different compiler or something like that

2277
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,040
so it was a product of Borland

2278
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,040
which before Microsoft kind of killed them

2279
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,040
they were the hot stuff

2280
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,040
developer tools company

2281
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,040
Turbo Pascal and Turbo C

2282
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,040
and Turbo Prologue I mean all the different things

2283
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,040
but what they did was

2284
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,040
they took a supremely pragmatic approach

2285
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:15,040
of making something useful it was

2286
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,040
one of these great examples where

2287
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,040
Pascal was an academic language

2288
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,040
and you had things like the UCSDP

2289
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,040
system that Wizardry was actually

2290
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:25,040
written in that they did

2291
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,040
they did manage to make a game with that

2292
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,040
but it was

2293
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,040
not a super practical system

2294
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,040
while Turbo Pascal was

2295
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,040
called Turbo because it was blazingly fast

2296
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,040
to compile I mean really

2297
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,040
ridiculously 10 to 20 times

2298
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,040
faster than most other compilers at the

2299
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,040
time but it also had very

2300
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,040
pragmatic access to look you can just

2301
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,040
poke at the hardware in these different ways

2302
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,040
and we have libraries that let you do things

2303
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,040
and it was a pretty good

2304
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,040
it was a perfectly good way to write games

2305
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,040
and this is one of those things where people have talked

2306
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,040
about different paths that computer

2307
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,040
development could have taken

2308
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,040
where C took over the world

2309
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,040
reasons that came out of UNIX

2310
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,040
and eventually Linux

2311
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,040
and that was not a foregone conclusion at all

2312
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,040
and people can make

2313
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,040
real reasoned rational arguments

2314
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,040
that the world might have been better

2315
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,040
if it had gone a Pascal route

2316
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:17,040
I'm somewhat agnostic on that

2317
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,040
where I do know from experience

2318
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:21,040
it was perfectly good enough to do

2319
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,040
that and it had some fundamental

2320
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,040
improvements like it had range checked

2321
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,040
arrays as an option there which could

2322
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,040
avoid many of C's

2323
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,040
as well as some kind of

2324
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,040
experimental hazards that happened in a security

2325
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,040
space but C1

2326
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,040
they were basically operating at about the same

2327
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,040
level of abstraction it was

2328
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,040
a systems programming language

2329
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,040
but you said Pascal had more

2330
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,040
emphasis on data structures

2331
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,040
actually

2332
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,040
in the tree of languages did Pascal

2333
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,040
come before C

2334
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,040
they were pretty contemporaneous

2335
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,040
so Pascal's lineage went to

2336
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,040
Modula 2 and eventually Oberon

2337
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,040
of experimental language

2338
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,040
but they were all good enough at that level

2339
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,040
now some of the classic

2340
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,040
academic oriented Pascal's were just missing

2341
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,040
fundamental things like oh you can't access

2342
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,040
this core system thing because we're just using

2343
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,040
it to teach students but

2344
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,040
Turbo Pascal showed that only modest changes

2345
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,040
to it really did make it

2346
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,040
a completely capable language

2347
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,040
and it had some reasons why

2348
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,040
you could implement it as a single pass compiler

2349
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,040
so it could be way way faster although

2350
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:25,040
less scope for optimizations if you do it

2351
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,040
that way and it did have

2352
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,040
some range checking options it had a little bit

2353
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,040
better typing capability

2354
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,040
properly typed enum sorts of things

2355
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,040
and other stuff that C lacked

2356
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,040
but you know C was also clearly

2357
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,040
good enough and it wound up with a huge

2358
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,040
inertia from the Unix ecosystem

2359
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,040
and Pascal didn't have garbage collection

2360
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,040
no it was not garbage

2361
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,040
collected the same kind of thing the same manual

2362
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,040
so you could still have your use after freeze

2363
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:51,040
and all those other problems but

2364
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,040
just getting rid of array overruns

2365
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,040
at least if you were compiled with that

2366
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,040
debugging option certainly would have avoided

2367
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,040
a lot of problems and could have a lot

2368
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,040
of benefits but so anyways that was the next

2369
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,040
thing I had to learn C because C

2370
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,040
was where it seemed like most

2371
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,040
of the things were going

2372
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,040
so I abandoned Pascal and I started working

2373
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,040
in C I started hacking on these hardware

2374
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,040
things dealing with

2375
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,040
the graphics controllers and the EGA

2376
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,040
systems and what we

2377
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:19,040
most wanted to do so at that time

2378
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:21,040
we had

2379
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,040
sitting in our darkened office playing

2380
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,040
all the different console video games

2381
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,040
we were figuring out what do we want to

2382
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,040
what games do we want to make for our

2383
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,040
gamers edge product there

2384
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,040
and so we had one of the first

2385
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,040
Super Nintendo's sitting there and we had

2386
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,040
an older Nintendo looking at all those

2387
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,040
games and the core thing that those

2388
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,040
consoles did that you just didn't get on

2389
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,040
the PC games was this ability

2390
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,040
to have a massive scrolling world

2391
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,040
where most of the games that you would make

2392
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:49,040
on the PC and earlier

2393
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,040
personal computers would be a static

2394
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,040
screen you move little things around on

2395
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,040
it and you interact like that maybe

2396
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,040
you go to additional screens as

2397
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,040
you move but arcade

2398
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,040
games and consoles had this

2399
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,040
wonderful ability to just have a big

2400
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,040
world that you're slowly moving your

2401
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,040
window through and that was

2402
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,040
for those types of games the kind of

2403
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,040
action exploration adventure games that

2404
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,040
was a super super important thing

2405
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,040
and PC games just didn't do

2406
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,040
that and what I

2407
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,040
had come across was a couple different

2408
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,040
techniques for implementing

2409
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,040
that on the PC and they're not

2410
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,040
hard complicated things

2411
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,040
when I explain them now they're

2412
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,040
they're pretty straightforward but just nobody was doing

2413
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:31,040
you sound like Einstein describing his

2414
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:33,040
five papers is pretty straightforward

2415
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,040
I understand but they're

2416
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,040
nevertheless revolutions so side-scrolling

2417
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,040
is a game-changer

2418
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,040
it's a genius invention

2419
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,040
and some of the consoles had different

2420
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,040
limitations about you could do one but not the

2421
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,040
other and I and there were similar things

2422
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,040
going on as advancements even in the console

2423
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,040
space where you'd have like the original

2424
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,040
Mario game was

2425
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,040
like just horizontal scrolling and then later

2426
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:57,040
Mario games added vertical aspects to

2427
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,040
it different things that

2428
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,040
you were doing to explore

2429
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:03,040
you know kind of expand the capabilities there

2430
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,040
and so much of the early game design for

2431
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,040
decades was removing limitations

2432
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,040
letting you do things that you envisioned

2433
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,040
as a designer you wanted the player to

2434
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,040
experience but the hardware just

2435
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:15,040
couldn't really or you didn't know how

2436
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,040
to make it happen it felt

2437
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,040
impossible you can imagine

2438
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,040
that you want to create like this

2439
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,040
big world through which you can

2440
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,040
side-scroll like through which you can

2441
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,040
walk and then

2442
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,040
you ask yourself a question how do I

2443
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:31,040
actually build that in a way that's

2444
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,040
like the the latency

2445
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,040
is low enough the

2446
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,040
hardware can actually deliver that

2447
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,040
in such a way there's a compelling

2448
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,040
yeah and we knew what we wanted to do because

2449
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,040
we were playing all of these console games playing

2450
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,040
all these Nintendo games and arcade games

2451
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:47,040
clearly there is a whole world of awesome

2452
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,040
things there that we just couldn't do on the

2453
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,040
PC at least initially

2454
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,040
because every programmer can tell it's

2455
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,040
like if you want to scroll you can just redraw the whole

2456
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,040
screen but then it turns out well you're going

2457
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,040
five frames per second I view that's

2458
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,040
not an interactive fun experience

2459
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,040
you want to be going 30 or 60

2460
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,040
frames per second or something and

2461
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,040
it just didn't feel like that was possible it

2462
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,040
felt like the PCs had to get five

2463
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,040
times faster for you to make a playable

2464
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,040
game there and

2465
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,040
interestingly I wound up with two

2466
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,040
completely different solutions

2467
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,040
for the scrolling problem

2468
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,040
and this is

2469
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,040
this is a theme that runs through everything

2470
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:25,040
where all of these big technical advancements

2471
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,040
it turns out there's always a couple different

2472
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:29,040
ways of doing them and it's not

2473
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,040
like you found the one true way

2474
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,040
of doing it and we'll see this as we

2475
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,040
go into 3d games and things later

2476
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:37,040
but so the scrolling

2477
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,040
the first set of scrolling tricks that I got

2478
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,040
was

2479
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,040
the hardware had this ability

2480
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,040
to you could shift

2481
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,040
like inside the window of memory

2482
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,040
so the EGA cards at the time

2483
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:51,040
had 256 kilobytes

2484
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,040
of memory and it was

2485
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,040
awkwardly set up in this planer

2486
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,040
format where instead of

2487
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,040
having 256 or

2488
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:01,040
24 million colors

2489
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,040
you had 16 colors which is 4 bits

2490
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,040
so you had 4 bit planes

2491
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,040
64k a piece of course

2492
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,040
64k is a nice round number

2493
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,040
for 16 bit addressing

2494
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,040
so your graphics card had

2495
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,040
a 16 bit window that you could

2496
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,040
look at and you could tell it to start

2497
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,040
the video scan out anywhere inside there

2498
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,040
so there were a couple games

2499
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,040
that had taken this approach if you could make

2500
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,040
a 2x2 screen or a 1x4 screen

2501
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,040
and you could do scrolling really

2502
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,040
easily like that you could just lay it

2503
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,040
all out and just pan around there

2504
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,040
but you just couldn't make it any bigger

2505
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,040
because that's all the memory that was there

2506
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,040
the first insight to the scrolling

2507
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,040
that I had was well

2508
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,040
if we make a screen that's just

2509
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:43,040
one tile larger you know

2510
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,040
we usually had tiles that were 16 pixels

2511
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:47,040
by 16 pixels the little classic

2512
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,040
Mario block that you run into

2513
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,040
lots of art gets drawn that way

2514
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,040
and your screen is a certain number of tiles

2515
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,040
but if you had one little buffer region

2516
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:57,040
outside of that

2517
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,040
you could easily pan around inside that

2518
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,040
16 pixel region that could be perfectly

2519
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,040
smooth but then what happens

2520
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,040
if you get to the edge and you want to keep going

2521
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,040
the first way we did

2522
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,040
scrolling was what I called

2523
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,040
adaptive tile refresh

2524
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,040
which was really just a matter of

2525
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,040
you get to the edge and then

2526
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:17,040
you go back to the original point and then

2527
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:19,040
only change the tiles that have actually

2528
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,040
that are different between where it

2529
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,040
was in most of the games at the time

2530
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,040
if you think about sort of your

2531
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,040
classic Super Mario Brothers game

2532
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,040
you've got big fields of blue sky

2533
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,040
long rows of

2534
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,040
the same brick texture

2535
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,040
and there's a lot of commonality

2536
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,040
it's kind of like a data compression thing

2537
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,040
if you take the screen and you set it down

2538
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,040
on top of each other in general

2539
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,040
only about 10% of the tiles

2540
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,040
were actually different there

2541
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,040
so this was a way to

2542
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,040
go ahead and say well I'm going to move it back

2543
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,040
and then I'm only going to change those

2544
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,040
10, 20 whatever percent

2545
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,040
tiles there and that meant

2546
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,040
that it was essentially five times

2547
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,040
faster than if you were redrawing all of the

2548
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,040
tiles and that worked well enough

2549
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,040
for us to do a bunch of these games

2550
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,040
for Gamers Edge

2551
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,040
we had a lot of these scrolling games like

2552
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,040
Slurnax and Shadow Knights and things like

2553
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:11,040
that that we were cranking out at this high

2554
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,040
rate that had this scrolling effect on it

2555
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,040
and it worked well enough there were

2556
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,040
design challenges there where

2557
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,040
if you made the worst case, if you made a

2558
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,040
checkerboard over the entire screen

2559
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,040
you scroll over one and every single tile

2560
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,040
changes and your frame rates now five frames

2561
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,040
and because it had to redraw everything

2562
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,040
so the designers had a little bit that they

2563
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,040
had to worry about they had to make these

2564
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,040
relatively plain looking levels

2565
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,040
but it was still pretty magical

2566
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,040
it was something that we hadn't seen before

2567
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,040
and

2568
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,040
the first thing that we wound up doing

2569
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,040
with that was I had just gotten this

2570
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,040
working and Tom Hall was

2571
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,040
sitting there with me and

2572
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,040
we were looking over at our Super Nintendo

2573
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,040
on the side there with Super Mario 3

2574
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,040
running and we had

2575
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,040
the technology, we had the tools

2576
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,040
set up there and we stayed up

2577
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,040
all night and we basically cloned

2578
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,040
the first level of Super Mario Brothers

2579
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,040
Performance wise as well? Yeah

2580
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,040
and so it and we had our little character running

2581
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,040
and jumping in there it wasn't

2582
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,040
it was close to pixel accurate as far as

2583
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:11,040
all the backgrounds and everything

2584
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,040
but the gaming was just stuff that we cobbled

2585
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,040
together from previous games that I had

2586
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,040
written I just kind of like really kit bash

2587
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,040
the whole thing together to make this demo

2588
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,040
and that was one of the rare cases

2589
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,040
when I said I don't usually do these

2590
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,040
all night programming things

2591
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:27,040
there's probably only two memorable ones

2592
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,040
that I can think about you know one was

2593
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,040
the all nighter to go ahead and get

2594
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,040
to get our dangerous Dave

2595
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,040
in copyright infringement is how we titled it

2596
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,040
because we had a game called dangerous Dave

2597
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,040
was you know running around with the shotgun shooting

2598
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,040
things and we were

2599
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:43,040
just taking our most beloved game at the time

2600
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:45,040
there the Super Mario 3

2601
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,040
and sort of sticking Dave inside that with

2602
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,040
this new scrolling technology that was

2603
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,040
going perfectly smooth for

2604
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,040
I am you know for them

2605
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,040
as it ran and Tom

2606
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,040
and I just kind of blurrily the next morning

2607
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,040
you know kind of left and we left a disc

2608
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,040
on I you know on the desk

2609
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,040
for John Romero and J Wilbur

2610
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,040
to see and just said run this

2611
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,040
and we eventually made it back in

2612
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,040
later in the day and it

2613
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:11,040
was you know like they grabbed us

2614
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,040
and pulled us in you know pulled us into the room

2615
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,040
and that was the point where they were

2616
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,040
like we got to do something with this

2617
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:19,040
you know we're going to make a company

2618
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,040
we're going to go make our own games

2619
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,040
where this was something that

2620
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:25,040
we were able to just kind of hit them

2621
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:27,040
with a hammer of an experience like wow

2622
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,040
this is just like so much cooler than

2623
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:31,040
what we thought was possible there

2624
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,040
and initially we tried to

2625
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,040
get Nintendo to let us make

2626
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,040
Super Mario 3 on the PC

2627
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,040
that's really what we wanted to do we're like hey

2628
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,040
we can finish this it's line of sight

2629
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,040
for this will be great and

2630
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,040
we sent something to Nintendo

2631
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,040
and we heard that it did get looked at

2632
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,040
in Japan and they just

2633
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:51,040
weren't interested in that

2634
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:53,040
but that's another one of those life could have gone

2635
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,040
a very different way where we could have been

2636
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,040
like Nintendo's house PC team

2637
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,040
you know at that point

2638
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,040
and to find the direction of

2639
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:03,040
you know

2640
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:05,040
Wolfenstein and

2641
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:07,040
Doom and Quake

2642
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:09,040
could have been a Nintendo creation

2643
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,040
yeah so at the same time

2644
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,040
that we were just doing our first scrolling

2645
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,040
demos

2646
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,040
we reached out to Scott Miller at Apogee

2647
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,040
and said it's like hey we do want to

2648
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:21,040
make some games you know these things that you

2649
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:23,040
think you want those are those are nothing

2650
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,040
what do you see what we can actually do now

2651
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:27,040
this is going to be amazing and

2652
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,040
he just like popped right up and sent a check

2653
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,040
to us where we at that point

2654
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,040
we still thought he might be a fraud that

2655
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,040
he was just lying about all of this but he

2656
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,040
was totally correct on how much money

2657
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,040
he was making with his shareware titles

2658
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,040
and this was his

2659
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,040
kind of real brainstorm about this

2660
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,040
where shareware was this idea that

2661
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,040
software doesn't have a fixed price

2662
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,040
if you use it you send out of the goodness

2663
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,040
of your heart some money to the creator

2664
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,040
and there were a couple utilities

2665
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,040
that did make some significant success

2666
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,040
like that but for the most part

2667
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,040
it didn't really work you know there wasn't

2668
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,040
much software in a pure shareware

2669
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,040
model that that was successful

2670
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:05,040
the Apogee innovation

2671
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,040
was to

2672
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,040
take something call it shareware split

2673
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,040
it into three pieces you always made a

2674
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,040
trilogy and you would put

2675
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:15,040
the first piece out but then you buy

2676
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,040
the whole trilogy for some

2677
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,040
shareware amount which in reality

2678
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,040
it meant that the first part was a demo

2679
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,040
where you kind of like the demo went

2680
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,040
everywhere for free and you paid money to

2681
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,040
to get the whole set but

2682
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,040
it was still played as shareware and we were

2683
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,040
happy to have the first one go everywhere

2684
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,040
and it wasn't a crippled demo where the

2685
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:35,040
first episode of all these trilogies it

2686
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:37,040
was a real complete game and probably

2687
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:39,040
20 times as many people played

2688
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,040
that part of it thought they had a great game

2689
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,040
had found memories of

2690
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,040
it but never paid us a dime

2691
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,040
but enough people were

2692
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,040
happy with that where

2693
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,040
it was really quite successful at these

2694
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,040
early games that we didn't think very much

2695
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,040
of compared to commercial quality

2696
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:57,040
games but they were doing really good

2697
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,040
business some fairly crude things

2698
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,040
and people it was good

2699
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,040
business people enjoyed it and

2700
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,040
it wasn't like you were taking a crap shoot on what

2701
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,040
you were getting you just played a third of the

2702
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,040
experience and you loved it enough

2703
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,040
to hand write out a check

2704
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,040
and put it in an envelope and address it

2705
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:15,040
and send it out to Apigee

2706
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,040
to get the rest of them so

2707
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,040
it was a really pretty feel good

2708
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:21,040
business prospect there because

2709
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:23,040
everybody was happy

2710
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,040
they knew what they were getting

2711
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,040
when they send it in and they would send in fan mail

2712
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:29,040
if you're going to the trouble of addressing

2713
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,040
a letter and I am filling out

2714
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,040
an envelope you write something in it and

2715
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,040
there were just the literal bags of fan mail

2716
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,040
for the shareware

2717
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:39,040
games so people loved them

2718
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,040
I should mention that for you

2719
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,040
the definition of wealth is being

2720
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,040
able to have

2721
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,040
pizza whenever you want

2722
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,040
for me there was a dream

2723
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:51,040
because I would play shareware games over

2724
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,040
and over the part that's free

2725
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,040
over and over and it was very

2726
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,040
deeply fulfilling experience but

2727
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,040
I dreamed of a time when I

2728
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,040
could actually afford

2729
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,040
the full experience and this is kind of this

2730
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,040
dream land beyond

2731
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,040
the horizon

2732
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,040
you could find out what else is there

2733
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,040
in some sense

2734
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,040
even just playing the shareware

2735
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,040
was

2736
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:17,040
the limitation of that

2737
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,040
you know life is

2738
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,040
limited eventually we all

2739
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,040
die in that way shareware was like

2740
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,040
somehow really fulfilling

2741
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,040
to have this kind of mysterious thing

2742
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,040
beyond what's free

2743
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,040
always there it's kind of

2744
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,040
I don't know that maybe

2745
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,040
it's because a part of my childhood is playing

2746
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,040
shareware games that was a really fulfilling

2747
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,040
experience it's so interesting how that model

2748
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:43,040
still brought joy

2749
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,040
to so many people the 20x

2750
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,040
people that played it I felt very good about

2751
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,040
that I would run into people

2752
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:51,040
that would say oh I loved that game

2753
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,040
that you had early on Commander Keen

2754
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,040
whatever and

2755
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,040
they meant just the first episode

2756
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,040
that they got to see everywhere

2757
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,040
the crap out of Commander Keen

2758
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,040
and that was all good

2759
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,040
but so we were

2760
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,040
in this position where Scott Miller was

2761
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,040
just fronting us cash and saying yeah make

2762
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,040
you know make a game but

2763
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:13,040
we did not properly

2764
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,040
pull the trigger and say alright we're going to

2765
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:17,040
we're quitting our jobs we were like we're gonna

2766
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,040
do both we're gonna keep working

2767
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:21,040
at soft disk working on this

2768
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:23,040
and then we're going to go ahead

2769
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,040
and make a new game for

2770
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,040
Apogee at the same time

2771
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,040
and this eventually did lead to some legal

2772
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,040
problems and we had trouble

2773
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,040
it all got worked out in the end

2774
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,040
but it was not a good call at the time

2775
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,040
there and your legal mind at the time

2776
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,040
was not stellar

2777
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,040
you were not thinking

2778
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,040
in terms of the illegal term no

2779
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,040
I definitely wasn't none of us were

2780
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,040
and in hindsight

2781
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,040
yeah it's like how did we think we were going to get away

2782
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,040
with like even using our work computers

2783
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,040
to write software for

2784
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:55,040
you know our breakaway

2785
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,040
new company

2786
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,040
it was not a good plan

2787
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,040
how did Commander Keane come to be

2788
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,040
so the design process

2789
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,040
we would start from we had some idea

2790
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,040
what we wanted to do we wanted to do a

2791
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,040
Mario like game it was going to be a

2792
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,040
side scroller it was going to use the

2793
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,040
technology we had some

2794
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,040
sense of what it would have to look like because of the limitations

2795
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,040
of this adaptive tile refresh

2796
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:19,040
technology it had to have

2797
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,040
fields of relatively constant tiles

2798
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:23,040
you couldn't just paint up a background

2799
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:25,040
and then move that around

2800
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,040
the early design

2801
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,040
or all the design for Commander Keane really came

2802
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,040
from Tom Hall where

2803
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,040
he was

2804
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,040
kind of the main creative mind

2805
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,040
for the early in software stuff

2806
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:39,040
where we had an interesting division of things

2807
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,040
where Tom was

2808
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,040
all creative in design I was

2809
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,040
all programming John Romero was an interesting bridge

2810
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,040
where he was both a very good

2811
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:49,040
programmer and also a very good designer

2812
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,040
and artist and kind of straddled

2813
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,040
between the areas but Commander

2814
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,040
Keane was very much Tom Hall's baby

2815
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,040
and he came up

2816
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,040
with all the design and backstory

2817
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,040
for the different things of kind of a

2818
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:03,040
mad scientist little kid with

2819
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,040
I am you know

2820
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:07,040
building a rocket ship and a zap gun

2821
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,040
and visiting alien worlds

2822
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,040
and doing all this that the background

2823
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,040
that we lay the game inside of

2824
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,040
and there's not a whole lot

2825
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,040
to any of these things you know design

2826
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,040
for us was always just what we needed

2827
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,040
to do to make the game that was going

2828
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,040
to be so much fun to play

2829
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,040
and we made our we laid out

2830
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:27,040
our first trilogy of games you know the

2831
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:29,040
shareware formula it's going to be three

2832
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,040
pieces we make Commander Keane one two

2833
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,040
and three and we just really

2834
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,040
started

2835
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,040
busting on all that work and it went together

2836
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,040
really quickly it was like three months or

2837
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,040
something that while we were still making

2838
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,040
games every month for

2839
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,040
for Gamers Edge we were sharing technology

2840
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,040
between that I'd write a bunch of code for this

2841
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,040
and we just kind of use it for both

2842
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:51,040
again not a particularly good idea there

2843
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,040
that had consequences for us

2844
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,040
but in three months

2845
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:57,040
we got our first our first game

2846
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,040
out and all of a sudden it was

2847
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:01,040
three times as successful as

2848
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,040
the most successful thing Apogee had had before

2849
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,040
and we were making like thirty thousand dollars

2850
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,040
a month immediately

2851
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,040
from the Commander Keane stuff

2852
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:11,040
and that was again

2853
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,040
a surprise to us it was more than we thought

2854
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,040
that was going to that was going to make

2855
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:17,040
and we said well we're going to

2856
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,040
certainly roll into another set of titles

2857
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,040
from this and in that three months

2858
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:23,040
I had come up with a much better way

2859
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:25,040
of doing the scrolling technology that

2860
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,040
was not the adaptive tile refresh

2861
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,040
which in some ways was even simpler

2862
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,040
and these things

2863
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:33,040
so many of the great ideas of technology

2864
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,040
are things that are back at the envelope

2865
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,040
designs I make this comment

2866
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,040
about modern machine learning where

2867
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,040
all the things that are really important practically

2868
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,040
in the last decade are each of them

2869
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,040
fits on the back of an envelope there are these

2870
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,040
simple little things they're not

2871
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,040
super dense hard to understand

2872
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,040
technologies

2873
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:53,040
and so the the second scrolling

2874
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,040
trick was just a matter of like

2875
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,040
okay we know we've got this 64k

2876
01:57:57,040 --> 01:57:59,040
window and

2877
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,040
the question was always like well you could make

2878
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,040
a two by two but you can't go

2879
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,040
off the edge

2880
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,040
but I finally asked well what actually

2881
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,040
happens if you just go off the

2882
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,040
edge if you take your start

2883
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,040
and you say it's like okay

2884
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:15,040
I can move over I'm scrolling I can move over

2885
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,040
I can move down I'm scrolling

2886
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,040
I get to what should be the bottom of the memory

2887
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,040
window like well what if I just

2888
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,040
keep going and I say I'm going to start

2889
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,040
at you know what happens if I start

2890
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:27,040
at FFFE at the very

2891
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,040
end of the 64k block

2892
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,040
and it turns out it just

2893
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:33,040
wraps back around to the top of the block

2894
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:35,040
and I'm like oh well this makes

2895
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,040
everything easy you can just scroll the

2896
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:39,040
screen everywhere and all you have to draw is just

2897
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,040
one new line of tiles which everything

2898
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,040
you expose it might be

2899
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:45,040
unaligned off various parts of

2900
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,040
the of the screen memory

2901
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,040
but it just works that no longer had

2902
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,040
the problem of you had to have fields of

2903
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,040
the similar colors because

2904
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,040
it doesn't matter what you're doing you could be having

2905
01:58:55,040 --> 01:58:57,040
a completely unique world

2906
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,040
and you're just drawing the new strip as it comes

2907
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,040
on but it might be like you said

2908
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,040
unaligned so it can be all over

2909
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,040
the place and it turns out it doesn't matter

2910
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:07,040
I would have two page flipped screens as long

2911
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,040
as they didn't overlap they moved in series

2912
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,040
through this two-dimensional

2913
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,040
window of graphics

2914
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:15,040
and that was one of those like well this is

2915
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:17,040
so simple this just

2916
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,040
this just works it's faster

2917
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:21,040
there it seemed like there was no downside

2918
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:23,040
funny thing was

2919
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:25,040
it turned out after we shipped

2920
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,040
titles with this there were

2921
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,040
what they called super VGA

2922
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:31,040
cards the cards that would allow higher

2923
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:33,040
resolutions and

2924
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:35,040
different features that the standard ones didn't

2925
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,040
and on some of those

2926
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,040
cards this was a weird

2927
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,040
compatibility quirk again because nobody

2928
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,040
thought this was not what it was designed to do

2929
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:45,040
and some of those cards had more

2930
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,040
memory they had more than just

2931
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:49,040
256k in four planes they

2932
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:51,040
had 512k or a megabyte

2933
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:53,040
and on some of those cards

2934
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,040
I scroll my window

2935
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,040
down and then it goes into uninitialized

2936
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,040
memory that actually exists there

2937
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,040
rather than wrapping back around at the top

2938
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,040
and

2939
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:05,040
then I was in the tough position of do I have to track

2940
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:07,040
every single one of these and it was a mad

2941
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:09,040
house back then with there were

2942
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:11,040
20 different video card vendors

2943
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,040
with all slightly different implementations

2944
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:15,040
of their non-standard functionality

2945
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:17,040
so either I needed to natively

2946
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:19,040
program all of the

2947
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,040
the VGA cards there to

2948
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,040
map in that memory and keep

2949
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,040
scrolling down through all of that

2950
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,040
or I kind of punted and took the easy

2951
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,040
solution of when you finally did run

2952
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,040
the edge of the screen I accepted

2953
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,040
a hitch and just copied the whole screen up

2954
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,040
there so on some of those

2955
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,040
those cards it was

2956
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,040
a compatibility mode in the normal

2957
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:41,040
ones when it all worked fine everything was just

2958
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:43,040
beautifully smooth but if you had one of those

2959
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,040
cards where it did not wrap

2960
02:00:45,040 --> 02:00:47,040
the way I wanted it to you'd be

2961
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,040
scrolling around scrolling around and

2962
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,040
then eventually you'd have a little hitch where

2963
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:53,040
200 milliseconds or something

2964
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,040
that was not super smooth as it

2965
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,040
froze a little bit and this was the binary

2966
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,040
thing is it one of the standard

2967
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,040
screens or is it one of the weird ones

2968
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:03,040
the super VGA ones yeah okay

2969
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:05,040
and so we would default to and I think

2970
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:07,040
that was one of those that changed over

2971
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,040
the kind of course of deployment

2972
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:11,040
where early on we would have a normal mode

2973
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,040
and then you would have you would enable the compatibility

2974
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,040
flag if your screen did this crazy

2975
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:17,040
flickery thing when you got to a certain

2976
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,040
point in the game and then

2977
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:21,040
later I think it probably got enabled by

2978
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,040
default as just more and more of the cards

2979
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,040
I kind of did not do exactly

2980
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:27,040
the right thing and that's the two-edged

2981
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,040
sword of doing unconventional

2982
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,040
things with technology where

2983
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:33,040
you can find something that nobody thought about

2984
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,040
doing that kind of scrolling trick when they set

2985
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,040
up those cards but the

2986
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,040
fact that nobody thought that was the primary reason

2987
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:41,040
when I was relying on that then

2988
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,040
I wound up being broken on some of the later

2989
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,040
cards let me take a bit

2990
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,040
of a tangent but

2991
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,040
ask about the hacker

2992
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,040
ethic because you mentioned share

2993
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:53,040
where it says it's an interesting world

2994
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,040
the world of

2995
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,040
people that make money

2996
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,040
business and the people

2997
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,040
that build systems the engineers

2998
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:03,040
and

2999
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:05,040
what is the

3000
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:07,040
hacker ethic you've been a man

3001
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:09,040
of the people and you've

3002
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:11,040
embodied at least the part of that

3003
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,040
ethic what does it mean

3004
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:15,040
what did it mean to you at the time what does it mean

3005
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,040
to you today so Stephen Levy's

3006
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:19,040
book Hackers was a really

3007
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:21,040
formative book for me as a teenager

3008
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:23,040
I mean I read it several times

3009
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:25,040
and there was all

3010
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,040
of the great lore of the early

3011
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,040
MIT era of hackers

3012
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,040
ending up at the end with

3013
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:33,040
it kind of went through the early

3014
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,040
MIT hackers and the Silicon Valley

3015
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:37,040
hardware hackers and then

3016
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,040
the game hackers in part 3

3017
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:41,040
and at that time as a teenager

3018
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,040
I really

3019
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,040
was kind of bitter in some ways like I

3020
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,040
thought I was born too late I thought I missed

3021
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,040
the window there

3022
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,040
and I really thought I belonged

3023
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,040
in that third section of that book with the

3024
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,040
game hackers and they were talking about

3025
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:57,040
the Williams at Sierra

3026
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,040
and Origin Systems with Richard Garriott

3027
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,040
and it's like I

3028
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,040
really wanted to be there and

3029
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,040
I knew that was now a few years

3030
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,040
in the past it was

3031
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:09,040
it was not to be

3032
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:11,040
but the early days especially

3033
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,040
the early MIT hacker days talking

3034
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:15,040
a lot about this sense of

3035
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,040
the hacker ethic that there was this sense

3036
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,040
that it was about

3037
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:21,040
sharing information being good

3038
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:23,040
not keeping it to yourself

3039
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,040
and that it's not a zero sum game

3040
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,040
that you can share something

3041
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:29,040
with another programmer and it doesn't

3042
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,040
take it away from you

3043
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:33,040
you then have somebody else doing something

3044
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,040
and I also think that there's

3045
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,040
an aspect of it where it's this

3046
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,040
ability to take

3047
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,040
joy in other people's accomplishments

3048
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,040
where it's not the cutthroat bit of

3049
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,040
I have to be first I have to be

3050
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,040
recognized as the one that did

3051
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,040
this in some way but

3052
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,040
being able to see somebody else

3053
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:53,040
do something and say holy shit that's amazing

3054
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:55,040
you know and just taking joy

3055
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,040
in the ability of something amazing

3056
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,040
that somebody else does

3057
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,040
and the

3058
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,040
big thing that I was able to do

3059
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:05,040
through in software was

3060
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:07,040
this ability to eventually release the source code

3061
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,040
for most of our like all of our

3062
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:11,040
really seminal game titles

3063
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,040
and that was a stepping stone

3064
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,040
process where we were kind

3065
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:17,040
of surprised early on where

3066
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:19,040
people were able to

3067
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:21,040
hack the existing games and of course I had

3068
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,040
experience with that I remember hacking my copies

3069
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,040
of Ultima so I give myself

3070
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,040
9999 gold and raise my levels

3071
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:29,040
and you know break out the sector editor

3072
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,040
and so I was familiar with all of that

3073
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,040
so it was just it was with a smile

3074
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,040
when I started to see people doing that to our

3075
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,040
games I am you know making

3076
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,040
level editors for Commander Keen

3077
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:41,040
or hacking up Wolfenstein 3D

3078
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,040
but I made the pitch

3079
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:45,040
internally that

3080
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,040
we should actually release our own

3081
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:49,040
tools for like what we did

3082
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,040
what we used to create the games

3083
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,040
and that was you know that was

3084
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,040
a little bit debatable about

3085
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:57,040
well you know we'll this let other

3086
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,040
we'll give people a leg up it's always like

3087
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,040
what's that going to mean for the competition

3088
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,040
but the really hard

3089
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:05,040
pitch was to actually release

3090
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,040
the full source code for the games

3091
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,040
and it was a balancing act with

3092
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:11,040
the other people inside the company

3093
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,040
where it's interesting

3094
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,040
how the programmers

3095
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,040
generally did get

3096
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,040
certainly I am the people

3097
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,040
that I worked closely with they did kind

3098
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,040
of get that hacker ethic bit where

3099
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:25,040
you wanted to share your code you were

3100
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,040
you were proud of it you wanted other people to take it

3101
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,040
do cool things with it

3102
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,040
but interestingly

3103
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,040
the broader game

3104
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:35,040
industry is a little more

3105
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,040
hesitant to embrace that than

3106
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,040
like the group of people that we happen to have

3107
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,040
at id software where it was

3108
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:43,040
always a little interesting to me seeing how

3109
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,040
a lot of people in the game modding

3110
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:47,040
community were very possessive

3111
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,040
of their code they did not want to share their

3112
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:51,040
code they wanted it to be theirs it was

3113
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,040
their you know claim to fame and

3114
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,040
that was much more like what we

3115
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:57,040
tended to see with artists where

3116
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:59,040
you know the artists understand something about

3117
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,040
credit and I you know wanting it to be

3118
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:03,040
known as their work and a lot of

3119
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:05,040
the game programmers

3120
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,040
felt a little bit more like artists

3121
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,040
than like hacker programmers in that

3122
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:11,040
it was about building something

3123
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,040
that maybe felt more like art to them

3124
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,040
than the more tool based

3125
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,040
and exploration based kind

3126
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:19,040
of hacking culture side of things

3127
02:06:19,040 --> 02:06:21,040
yes so it's so interesting that this

3128
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,040
kind of

3129
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,040
fear that credit will not

3130
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,040
be sufficiently attributed to you

3131
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:29,040
and that's one of the things that I

3132
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,040
do bump into a lot because

3133
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:33,040
I try not

3134
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:35,040
to go clean I mean it's easy for me

3135
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:37,040
to say because so much credit is heaped on

3136
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:39,040
me for the the software side of

3137
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:41,040
things but when people come up and

3138
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,040
they want to pick a fight and say no it's

3139
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:45,040
like that wasn't where first person gaming

3140
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,040
came from and you can point to

3141
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,040
you know you can point to some of like things

3142
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,040
on obscure titles that I was never aware

3143
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,040
of or like the old play-doh systems

3144
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:55,040
or you know each personal computer

3145
02:06:55,040 --> 02:06:57,040
had something that was 3d-ish

3146
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,040
and moving around and I'm

3147
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,040
you know and I'm happy to say it's like no

3148
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:03,040
I mean I saw battle zone and star wars

3149
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,040
in the arcades I had seen 3D graphics

3150
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,040
I had seen all these things there

3151
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,040
standing on the shoulders of lots of other people

3152
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,040
but sometimes these examples they pull out

3153
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,040
like I didn't know that existed I mean

3154
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:15,040
there I had never heard of that before

3155
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,040
then that didn't contribute to

3156
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,040
what I made but there's plenty of stuff

3157
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,040
that did and you know I

3158
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,040
I think there's good cases to be made

3159
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,040
that obviously doom

3160
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:27,040
and quake and Wolfenstein were formative

3161
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:29,040
examples for what

3162
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,040
everything that came after

3163
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:33,040
that but I don't

3164
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,040
feel the need to go fight and say

3165
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:37,040
claim primacy or initial

3166
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:39,040
invention of anything like that

3167
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,040
but a lot of people do want to

3168
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,040
I think when you fight for the credit in that way

3169
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:45,040
and it does go against the hacker ethic

3170
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:47,040
you destroy

3171
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:49,040
something fundamental about the culture

3172
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,040
about the community that builds cool stuff

3173
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,040
I think credit ultimately

3174
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,040
so I had this

3175
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,040
sort of

3176
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:01,040
there's a famous wrestler and freestyle

3177
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,040
wrestler called

3178
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,040
and he always

3179
02:08:05,040 --> 02:08:07,040
preached that you should just

3180
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:09,040
focus on the art of the wrestling

3181
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,040
and let people

3182
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:13,040
write your

3183
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,040
story however they want

3184
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:17,040
the

3185
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,040
the highest form of the art is just

3186
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:21,040
focusing on the art and that's something

3187
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,040
that is something about the

3188
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,040
hacker ethic is just

3189
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:27,040
on building cool stuff

3190
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,040
sharing it with other cool people

3191
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:31,040
and credit will get

3192
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,040
assigned correctly

3193
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:37,040
in the long arc of history

3194
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,040
and I generally think that's true

3195
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:41,040
and you've got

3196
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,040
there's some things

3197
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,040
there's a graphics technique that got labeled

3198
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:47,040
car max reverse

3199
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:49,040
literally named it and it turned out

3200
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,040
that I wasn't the first person to

3201
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:53,040
figure that out like most scientific

3202
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,040
things or mathematical things you wind up like

3203
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,040
oh this other person had actually done that

3204
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,040
somewhat before and then

3205
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,040
there's things that get attributed to me like the inverse

3206
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,040
square root hack that I actually didn't

3207
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,040
do I flat out that wasn't me and it's

3208
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,040
like it's weird how the memetic power

3209
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,040
of the internet I cannot

3210
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,040
you're like the marked point of programming

3211
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,040
yes it's just everything just gets attributed

3212
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:15,040
to you now even though you've never

3213
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:17,040
sought that the credit of things

3214
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,040
I mean but

3215
02:09:19,040 --> 02:09:21,040
part of the fact that the humility behind

3216
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,040
that is what attracts the

3217
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,040
attributions

3218
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:27,040
let's talk about a game

3219
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:29,040
you mean one of the greatest games

3220
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:31,040
ever made I know you could talk about doing quake

3221
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,040
and so on but to me Wolfenstein 3D

3222
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:35,040
was like wow

3223
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:37,040
it blew my mind

3224
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,040
that a world like this could exist so

3225
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,040
how did Wolfenstein 3D come to be

3226
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:43,040
in terms of the programming

3227
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:45,040
in terms of the design in terms of some

3228
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:47,040
of the memorable technical challenges

3229
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:49,040
and also

3230
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:51,040
actually just something you haven't mentioned

3231
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,040
you know

3232
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,040
how did these ideas

3233
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:57,040
come to be

3234
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:59,040
inside your mind the adaptive

3235
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:01,040
side-scrolling

3236
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,040
the solutions to these technical challenges

3237
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:05,040
so I usually can

3238
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,040
introspectively pull back

3239
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:09,040
pretty detailed

3240
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:11,040
accounts of how technology

3241
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,040
solutions and design choices on my

3242
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:15,040
part came to be where

3243
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:17,040
technically we had done two games

3244
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,040
3D games like that before

3245
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,040
where hover tank was the first one which

3246
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:23,040
had flat shaded walls

3247
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:25,040
but did have the scaled enemies inside it

3248
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,040
and then catacombs 3D

3249
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:29,040
which had textured walls

3250
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,040
scaled enemies and

3251
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,040
some more

3252
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:35,040
some more functionality like the disappearing

3253
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:37,040
walls and some other stuff

3254
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:39,040
but what's really interesting from a game

3255
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,040
development standpoint is

3256
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:43,040
those games catacombs 3D

3257
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:45,040
hover tank and Wolfenstein

3258
02:10:45,040 --> 02:10:47,040
they literally used

3259
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:49,040
the same code for

3260
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:51,040
a lot of the character behavior that a 2D

3261
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,040
game that I had made earlier called catacombs

3262
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:55,040
did where

3263
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,040
it was an overhead view game kind of like gauntlet

3264
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,040
you're running around and you can open up doors

3265
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:01,040
pick up items basic game stuff

3266
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,040
and the thought was that

3267
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:05,040
this exact same

3268
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,040
game experience just

3269
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,040
presented in a different perspective

3270
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:11,040
it could be literally the same game

3271
02:11:11,040 --> 02:11:13,040
just with a different view into it

3272
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:15,040
would have a dramatically different impact

3273
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,040
on the players

3274
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:19,040
so it wasn't

3275
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,040
a true 3D you're saying that

3276
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,040
you can kind of fake it you can

3277
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:25,040
scale enemies meaning things that are

3278
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:27,040
farther away you can make them smaller

3279
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,040
so from the game was

3280
02:11:29,040 --> 02:11:31,040
a 2D map like all of our games

3281
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:33,040
use the same tool for creation

3282
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:35,040
we use the same map editor for creating

3283
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:37,040
Keen as Wolfenstein and

3284
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:39,040
Hevertank and catacombs and all this stuff

3285
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:41,040
so the game was a 2D grid

3286
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,040
made out of blocks and you could say

3287
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:45,040
well these are walls these are where the enemies

3288
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:47,040
start then they start moving around

3289
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:49,040
and these early games like catacombs

3290
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,040
you played it strictly in a 2D view

3291
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,040
it was a scrolling 2D view

3292
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,040
and that was kind of using an adaptive tile refresh

3293
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,040
at the time to be able to do something like

3294
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,040
that and then

3295
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:01,040
the thought that these early games

3296
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:03,040
all it did was take the same

3297
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:05,040
basic enemy logic but instead of

3298
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:07,040
seeing it from the god's eye view on top

3299
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,040
you were inside it and turning

3300
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:11,040
from side to side yawing your view

3301
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:13,040
and moving forwards and backwards and side to

3302
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:15,040
side and

3303
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:17,040
it's a striking thing where you always talk

3304
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:19,040
about wanting to isolate and factor changes

3305
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:21,040
in values and this was one of those

3306
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,040
most pure cases there where

3307
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:25,040
the rest of the game changed very little

3308
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,040
it was our normal kind of change the colors

3309
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:29,040
on something and draw a different picture for

3310
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,040
it but it's kind of the same thing

3311
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:33,040
but the perspective changed in a really

3312
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:35,040
fundamental way and it was

3313
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,040
dramatically different I can remember

3314
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:39,040
the reactions where

3315
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,040
the artist Adrian that had been

3316
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:43,040
drawing the pictures for it we had a cool

3317
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,040
big troll thing in Catacombs 3D

3318
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:47,040
and we had these walls that

3319
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:49,040
you could get a key and you could make the blocks

3320
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,040
disappear and really simple stuff

3321
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:53,040
blocks could either be there or not there

3322
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:55,040
so our idea of a door was being able to

3323
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:57,040
make a set of blocks just disappear

3324
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:59,040
and I remember the reaction where he

3325
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,040
had drawn these characters and he was slowly

3326
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,040
moving around and like people had no

3327
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,040
experience with 3D navigation it was all still

3328
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,040
keyboard we didn't even have mice

3329
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:09,040
set up at that time but

3330
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,040
slowly moving going up picked up a

3331
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,040
key go to a wall the wall disappears

3332
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:15,040
in a little animation and there's a monster

3333
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:17,040
like right there and he practically

3334
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,040
fell out of his chair it was just like

3335
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,040
and games just

3336
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,040
didn't do that you know the games were

3337
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:25,040
the gods eye view you were a little invested

3338
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,040
in your little guy you can be like

3339
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,040
you know happy or sad when things

3340
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:31,040
happen but you just did not get that kind

3341
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,040
of startle reaction you weren't inside

3342
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,040
your face something in the back of your

3343
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:37,040
brain some reptile brain thing is just

3344
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,040
going oh shit something just happened

3345
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:41,040
and that was one of those

3346
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:43,040
early points where it's like yeah this

3347
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,040
is going to make a difference this is

3348
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:47,040
going to be powerful and it's going to matter

3349
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,040
were you able to imagine that in the

3350
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:51,040
idea stage or no so

3351
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:53,040
not that exact

3352
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:55,040
thing so again we had cases

3353
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,040
like the arcade games battle zone

3354
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:59,040
and star wars that you could kind of see

3355
02:13:59,040 --> 02:14:01,040
a 3D world and things coming at you

3356
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,040
and you get some sense of it

3357
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:05,040
but nothing had done the kind

3358
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:07,040
of worlds that we were doing and the sort

3359
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,040
of action based things 3D

3360
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,040
at the time was really

3361
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,040
largely about the simulation

3362
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,040
thoughts and this is something

3363
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:17,040
that really might have

3364
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:19,040
trended differently if not for

3365
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:21,040
the software approach in the games where

3366
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,040
there were flight simulators

3367
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,040
there were driving simulators you had

3368
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:27,040
like hard drive in and

3369
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,040
Microsoft flight simulator and these were

3370
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:31,040
doing 3D and general purpose

3371
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,040
3D and ways that were

3372
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,040
more flexible than what we were doing with

3373
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:37,040
our games but they were looked at

3374
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:39,040
as simulations they weren't trying

3375
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,040
to necessarily be fast or responsive

3376
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:43,040
or letting you do

3377
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:45,040
kind of exciting maneuvers

3378
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,040
because they were trying to simulate reality

3379
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,040
and they were taking their cues from the big

3380
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:51,040
systems the Evans in Sutherland and the silicon

3381
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:53,040
graphics that were doing things

3382
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:55,040
but we were taking our cues from

3383
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:57,040
the console and arcade games you know we

3384
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:59,040
had things that were

3385
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:01,040
sort of quarter eaters that were doing

3386
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,040
fast paced things that you could smack

3387
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:05,040
you around rather than just smoothly

3388
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:07,040
gliding you from place to place

3389
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:09,040
so quarter

3390
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:11,040
yeah and you know a funny thing is

3391
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:13,040
so much that that built into us that

3392
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:15,040
Wolfenstein still had

3393
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:17,040
lives and you had like one of the biggest

3394
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,040
power-ups in all these games like was an

3395
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:21,040
extra life because you started off with

3396
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:23,040
three lives and you lose your lives and

3397
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:25,040
then it's game over and there weren't

3398
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:27,040
any other games in most of this stuff

3399
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,040
it was and it sounds almost crazy

3400
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,040
to say this but it was an innovation

3401
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:33,040
in doom to not have lives

3402
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:35,040
you know you could just play doom as long as you wanted

3403
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,040
you just restart at the start of the level

3404
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,040
and why not this is like

3405
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:41,040
we aren't trying to take people's quarters

3406
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:43,040
they've already paid for the entire game

3407
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,040
we want them to have a good time

3408
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:47,040
and you would have some

3409
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,040
you know some old-timer purists that might think

3410
02:15:49,040 --> 02:15:51,040
that there's something to the epic journey

3411
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:53,040
of making it to the end having to restart

3412
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:55,040
tries but now more fun is had

3413
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:57,040
when you just let people kind of keep trying

3414
02:15:57,040 --> 02:15:59,040
when they're stuck rather than having to go

3415
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,040
all the way back and and learn different

3416
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:03,040
things so you recommended the

3417
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:05,040
game engine black book Wolfenstein 3D

3418
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:07,040
for technical exploration

3419
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,040
of the game so looking back

3420
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,040
30 years what are some

3421
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:13,040
memorable technical innovations

3422
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:15,040
that made this perspective

3423
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:17,040
shift into this world that's

3424
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:19,040
so immersive that scares you when a monster appears

3425
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,040
or some things you have to solve

3426
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:23,040
so one of the interesting things

3427
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:25,040
that come back to the theme of

3428
02:16:25,040 --> 02:16:27,040
deadlines and resource constraints

3429
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:29,040
the game catacombs 3D

3430
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,040
we shipped

3431
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:33,040
we were supposed to be shipping this for gamers edge

3432
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:35,040
on a monthly cadence and

3433
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,040
I had slipped I was actually

3434
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,040
late it slipped like six weeks because

3435
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,040
this was texture mapped walls

3436
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:43,040
doing stuff that I hadn't done before

3437
02:16:43,040 --> 02:16:45,040
and

3438
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,040
at the six-week point it was still

3439
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:49,040
kind of glitchy and buggy there were things

3440
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:51,040
that I knew that if you had

3441
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:53,040
a wall that was like almost edge on

3442
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,040
you could slide over to it you could see

3443
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,040
some things freak out or vanish or not

3444
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,040
work and I hated that

3445
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:01,040
I but I was up against

3446
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:03,040
the wall we had to ship the game

3447
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:05,040
it was still a lot of fun to play it was novel

3448
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:07,040
nobody had seen it it gave you that startle

3449
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:09,040
reflex I reaction so

3450
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:11,040
it was worth shipping

3451
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,040
but it had these things that I knew

3452
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,040
were kind of flaky and janky and not

3453
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,040
not what I was really proud of

3454
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,040
so one of the

3455
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:21,040
things that I did very differently in Wolfenstein

3456
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,040
I was

3457
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,040
I went catacombs used

3458
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:27,040
almost a conventional

3459
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,040
thing where you had segments that were

3460
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,040
one-dimensional polygons basically that were

3461
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:33,040
clipped and back faced

3462
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,040
and done kind of like a very crude

3463
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:37,040
3D engine from the professionals

3464
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,040
but I wasn't getting it done

3465
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:41,040
right I was not doing a good

3466
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,040
enough job I didn't really have line of sight

3467
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,040
to fix it

3468
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,040
right there's stuff that of course I look back

3469
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,040
it's like oh it's obvious how to do this

3470
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:51,040
do the math right do your clipping right

3471
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:53,040
check all of this how you handle the precision

3472
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,040
but I did not know how to do that

3473
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:57,040
at that time the first 3D

3474
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,040
engine you wrote catacombs 3D

3475
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,040
you know hover tank had been a little bit before that

3476
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,040
but that had the flat shaded walls so

3477
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:05,040
the texture mapping on the walls was what

3478
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,040
was bringing in some of these challenges

3479
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,040
that was hard for me

3480
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:11,040
and I couldn't solve it right at the time

3481
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,040
can you describe what flat shading is in texture mapping

3482
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,040
so in the the walls were

3483
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,040
solid color one of 16 colors

3484
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:19,040
I am in hover tank

3485
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:21,040
so that's easy it's fast you just

3486
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,040
draw the solid color for everything

3487
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,040
texture mapping is what we all see today

3488
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:27,040
where you have an image that is stretched

3489
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:29,040
and distorted onto the walls

3490
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:31,040
or the surfaces that you're working with

3491
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:33,040
and it was

3492
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:35,040
you know it was a long time for me to just figure out

3493
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,040
how to do that without it

3494
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,040
distorting in the wrong ways and

3495
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:41,040
and I did not get it all

3496
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,040
exactly right in catacombs and I had

3497
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,040
these flaws

3498
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,040
so that was important enough to me

3499
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,040
that rather than continuing to bang my head

3500
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:51,040
on that when I wasn't positive I was

3501
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:53,040
going to get it I went with a completely

3502
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,040
different approach for drawing for

3503
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,040
figuring out where the walls were which was

3504
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,040
a ray casting approach

3505
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:01,040
which I had done in catacombs 3D

3506
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:03,040
I had a bunch of C code

3507
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:05,040
trying to make this work right and it wasn't

3508
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:07,040
working right in Wolfenstein

3509
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:09,040
I wound up going to a very

3510
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:11,040
small amount of assembly code

3511
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:13,040
so in some ways they should be a slower

3512
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:15,040
way of doing it but by

3513
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:17,040
making it a smaller amount of work that I could

3514
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:19,040
more tightly optimize it worked

3515
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:21,040
out and Wolfenstein 3D was just

3516
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:23,040
absolutely rock solid you know it was

3517
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:25,040
you know nothing glitched

3518
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,040
in there the game just was pretty much

3519
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,040
flawless through all of that and I was super

3520
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,040
proud of that

3521
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:33,040
but eventually like in the later games

3522
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,040
I went back to the more span

3523
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:37,040
based things where I could get more total efficiency

3524
02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:39,040
once I really did figure out how

3525
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:41,040
to do it so there were two

3526
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:43,040
sort of key technical things to Wolfenstein

3527
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:45,040
one was this ray casting

3528
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:47,040
approach which you still to this

3529
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,040
day you see people go and say let's

3530
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:51,040
write a ray casting engine because

3531
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:53,040
it's an understandable way of doing things

3532
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,040
that let you make games very much

3533
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:57,040
like that so you see raycasters in

3534
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:59,040
javascript raycasters in python people

3535
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:01,040
that are are basically going and

3536
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,040
re-implementing that that approach

3537
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:05,040
to taking a tiled world

3538
02:20:05,040 --> 02:20:07,040
and casting out into it it works

3539
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:09,040
pretty well but it's not the fastest way

3540
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:11,040
of doing it can you describe what ray casting is

3541
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,040
so you start off and you got

3542
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:15,040
your screen which is 320 pixels

3543
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:17,040
across at the time if you haven't sized down

3544
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:19,040
in the window for for greater

3545
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:21,040
speed and at every pixel

3546
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,040
there's going to be an angle from you got

3547
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:25,040
your position in the world and you're going

3548
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:27,040
to just run along that angle

3549
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:29,040
and keep going until you hit a block

3550
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:31,040
so up to 320

3551
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,040
times across there it's going to throw

3552
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:35,040
cast array out into the world

3553
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,040
from wherever your origin is

3554
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,040
until it runs into a wall and then it

3555
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,040
can figure out exactly where on the wall

3556
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:43,040
it hits the performance challenge

3557
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,040
of that is as it's going out

3558
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,040
every block it's crossing it checks

3559
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,040
is this a solid wall

3560
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:51,040
so that means that in like

3561
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:53,040
the early Wolfenstein levels you're in a

3562
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,040
small jail cell going out into a small

3563
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:57,040
hallway it's super efficient for that

3564
02:20:57,040 --> 02:20:59,040
because you're only stepping across three

3565
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,040
or four blocks but then if somebody

3566
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:03,040
makes a room that covers our maps

3567
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,040
we're limited to 64 by 64 blocks

3568
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:07,040
if you made one room

3569
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:09,040
that was nothing but walls at the far

3570
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:11,040
space it would go pretty slow

3571
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:13,040
because it would be stepping across

3572
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:15,040
80 tile tests or something

3573
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:17,040
along the way by the way the physics of our

3574
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:19,040
universe seems to be computing this very thing

3575
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,040
so this maps nicely to the

3576
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,040
actual physics of our world

3577
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,040
yeah you get like I follow a little bit

3578
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:27,040
of something like Stephen Wolfram's work on

3579
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:29,040
you know interconnected network

3580
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,040
information states of that and

3581
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:33,040
that's it's beyond what I can

3582
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,040
have an informed opinion on

3583
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:37,040
but it's interesting that people are

3584
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:39,040
considering things like that and have

3585
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:41,040
and have things that can back

3586
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,040
it up yeah that's yeah

3587
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,040
there's whole different sets of interesting stuff

3588
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:47,040
there so Wolfenstein 3D

3589
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:49,040
had ray casting so the ray casting

3590
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:51,040
and then the other kind of key aspect

3591
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,040
was what I called compiled

3592
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,040
scalers where the idea of

3593
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:57,040
you saw this in the

3594
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:59,040
earlier classic arcade games

3595
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,040
like space harrier and stuff where

3596
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,040
you would take a picture which is

3597
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,040
normally drawn directly on the screen

3598
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:07,040
and then if you have the ability to make it

3599
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:09,040
bigger or smaller big chunky pixels

3600
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:11,040
or physically small drop sampled pixels

3601
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,040
that's the fundamental

3602
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,040
aspect of what our characters were doing

3603
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,040
in these 3D games you would have

3604
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,040
it's just like you might have drawn a tiny little character

3605
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:21,040
but now we can make them really big

3606
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:23,040
and make them really small move it around

3607
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:25,040
that was the limited kind of 3D

3608
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:27,040
that we had for characters to make them turn

3609
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:29,040
there were literally eight different views

3610
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,040
of them you didn't actually have a 3D model

3611
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,040
that would rotate you just had these cardboard

3612
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:35,040
cutouts but that was good enough for that

3613
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:37,040
startle fight reaction and

3614
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:39,040
it was kind of what we had to deal

3615
02:22:39,040 --> 02:22:41,040
with there so a straight

3616
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,040
forward approach to do that you could just

3617
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,040
write out your doubly nested loop of

3618
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,040
you've got your stretch factor

3619
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,040
and it's like you've got a point you stretch by a little

3620
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:51,040
bit it might be on the same pixel it might

3621
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,040
have skipped a pixel

3622
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,040
you can write that out but it's not

3623
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:57,040
going to be fast enough where especially

3624
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:59,040
you get a character for that right in your

3625
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:01,040
face monster covering almost the entire

3626
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:03,040
screen doing that with a general

3627
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:05,040
purpose scaling routine would have just

3628
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:07,040
been much too slow it would have worked

3629
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:09,040
when they're small characters but then it would get

3630
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:11,040
slower and slower as they got closer to you

3631
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:13,040
until right at the time when you most care

3632
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:15,040
about having a fast reaction time

3633
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:17,040
the game would be chunking down

3634
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,040
so the fastest possible way

3635
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,040
to draw pixels

3636
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,040
at that time was

3637
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:25,040
to I am

3638
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:27,040
instead of saying I've got a general

3639
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:29,040
purpose I am

3640
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:31,040
version that can handle any scale

3641
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:33,040
I made I used

3642
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:35,040
a program to make essentially

3643
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:37,040
a hundred or more separate little

3644
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:39,040
programs that was optimized for

3645
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:41,040
I will take an image and I will draw it

3646
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:43,040
12 pixels tall I'll take an image

3647
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:45,040
I'll draw it 14 pixels tall up

3648
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,040
by every two pixels even

3649
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,040
for that so you would have the most

3650
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:51,040
optimized code so that

3651
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,040
in the normal case where

3652
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,040
most of the world is fairly large

3653
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:57,040
I like the pixels are big

3654
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:59,040
we did not have a lot of memory

3655
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:01,040
so in most cases that meant that you would

3656
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:03,040
load a pixel color

3657
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:05,040
and then you would store it multiple times

3658
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,040
so that was faster

3659
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:09,040
than even copying an image

3660
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:11,040
in a normal conventional case

3661
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:13,040
because most of the time the image is expanded

3662
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:15,040
so instead of doing one read one

3663
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:17,040
write for a simple copy you might

3664
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:19,040
be doing one read and three or four writes

3665
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:21,040
as it got really big and that

3666
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,040
had the beneficial aspect of just when you

3667
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:25,040
needed the performance most when things are

3668
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:27,040
covering the screen it was giving you the most

3669
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:29,040
acceleration for that by the way

3670
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,040
were you able to

3671
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:33,040
understand this through

3672
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:35,040
thinking about it or were you testing

3673
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,040
like the right speed and like this again

3674
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:39,040
comes back to I can

3675
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,040
find the antecedents for things like this

3676
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,040
so in I am

3677
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:45,040
back in the Apple two days

3678
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:47,040
the graphics were

3679
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,040
essentially single bits at a time

3680
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,040
and if you wanted to make your little

3681
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:53,040
spaceship if you wanted to make it

3682
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,040
smoothly go across the world

3683
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,040
if you just took the image and you drew it out at the next

3684
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,040
location you would move by seven pixels

3685
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:01,040
at a time so it would go chunk chunk chunk

3686
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:03,040
if you wanted to make it move smoothly

3687
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:05,040
you actually had to make seven versions

3688
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,040
of the ship that were pre-shifted

3689
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:09,040
you could write a program that would shift it

3690
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:11,040
dynamically but on a one megahertz

3691
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,040
processor that's not going anywhere fast

3692
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,040
so if you wanted to do a smooth

3693
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:17,040
moving fast action game

3694
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,040
you made separate versions of each of these

3695
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,040
sprites now there were

3696
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:23,040
a few more tricks you could pull that if it

3697
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:25,040
still wasn't fast enough you could make

3698
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:27,040
a compiled shape

3699
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,040
where instead of

3700
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,040
this program that normally copies

3701
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,040
an image and it says like get this byte

3702
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:35,040
from here stored here get this byte store this

3703
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:37,040
byte if you've got the memory

3704
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,040
space you could say I'm going

3705
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:41,040
to write the program that does nothing but draw

3706
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:43,040
this shape it's going to be like

3707
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:45,040
I'm going to load the immediate value

3708
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,040
25 you know which is

3709
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,040
some bit pattern and then I'm going to store

3710
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:51,040
that at this location

3711
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:53,040
rather than loading something from memory

3712
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:55,040
that involved indexing registers

3713
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,040
and this other slow stuff

3714
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:59,040
you could go ahead and say no I'm going to hard

3715
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,040
code the exact values of all of the image

3716
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:03,040
right into the program and this was always

3717
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,040
a horrible trade off there but you didn't have much

3718
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,040
memory and you didn't have much speed

3719
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:09,040
but if you had something that you wanted to go really

3720
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:11,040
fast you could turn it into a program

3721
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:13,040
and that was

3722
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,040
you know knowing about that technique is what

3723
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:17,040
made me think about some of these unwinding

3724
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:19,040
it for the PC where people

3725
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:21,040
that didn't come from that background were less

3726
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:23,040
likely to think about that

3727
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:25,040
I mean there's some deep parallels

3728
02:26:25,040 --> 02:26:27,040
probably to human cognition as well

3729
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:29,040
there's something about

3730
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:33,040
optimizing and compressing

3731
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:35,040
the processing

3732
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:37,040
of a new information that requires

3733
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,040
you to predict the possible

3734
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:41,040
ways in which

3735
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,040
the game or the world

3736
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,040
might unroll and you have

3737
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,040
something like compiled scalars always

3738
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:49,040
there so you have like

3739
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,040
optimum like you have a

3740
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,040
prediction of how the world will unroll and you have

3741
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,040
some kind of optimized

3742
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:57,040
data structure

3743
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:59,040
for that prediction and then you can modify

3744
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:01,040
if the world turns out to be different

3745
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,040
you can modify in a slight way

3746
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,040
and as far as building out techniques

3747
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,040
so much of the brain is about the associative context

3748
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,040
you know there just when you learn

3749
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:11,040
something it's in the context of something else

3750
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:13,040
and you can have faint tiny little

3751
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:15,040
hints of things and I do think

3752
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:17,040
there are some deep things around

3753
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:19,040
like sparse distributed memories and boosting

3754
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:21,040
that's like if you can just be slightly above

3755
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:23,040
the noise floor of having some hint

3756
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:25,040
of something you can have things refined

3757
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,040
into pulling the memory back up so

3758
02:27:27,040 --> 02:27:29,040
having a being a programmer

3759
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,040
a tool box of like all of these things

3760
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:33,040
that things that I did in all of these

3761
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:35,040
previous lives of programming tasks

3762
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:37,040
that still matters to me about how

3763
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:39,040
I'm able to pull up some of these things

3764
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,040
like in that case it was something I did on the

3765
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:43,040
Apple too then being relevant for the PC

3766
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:45,040
and I have still cases

3767
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:47,040
when I would when I would work on

3768
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,040
mobile development then be like okay

3769
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:51,040
I did something like this back in the

3770
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:53,040
doom days but now it's a different

3771
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:55,040
environment but I still had that tie

3772
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:57,040
I can bring it in and I can transform it

3773
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:59,040
into what the world needs right now

3774
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,040
and I do think that's actually one of the

3775
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:03,040
very core things with human

3776
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:05,040
cognition and brain like

3777
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:07,040
you know brain like functioning is

3778
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,040
finding these ways about you've got

3779
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:11,040
your brain is kind of everything everywhere all at once

3780
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:13,040
you know it's it is just a set of all of

3781
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:15,040
this stuff that is just fetched back by

3782
02:28:15,040 --> 02:28:17,040
these queries that go into it

3783
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:19,040
and they can just be slightly above the noise

3784
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:21,040
floor with random noise in your neurons

3785
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:23,040
and synapses that are affecting exactly

3786
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:25,040
what gets pulled up. So you're saying

3787
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:27,040
there's very specific solutions for different

3788
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:29,040
games you find

3789
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:31,040
that there's a kernel of

3790
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,040
a deep idea that's generalizable to

3791
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:35,040
other to other things. Yeah you

3792
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,040
can't predict what it's going to be but

3793
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:39,040
that idea of like I called out that compiled

3794
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:41,040
shaders in the forward that I wrote

3795
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:43,040
for that the game engine black book

3796
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,040
as you know this is

3797
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,040
it's kind of an endpoint of unrolling

3798
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:49,040
code but that's one of those

3799
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:51,040
things that thinking about that and having that

3800
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:53,040
in your mind and I'm sure there are some programmers

3801
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:55,040
that you know hear about that think about

3802
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:57,040
it a little bit it's kind of the mind blown moment

3803
02:28:57,040 --> 02:28:59,040
it's like oh you can just turn all of that

3804
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:01,040
data into code and

3805
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:03,040
nowadays you know you have instruction cache

3806
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:05,040
issues and that's not necessarily the best idea

3807
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:07,040
but there are different

3808
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:09,040
it's an idea that has power

3809
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,040
and has probably relevance in some other

3810
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,040
areas maybe it's in a hardware point of view

3811
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:15,040
that there's a way you approach building hardware

3812
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:17,040
that has that same you don't

3813
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:19,040
even have to think about iterating you just bake

3814
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:21,040
everything all the way into it in one

3815
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:23,040
place what is the story

3816
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:25,040
of how you came to program doom

3817
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,040
what is some memorable technical

3818
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:29,040
challenges or innovations within that game

3819
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:31,040
so the path that we went

3820
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,040
after after Wolfenstein

3821
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:35,040
got out and we were on this crazy

3822
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:37,040
arc where keen one through three

3823
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:39,040
more success than we thought keen

3824
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:41,040
four through six even more success

3825
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:43,040
Wolfenstein even more success so we were

3826
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:45,040
on this this crazy trajectory

3827
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:47,040
for things so actually our first

3828
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:49,040
box commercial project was a commander keen

3829
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:51,040
I am game but then

3830
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:53,040
Wolfenstein was going to have a game called

3831
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:55,040
spear of destiny which was

3832
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,040
a commercial version 60 new levels

3833
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:59,040
so the rest of the team took the game

3834
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:01,040
engine pretty much as it was

3835
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:03,040
and started working on that we got

3836
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,040
new monsters but it's

3837
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:07,040
basically reskins of the things

3838
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,040
there there's a really interesting aspect

3839
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:11,040
about that that I didn't appreciate until much

3840
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:13,040
much later about how

3841
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:15,040
Wolfenstein clearly did

3842
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:17,040
tap out its limit about what

3843
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:19,040
you want to play and all

3844
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,040
the levels and a couple of our license things

3845
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:23,040
there was a hard

3846
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:25,040
creative wall that you did not really

3847
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,040
benefit much by continuing to beat on it

3848
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,040
but a game like

3849
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,040
doom and other more modern

3850
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,040
games like minecraft or something

3851
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:35,040
there's kind of a turing completeness level

3852
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:37,040
of design freedom that you get in games

3853
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:39,040
that Wolfenstein really sat on one

3854
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:41,040
side of you know all the creative

3855
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:43,040
people in the world could not go and do

3856
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,040
a masterpiece just with the technology

3857
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,040
that Wolfenstein had Wolfenstein

3858
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,040
could do Wolfenstein but you really couldn't do

3859
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:51,040
something crazy and different but it

3860
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:53,040
didn't take that much more capability

3861
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:55,040
to get to Wolfenstein with

3862
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,040
the freeform lines and a little

3863
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:59,040
bit more artistic freedom to get to the

3864
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:01,040
point where people still announced

3865
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,040
new doom levels today all these years

3866
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:05,040
after without having completely

3867
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:07,040
tapped out the creativity how did you

3868
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,040
put it turing complete

3869
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:11,040
design space design space like

3870
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:13,040
you know we have the kind of computational

3871
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:15,040
universality

3872
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:17,040
on a lot of things but for creativity

3873
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:19,040
but yeah there's things where

3874
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:21,040
a box can be too small

3875
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,040
but above a certain point

3876
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,040
you kind of are at the point where

3877
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:27,040
you really have almost

3878
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:29,040
unbounded creative ability there and doom

3879
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:31,040
was the first time you crossed that

3880
02:31:31,040 --> 02:31:33,040
line yeah where there were

3881
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,040
thousands of doom levels created

3882
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,040
and some of them still have something new

3883
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:39,040
and interesting to say to the world about it

3884
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:41,040
is that line

3885
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:43,040
do you introspect what that line was

3886
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:45,040
is in the design space

3887
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:47,040
is it something about the programming

3888
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,040
capabilities that you were able

3889
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:51,040
to add to the game

3890
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:53,040
so the graphics fidelity

3891
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:55,040
was a necessary part because the block

3892
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:57,040
limitations in Wolfenstein

3893
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:59,040
what we had right there

3894
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,040
was not enough

3895
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,040
the full scale blocks although

3896
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,040
Minecraft I really did show

3897
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:07,040
that perhaps blocks stacked

3898
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:09,040
in 3D and at one quarter

3899
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:11,040
scale of that one eighth in volume

3900
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:13,040
is then sufficient to have all of that

3901
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:15,040
but the wall

3902
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,040
sized blocks that we had in Wolfenstein

3903
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,040
was too much of a creative limitation

3904
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,040
we licensed the technology to a few other teams

3905
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:23,040
none of them made

3906
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:25,040
too much of a dent with that

3907
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:27,040
it just wasn't enough creative ability

3908
02:32:27,040 --> 02:32:29,040
but a little bit more whether it was

3909
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:31,040
the variable floors and ceilings

3910
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:33,040
and arbitrary angles in doom

3911
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:35,040
or the smaller

3912
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:37,040
box blocks in Minecraft

3913
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:39,040
is then enough to open it up to

3914
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,040
just worlds and worlds of new capabilities

3915
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:43,040
what is binary

3916
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:45,040
space partitioning

3917
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:47,040
which is one of the technologies

3918
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:49,040
jump around a little bit

3919
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:51,040
on the story path there

3920
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:53,040
so while the team was working on Spirit Destiny

3921
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:55,040
for Wolfenstein

3922
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,040
we had met another development team

3923
02:32:57,040 --> 02:32:59,040
Raven Software while we were in Wisconsin

3924
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:01,040
and

3925
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:03,040
they had RPG background

3926
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:05,040
and I still kind of love that

3927
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,040
they offered to do a game engine

3928
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,040
for them to let them do a

3929
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,040
3D rendered RPG

3930
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:13,040
instead of the like most RPG games

3931
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:15,040
were kind of hand drawn they made it look

3932
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:17,040
kind of 3D but it was done just all with

3933
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,040
artist work rather than a real engine

3934
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:21,040
and

3935
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,040
after Wolfenstein this was still a tile

3936
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,040
based world but I added floors and ceilings

3937
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:27,040
and some lighting and the ability to have

3938
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:29,040
some sloped floors in different areas

3939
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,040
and that was my intermediate step for a game called

3940
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,040
Shadowcaster

3941
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:35,040
it had slowed down enough it was not

3942
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:37,040
fast enough to do our type of action

3943
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:39,040
things so that they had the screen

3944
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:41,040
cropped down a little bit so you couldn't

3945
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:43,040
go the full screen width like we would try to

3946
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:45,040
do in Wolfenstein

3947
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:47,040
but I learned a lot I got the floors

3948
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:49,040
and ceilings and lightings and it looked great

3949
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:51,040
they were great artists up there and it was

3950
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:53,040
it was an inspiration for us to look at some

3951
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:55,040
of that stuff

3952
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:57,040
but I had learned enough from that

3953
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:59,040
that I had the plan for I knew

3954
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,040
faster ways to do the the lighting

3955
02:34:01,040 --> 02:34:03,040
shadowing and I wanted to do this free form

3956
02:34:03,040 --> 02:34:05,040
geometry I wanted to break out of this tile

3957
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:07,040
based 90 degree

3958
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:09,040
world limitations

3959
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:11,040
so we had that was when

3960
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,040
we got our next stations and we were working

3961
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:15,040
with these higher powered systems

3962
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:17,040
and we built

3963
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:19,040
an editor that let us draw kind of arbitrary

3964
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:21,040
line segments and I was working

3965
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:23,040
hard to try to make something that could

3966
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,040
render this fast enough

3967
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:27,040
I was pushing myself

3968
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,040
pretty hard and

3969
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,040
we were we were at a point where

3970
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:33,040
we could see some things that looked amazingly

3971
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:35,040
cool but it wasn't really fast enough

3972
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,040
for the way I was doing it

3973
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:39,040
I for this flexibility it was no longer

3974
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:41,040
I couldn't just ray cast into it

3975
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:43,040
and I had these very complex sets of lines

3976
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:45,040
and simple little worlds were okay

3977
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,040
but the cool things that we wanted to do

3978
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:49,040
just weren't quite fast enough

3979
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:51,040
and I wound up taking

3980
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:53,040
a break at that point and I

3981
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,040
did the the port I did two

3982
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:57,040
ports of our games

3983
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:59,040
I Wolfenstein to

3984
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:01,040
the I to the Super Nintendo

3985
02:35:01,040 --> 02:35:03,040
it was I it was a crazy

3986
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:05,040
difficult thing to do which was an even

3987
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:07,040
slower processors like 2

3988
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:09,040
I a couple megahertz

3989
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:11,040
processor and it had

3990
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:13,040
been this whole thing where we had farmed out

3991
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,040
the I

3992
02:35:15,040 --> 02:35:17,040
the work and it wasn't it wasn't going

3993
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:19,040
well and I took it back over

3994
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:21,040
and trying to make it go

3995
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,040
fast on there where it really

3996
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:25,040
did not have much processing power

3997
02:35:25,040 --> 02:35:27,040
the pixels were stretched up hugely and it's

3998
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:29,040
you know it's pretty ugly when you looked at it

3999
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,040
but in the end it did come out fast enough

4000
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:33,040
to play and still be kind of fun from that

4001
02:35:33,040 --> 02:35:35,040
but that was where I started

4002
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:37,040
using BSP trees or binary

4003
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:39,040
space partitioning trees it was one of those

4004
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:41,040
things I had to make it faster there

4005
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:43,040
it was a stepping stone where

4006
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,040
it was reasonably easy to understand

4007
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:47,040
in the grid world of Wolfenstein where

4008
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,040
it was all still 90 degree angles

4009
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:51,040
I'm BSP trees were

4010
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:53,040
I eased myself into it

4011
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:55,040
with that and it was a big success

4012
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:57,040
I am then when I came

4013
02:35:57,040 --> 02:35:59,040
back to working on doom I had

4014
02:35:59,040 --> 02:36:01,040
this new tool in my toolbox it was going

4015
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,040
to be a lot harder with the arbitrary

4016
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:05,040
angles of doom this was where

4017
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,040
I really started grappling with epsilon

4018
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:09,040
problems and just you know up

4019
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:11,040
until that point I hadn't really had to deal with

4020
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,040
the fact that I am so

4021
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:15,040
many numeric things this almost felt like a betrayal

4022
02:36:15,040 --> 02:36:17,040
to me where people had told me that I had

4023
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:19,040
mathematicians up on a bit of a pedestal

4024
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,040
where I was people

4025
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,040
think I'm a math wizard and I'm not I really

4026
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:25,040
everything that I did

4027
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:27,040
was really done with a solid

4028
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:29,040
high school math understanding

4029
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:31,040
you know algebra 2 trigonometry

4030
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:33,040
and I am that was

4031
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:35,040
what got me all the way through doom and quake

4032
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:37,040
and all of that of just understanding

4033
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:39,040
basics of matrices and

4034
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:41,040
knowing it well enough to do something with it

4035
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:43,040
what's the epsilon problems you ran into

4036
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:45,040
so I when you wind up taking

4037
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:47,040
a like a sloped line

4038
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:49,040
and you say I'm going to intersect it with another

4039
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:51,040
sloped line I am

4040
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:53,040
then you wind up with something that's not going

4041
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:55,040
to be on these nice grid boundaries

4042
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:57,040
with the Wolfenstein tile maps

4043
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:59,040
where all you've got is horizontal and vertical lines

4044
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:01,040
looking at it from above and if you cut

4045
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:03,040
one of them it's just obvious the other one gets

4046
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:05,040
cut exactly at that point

4047
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:07,040
but when you have angled lines you're doing

4048
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,040
a kind of a slope intercept problem

4049
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,040
and you wind up with rational numbers there

4050
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:13,040
where things that are not going

4051
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:15,040
to evenly land on an integer

4052
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:17,040
or even on any fixed point value that you've got

4053
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:19,040
so everything winds up having

4054
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,040
to snap to some fixed point value

4055
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:23,040
so the lines slightly change their

4056
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:25,040
angle you wind up if you cut something

4057
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:27,040
here this one's going to bend a little this way

4058
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:29,040
and it's not going to be completely straight

4059
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,040
and then you come down to all these questions of

4060
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:33,040
well this one is

4061
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:35,040
is a point on an angled line

4062
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:37,040
you can't answer that in finite precision

4063
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,040
unless you're doing something

4064
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:41,040
with actual rational numbers

4065
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,040
and later on I did waste far too much time

4066
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:45,040
chasing things like that how do you do

4067
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:47,040
base arithmetic with rational numbers

4068
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:49,040
and it always blows up eventually

4069
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:51,040
exponentially as you do an update

4070
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:53,040
so these kind of things aren't possible with computers

4071
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,040
so they're possible

4072
02:37:55,040 --> 02:37:57,040
again there are paths to do

4073
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:59,040
doing it but you can't fit them conveniently

4074
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:01,040
and any of the numbers you need to start using

4075
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,040
big nums and different

4076
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:05,040
factor trackings and different things

4077
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:07,040
so you have to if you have any

4078
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:09,040
elements of OCD and you want to do something

4079
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:11,040
perfectly you're screwed if you're working

4080
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:13,040
with floating point

4081
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:15,040
so you had to deal with this for the first time

4082
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,040
and there were lots of challenges

4083
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,040
there about okay

4084
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:21,040
they build this cool thing and the way the BSP

4085
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:23,040
trees work is it basically

4086
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:25,040
takes the walls and it carves other

4087
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:27,040
walls by those walls in this

4088
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:29,040
clever way that you can then take

4089
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,040
all of these fragments and then you can

4090
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:33,040
for sure from any given point

4091
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:35,040
get an ordering of everything in the world

4092
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:37,040
and you can say this goes in front of this

4093
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,040
goes in front of this all the way back to

4094
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:41,040
the last thing and that's super

4095
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:43,040
valuable for graphics where

4096
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:45,040
kind of a classic graphics algorithm

4097
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:47,040
would be painter's algorithm

4098
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:49,040
you paint the furthest thing first and then the next thing

4099
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:51,040
and then the next thing and then it comes up

4100
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:53,040
and it's all perfect for you that's

4101
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:55,040
slow because you don't want to have to have drawn

4102
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:57,040
everything like that but you can also flip

4103
02:38:57,040 --> 02:38:59,040
it around and draw the closest thing to

4104
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:01,040
you and then if you're clever

4105
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:03,040
about it you can figure out what you need to

4106
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,040
draw that's visible beyond

4107
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:07,040
that and that's what BSP trees allow you to do

4108
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:09,040
yeah so it's combined with

4109
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:11,040
a bunch of other things but it gives

4110
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,040
you that ordering it's a clever way

4111
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:15,040
of doing things and I remember

4112
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:17,040
I had learned this from one of

4113
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:19,040
my graphics bible at the time

4114
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,040
a book called folian van dam

4115
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:23,040
it was a different world back there

4116
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:25,040
there was a small integer number of books

4117
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:27,040
and this book

4118
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:29,040
this book that was a big fat college

4119
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:31,040
textbook that I had read

4120
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:33,040
through many times I didn't

4121
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:35,040
understand everything in it some of it wasn't

4122
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,040
useful to me but they had the little

4123
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:39,040
thing about

4124
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:41,040
finite orderings of you draw a little

4125
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:43,040
t-shaped thing and you can say you

4126
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,040
can make a fixed ahead of time order from

4127
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:47,040
this and you can generalize this with

4128
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:49,040
the BSP trees and

4129
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:51,040
I got a little bit more information about that

4130
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,040
and it was kind of fun later while I was working on Quake

4131
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:55,040
I got to meet Bruce Naylor

4132
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:57,040
who was one of the original researchers that

4133
02:39:57,040 --> 02:39:59,040
developed those technologies

4134
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:01,040
for academic literature

4135
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,040
and that was kind of fun but I was very much

4136
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:05,040
just finding a tool that can help me solve

4137
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,040
what I was doing and I was using it in this very

4138
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,040
crude way in a two-dimensional fashion

4139
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:11,040
rather than the general 3d the epsilon

4140
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:13,040
problems got much worse in quake in

4141
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:15,040
three-dimensionals when things angle in every

4142
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,040
way but eventually I did sort

4143
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,040
out the sort out how to do it reliably

4144
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:21,040
on doom there were still a few

4145
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:23,040
edge cases in doom that were not

4146
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:25,040
absolutely perfect where

4147
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:27,040
they even got terminologies in the

4148
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:29,040
communities like when you got to something where it was

4149
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,040
messed up it was a hall of mirrors effect

4150
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:33,040
because you'd sweep by and it wouldn't draw

4151
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,040
something there and you would just wind up with

4152
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,040
the leftover remnants as you flipped between

4153
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:39,040
the the two pages

4154
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:41,040
but BSP trees were important

4155
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,040
for it but it's again worth noting

4156
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:45,040
that after we did

4157
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:47,040
doom our major competition

4158
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,040
came from Ken Silverman

4159
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:51,040
in his build engine which was used for Duke

4160
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:53,040
Nukem 3d and some of the other games for

4161
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:55,040
3d realms and he used a completely

4162
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:57,040
different technology nothing to do with

4163
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:59,040
I'm with BSP

4164
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:01,040
trees so there's not just a one

4165
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:03,040
true way of doing things

4166
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:05,040
I'm there were critical things

4167
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:07,040
about to make any of those games fast

4168
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:09,040
you had to you had to separate your

4169
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:11,040
drawing into you drew vertical lines

4170
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:13,040
and you drew horizontal lines just kind

4171
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:15,040
of changing exactly what you would

4172
02:41:15,040 --> 02:41:17,040
draw with them that was critical for the

4173
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:19,040
technologies at that time

4174
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:21,040
and like all the games that were kind

4175
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:23,040
of like that wound up doing something similar

4176
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,040
but there were still a bunch of other

4177
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:27,040
decisions that could be made

4178
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,040
and we made good enough decisions

4179
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:31,040
on everything on doom we

4180
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,040
we brought in multiplayer

4181
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:35,040
significantly and it was our first game that was

4182
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,040
designed to be modified by the user

4183
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:39,040
community where we had this whole

4184
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:41,040
setup of our wad files and pwads

4185
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:43,040
and things that people could could build

4186
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:45,040
with tools that we released to them and they

4187
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:47,040
eventually rewrote to be better than what we

4188
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,040
released but they could build things

4189
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:51,040
and you could add it to your game without

4190
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:53,040
destructively modifying it which is what you

4191
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,040
had to do in all the early games you literally

4192
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:57,040
hacked the data files

4193
02:41:57,040 --> 02:41:59,040
executable before while doom was

4194
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,040
set up in this flexible way so that

4195
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,040
you could just say run the normal

4196
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:05,040
game with this added on on top

4197
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:07,040
and it would overlay just the things that

4198
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:09,040
you wanted to there

4199
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:11,040
would you say that doom was kind of the first

4200
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:13,040
true 3d game

4201
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:15,040
that you created so no it's still

4202
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:17,040
doom would usually be called a 2

4203
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:19,040
and a half d game where it had

4204
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:21,040
three-dimensional points on it and this is

4205
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:23,040
another one of these kind of pedantic things that people

4206
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:25,040
love to argue about about what was the first

4207
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:27,040
3d game I still like

4208
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:29,040
like every month probably I hear from

4209
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:31,040
somebody about well was doom really a

4210
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:33,040
3d game or something

4211
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:35,040
and you know I give the

4212
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:37,040
the point where characters

4213
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:39,040
had three coordinates so you had

4214
02:42:39,040 --> 02:42:41,040
like an x y and z the cacodammon

4215
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:43,040
could be coming in very high and come

4216
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:45,040
you know and come down towards you

4217
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,040
the walls had three coordinates

4218
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:49,040
on them so on some sense

4219
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:51,040
it's a 3d game engine but it was

4220
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:53,040
not a fully general 3d game engine

4221
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:55,040
you could not

4222
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:57,040
build a pyramid in doom because you

4223
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,040
couldn't make a sloped wall

4224
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,040
which was slightly different where in that

4225
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:03,040
previous shadow caster game I couldn't

4226
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:05,040
have vertexes and have a sloped floor there

4227
02:43:05,040 --> 02:43:07,040
but the changes that I made for doom

4228
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:09,040
to get higher speed and a different

4229
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:11,040
set of flexibility traded away that ability

4230
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,040
but you literally couldn't make that

4231
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:15,040
you could not

4232
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:17,040
make different heights of

4233
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:19,040
passages but you could not make a bridge

4234
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:21,040
over another area you could not go over

4235
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:23,040
and above it so it still had

4236
02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:25,040
some 2d limitations to it

4237
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:27,040
that's more about the building versus the actual experience

4238
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:29,040
because the experience is

4239
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:31,040
it felt like things would come at you but again

4240
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:33,040
you couldn't look up either

4241
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:35,040
you could only pitch

4242
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:37,040
it was 4 degrees of freedom rather than

4243
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:39,040
6 degrees of freedom you did not

4244
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,040
have the ability to tilt your head this way

4245
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:43,040
or pitch up and down

4246
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:45,040
so that takes us to quake

4247
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,040
what was the leap there

4248
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:49,040
what was some fascinating

4249
02:43:49,040 --> 02:43:51,040
technical challenges and there were a lot

4250
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,040
or not challenges but innovations

4251
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,040
that you've come up with so quake

4252
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,040
was kind of the first thing where

4253
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:59,040
I did have to kind of come face

4254
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,040
to face with my limitations

4255
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:03,040
where it was the first thing where

4256
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,040
I really did kind of

4257
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,040
give it my all and still come up

4258
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:09,040
you know come up a little bit short in terms

4259
02:44:09,040 --> 02:44:11,040
of what and when I wanted to

4260
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:13,040
to get it done and

4261
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:15,040
the company brand had some serious stresses

4262
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:17,040
through the whole project

4263
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:19,040
and we bit off a lot

4264
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:21,040
so the things that we set out

4265
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:23,040
to do was it was going to be

4266
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:25,040
really a true 3D engine

4267
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:27,040
where it could do 6 degree of freedom

4268
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:29,040
you could have all the viewpoints

4269
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:31,040
you could model anything

4270
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:33,040
it had

4271
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:35,040
a really remarkable new lighting model

4272
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:37,040
with the surface cashing and things

4273
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:39,040
that was one of those where it was starting to

4274
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:41,040
do some things that they weren't doing

4275
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:43,040
even on the very high end systems

4276
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:45,040
and it was going to be

4277
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,040
completely programmable

4278
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:49,040
in the modding standpoint where

4279
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:51,040
the thing that you couldn't do and do

4280
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:53,040
you could replace almost all of the media

4281
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:55,040
but you couldn't really change the game

4282
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:57,040
there were still some people

4283
02:44:57,040 --> 02:44:59,040
that were doing the hex setting of the executable

4284
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:01,040
the de-hacked things where you could change

4285
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:03,040
a few things about rules and people made

4286
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:05,040
some early capture the flag type things

4287
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:07,040
by hacking the executable but

4288
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:09,040
it wasn't really set out to do that

4289
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:11,040
quake was going to have its own

4290
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,040
programming language that the game was going to be implemented

4291
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:15,040
and that would be able to be overwritten

4292
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:17,040
just like any of the media

4293
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,040
code was going to be data for that

4294
02:45:19,040 --> 02:45:21,040
and you would be able to have expansion

4295
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:23,040
packs that changed fundamental things

4296
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:25,040
and mods and so on

4297
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:27,040
and the multiplayer

4298
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:29,040
was going to be playable over the internet

4299
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:31,040
it was going to support a client

4300
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:33,040
server rather than peer to peer

4301
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:35,040
so we had the possibility of supporting

4302
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:37,040
larger numbers of players in disparate locations

4303
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:39,040
with this full flexibility

4304
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:41,040
of the programming overrides

4305
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:43,040
with full six-degree of freedom

4306
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:45,040
modeling and viewing

4307
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:47,040
and with this fancy new light

4308
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:49,040
mapped kind of surface caching

4309
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:51,040
side it was a lot

4310
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:53,040
and this was one of those things that

4311
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:55,040
if I could go back and tell

4312
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:57,040
younger me to do something differently

4313
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:59,040
it would have been to split those

4314
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:01,040
innovations up into two phases

4315
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:03,040
in two separate games

4316
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:05,040
so it probably would have been taking

4317
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,040
the doom rendering engine

4318
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:09,040
and bringing in the TCPIP

4319
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:11,040
client server

4320
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:13,040
focusing on the multiplayer

4321
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,040
and the Quake C

4322
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:17,040
or would have been Doom C programming language

4323
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:19,040
there so I would have split that into

4324
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:21,040
programming language and networking

4325
02:46:21,040 --> 02:46:23,040
with the same doom engine

4326
02:46:23,040 --> 02:46:25,040
rather than forcing everybody to go towards

4327
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,040
the Quake engine which really

4328
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:29,040
meant getting a Pentium

4329
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:31,040
while it ran on a 486 it was not a great

4330
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:33,040
experience there we could have made more

4331
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:35,040
people happier and gotten two games done

4332
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,040
in 50% more time

4333
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:39,040
so speaking of people happier

4334
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:41,040
or

4335
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,040
mutual friend Joe Rogan

4336
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:45,040
it seems like the most

4337
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,040
important moment of his life

4338
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:49,040
is centered around Quake

4339
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:51,040
so it was a definitive

4340
02:46:51,040 --> 02:46:53,040
part of his life

4341
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:55,040
so would he agree with

4342
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:57,040
your thinking that

4343
02:46:57,040 --> 02:46:59,040
they should split

4344
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:01,040
so he is a person who loves Quake

4345
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,040
and played Quake a lot

4346
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:05,040
would he agree that you should have done

4347
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:07,040
the doom engine

4348
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:09,040
and focus on the multiplayer for phase one

4349
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:11,040
or

4350
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:13,040
in your looking back

4351
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:15,040
is the 3D world that

4352
02:47:15,040 --> 02:47:17,040
Quake created was also

4353
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:19,040
fundamental to the

4354
02:47:19,040 --> 02:47:21,040
the enriched experience I would say that

4355
02:47:21,040 --> 02:47:23,040
what would have happened is

4356
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:25,040
you would have had a

4357
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:27,040
a doom looking but Quake feeling

4358
02:47:27,040 --> 02:47:29,040
game

4359
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:31,040
8 months earlier and then maybe

4360
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:33,040
6 months after Quake actually

4361
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:35,040
then there would have been the full running on a pentium

4362
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:37,040
6 degree of freedom

4363
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:39,040
graphics engine type things there so it's not

4364
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:41,040
that it wouldn't have

4365
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,040
been there it would have been

4366
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:45,040
something amazingly cool earlier

4367
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,040
and then something even cooler somewhat later

4368
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:49,040
where I would much

4369
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:51,040
rather have gone and done

4370
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:53,040
two one year development efforts

4371
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:55,040
I've cycled them through

4372
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:57,040
I've been a little more pragmatic about that

4373
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:59,040
rather than killing us

4374
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:01,040
ourselves on the whole Quake development

4375
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:03,040
but I would say it's obviously

4376
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:05,040
things worked out well in the end

4377
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:07,040
but looking back and saying how would I

4378
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:09,040
optimize and do things differently

4379
02:48:09,040 --> 02:48:11,040
that did seem to be a clear case where

4380
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:13,040
I

4381
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:15,040
going ahead and we had enormous momentum

4382
02:48:15,040 --> 02:48:17,040
on doom you know we did doom too as

4383
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:19,040
the kind of commercial boxed version

4384
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:21,040
after our shareware success

4385
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,040
with the original but we could have

4386
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:25,040
just made another doom game

4387
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:27,040
adding those new features

4388
02:48:27,040 --> 02:48:29,040
in it would have been huge we would

4389
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:31,040
have learned all the same lessons but faster

4390
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:33,040
and it would have given

4391
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:35,040
6 degree of freedom and pentium

4392
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:37,040
class systems a little bit more time

4393
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:39,040
to get mainstream because we did

4394
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:41,040
cut out a lot of people with the hardware

4395
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:43,040
requirements for Quake

4396
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:45,040
was there any dark moments for you personally

4397
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:47,040
psychologically in having

4398
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:49,040
in

4399
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:51,040
having such harsh deadlines

4400
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,040
and having this also made

4401
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,040
difficult technical challenges

4402
02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:57,040
so I've never really

4403
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:59,040
had

4404
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:01,040
really dark black places

4405
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:03,040
I can't necessarily put myself in

4406
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:05,040
anyone else's shoes but I understand

4407
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:07,040
a lot of people

4408
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:09,040
have significant

4409
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:11,040
challenges with their

4410
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:13,040
mental health and well-being

4411
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:15,040
and I've been super stressed

4412
02:49:15,040 --> 02:49:17,040
I've been unhappy as a teenager

4413
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:19,040
in various ways

4414
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:21,040
but I've never really

4415
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:23,040
gone to a very dark

4416
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:25,040
place I just seem to be

4417
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:27,040
largely

4418
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:29,040
immune to what really

4419
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,040
wrecks people I mean I've had plenty of time

4420
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:33,040
when I'm very unhappy and miserable about

4421
02:49:33,040 --> 02:49:35,040
something but it's never

4422
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:37,040
hit me like I believe

4423
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:39,040
it winds up hitting some other people

4424
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:41,040
I've borne up well under whatever

4425
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:43,040
stresses have

4426
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:45,040
kind of fallen on me and I've always

4427
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:47,040
coped best on that

4428
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,040
when all I need to do is

4429
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:51,040
usually just kind of bear down on my work

4430
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:53,040
I pull myself out of

4431
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:55,040
whatever hole I might be slipping into

4432
02:49:55,040 --> 02:49:57,040
by actually making progress

4433
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:59,040
I mean maybe if I was in a

4434
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:01,040
position where I was never able to make

4435
02:50:01,040 --> 02:50:03,040
that progress I could have slid down further

4436
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:05,040
but I've always been in a

4437
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:07,040
place where okay a little bit

4438
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:09,040
more work maybe I'm in a tough spot here

4439
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:11,040
but I always know

4440
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:13,040
if I just keep pushing eventually

4441
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:15,040
I break through and I make progress

4442
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:17,040
I feel good about what I'm doing

4443
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,040
and that's been enough for me

4444
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,040
so far in my life

4445
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:23,040
I've seen in the distance

4446
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:25,040
like

4447
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:27,040
ideas of depression

4448
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:29,040
or contemplating suicide

4449
02:50:29,040 --> 02:50:31,040
have you seen those things far?

4450
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:33,040
So it was interesting when I was a teenager

4451
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:35,040
I was

4452
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,040
probably at some level a troubled youth

4453
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:39,040
I was unhappy most of my teenage

4454
02:50:39,040 --> 02:50:41,040
years

4455
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,040
I wanted to be on my own

4456
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:45,040
doing programming all the time

4457
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:47,040
as soon as I was 18, 19

4458
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:49,040
even though I was poor I was doing exactly

4459
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:51,040
what I wanted and I was very happy

4460
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:53,040
but high school was not a great time for me

4461
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:55,040
and

4462
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:57,040
I had a conversation with like the school counselor

4463
02:50:57,040 --> 02:50:59,040
and they're kind of running their script

4464
02:50:59,040 --> 02:51:01,040
it's like okay it's kind of a weird kid here

4465
02:51:01,040 --> 02:51:03,040
let's carefully probe around

4466
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:05,040
it's like do you ever think about

4467
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:07,040
ending it all? I'm like no of course not

4468
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:09,040
never not at all

4469
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,040
this is temporary things are going to be better

4470
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:15,040
and that's always been kind of the case

4471
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:17,040
for me and obviously

4472
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,040
it's not that way for everyone

4473
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,040
and other people do react differently

4474
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:23,040
what was your

4475
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:25,040
escape from the troubled youth

4476
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:27,040
like

4477
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:29,040
you know

4478
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:31,040
music

4479
02:51:31,040 --> 02:51:33,040
video games

4480
02:51:33,040 --> 02:51:35,040
books

4481
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:37,040
how did you escape from a world that's full of cruelty

4482
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:39,040
and suffering and that's absurd

4483
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:41,040
I was not victim of cruelty

4484
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:43,040
and suffering it's like I was an unhappy

4485
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,040
somewhat petulant youth

4486
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:47,040
where I'm not

4487
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:49,040
putting myself up with anybody else's

4488
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:51,040
suffering but I was unhappy

4489
02:51:51,040 --> 02:51:53,040
objectively and

4490
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:55,040
the things that I did that

4491
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:57,040
very much characterized my childhood

4492
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:59,040
were I had

4493
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,040
books, comic books, dungeons and dragons

4494
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:03,040
arcade games, video games

4495
02:52:03,040 --> 02:52:05,040
like some of my fondest

4496
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:07,040
childhood memories are the convenience stores

4497
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:09,040
the 7-Elevens and Quick Trips

4498
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:11,040
because they had a spinner rack of comic books

4499
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:13,040
and they had a little side room with

4500
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:15,040
two or three video games, arcade games

4501
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:17,040
in it and that was

4502
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:19,040
very much my happy place

4503
02:52:19,040 --> 02:52:21,040
I get my comic books

4504
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:23,040
and if I could go to a library

4505
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,040
and go through those little

4506
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:27,040
0-0-0 section where computer books were supposed

4507
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,040
to be and there are a few sad little books there

4508
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:31,040
but still just being able to sit down

4509
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:33,040
and go through that and I read

4510
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:35,040
I read a ridiculous number

4511
02:52:35,040 --> 02:52:37,040
of books both fiction and non-fiction

4512
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:39,040
as a teenager

4513
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:41,040
and

4514
02:52:41,040 --> 02:52:43,040
my rebelling in high school was just

4515
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:45,040
sitting there with my nose in a book ignoring the

4516
02:52:45,040 --> 02:52:47,040
class through lots of it

4517
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:49,040
and teachers had a range of reactions

4518
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,040
to that some more accepting

4519
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:53,040
of it than others

4520
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:55,040
I'm with you on that so let us

4521
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:57,040
return to quake for a bit with the technical

4522
02:52:57,040 --> 02:52:59,040
challenges what

4523
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:01,040
everything together

4524
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:03,040
from the networking

4525
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:05,040
to the graphics

4526
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:07,040
what are some things you remember

4527
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:09,040
that were innovations

4528
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:11,040
you had to come up with in order to

4529
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:13,040
make it all happen

4530
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:15,040
there were a bunch of things on quake

4531
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:17,040
where on the one hand the idea

4532
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:19,040
that I built my own programming language

4533
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:21,040
to implement the game in

4534
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:23,040
looking back and I try to tell people

4535
02:53:23,040 --> 02:53:25,040
every high-level programmer

4536
02:53:25,040 --> 02:53:27,040
sometime in their career goes through and they

4537
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:29,040
invent their own language it just seems to be a thing

4538
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:31,040
that's pretty broadly done

4539
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:33,040
I'm going to go write a computer programming language

4540
02:53:33,040 --> 02:53:35,040
and

4541
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:37,040
I don't regret having done it

4542
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:39,040
but after that

4543
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:41,040
I switched from quake c my quirky

4544
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:43,040
little pseudo-object

4545
02:53:43,040 --> 02:53:45,040
or entity-oriented language there

4546
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:47,040
quake 2 went back to using

4547
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,040
DLLs with C and then quake 3

4548
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:51,040
I implemented my own C interpreter or compiler

4549
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:53,040
which was a much smarter thing

4550
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:55,040
to do that I should have done originally for quake

4551
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:57,040
but building my own language

4552
02:53:57,040 --> 02:53:59,040
was an experience I learned a lot from that

4553
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:01,040
and then there was a generation

4554
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:03,040
of game programmers that

4555
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:05,040
learned programming with quake c which I feel kind

4556
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:07,040
of bad about because

4557
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:09,040
we give javascript a lot of crap but

4558
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:11,040
quake c was nothing to

4559
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:13,040
write home about there

4560
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:15,040
but it allowed people to do

4561
02:54:15,040 --> 02:54:17,040
magical things you get into programming

4562
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:19,040
not because you love the

4563
02:54:19,040 --> 02:54:21,040
BNF syntax of a language

4564
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:23,040
it's because the language lets you do

4565
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:25,040
something that you cared about

4566
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:27,040
and here's very much you could do something

4567
02:54:27,040 --> 02:54:29,040
in a whole beautiful three-dimensional

4568
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:31,040
world and the idea and the fact that the

4569
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:33,040
code for the game was out there you could say

4570
02:54:33,040 --> 02:54:35,040
I like the shotgun but I want

4571
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:37,040
it to be more badass you go in there and say

4572
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:39,040
okay now it does 200 points damage

4573
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:41,040
and then you go around with a big grin

4574
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:43,040
on your face blowing up monsters all over

4575
02:54:43,040 --> 02:54:45,040
the game so yeah it's

4576
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:47,040
I you know it is not

4577
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:49,040
what I would do today going back with that

4578
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:51,040
language but that was a big part of it

4579
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:53,040
learning about the networking stuff

4580
02:54:53,040 --> 02:54:55,040
I because it's

4581
02:54:55,040 --> 02:54:57,040
interesting where I learn these things by

4582
02:54:57,040 --> 02:54:59,040
reading books so I would get a book on networking

4583
02:54:59,040 --> 02:55:01,040
find something I read

4584
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:03,040
all about and learn okay packets they can

4585
02:55:03,040 --> 02:55:05,040
be you know out of order lost

4586
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:07,040
or duplicated these are all the

4587
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:09,040
things that can theoretically happen to packets

4588
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:11,040
so I wind up spending all this time

4589
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:13,040
thinking about how do we deal about all that

4590
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:15,040
and it turns out of course in the real world

4591
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:17,040
those are things that yes theoretically can happen

4592
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:19,040
with multiple routes but they really

4593
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:21,040
aren't things that your 99.999

4594
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:23,040
percent of your packets

4595
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:25,040
have to deal with

4596
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:27,040
so there was learning experiences about

4597
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:29,040
lots of that like why

4598
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:31,040
when TCP is appropriate

4599
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:33,040
versus UDP and and how

4600
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:35,040
if you do things in UDP you wind up reinventing

4601
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:37,040
TCP badly in almost all

4602
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:39,040
cases so you know there's

4603
02:55:39,040 --> 02:55:41,040
there's good arguments for using

4604
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:43,040
both for different game technology

4605
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:45,040
different parts of the game process transitioning

4606
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:47,040
from level to level and all but the the

4607
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:49,040
graphics were the showcase

4608
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:51,040
of what what quake

4609
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:53,040
was all about it was this graphics technology

4610
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:55,040
that nobody had seen there

4611
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,040
and it was a while before

4612
02:55:57,040 --> 02:55:59,040
you know there were competitive things out there

4613
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:01,040
and it went a long

4614
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:03,040
time internally really not working

4615
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:05,040
where we were even building

4616
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:07,040
levels where the game

4617
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:09,040
just was not at all

4618
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:11,040
shippable with large fractions of the world

4619
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:13,040
like disappearing not being there

4620
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:15,040
I or being really

4621
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:17,040
slow in various parts of it and it

4622
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,040
was this act of faith it's like I think

4623
02:56:19,040 --> 02:56:21,040
I'm going to be able to fix this I think

4624
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:23,040
I'm going to be able to make this work

4625
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:25,040
and lots of stuff

4626
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:27,040
changed where the level designers

4627
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,040
would build something then have to throw it away

4628
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:31,040
as something fundamental in the kind of graphics

4629
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,040
or level technology change

4630
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:35,040
and the I

4631
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:37,040
so there were two big things that

4632
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:39,040
contributed to making it possible

4633
02:56:39,040 --> 02:56:41,040
at that time frame I am

4634
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:43,040
two new things there was certainly

4635
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:45,040
hardcore optimized low level assembly

4636
02:56:45,040 --> 02:56:47,040
language and this is where I had hired

4637
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:49,040
Michael A. Brash away from

4638
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:51,040
Microsoft and he had been one of my

4639
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:53,040
early inspirations where that

4640
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:55,040
back in the soft disk days the library

4641
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:57,040
of magazines that they had

4642
02:56:57,040 --> 02:56:59,040
some of my most treasured ones were

4643
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:01,040
Michael A. Brash's articles

4644
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:03,040
in Dr. Dobbs Journal and

4645
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:05,040
it was it was amazing after

4646
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:07,040
all of our success in Doom we were able to

4647
02:57:07,040 --> 02:57:09,040
kind of hit him up and say hey we'd like

4648
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,040
you to come work at id software and he was

4649
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:13,040
in the senior technical role at Microsoft

4650
02:57:13,040 --> 02:57:15,040
and I am you know and

4651
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:17,040
he was on track for and this was right when

4652
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:19,040
Microsoft was starting to take off and I

4653
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:21,040
did eventually you know

4654
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:23,040
convince him that what we were doing was

4655
02:57:23,040 --> 02:57:25,040
going to be really amazing with quake it was

4656
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:27,040
going to it was going to be something nobody

4657
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:29,040
had seen before it had

4658
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:31,040
these aspects of what we were talking

4659
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:33,040
about we had metaverse talk back then

4660
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:35,040
we you know we had read snow crash and

4661
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:37,040
we were we knew about this and

4662
02:57:37,040 --> 02:57:39,040
Michael was I was big

4663
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:41,040
into the science fiction and we would talk

4664
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:43,040
about all that and kind of spin this tail

4665
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:45,040
and it was some of the same conversations

4666
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:47,040
that we have today about the metaverse

4667
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:49,040
about how you could have different areas

4668
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:51,040
linked together by portals and you could have

4669
02:57:51,040 --> 02:57:53,040
user-generated content and changing

4670
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:55,040
out all of these things so you really

4671
02:57:55,040 --> 02:57:57,040
were creating the metaverse with quaking

4672
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:59,040
and we we talked about things like

4673
02:57:59,040 --> 02:58:01,040
philosophically used to be advertised as a

4674
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:03,040
virtual reality experience you know that

4675
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:05,040
was the first wave of virtual reality

4676
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:07,040
was in the late 80s and early

4677
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:09,040
90s you had like the lawnmower man

4678
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:11,040
I'm you know movie and you had

4679
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:13,040
time in newsweek talking about the early

4680
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:15,040
VPL headsets and

4681
02:58:15,040 --> 02:58:17,040
of course that cratered so hard that

4682
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,040
people didn't want to look at virtual reality

4683
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:21,040
for decades afterwards where

4684
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:23,040
it was just it was spoken

4685
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:25,040
mirrors it was not real in the sense

4686
02:58:25,040 --> 02:58:27,040
that you could actually do something

4687
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:29,040
real and valuable with it but

4688
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:31,040
but still we had that kind of common

4689
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:33,040
set of talking points and we were talking

4690
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:35,040
about what these games could

4691
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:37,040
I could become and how you'd

4692
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:39,040
like to see people building all of these

4693
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:41,040
creative things because we were seeing an

4694
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:43,040
explosion of work with doom at that time

4695
02:58:43,040 --> 02:58:45,040
where people were doing amazingly

4696
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:47,040
cool things like we saw cooler

4697
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:49,040
levels that we had built coming out of the user

4698
02:58:49,040 --> 02:58:51,040
community and then people finding

4699
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,040
ways to you know change that the characters

4700
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:55,040
in different ways and it was great and we

4701
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:57,040
knew what we were doing in quake was

4702
02:58:57,040 --> 02:58:59,040
removing those last things there was

4703
02:58:59,040 --> 02:59:01,040
some quirky things with a couple of

4704
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:03,040
the data types that didn't work right

4705
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:05,040
for overriding and that and then the core

4706
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:07,040
thing about the programming model

4707
02:59:07,040 --> 02:59:09,040
and I was definitely going to hit all of those

4708
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,040
in quake I'm but

4709
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:13,040
the the graphic side of it was

4710
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:15,040
I was still

4711
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:17,040
I knew what I wanted to do

4712
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:19,040
and it was one of these

4713
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:21,040
hubris things where it's like well

4714
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:23,040
so far I've been able to kind of

4715
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,040
kick everything that I set out

4716
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:27,040
to go do but quake

4717
02:59:27,040 --> 02:59:29,040
was definitely a little bit

4718
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:31,040
more than could be comfortably chewed at

4719
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:33,040
that point and I

4720
02:59:33,040 --> 02:59:35,040
but Michael was one of the

4721
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:37,040
one of the strongest programmers and

4722
02:59:37,040 --> 02:59:39,040
graphics programmers that I knew

4723
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:41,040
and he was one of the people that I trusted

4724
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:43,040
to to write assembly code

4725
02:59:43,040 --> 02:59:45,040
you know better than I could and there's

4726
02:59:45,040 --> 02:59:47,040
there's a few people that I can point to

4727
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,040
about things like this where I'm a world

4728
02:59:49,040 --> 02:59:51,040
class optimizer I mean I make things

4729
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:53,040
go fast but I recognize

4730
02:59:53,040 --> 02:59:55,040
there's a number of people that

4731
02:59:55,040 --> 02:59:57,040
can write tighter assembly code

4732
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:59,040
tighter SIMD code or tighter CUDA

4733
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,040
code then you know then I can write

4734
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:03,040
I'm you know my best strengths

4735
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:05,040
are a little bit more at the system

4736
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:07,040
level I mean I'm good at all of that

4737
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:09,040
but the most leverage

4738
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:11,040
comes from making the decisions that are a little

4739
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:13,040
bit higher up where you figure out

4740
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:15,040
how to change your large scale problems

4741
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:17,040
so that these lower level problems

4742
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,040
are easier to do or it makes it possible

4743
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:21,040
to do them in a

4744
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:23,040
in a uniquely fast way

4745
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:25,040
so most of my

4746
03:00:25,040 --> 03:00:27,040
you know my big wins in a lot of ways

4747
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:29,040
from all the way from the early games through

4748
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:31,040
you know through VR and the aerospace

4749
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:33,040
work that I'm doing and or did

4750
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:35,040
and hopefully the AI work that I'm working on

4751
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:37,040
now is finding an angle on

4752
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:39,040
something that means you trade

4753
03:00:39,040 --> 03:00:41,040
off something that you maybe think

4754
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:43,040
you need but it turns out you don't need

4755
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:45,040
and by making a sacrifice in one

4756
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:47,040
place you can get big advantages

4757
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:49,040
in another place is it

4758
03:00:49,040 --> 03:00:51,040
clear at which level of the system

4759
03:00:51,040 --> 03:00:53,040
those big advantages

4760
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,040
can be gained it's not always

4761
03:00:55,040 --> 03:00:57,040
clear and that's why the thing

4762
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:59,040
that that I try to make one of my

4763
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:01,040
core values and I

4764
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:03,040
proselytize to a lot of people is

4765
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:05,040
trying to know the entire stack

4766
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:07,040
no trying to see through

4767
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:09,040
everything that happens and it's almost

4768
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:11,040
impossible on like the web browser

4769
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:13,040
level of things where there's so many levels

4770
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,040
to it but you should at least understand

4771
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:17,040
what they all are even if you can't understand

4772
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:19,040
all the performance characteristics at

4773
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:21,040
each level but it goes all the

4774
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:23,040
way down to literally the hardware

4775
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:25,040
so what does the what is this

4776
03:01:25,040 --> 03:01:27,040
chip capable of and

4777
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:29,040
what is this software that you're writing capable

4778
03:01:29,040 --> 03:01:31,040
of and then with this architecture you put

4779
03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:33,040
on top of that than the ecosystem around

4780
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:35,040
it all the people that are

4781
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:37,040
working on it so there are

4782
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:39,040
all these decisions and

4783
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:41,040
they're never made in a globally optimal way

4784
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:43,040
but sometimes you can drive a thread

4785
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:45,040
of global optimality through it

4786
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:47,040
you can't look at everything it's too complicated

4787
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:49,040
but sometimes you can step

4788
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:51,040
back up and make a different

4789
03:01:51,040 --> 03:01:53,040
decision and we kind of went through this on the graphics

4790
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:55,040
side on quake where

4791
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:57,040
in some ways it was kind of bad where Michael

4792
03:01:57,040 --> 03:01:59,040
would spend his time writing

4793
03:01:59,040 --> 03:02:01,040
like I'd rough out the basic

4794
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:03,040
routines like okay here's our span

4795
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:05,040
rasterizer and he would spend a month

4796
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:07,040
writing this you know beautiful

4797
03:02:07,040 --> 03:02:09,040
cycle optimized

4798
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:11,040
piece of assembly language that does

4799
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:13,040
you know does what I asked it to do

4800
03:02:13,040 --> 03:02:15,040
and he did it faster than like my

4801
03:02:15,040 --> 03:02:17,040
original code would do or probably what

4802
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,040
I would be able to do even if I had spent that month

4803
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:21,040
on it but then we'd have

4804
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:23,040
some cases when I'd be like okay

4805
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:25,040
well I figured out at this higher

4806
03:02:25,040 --> 03:02:27,040
level instead of drawing these in a

4807
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:29,040
painter's order here I do a span buffer

4808
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:31,040
and it cuts out

4809
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:33,040
30% or 40% of all of these

4810
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:35,040
pixels but it means you need to

4811
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:37,040
rewrite kind of this interface of all of that

4812
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:39,040
and I could tell that wore on him a little

4813
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,040
bit but in the end it was

4814
03:02:41,040 --> 03:02:43,040
the right thing to do where we wound up

4815
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:45,040
changing that rasterization approach

4816
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:47,040
and we wound up with a super optimized

4817
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:49,040
assembly language

4818
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:51,040
core loop and then a good

4819
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:53,040
system around it which minimized how much that had

4820
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:55,040
to be called. And so in order

4821
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:57,040
to be able to do this kind of system level

4822
03:02:57,040 --> 03:02:59,040
thinking whether we're talking about

4823
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:01,040
game development

4824
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:03,040
aerospace

4825
03:03:03,040 --> 03:03:05,040
nuclear energy

4826
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:07,040
AI

4827
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:09,040
VR you have to be able to understand

4828
03:03:09,040 --> 03:03:11,040
the hardware the low level

4829
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:13,040
software the high level

4830
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:15,040
software the design decisions

4831
03:03:15,040 --> 03:03:17,040
the whole thing the full stack

4832
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,040
of it. Yeah and that's where

4833
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,040
a lot of these things become possible

4834
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:23,040
when you're really when you're bringing the future

4835
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:25,040
forward I mean there's a pace that everything

4836
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,040
just kind of glides towards where we have a

4837
03:03:27,040 --> 03:03:29,040
lot of progress that's happening at such a

4838
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:31,040
different so many different ways you kind of slide

4839
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:33,040
towards progress just left to your own

4840
03:03:33,040 --> 03:03:35,040
programs just get faster for

4841
03:03:35,040 --> 03:03:37,040
a while it wasn't clear if they were going to get

4842
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:39,040
fatter more than they get quicker than they get

4843
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:41,040
faster and it cancels out but it is

4844
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,040
clear now in retrospect now programs just

4845
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:45,040
get faster and have gotten faster

4846
03:03:45,040 --> 03:03:47,040
for a long time but if you want

4847
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:49,040
to do something like back at that original

4848
03:03:49,040 --> 03:03:51,040
talking about

4849
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:53,040
scrolling games say what this needs to be

4850
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:55,040
five times faster well

4851
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:57,040
we can wait six years

4852
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:59,040
and just it'll naturally get that much

4853
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:01,040
faster at that time

4854
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:03,040
or you come up with some really clever way of

4855
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:05,040
doing it so there are those

4856
03:04:05,040 --> 03:04:07,040
opportunities like that in a whole bunch

4857
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:09,040
of different areas now

4858
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:11,040
most programmers don't need to be

4859
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:13,040
thinking about that there's not that many

4860
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:15,040
you know there's a lot of opportunities for

4861
03:04:15,040 --> 03:04:17,040
this but it's not everyone's work a day type

4862
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:19,040
stuff so everyone doesn't have to know

4863
03:04:19,040 --> 03:04:21,040
how all these things work they don't have

4864
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:23,040
to know how their compiler works

4865
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:25,040
how you know the processor chip manages

4866
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:27,040
cache eviction and all these

4867
03:04:27,040 --> 03:04:29,040
low-level things but

4868
03:04:29,040 --> 03:04:31,040
sometimes there are powerful opportunities

4869
03:04:31,040 --> 03:04:33,040
that you can look at and say

4870
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:35,040
we can bring the future

4871
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:37,040
five years faster

4872
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:39,040
you know we can do something that wouldn't it be

4873
03:04:39,040 --> 03:04:41,040
great if we could do this well we can do

4874
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:43,040
it today if we make a certain

4875
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:45,040
set of decisions and

4876
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:47,040
it is in some ways smoke and mirrors

4877
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:49,040
where you say it's like doom was

4878
03:04:49,040 --> 03:04:51,040
a lot of smoke and mirrors where people

4879
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:53,040
thought it was more capable than it actually was

4880
03:04:53,040 --> 03:04:55,040
but we picked the right

4881
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:57,040
smoke and mirrors to deploy in the game

4882
03:04:57,040 --> 03:04:59,040
where by doing this

4883
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:01,040
people will think that it's more general

4884
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:03,040
if we are going to amaze them with what they've got here

4885
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:05,040
and they won't notice

4886
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:07,040
that it doesn't do these other things

4887
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:09,040
so smart decision making

4888
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:11,040
at that point that's where that

4889
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:13,040
that kind of global

4890
03:05:13,040 --> 03:05:15,040
holistic top-down view

4891
03:05:15,040 --> 03:05:17,040
can work and

4892
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:19,040
I'm

4893
03:05:19,040 --> 03:05:21,040
really a strong believer that technology

4894
03:05:21,040 --> 03:05:23,040
should be

4895
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:25,040
sitting at that table having those discussions

4896
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:27,040
because you do have cases where you say well

4897
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:29,040
you want to be the Jonathan Ivy or whatever

4898
03:05:29,040 --> 03:05:31,040
where it's a pure design

4899
03:05:31,040 --> 03:05:33,040
solution

4900
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:35,040
and that's in some cases

4901
03:05:35,040 --> 03:05:37,040
now where you truly have almost infinite

4902
03:05:37,040 --> 03:05:39,040
resources like if you're trying to do

4903
03:05:39,040 --> 03:05:41,040
a scrolling game on the PC

4904
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:43,040
now you don't even have to talk to a technology

4905
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:45,040
person you can just have

4906
03:05:45,040 --> 03:05:47,040
any intern can make that go run

4907
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:49,040
as fast as it needs to there and it can be

4908
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:51,040
completely design based

4909
03:05:51,040 --> 03:05:53,040
but if you're trying to do something that's hard

4910
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:55,040
either that can't be done

4911
03:05:55,040 --> 03:05:57,040
for resources like VR on a mobile

4912
03:05:57,040 --> 03:05:59,040
chipset or that we don't even know

4913
03:05:59,040 --> 03:06:01,040
how to do yet like artificial general intelligence

4914
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:03,040
it's probably going to be a matter of

4915
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:05,040
coming at it from an angle

4916
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:07,040
like I mean for AGI we have some of

4917
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:09,040
like some of the Hutter principles

4918
03:06:09,040 --> 03:06:11,040
about how you can

4919
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:13,040
some of that there are theoretical ways

4920
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:15,040
you can say this is the optimal learning

4921
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:17,040
algorithm that can solve everything

4922
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:19,040
but it's completely impractical

4923
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:21,040
you just can't do that

4924
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:23,040
so clearly you have to make some

4925
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:25,040
concessions for general intelligence

4926
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:27,040
and nobody knows what the right ones are

4927
03:06:27,040 --> 03:06:29,040
yet so people are taking different

4928
03:06:29,040 --> 03:06:31,040
angles of attack I hope I've got something

4929
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:33,040
clever to come up with in that space

4930
03:06:33,040 --> 03:06:35,040
it's been surprising to me

4931
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:37,040
and I think perhaps it is

4932
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:39,040
a principle of progress

4933
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:41,040
that smoking mirrors somehow

4934
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:43,040
you build the future

4935
03:06:43,040 --> 03:06:45,040
you kind of

4936
03:06:45,040 --> 03:06:47,040
fake it till you make it

4937
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:49,040
and you almost always make it and I think

4938
03:06:49,040 --> 03:06:51,040
that's going to be the way we achieve AGI

4939
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:53,040
that's going to be the way we build

4940
03:06:53,040 --> 03:06:55,040
consciousness into our machines

4941
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:57,040
is there's

4942
03:06:57,040 --> 03:06:59,040
you know philosophers debate about

4943
03:06:59,040 --> 03:07:01,040
the Turing test is essentially about

4944
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:03,040
faking it till you make it

4945
03:07:03,040 --> 03:07:05,040
you start by faking it

4946
03:07:05,040 --> 03:07:07,040
and I think that always leads

4947
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:09,040
to making it

4948
03:07:09,040 --> 03:07:11,040
because if you look at history

4949
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:13,040
arguments when as soon as people start talking

4950
03:07:13,040 --> 03:07:15,040
about qualia and consciousness

4951
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:17,040
and Chinese rooms and things it's like

4952
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:19,040
I just check out I just don't think there's any value

4953
03:07:19,040 --> 03:07:21,040
in those conversations it's just like

4954
03:07:21,040 --> 03:07:23,040
go ahead tell me it's not going to work

4955
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,040
I'm going to do my best to try to make it work anyways

4956
03:07:25,040 --> 03:07:27,040
I don't know if you work with legged robots

4957
03:07:27,040 --> 03:07:29,040
there's a bunch of these

4958
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:31,040
they make

4959
03:07:31,040 --> 03:07:33,040
they sure as heck make me feel like they're conscious

4960
03:07:33,040 --> 03:07:35,040
in a certain

4961
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:37,040
way that's not here today

4962
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:39,040
but is

4963
03:07:39,040 --> 03:07:41,040
you could see the kernel

4964
03:07:41,040 --> 03:07:43,040
it's like

4965
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:45,040
the flame

4966
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:47,040
the beginnings of a flame

4967
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:49,040
we don't have line of sight but there's

4968
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:51,040
glimmerings of light in the distance

4969
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:53,040
for all of these things

4970
03:07:53,040 --> 03:07:55,040
I'm hearing murmuring in a distant room

4971
03:07:55,040 --> 03:07:57,040
well let me ask you a human question here

4972
03:07:57,040 --> 03:07:59,040
you've

4973
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:01,040
in the game design space

4974
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:03,040
you've done a lot of incredible work throughout

4975
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:05,040
but in terms of game design

4976
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:07,040
you've changed the world and there's a few people

4977
03:08:07,040 --> 03:08:09,040
around you that did the same

4978
03:08:09,040 --> 03:08:11,040
so famously there's some animosity

4979
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:13,040
there's much love

4980
03:08:13,040 --> 03:08:15,040
but there's some animosity between you

4981
03:08:15,040 --> 03:08:17,040
and John Romero

4982
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:19,040
what is at the core of that animosity

4983
03:08:19,040 --> 03:08:21,040
and human tension

4984
03:08:21,040 --> 03:08:23,040
so there really hasn't been

4985
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:25,040
I for a long time

4986
03:08:25,040 --> 03:08:27,040
and even at the beginning it's like yes

4987
03:08:27,040 --> 03:08:29,040
I did push Romero out of the company

4988
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:31,040
and

4989
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:33,040
this is one of the things that I look back

4990
03:08:33,040 --> 03:08:35,040
when I was filing my younger self

4991
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:37,040
some

4992
03:08:37,040 --> 03:08:39,040
advice about things

4993
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:41,040
the original

4994
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:43,040
founding kind of corporate structure

4995
03:08:43,040 --> 03:08:45,040
of id software

4996
03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:47,040
really led to a bunch of problems

4997
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:49,040
we started off with us as equal partners

4998
03:08:49,040 --> 03:08:51,040
and we had a buy-sell agreement

4999
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,040
because we didn't want outsiders to be telling us

5000
03:08:53,040 --> 03:08:55,040
what to do inside the company

5001
03:08:55,040 --> 03:08:57,040
and that did lead to

5002
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:59,040
a bunch of the problems where I was sitting here

5003
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:01,040
going

5004
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:03,040
I'm working harder than anyone

5005
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:05,040
I'm doing these technologies

5006
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:07,040
nobody's done before

5007
03:09:07,040 --> 03:09:09,040
but we're all equal partners

5008
03:09:09,040 --> 03:09:11,040
and then I see somebody that's

5009
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:13,040
not working as hard

5010
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:15,040
and it's

5011
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:17,040
I can't say I was the most mature about that

5012
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:19,040
I was 20-something years old

5013
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:21,040
and it did

5014
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:23,040
bother me when I'm like everybody

5015
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:25,040
okay we need all pulled together

5016
03:09:25,040 --> 03:09:27,040
and we've done it before everybody

5017
03:09:27,040 --> 03:09:29,040
we know we can do this if we get together

5018
03:09:29,040 --> 03:09:31,040
but not everybody wanted to do that

5019
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:33,040
for all time

5020
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:35,040
and I was the youngest one of the crowd

5021
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:37,040
there I had different

5022
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:39,040
sets of kind of backgrounds

5023
03:09:39,040 --> 03:09:41,040
and motivations and left

5024
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:43,040
at that point where

5025
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:45,040
it was

5026
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:47,040
everybody has to be contributing

5027
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:49,040
up to this level or

5028
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:51,040
they need to get pushed out

5029
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:53,040
that was not a great

5030
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:55,040
situation and I look back on it

5031
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:57,040
and no

5032
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:59,040
I pushed people out of the company

5033
03:09:59,040 --> 03:10:01,040
that could have contributed

5034
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:03,040
if there was a different framework for them

5035
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:05,040
and the modern kind of Silicon Valley

5036
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:07,040
let your stock vest over a time period

5037
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:09,040
and maybe it's non-voting stock

5038
03:10:09,040 --> 03:10:11,040
and all those different things

5039
03:10:11,040 --> 03:10:13,040
we knew nothing about any of that

5040
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:15,040
we didn't know what we were doing

5041
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:17,040
in terms of corporate structure

5042
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:19,040
so if you think the framework was different

5043
03:10:19,040 --> 03:10:21,040
some of the human tension

5044
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:23,040
it almost certainly would have

5045
03:10:23,040 --> 03:10:25,040
I look back at that

5046
03:10:25,040 --> 03:10:27,040
and it's like even trying to summon up

5047
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:29,040
in my mind it's like I know

5048
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:31,040
I was really really angry

5049
03:10:31,040 --> 03:10:33,040
about I am

5050
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:35,040
Romero not working as hard as I wanted him

5051
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:37,040
to work or not carrying

5052
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:39,040
his load on the design for Quake

5053
03:10:39,040 --> 03:10:41,040
and coming up with things there

5054
03:10:41,040 --> 03:10:43,040
but he was definitely doing things

5055
03:10:43,040 --> 03:10:45,040
he made some of the best levels there

5056
03:10:45,040 --> 03:10:47,040
he was working with our

5057
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:49,040
external teams like Raven on the licensing

5058
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:51,040
side of things

5059
03:10:51,040 --> 03:10:53,040
but there were differences

5060
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:55,040
of opinion about it

5061
03:10:55,040 --> 03:10:57,040
but he landed right on his feet

5062
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:59,040
he got 20 million dollars

5063
03:10:59,040 --> 03:11:01,040
from Eidos to go do Ion Storm

5064
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:03,040
and he got to do things his way

5065
03:11:03,040 --> 03:11:05,040
and spun up three teams simultaneously

5066
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:07,040
because that was always one of the

5067
03:11:07,040 --> 03:11:09,040
challenging things in it

5068
03:11:09,040 --> 03:11:11,040
where we were doing these single string

5069
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:13,040
one project after another

5070
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:15,040
and I think some of them

5071
03:11:15,040 --> 03:11:17,040
wanted to grow the company more

5072
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:19,040
and I didn't because I knew people

5073
03:11:19,040 --> 03:11:21,040
that were saying that oh companies turned to shit

5074
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:23,040
they were like the employees

5075
03:11:23,040 --> 03:11:25,040
it's just a different world there

5076
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:27,040
and I loved our little dozen people

5077
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:29,040
working on the projects

5078
03:11:29,040 --> 03:11:31,040
but you can look at it and say

5079
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:33,040
well business realities matter

5080
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:35,040
it's like you're super successful here

5081
03:11:35,040 --> 03:11:37,040
and we could take a swing and a miss

5082
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:39,040
on something but you do it a couple times

5083
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:41,040
and you're out of luck

5084
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:43,040
there's a reason companies try to have

5085
03:11:43,040 --> 03:11:45,040
multiple teams running at one time

5086
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:47,040
I am

5087
03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:49,040
and so I was doing something I didn't

5088
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:51,040
so if you look past all that

5089
03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:53,040
you did create some amazing things together

5090
03:11:53,040 --> 03:11:55,040
what did you love about John Romero

5091
03:11:55,040 --> 03:11:57,040
what did you respect and appreciate about him

5092
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:59,040
what did you admire about him

5093
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:01,040
what did you learn from him

5094
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:03,040
when I met him he was the coolest programmer I had ever met

5095
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:05,040
he had done all of this stuff

5096
03:12:05,040 --> 03:12:07,040
he had made all of these games

5097
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:09,040
he had worked at

5098
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:11,040
one of the companies that I thought was the coolest

5099
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:13,040
at Origin Systems

5100
03:12:13,040 --> 03:12:15,040
and he knew all this stuff

5101
03:12:15,040 --> 03:12:17,040
he made things happen fast

5102
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,040
he was also kind of a polymath about this

5103
03:12:19,040 --> 03:12:21,040
where he could do, he made his own

5104
03:12:21,040 --> 03:12:23,040
he drew his own art, he made his own levels

5105
03:12:23,040 --> 03:12:25,040
as well as

5106
03:12:25,040 --> 03:12:27,040
we worked on sound design systems

5107
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:29,040
on top of actually being a really good programmer

5108
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,040
and we had

5109
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,040
we went through a little

5110
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:35,040
it was kind of fun where one of the early things that we did

5111
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:37,040
where there was kind of the young buck bit

5112
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:39,040
going in where I was

5113
03:12:39,040 --> 03:12:41,040
the new guy and he was the

5114
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:43,040
he was the top man programmer

5115
03:12:43,040 --> 03:12:45,040
at the soft disk area

5116
03:12:45,040 --> 03:12:47,040
eventually we had sort of a challenge over the weekend

5117
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:49,040
that we were going to like race to

5118
03:12:49,040 --> 03:12:51,040
implement this game to port one of our PC games

5119
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:53,040
back down to the Apple too

5120
03:12:53,040 --> 03:12:55,040
and that was where we finally kind of became clear

5121
03:12:55,040 --> 03:12:57,040
it's like, okay, Carmack stands

5122
03:12:57,040 --> 03:12:59,040
a little bit apart on the programming side of things

5123
03:12:59,040 --> 03:13:01,040
but Romero then

5124
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:03,040
very gracefully moved into

5125
03:13:03,040 --> 03:13:05,040
well, he'll work on the tools

5126
03:13:05,040 --> 03:13:07,040
he'll work on the systems

5127
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:09,040
do some of the game design stuff as well as

5128
03:13:09,040 --> 03:13:11,040
contributing on starting to lead the design

5129
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:13,040
aspects of a lot of things

5130
03:13:13,040 --> 03:13:15,040
so he was

5131
03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:17,040
enormously valuable in the early stuff

5132
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:19,040
and so much of Doom and even Quake

5133
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:21,040
have his stamp on it in a lot of ways

5134
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:23,040
but

5135
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:25,040
he wasn't at the same level of

5136
03:13:25,040 --> 03:13:27,040
focus that I brought to

5137
03:13:27,040 --> 03:13:29,040
the work that we were doing there

5138
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:31,040
and he really did

5139
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:33,040
we hit such a degree of success

5140
03:13:33,040 --> 03:13:35,040
it was all in the

5141
03:13:35,040 --> 03:13:37,040
press about that, the Rockstar game

5142
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:39,040
programmers

5143
03:13:39,040 --> 03:13:41,040
I mean it's the Beatles problem

5144
03:13:41,040 --> 03:13:43,040
he aided up and he did personify

5145
03:13:43,040 --> 03:13:45,040
there was the whole game developers

5146
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:47,040
with Ferraris

5147
03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:49,040
that we had there

5148
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:51,040
and I thought that led to

5149
03:13:51,040 --> 03:13:53,040
some challenges there

5150
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:55,040
but so much of

5151
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:57,040
the stuff that

5152
03:13:57,040 --> 03:13:59,040
was great in the games did come from him

5153
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:01,040
and I would certainly not take that away

5154
03:14:01,040 --> 03:14:03,040
from him and even after

5155
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:05,040
we parted ways and he took his swing

5156
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:07,040
with Eidos

5157
03:14:07,040 --> 03:14:09,040
in some ways he was ahead of the curve

5158
03:14:09,040 --> 03:14:11,040
with mobile gaming as well

5159
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:13,040
where one of his companies after

5160
03:14:13,040 --> 03:14:15,040
Eidos was working on

5161
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:17,040
feature phone game development

5162
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:19,040
and I wound up doing some of that

5163
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:21,040
just before the iPhone crossing

5164
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:23,040
over into the iPhone phase there

5165
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:25,040
and that was something that clearly

5166
03:14:25,040 --> 03:14:27,040
did turn out to be a huge thing although

5167
03:14:27,040 --> 03:14:29,040
he was too early for

5168
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:31,040
what he was working on at that time

5169
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:33,040
you know we've had

5170
03:14:33,040 --> 03:14:35,040
pretty cordial relationships where I was happy

5171
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:37,040
to talk with him anytime I'd run into him

5172
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:39,040
at a conference I haven't actually had

5173
03:14:39,040 --> 03:14:41,040
some other people just say it's like

5174
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:43,040
you shouldn't go over there

5175
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,040
and give him the time of day

5176
03:14:45,040 --> 03:14:47,040
or felt that Masters of Doom

5177
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:49,040
was I

5178
03:14:49,040 --> 03:14:51,040
played things up in a way

5179
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:53,040
that I shouldn't be too happy with

5180
03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:55,040
but I'm okay with all of that

5181
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:57,040
he's still got love in your heart

5182
03:14:57,040 --> 03:14:59,040
I just talked with him like

5183
03:14:59,040 --> 03:15:01,040
last year I guess it was even this year

5184
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:03,040
about mentioning that I'm going off doing this

5185
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:05,040
AI stuff I'm going big

5186
03:15:05,040 --> 03:15:07,040
into artificial intelligence and

5187
03:15:07,040 --> 03:15:09,040
he had a bunch of ideas for

5188
03:15:09,040 --> 03:15:11,040
how AI is going to play into gaming

5189
03:15:11,040 --> 03:15:13,040
and you know asked if I was interested in collaborating

5190
03:15:13,040 --> 03:15:15,040
and it's not in line with what

5191
03:15:15,040 --> 03:15:17,040
with what I'm doing but I do

5192
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,040
you know I wish almost everyone

5193
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:21,040
the best I mean I know I may

5194
03:15:21,040 --> 03:15:23,040
not have parted on the best of terms with

5195
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:25,040
I you know with some people but

5196
03:15:25,040 --> 03:15:27,040
I was thrilled to see Tom Hall

5197
03:15:27,040 --> 03:15:29,040
I'm writing VR games now

5198
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:31,040
we wrote working on a game called Demio

5199
03:15:31,040 --> 03:15:33,040
which is really an awesome

5200
03:15:33,040 --> 03:15:35,040
VR game it's like Dungeons and Dragons

5201
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:37,040
we all used to play Dungeons and Dragons together

5202
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:39,040
that was one of the things that was what we did on Sundays

5203
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:41,040
in the early days I would

5204
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:43,040
Dungeon Master and they'd all play and

5205
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:45,040
I you know so it really made me smile

5206
03:15:45,040 --> 03:15:47,040
seeing Tom involved with an RPG game

5207
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:49,040
in virtual reality

5208
03:15:49,040 --> 03:15:51,040
you were the CTO

5209
03:15:51,040 --> 03:15:53,040
of Oculus VR since

5210
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:55,040
2013 and maybe

5211
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:57,040
less than a year involved in a bit

5212
03:15:57,040 --> 03:15:59,040
in 2019

5213
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:01,040
Oculus was acquired

5214
03:16:01,040 --> 03:16:03,040
by Facebook now meta in

5215
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:05,040
2014

5216
03:16:05,040 --> 03:16:07,040
you've spoken brilliantly about both the low level

5217
03:16:07,040 --> 03:16:09,040
details the experimental design

5218
03:16:09,040 --> 03:16:11,040
and the big picture vision of virtual reality

5219
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:13,040
let me ask you about

5220
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:15,040
the metaverse the big question here

5221
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:17,040
both philosophically and technically

5222
03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:19,040
how hard is it to

5223
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:21,040
build the metaverse what is the metaverse

5224
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:23,040
in your view you started

5225
03:16:23,040 --> 03:16:25,040
with discussing and thinking about Quake

5226
03:16:25,040 --> 03:16:27,040
as a kind of metaverse

5227
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:29,040
as you think about it today

5228
03:16:29,040 --> 03:16:31,040
what is the metaverse

5229
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:33,040
the thing that could create this

5230
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:35,040
compelling user value this experience

5231
03:16:35,040 --> 03:16:37,040
that will change the world

5232
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:39,040
and how hard is it to build it

5233
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:41,040
so the term comes from Neil Stevenson's

5234
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:43,040
book Snow Crash which many

5235
03:16:43,040 --> 03:16:45,040
of us had read back in the 90s

5236
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:47,040
it was one of those kind of formative books

5237
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:49,040
and there was this

5238
03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:51,040
sense that the

5239
03:16:51,040 --> 03:16:53,040
the possibilities

5240
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:55,040
and kind of the freedom and

5241
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:57,040
unlimited capabilities to build a virtual

5242
03:16:57,040 --> 03:16:59,040
world that that does whatever

5243
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:01,040
you want whatever you ask of it

5244
03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:03,040
has been a powerful draw for generations

5245
03:17:03,040 --> 03:17:05,040
of developers you know game developers

5246
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:07,040
specifically and people that are thinking

5247
03:17:07,040 --> 03:17:09,040
about more more general purpose

5248
03:17:09,040 --> 03:17:11,040
applications so we were

5249
03:17:11,040 --> 03:17:13,040
talking about that back in the doom

5250
03:17:13,040 --> 03:17:15,040
and quake days about how do you wind

5251
03:17:15,040 --> 03:17:17,040
up with an interconnected set of worlds

5252
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:19,040
that you kind of visit from one to another

5253
03:17:19,040 --> 03:17:21,040
and as web pages were becoming

5254
03:17:21,040 --> 03:17:23,040
a thing you start thinking about how

5255
03:17:23,040 --> 03:17:25,040
what is the interactive

5256
03:17:25,040 --> 03:17:27,040
kind of 3D based equivalent of this

5257
03:17:27,040 --> 03:17:29,040
and there were a lot of really

5258
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:31,040
bad takes you had like

5259
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:33,040
vermal then virtual reality

5260
03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:35,040
markup languages and there's

5261
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:37,040
aspects like that that

5262
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:39,040
that came from people saying well what

5263
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:41,040
what kind of capabilities should we develop

5264
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:43,040
to to enable this

5265
03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:45,040
and that kind of capability first

5266
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:47,040
work has usually not panned

5267
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,040
out very well

5268
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:51,040
on the other hand we have successful

5269
03:17:51,040 --> 03:17:53,040
games that started with things like doom

5270
03:17:53,040 --> 03:17:55,040
and quake and communities that formed

5271
03:17:55,040 --> 03:17:57,040
around those and whether

5272
03:17:57,040 --> 03:17:59,040
it was server lists in the early days

5273
03:17:59,040 --> 03:18:01,040
or literal portaling between different

5274
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:03,040
games and then modern

5275
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:05,040
things that are on completely different

5276
03:18:05,040 --> 03:18:07,040
order of magnitude like Minecraft and

5277
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:09,040
Fortnite that have 100 million

5278
03:18:09,040 --> 03:18:11,040
plus users

5279
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:13,040
you know I still think that

5280
03:18:13,040 --> 03:18:15,040
that's the right way to go to build the

5281
03:18:15,040 --> 03:18:17,040
metaverse is you build something

5282
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:19,040
that's amazing that people love and people

5283
03:18:19,040 --> 03:18:21,040
wind up spending all their time in

5284
03:18:21,040 --> 03:18:23,040
because it's awesome and you expand the

5285
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:25,040
capabilities of that

5286
03:18:25,040 --> 03:18:27,040
even if it's a very basic experience

5287
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:29,040
Minecraft

5288
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:31,040
is an amazing case study in so many

5289
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:33,040
things where what's been able

5290
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:35,040
to be done with that is

5291
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:37,040
really enlightening

5292
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:39,040
and there are other cases where

5293
03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:41,040
like right now Roblox is

5294
03:18:41,040 --> 03:18:43,040
basically a game construction kit aimed at

5295
03:18:43,040 --> 03:18:45,040
kids and that was capability first play

5296
03:18:45,040 --> 03:18:47,040
and it's achieving scale that's on

5297
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:49,040
the same order of those things

5298
03:18:49,040 --> 03:18:51,040
so it's not impossible

5299
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:53,040
but my preferred bet would be

5300
03:18:53,040 --> 03:18:55,040
you make something amazing that people love

5301
03:18:55,040 --> 03:18:57,040
and you make it better and better

5302
03:18:57,040 --> 03:18:59,040
and that's where I could say we could

5303
03:18:59,040 --> 03:19:01,040
have gone back and followed a path kind of

5304
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:03,040
like that in the early days

5305
03:19:03,040 --> 03:19:05,040
if you just kind of take the same game

5306
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:07,040
whether it's when Activision demonstrated

5307
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:09,040
that you could make Call of Duty every year

5308
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:11,040
and not only is it not bad

5309
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:13,040
people kind of love it and it's

5310
03:19:13,040 --> 03:19:15,040
very profitable the idea

5311
03:19:15,040 --> 03:19:17,040
that you could have taken something like that

5312
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:19,040
and take a great game

5313
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:21,040
release a new version every year that

5314
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:23,040
lets the capabilities grow and expand

5315
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:25,040
to start saying it's like okay it's a game

5316
03:19:25,040 --> 03:19:27,040
about running around and shooting things

5317
03:19:27,040 --> 03:19:29,040
but now you can have

5318
03:19:29,040 --> 03:19:31,040
bring your media into it

5319
03:19:31,040 --> 03:19:33,040
you can add persistence of

5320
03:19:33,040 --> 03:19:35,040
social sense signs of life

5321
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:37,040
or whatever you want to add to it

5322
03:19:37,040 --> 03:19:39,040
I still think that's

5323
03:19:39,040 --> 03:19:41,040
you know quite a good

5324
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:43,040
position to take and I think that

5325
03:19:43,040 --> 03:19:45,040
while Meta is doing a

5326
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:47,040
comes up capability approach with

5327
03:19:47,040 --> 03:19:49,040
Horizon Worlds where

5328
03:19:49,040 --> 03:19:51,040
it's a fairly general purpose

5329
03:19:51,040 --> 03:19:53,040
creators can build whatever they want

5330
03:19:53,040 --> 03:19:55,040
in their sort of thing

5331
03:19:55,040 --> 03:19:57,040
you know it's hard to

5332
03:19:57,040 --> 03:19:59,040
compare and compete with something like Fortnight

5333
03:19:59,040 --> 03:20:01,040
which also has enormous amounts

5334
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:03,040
of creativity even though it was not

5335
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:05,040
designed originally as a general purpose

5336
03:20:05,040 --> 03:20:07,040
sort of thing so there's

5337
03:20:07,040 --> 03:20:09,040
we have examples on both sides

5338
03:20:09,040 --> 03:20:11,040
me personally I would have bet on

5339
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:13,040
I'm trying to do

5340
03:20:13,040 --> 03:20:15,040
an achievement valuable destination

5341
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:17,040
first and expanding from there

5342
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:19,040
so

5343
03:20:19,040 --> 03:20:21,040
can you imagine the thing that

5344
03:20:21,040 --> 03:20:23,040
will be kind of if we

5345
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:25,040
look back a couple centuries from now

5346
03:20:25,040 --> 03:20:27,040
and you think about

5347
03:20:27,040 --> 03:20:29,040
the experiences

5348
03:20:29,040 --> 03:20:31,040
that marked the singularity

5349
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:33,040
the transition

5350
03:20:33,040 --> 03:20:35,040
where most of our

5351
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:37,040
world moved into virtual reality

5352
03:20:37,040 --> 03:20:39,040
what do you think those experiences

5353
03:20:39,040 --> 03:20:41,040
will look like

5354
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:43,040
do you think it's going to be kind of like the way the web

5355
03:20:43,040 --> 03:20:45,040
slowly took over

5356
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:47,040
where you're the frog in the pot

5357
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:49,040
of water that's slowly heating up

5358
03:20:49,040 --> 03:20:51,040
where having lived through all of that

5359
03:20:51,040 --> 03:20:53,040
I remember when it was

5360
03:20:53,040 --> 03:20:55,040
shocking to start seeing the first

5361
03:20:55,040 --> 03:20:57,040
website address on a billboard

5362
03:20:57,040 --> 03:20:59,040
when you're like hey my computer world is

5363
03:20:59,040 --> 03:21:01,040
infecting the real world

5364
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:03,040
this is spreading out in some way

5365
03:21:03,040 --> 03:21:05,040
but there's still when you look back

5366
03:21:05,040 --> 03:21:07,040
and say well what made

5367
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:09,040
the web take off and

5368
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:11,040
it wasn't a big bang sort of

5369
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:13,040
moment there it was

5370
03:21:13,040 --> 03:21:15,040
a bunch of little things that turned out

5371
03:21:15,040 --> 03:21:17,040
not to even be the things that are relevant now

5372
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:19,040
that brought them into it

5373
03:21:19,040 --> 03:21:21,040
well I wonder from

5374
03:21:21,040 --> 03:21:23,040
like you said you're not a historian

5375
03:21:23,040 --> 03:21:25,040
so maybe there's a historian

5376
03:21:25,040 --> 03:21:27,040
out there that could

5377
03:21:27,040 --> 03:21:29,040
really identify that moment

5378
03:21:29,040 --> 03:21:31,040
data driven way

5379
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:33,040
it could be like MySpace or something like that

5380
03:21:33,040 --> 03:21:35,040
maybe the first major

5381
03:21:35,040 --> 03:21:37,040
social network that really reached

5382
03:21:37,040 --> 03:21:39,040
into

5383
03:21:39,040 --> 03:21:41,040
non-geek world

5384
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:43,040
or something like that

5385
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:45,040
I think that's kind of the fallacy of historians though

5386
03:21:45,040 --> 03:21:47,040
looking for some of those

5387
03:21:47,040 --> 03:21:49,040
kind of primary dominant causes

5388
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:51,040
where so many of these things are

5389
03:21:51,040 --> 03:21:53,040
like we see an exponential curve

5390
03:21:53,040 --> 03:21:55,040
but it's not because like one thing

5391
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:57,040
is going exponential it's because

5392
03:21:57,040 --> 03:21:59,040
we have hundreds of little sigmoid curves

5393
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:01,040
overlapped on top of each other

5394
03:22:01,040 --> 03:22:03,040
and they just happen to keep adding up

5395
03:22:03,040 --> 03:22:05,040
so that you've got something kind of going

5396
03:22:05,040 --> 03:22:07,040
to be exponential at any given point

5397
03:22:07,040 --> 03:22:09,040
but no single one of them

5398
03:22:09,040 --> 03:22:11,040
was the critical thing

5399
03:22:11,040 --> 03:22:13,040
there were dozens and dozens of things

5400
03:22:13,040 --> 03:22:15,040
I mean seeing the transitions of stuff

5401
03:22:15,040 --> 03:22:17,040
like as obviously MySpace giving way

5402
03:22:17,040 --> 03:22:19,040
to other things but even like blogging

5403
03:22:19,040 --> 03:22:21,040
giving way to social media

5404
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:23,040
and getting resurrected in other guys'

5405
03:22:23,040 --> 03:22:25,040
and things that happened there

5406
03:22:25,040 --> 03:22:27,040
dancing baby gift or whatever

5407
03:22:27,040 --> 03:22:29,040
all your base now belong to us

5408
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:31,040
whatever those early memes

5409
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:33,040
that led to the modern memes

5410
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:35,040
the humor on the different

5411
03:22:35,040 --> 03:22:37,040
evolution of humor on the internet

5412
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:39,040
that I'm sure the historians will also

5413
03:22:39,040 --> 03:22:41,040
write books about

5414
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:43,040
from the different website that support

5415
03:22:43,040 --> 03:22:45,040
to create the infrastructure for that humor

5416
03:22:45,040 --> 03:22:47,040
like Reddit and all that kind of stuff

5417
03:22:47,040 --> 03:22:49,040
so people will go back and they will name

5418
03:22:49,040 --> 03:22:51,040
firsts and critical moments but

5419
03:22:51,040 --> 03:22:53,040
it's probably going to be a poor approximation

5420
03:22:53,040 --> 03:22:55,040
of what actually happens

5421
03:22:55,040 --> 03:22:57,040
and we've already seen like in the VR

5422
03:22:57,040 --> 03:22:59,040
space where

5423
03:22:59,040 --> 03:23:01,040
it didn't play out the way we thought

5424
03:23:01,040 --> 03:23:03,040
in terms of what was going to be like

5425
03:23:03,040 --> 03:23:05,040
the modern era of VR basically

5426
03:23:05,040 --> 03:23:07,040
started with my E3 demo of Doom 3

5427
03:23:07,040 --> 03:23:09,040
on the Rift prototype so we're like

5428
03:23:09,040 --> 03:23:11,040
first person shooters in VR

5429
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:13,040
match made in heaven right

5430
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:15,040
and that didn't work out that way at all

5431
03:23:15,040 --> 03:23:17,040
they have you know they have the most

5432
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:19,040
comfort problems with it and then

5433
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:21,040
the most popular virtual reality app

5434
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:23,040
is Beat Saber which nobody

5435
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:25,040
predicted back then

5436
03:23:25,040 --> 03:23:27,040
what's that make you like

5437
03:23:27,040 --> 03:23:29,040
from the first principles if you were to

5438
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:31,040
reverse engineer that

5439
03:23:31,040 --> 03:23:33,040
why are these like

5440
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:35,040
silly fun games the most

5441
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:37,040
it actually makes very clear

5442
03:23:37,040 --> 03:23:39,040
sense when you when you analyze it

5443
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:41,040
from hindsight and look at the

5444
03:23:41,040 --> 03:23:43,040
engineering reasons where it's not

5445
03:23:43,040 --> 03:23:45,040
just that it was a magical quirky idea

5446
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:47,040
it was something that played

5447
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:49,040
almost perfectly to what turned out to be

5448
03:23:49,040 --> 03:23:51,040
the real strengths of VR where

5449
03:23:51,040 --> 03:23:53,040
the one thing that I really underestimated

5450
03:23:53,040 --> 03:23:55,040
importance in VR was the importance of

5451
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:57,040
the controllers you know I was still thinking

5452
03:23:57,040 --> 03:23:59,040
about what to do a lot more with

5453
03:23:59,040 --> 03:24:01,040
with the game pad and just the

5454
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:03,040
amazingness of taking any existing game

5455
03:24:03,040 --> 03:24:05,040
being able to move your head around

5456
03:24:05,040 --> 03:24:07,040
and look around that that was

5457
03:24:07,040 --> 03:24:09,040
you know that was really amazing but

5458
03:24:09,040 --> 03:24:11,040
the controllers were super important

5459
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:13,040
but the problem is so many things that you

5460
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:15,040
do with the controllers just

5461
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:17,040
suck it feels like it breaks the illusion

5462
03:24:17,040 --> 03:24:19,040
like trying to pick up glasses with the

5463
03:24:19,040 --> 03:24:21,040
controllers where you're like oh use the grip

5464
03:24:21,040 --> 03:24:23,040
button when you're kind of close and it'll

5465
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:25,040
snap into your hand all of those

5466
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:27,040
and you do them and it's still part of the VR

5467
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:29,040
experience but

5468
03:24:29,040 --> 03:24:31,040
Beat Saber winds up

5469
03:24:31,040 --> 03:24:33,040
playing only to the strengths it

5470
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:35,040
completely hides all the weaknesses of it

5471
03:24:35,040 --> 03:24:37,040
because you are holding something

5472
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:39,040
in your hand you keep a solid grip on it

5473
03:24:39,040 --> 03:24:41,040
the whole time it slices through things

5474
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:43,040
without ever bumping into things you

5475
03:24:43,040 --> 03:24:45,040
never get into the point where you know

5476
03:24:45,040 --> 03:24:47,040
I'm knocking on this table but in VR

5477
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:49,040
my hand just goes right through it so

5478
03:24:49,040 --> 03:24:51,040
you've got something that slices

5479
03:24:51,040 --> 03:24:53,040
through so it's never your brain

5480
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:55,040
oh I should have hit something you've got a

5481
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:57,040
lightsaber here it's just you expect it to

5482
03:24:57,040 --> 03:24:59,040
slice through everything

5483
03:24:59,040 --> 03:25:01,040
audio and music turned out to be

5484
03:25:01,040 --> 03:25:03,040
a really powerful aspect of virtual

5485
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:05,040
reality where you're blocking the world off

5486
03:25:05,040 --> 03:25:07,040
and constructing the world around you

5487
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:09,040
and

5488
03:25:09,040 --> 03:25:11,040
being something that can run efficiently on

5489
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:13,040
even this relatively low powered hardware

5490
03:25:13,040 --> 03:25:15,040
and can have

5491
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:17,040
a valuable loop in a small

5492
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:19,040
amount of time where a lot of modern games

5493
03:25:19,040 --> 03:25:21,040
you're supposed to sit down and play it for

5494
03:25:21,040 --> 03:25:23,040
an hour just to get anywhere sometimes a new

5495
03:25:23,040 --> 03:25:25,040
game takes an hour to get through the tutorial level

5496
03:25:25,040 --> 03:25:27,040
and that's not good for VR for

5497
03:25:27,040 --> 03:25:29,040
a couple reasons you do still have the comfort

5498
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:31,040
issues if you're moving around at all

5499
03:25:31,040 --> 03:25:33,040
but you've also got just

5500
03:25:33,040 --> 03:25:35,040
discomfort from the headset battery

5501
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:37,040
lifespan on the mobile versions

5502
03:25:37,040 --> 03:25:39,040
so having things that do break down

5503
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:41,040
into three and four minute

5504
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:43,040
windows of play that turns out to be very

5505
03:25:43,040 --> 03:25:45,040
valuable from a gameplay standpoint

5506
03:25:45,040 --> 03:25:47,040
so it winds up being

5507
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:49,040
kind of a perfect storm of all of these things

5508
03:25:49,040 --> 03:25:51,040
that are really good it doesn't have any

5509
03:25:51,040 --> 03:25:53,040
of the comfort problems you're not navigating

5510
03:25:53,040 --> 03:25:55,040
around you're standing still all the

5511
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:57,040
stuff flies at you it has

5512
03:25:57,040 --> 03:25:59,040
placed audio strengths

5513
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:01,040
it adds the whole fitness in

5514
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:03,040
VR nobody was thinking about that

5515
03:26:03,040 --> 03:26:05,040
back in the at the beginning and it turns

5516
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:07,040
out that that is an excellent

5517
03:26:07,040 --> 03:26:09,040
daily fitness thing to be doing

5518
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:11,040
if you go play an hour

5519
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:13,040
of beat saver or supernatural or something

5520
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:15,040
that is legit solid

5521
03:26:15,040 --> 03:26:17,040
exercise and it's

5522
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:19,040
more fun than doing it just about any other way

5523
03:26:19,040 --> 03:26:21,040
there so that's kind of the

5524
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:23,040
arcade stage of things

5525
03:26:23,040 --> 03:26:25,040
if I were to say with my

5526
03:26:25,040 --> 03:26:27,040
experience with VR

5527
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:29,040
the thing that I think is powerful is

5528
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:31,040
the

5529
03:26:31,040 --> 03:26:33,040
maybe it's not here yet

5530
03:26:33,040 --> 03:26:35,040
but the degree to which it is immersive

5531
03:26:35,040 --> 03:26:37,040
in the way

5532
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:39,040
that quake is immersive it takes you to

5533
03:26:39,040 --> 03:26:41,040
another world for me

5534
03:26:41,040 --> 03:26:43,040
because I'm a fan of role-playing games

5535
03:26:43,040 --> 03:26:45,040
the

5536
03:26:45,040 --> 03:26:47,040
Elder Scrolls series

5537
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:49,040
like Skyrim

5538
03:26:49,040 --> 03:26:51,040
or even Daggerfall it just takes

5539
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:53,040
you to another world and when you're

5540
03:26:53,040 --> 03:26:55,040
not in that world you miss not being

5541
03:26:55,040 --> 03:26:57,040
there and then you just

5542
03:26:57,040 --> 03:26:59,040
you kind of want to stay there forever

5543
03:26:59,040 --> 03:27:01,040
because life is shitty

5544
03:27:01,040 --> 03:27:03,040
and you just want to go to this

5545
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:05,040
place is that

5546
03:27:05,040 --> 03:27:07,040
I there was a

5547
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:09,040
time when I we were

5548
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:11,040
kind of asked to come up with like what's your view

5549
03:27:11,040 --> 03:27:13,040
about VR and

5550
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:15,040
you know my pitch was that it should

5551
03:27:15,040 --> 03:27:17,040
be better inside the headset than outside

5552
03:27:17,040 --> 03:27:19,040
it's the world as you want it

5553
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:21,040
and everybody thought that was dystopian

5554
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:23,040
and like that's like

5555
03:27:23,040 --> 03:27:25,040
oh you're just going to forget about the world outside

5556
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:27,040
and I don't

5557
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:29,040
get that mindset where the

5558
03:27:29,040 --> 03:27:31,040
idea that if you can make the world

5559
03:27:31,040 --> 03:27:33,040
better inside the headset than

5560
03:27:33,040 --> 03:27:35,040
outside you've just improved

5561
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:37,040
the person's life that has a headset

5562
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:39,040
that can wear it and

5563
03:27:39,040 --> 03:27:41,040
there are plenty of things that we just can't do

5564
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:43,040
for everyone in the real world everybody can't

5565
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:45,040
have Richard Branson's private island

5566
03:27:45,040 --> 03:27:47,040
but everyone can have a private VR island

5567
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:49,040
and it can have the things that they want on it

5568
03:27:49,040 --> 03:27:51,040
and there's a lot of these kind of rival

5569
03:27:51,040 --> 03:27:53,040
risk goods in the real world

5570
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:55,040
that VR can just be better

5571
03:27:55,040 --> 03:27:57,040
at we can do a lot of

5572
03:27:57,040 --> 03:27:59,040
things like that that can be very very rich

5573
03:27:59,040 --> 03:28:01,040
so yeah I want the

5574
03:28:01,040 --> 03:28:03,040
I think it's going to be a positive thing this world where

5575
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:05,040
people want to go back into their headset

5576
03:28:05,040 --> 03:28:07,040
where it can be better than

5577
03:28:07,040 --> 03:28:09,040
somebody that's living in a tiny apartment

5578
03:28:09,040 --> 03:28:11,040
can have a palatial estate

5579
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:13,040
in virtual reality that can have all their friends

5580
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:15,040
from all over the world come over

5581
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:17,040
and visit them without everybody getting on a plane

5582
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:19,040
and meeting in some

5583
03:28:19,040 --> 03:28:21,040
place and dealing with all the other logistics hassles

5584
03:28:21,040 --> 03:28:23,040
there is real value

5585
03:28:23,040 --> 03:28:25,040
in the presence that

5586
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:27,040
you can get for remote meetings

5587
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:29,040
it's all the little things

5588
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:31,040
that we need to sort out but those are things

5589
03:28:31,040 --> 03:28:33,040
that we have line of sight on

5590
03:28:33,040 --> 03:28:35,040
people that have been in

5591
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:37,040
a good VR meeting using work rooms

5592
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:39,040
where you can say oh that was better

5593
03:28:39,040 --> 03:28:41,040
than a zoom meeting but of course

5594
03:28:41,040 --> 03:28:43,040
it's more of a hassle to get into it

5595
03:28:43,040 --> 03:28:45,040
not everyone has a headset interoperability

5596
03:28:45,040 --> 03:28:47,040
is worse you can't have

5597
03:28:47,040 --> 03:28:49,040
you cap out at a certain number there's all

5598
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:51,040
these things that need to be fixed but that's

5599
03:28:51,040 --> 03:28:53,040
one of those things you can look at and say we know

5600
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:55,040
there's value there we just need to

5601
03:28:55,040 --> 03:28:57,040
really grind hard file off all

5602
03:28:57,040 --> 03:28:59,040
the rough edges and make that possible

5603
03:28:59,040 --> 03:29:01,040
so you do think we have line of sight

5604
03:29:01,040 --> 03:29:03,040
because

5605
03:29:03,040 --> 03:29:05,040
there's a

5606
03:29:05,040 --> 03:29:07,040
reason like

5607
03:29:07,040 --> 03:29:09,040
I do this podcast in person for example

5608
03:29:11,040 --> 03:29:13,040
doing it remotely it's

5609
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:15,040
not the same and if you're somebody

5610
03:29:15,040 --> 03:29:17,040
were to ask me why it's not the same I

5611
03:29:17,040 --> 03:29:19,040
wouldn't be able to write down exactly why

5612
03:29:19,040 --> 03:29:21,040
but you're

5613
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:23,040
saying that it's possible

5614
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:25,040
whatever the magic is for in person

5615
03:29:25,040 --> 03:29:27,040
interaction

5616
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:29,040
that immersiveness of the experience

5617
03:29:29,040 --> 03:29:31,040
we are

5618
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:33,040
almost there yes so

5619
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:35,040
the idea of like I

5620
03:29:35,040 --> 03:29:37,040
doing a VR interview with

5621
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:39,040
someone I'm not saying it's here right

5622
03:29:39,040 --> 03:29:41,040
now but you can see

5623
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:43,040
glimmers of what it should be and

5624
03:29:43,040 --> 03:29:45,040
we largely know what would need

5625
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:47,040
to be fixed and improved

5626
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:49,040
to like you say there's a difference between

5627
03:29:49,040 --> 03:29:51,040
at remote interview doing a

5628
03:29:51,040 --> 03:29:53,040
podcast over zoom or something and face

5629
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:55,040
to face there's that sense of

5630
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:57,040
presence that immediacy the super

5631
03:29:57,040 --> 03:29:59,040
low latency responsiveness

5632
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:01,040
being able to see all the subtle things there

5633
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:03,040
just occupying the same field

5634
03:30:03,040 --> 03:30:05,040
of view and all of those are things that

5635
03:30:05,040 --> 03:30:07,040
we absolutely can do in

5636
03:30:07,040 --> 03:30:09,040
VR and that simple case

5637
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:11,040
of a small meeting with a couple

5638
03:30:11,040 --> 03:30:13,040
people that's the much easier case

5639
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:15,040
than everybody thinks the ready player one multiverse

5640
03:30:15,040 --> 03:30:17,040
with a thousand people going across

5641
03:30:17,040 --> 03:30:19,040
that you know a huge bridge to amazing

5642
03:30:19,040 --> 03:30:21,040
places that's harder in a lot

5643
03:30:21,040 --> 03:30:23,040
of other technical ways not to say we

5644
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:25,040
can't also do that but that's further away

5645
03:30:25,040 --> 03:30:27,040
and has more challenges but this small

5646
03:30:27,040 --> 03:30:29,040
thing about being able to have a

5647
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:31,040
meeting with one or

5648
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:33,040
a few people and have it feel

5649
03:30:33,040 --> 03:30:35,040
real feel like you're there

5650
03:30:35,040 --> 03:30:37,040
I think you have the same interactions

5651
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:39,040
and talking with them you get subtle cues

5652
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:41,040
as we start getting eye and face tracking

5653
03:30:41,040 --> 03:30:43,040
and some of the other things on high end

5654
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:45,040
headsets a lot of that is

5655
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:47,040
going to come over and it

5656
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:49,040
doesn't have to be as good

5657
03:30:49,040 --> 03:30:51,040
this is an important thing that people miss

5658
03:30:51,040 --> 03:30:53,040
where there was a lot

5659
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:55,040
of people that especially rich

5660
03:30:55,040 --> 03:30:57,040
people that would look at VR and say

5661
03:30:57,040 --> 03:30:59,040
it's like oh this just isn't

5662
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:01,040
that good and I'd say it's like well

5663
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:03,040
you've already been court side

5664
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:05,040
backstage and you know on pit row

5665
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:07,040
and you've done all of these experiences

5666
03:31:07,040 --> 03:31:09,040
because you get to do them in real life

5667
03:31:09,040 --> 03:31:11,040
but most people don't get to and

5668
03:31:11,040 --> 03:31:13,040
even if the experience is only half as good

5669
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:15,040
if it's something that they never would have gotten

5670
03:31:15,040 --> 03:31:17,040
to do before it's still a very good

5671
03:31:17,040 --> 03:31:19,040
thing and as we can just we can

5672
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:21,040
push that number up over time

5673
03:31:21,040 --> 03:31:23,040
it has a minimum viable

5674
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:25,040
value level when it

5675
03:31:25,040 --> 03:31:27,040
does something that is valuable enough to people

5676
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:29,040
as long as it's better inside the headset

5677
03:31:29,040 --> 03:31:31,040
on any metric than it is outside

5678
03:31:31,040 --> 03:31:33,040
and people choose to go there we're on the

5679
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:35,040
right path and we have a value

5680
03:31:35,040 --> 03:31:37,040
gradient that I'm just always hammering

5681
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:39,040
on we can just follow this value gradient

5682
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:41,040
just keep making things better

5683
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:43,040
rather than going for that

5684
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:45,040
one close your eyes swing for the

5685
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:47,040
fences I kind of

5686
03:31:47,040 --> 03:31:49,040
silver bullet approach

5687
03:31:49,040 --> 03:31:51,040
I wonder if there's a value gradient for in-person

5688
03:31:51,040 --> 03:31:53,040
meetings because if you get that right

5689
03:31:53,040 --> 03:31:55,040
I mean that would change the world

5690
03:31:55,040 --> 03:31:57,040
it doesn't need to

5691
03:31:57,040 --> 03:31:59,040
I mean you don't need a ready player one

5692
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:01,040
but I wonder

5693
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:03,040
if there's that value gradient you can

5694
03:32:03,040 --> 03:32:05,040
follow along

5695
03:32:05,040 --> 03:32:07,040
because if there is

5696
03:32:07,040 --> 03:32:09,040
and you follow it then

5697
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:11,040
there'll be a certain like

5698
03:32:11,040 --> 03:32:13,040
phase shift at a certain point

5699
03:32:13,040 --> 03:32:15,040
where people will shift from

5700
03:32:15,040 --> 03:32:17,040
from zoom

5701
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:19,040
to this

5702
03:32:19,040 --> 03:32:21,040
I wonder

5703
03:32:21,040 --> 03:32:23,040
what are the bottlenecks

5704
03:32:23,040 --> 03:32:25,040
is it software is it hardware

5705
03:32:25,040 --> 03:32:27,040
like is it all about latency

5706
03:32:27,040 --> 03:32:29,040
so I have

5707
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:31,040
big arguments internally about

5708
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:33,040
strategic things like that where

5709
03:32:33,040 --> 03:32:35,040
I like the next headset

5710
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:37,040
that's coming out that

5711
03:32:37,040 --> 03:32:39,040
we've made various announcements about is going to be a

5712
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:41,040
higher-end headset more expensive

5713
03:32:41,040 --> 03:32:43,040
more features lots of people want to make

5714
03:32:43,040 --> 03:32:45,040
those trade-offs I

5715
03:32:45,040 --> 03:32:47,040
you know we'll see what the market has to say

5716
03:32:47,040 --> 03:32:49,040
about the exact trade-offs we've made

5717
03:32:49,040 --> 03:32:51,040
here but if you want to replace zoom

5718
03:32:51,040 --> 03:32:53,040
you need to have something that everybody

5719
03:32:53,040 --> 03:32:55,040
has

5720
03:32:55,040 --> 03:32:57,040
so you like cheaper

5721
03:32:57,040 --> 03:32:59,040
I like cheaper because also

5722
03:32:59,040 --> 03:33:01,040
lighter and cheaper wind up being

5723
03:33:01,040 --> 03:33:03,040
a virtuous cycle there

5724
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:05,040
where expensive and more

5725
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:07,040
features tends to also lead towards heavier

5726
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:09,040
and it just kind of goes it's like let's add more

5727
03:33:09,040 --> 03:33:11,040
features the features are not

5728
03:33:11,040 --> 03:33:13,040
you know they have physical

5729
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:15,040
presence and weight and draw from batteries

5730
03:33:15,040 --> 03:33:17,040
and all of those things so I've always

5731
03:33:17,040 --> 03:33:19,040
favored a lower-end

5732
03:33:19,040 --> 03:33:21,040
cheaper faster approach

5733
03:33:21,040 --> 03:33:23,040
that's why I was always behind the

5734
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:25,040
mobile side of VR rather than the higher-end

5735
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:27,040
PC headsets and I think that's

5736
03:33:27,040 --> 03:33:29,040
you know that's proven out well

5737
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:31,040
but there's I you always

5738
03:33:31,040 --> 03:33:33,040
ideally we have a whole range of things but

5739
03:33:33,040 --> 03:33:35,040
if you've only got one or two things

5740
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:37,040
it's important that those two things cover

5741
03:33:37,040 --> 03:33:39,040
the you know the scope that

5742
03:33:39,040 --> 03:33:41,040
you think is most important when we're in a

5743
03:33:41,040 --> 03:33:43,040
world when it's like cell phones and there's 50

5744
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:45,040
of them on the market covering every conceivable

5745
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:47,040
ecological niche you want

5746
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:49,040
that's going to be great but we're not going to be there

5747
03:33:49,040 --> 03:33:51,040
for a while. Where are the bottlenecks?

5748
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:53,040
Is it the hardware or the software?

5749
03:33:53,040 --> 03:33:55,040
Yeah so right now

5750
03:33:55,040 --> 03:33:57,040
you can play you can get

5751
03:33:57,040 --> 03:33:59,040
work rooms on Quest and

5752
03:33:59,040 --> 03:34:01,040
you can set up these things and it's a pretty

5753
03:34:01,040 --> 03:34:03,040
good experience it's surprisingly good. I haven't

5754
03:34:03,040 --> 03:34:05,040
tried it it's surprisingly good

5755
03:34:05,040 --> 03:34:07,040
yeah the voice latency is better

5756
03:34:07,040 --> 03:34:09,040
on that than a lot

5757
03:34:09,040 --> 03:34:11,040
better than a zoom meeting so you've got

5758
03:34:11,040 --> 03:34:13,040
a more a better sense of immediacy there

5759
03:34:13,040 --> 03:34:15,040
the expressions that you

5760
03:34:15,040 --> 03:34:17,040
get from the current hardware

5761
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:19,040
with just kind of your controllers

5762
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:21,040
and your head is pretty realistic

5763
03:34:21,040 --> 03:34:23,040
feeling you've got a pretty good sense of being

5764
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:25,040
there with someone. Are these like

5765
03:34:25,040 --> 03:34:27,040
avatars

5766
03:34:27,040 --> 03:34:29,040
of people? Do you get

5767
03:34:29,040 --> 03:34:31,040
to see their body and

5768
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:33,040
they're sitting around a table? Yeah

5769
03:34:33,040 --> 03:34:35,040
and it feels

5770
03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:37,040
better than zoom? Yeah better than you'd

5771
03:34:37,040 --> 03:34:39,040
expect for that it is definitely

5772
03:34:39,040 --> 03:34:41,040
yeah I'd say

5773
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:43,040
it's quite a bit better than zoom when everything

5774
03:34:43,040 --> 03:34:45,040
is working right but there's still

5775
03:34:45,040 --> 03:34:47,040
all the rough edges of the reason zoom

5776
03:34:47,040 --> 03:34:49,040
became so successful is because they just

5777
03:34:49,040 --> 03:34:51,040
nailed the usability of everything

5778
03:34:51,040 --> 03:34:53,040
it's high quality with a absolutely

5779
03:34:53,040 --> 03:34:55,040
first-rate experience

5780
03:34:55,040 --> 03:34:57,040
and we are not there yet with

5781
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:59,040
any of the VR stuff I'm trying to

5782
03:34:59,040 --> 03:35:01,040
to push hard to get

5783
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:03,040
I keep talking about it's like it needs to just

5784
03:35:03,040 --> 03:35:05,040
be one click to make everything happen

5785
03:35:05,040 --> 03:35:07,040
and we're getting there in our home

5786
03:35:07,040 --> 03:35:09,040
environment not the whole work rooms application

5787
03:35:09,040 --> 03:35:11,040
but the main home where you can now

5788
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:13,040
kind of go over and click and invite and

5789
03:35:13,040 --> 03:35:15,040
still winds up taking five times longer

5790
03:35:15,040 --> 03:35:17,040
than it should but we're getting

5791
03:35:17,040 --> 03:35:19,040
close to that where you click there

5792
03:35:19,040 --> 03:35:21,040
they click on their button and then

5793
03:35:21,040 --> 03:35:23,040
they're sitting there in this good presence

5794
03:35:23,040 --> 03:35:25,040
with you but latencies need

5795
03:35:25,040 --> 03:35:27,040
to get a lot better user interface needs

5796
03:35:27,040 --> 03:35:29,040
to get a lot better I'm

5797
03:35:29,040 --> 03:35:31,040
ubiquity of the headsets needs to get better

5798
03:35:31,040 --> 03:35:33,040
we need to have a hundred million of them

5799
03:35:33,040 --> 03:35:35,040
out there just so that everybody knows

5800
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:37,040
somebody that uses this all the time

5801
03:35:37,040 --> 03:35:39,040
well I think it's a virtual cycle because I do

5802
03:35:39,040 --> 03:35:41,040
think

5803
03:35:41,040 --> 03:35:43,040
the interface

5804
03:35:43,040 --> 03:35:45,040
is the thing that makes

5805
03:35:45,040 --> 03:35:47,040
or breaks this kind

5806
03:35:47,040 --> 03:35:49,040
of revolution it's so interesting how

5807
03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:51,040
like you said one click but it's also

5808
03:35:51,040 --> 03:35:53,040
like how you achieve that one click

5809
03:35:53,040 --> 03:35:55,040
I don't know what is

5810
03:35:57,040 --> 03:35:59,040
can I ask a dark question maybe let's

5811
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:01,040
keep it outside of meta but

5812
03:36:01,040 --> 03:36:03,040
this is about meta but also

5813
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:05,040
Google and big company

5814
03:36:05,040 --> 03:36:07,040
are they able to do this kind

5815
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:09,040
of thing it seems like

5816
03:36:09,040 --> 03:36:11,040
let me put on my cranky old

5817
03:36:11,040 --> 03:36:13,040
man hat is they

5818
03:36:13,040 --> 03:36:15,040
seem to not do a good

5819
03:36:15,040 --> 03:36:17,040
job of

5820
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:19,040
creating these user

5821
03:36:19,040 --> 03:36:21,040
friendly interfaces as they get

5822
03:36:21,040 --> 03:36:23,040
bigger and bigger as a company like

5823
03:36:23,040 --> 03:36:25,040
Google has created some of the greatest interfaces

5824
03:36:25,040 --> 03:36:27,040
ever

5825
03:36:27,040 --> 03:36:29,040
early on and it's I mean creating Gmail

5826
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:31,040
just so

5827
03:36:31,040 --> 03:36:33,040
many brilliant

5828
03:36:33,040 --> 03:36:35,040
interfaces and she seems to be getting

5829
03:36:35,040 --> 03:36:37,040
crappier and crappier at that

5830
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:39,040
same with meta same

5831
03:36:39,040 --> 03:36:41,040
with

5832
03:36:41,040 --> 03:36:43,040
Microsoft it's just it

5833
03:36:43,040 --> 03:36:45,040
seems to get worse and worse at that

5834
03:36:45,040 --> 03:36:47,040
I don't know what is it because you become

5835
03:36:47,040 --> 03:36:49,040
more conservative careful risk

5836
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:51,040
averse is that why

5837
03:36:51,040 --> 03:36:53,040
can you speak to that? So it's been really eye

5838
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:55,040
opening to me working inside a tech

5839
03:36:55,040 --> 03:36:57,040
Titan where I

5840
03:36:57,040 --> 03:36:59,040
you know I had my small

5841
03:36:59,040 --> 03:37:01,040
companies and then we're acquired by

5842
03:37:01,040 --> 03:37:03,040
a you know a midsize game publisher

5843
03:37:03,040 --> 03:37:05,040
and then

5844
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:07,040
Oculus getting acquired by meta

5845
03:37:07,040 --> 03:37:09,040
and meta has grown by a factor of many

5846
03:37:09,040 --> 03:37:11,040
just in the eight years

5847
03:37:11,040 --> 03:37:13,040
since the acquisition

5848
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:15,040
so I did not have

5849
03:37:15,040 --> 03:37:17,040
experience with this and it's

5850
03:37:17,040 --> 03:37:19,040
it was interesting because I remember

5851
03:37:19,040 --> 03:37:21,040
like previously my benchmark for

5852
03:37:21,040 --> 03:37:23,040
kind of use of resources

5853
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:25,040
was some of the government programs I interacted

5854
03:37:25,040 --> 03:37:27,040
with on the aerospace side

5855
03:37:27,040 --> 03:37:29,040
and I remember thinking there was

5856
03:37:29,040 --> 03:37:31,040
an Air Force program and they spent 50

5857
03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:33,040
million dollars and they didn't

5858
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:35,040
they didn't launch anything they didn't even build

5859
03:37:35,040 --> 03:37:37,040
anything it was just kind of like they

5860
03:37:37,040 --> 03:37:39,040
you know they made a bunch of papers

5861
03:37:39,040 --> 03:37:41,040
and had some parts in a warehouse

5862
03:37:41,040 --> 03:37:43,040
and nothing came of it it's like 50 million

5863
03:37:43,040 --> 03:37:45,040
dollars

5864
03:37:45,040 --> 03:37:47,040
and I have I've had to radically

5865
03:37:47,040 --> 03:37:49,040
recalibrate my sense of

5866
03:37:49,040 --> 03:37:51,040
like how much money can be spent with

5867
03:37:51,040 --> 03:37:53,040
without a product at the end resources

5868
03:37:53,040 --> 03:37:55,040
where

5869
03:37:55,040 --> 03:37:57,040
on the plus side VR

5870
03:37:57,040 --> 03:37:59,040
has turned out we've built

5871
03:37:59,040 --> 03:38:01,040
pretty much exactly

5872
03:38:01,040 --> 03:38:03,040
what you know we just passed

5873
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:05,040
the 10-year mark then from my I like

5874
03:38:05,040 --> 03:38:07,040
my first demo of the Rift

5875
03:38:07,040 --> 03:38:09,040
and if I could have said what I wanted

5876
03:38:09,040 --> 03:38:11,040
to have it would have been

5877
03:38:11,040 --> 03:38:13,040
a standalone inside out tracked

5878
03:38:13,040 --> 03:38:15,040
4k resolution headset

5879
03:38:15,040 --> 03:38:17,040
that I that could still plug into

5880
03:38:17,040 --> 03:38:19,040
a PC for high-end rendering and that's

5881
03:38:19,040 --> 03:38:21,040
exactly what we've got on Quest 2

5882
03:38:21,040 --> 03:38:23,040
first of all let's pause on that with me

5883
03:38:23,040 --> 03:38:25,040
being cranky and everything

5884
03:38:25,040 --> 03:38:27,040
it's what meta achieved

5885
03:38:27,040 --> 03:38:29,040
with Oculus and so on is incredible

5886
03:38:29,040 --> 03:38:31,040
I mean this is

5887
03:38:31,040 --> 03:38:33,040
this what when I thought

5888
03:38:33,040 --> 03:38:35,040
about the future of VR this is what I imagine

5889
03:38:35,040 --> 03:38:37,040
in terms of hardware I would say

5890
03:38:37,040 --> 03:38:39,040
and maybe in terms of the experience as well

5891
03:38:39,040 --> 03:38:41,040
but it's still not there somehow

5892
03:38:41,040 --> 03:38:43,040
on the one hand

5893
03:38:43,040 --> 03:38:45,040
we did kind of achieve it and win and we've got

5894
03:38:45,040 --> 03:38:47,040
we've sold you know we're a success

5895
03:38:47,040 --> 03:38:49,040
right now but

5896
03:38:49,040 --> 03:38:51,040
the amount of resources that have gone into

5897
03:38:51,040 --> 03:38:53,040
it it winds up getting cluttered up in

5898
03:38:53,040 --> 03:38:55,040
accounting where last mark

5899
03:38:55,040 --> 03:38:57,040
did announce that they spent

5900
03:38:57,040 --> 03:38:59,040
ten billion dollars a year like on

5901
03:38:59,040 --> 03:39:01,040
reality labs now reality labs

5902
03:39:01,040 --> 03:39:03,040
covers a lot it was VR

5903
03:39:03,040 --> 03:39:05,040
was not the large part of it also had

5904
03:39:05,040 --> 03:39:07,040
portal and spark and the big AR

5905
03:39:07,040 --> 03:39:09,040
research efforts and

5906
03:39:09,040 --> 03:39:11,040
it's been expanding out to include AI

5907
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:13,040
and other things there where

5908
03:39:13,040 --> 03:39:15,040
I there's a lot going on there

5909
03:39:15,040 --> 03:39:17,040
but ten billion

5910
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:19,040
dollars was just a number that I had

5911
03:39:19,040 --> 03:39:21,040
trouble processing it just

5912
03:39:21,040 --> 03:39:23,040
I feel sick to my stomach thinking about

5913
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:25,040
that much money being spent

5914
03:39:25,040 --> 03:39:27,040
but that's how they demonstrate commitment

5915
03:39:27,040 --> 03:39:29,040
to this where it's not

5916
03:39:29,040 --> 03:39:31,040
I'm more so than

5917
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:33,040
like yeah Google goes and cancels all of these

5918
03:39:33,040 --> 03:39:35,040
projects I had different things I

5919
03:39:35,040 --> 03:39:37,040
like that while meta is

5920
03:39:37,040 --> 03:39:39,040
really sticking with the funding of

5921
03:39:39,040 --> 03:39:41,040
VR and AR is still

5922
03:39:41,040 --> 03:39:43,040
further out with it so there's something to be said

5923
03:39:43,040 --> 03:39:45,040
for that I

5924
03:39:45,040 --> 03:39:47,040
it's not just going to vanish the works going in

5925
03:39:47,040 --> 03:39:49,040
I just wish it could be

5926
03:39:49,040 --> 03:39:51,040
those resources could be applied more

5927
03:39:51,040 --> 03:39:53,040
effectively because I see

5928
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:55,040
all these cases I point out these examples

5929
03:39:55,040 --> 03:39:57,040
of how a third party

5930
03:39:57,040 --> 03:39:59,040
that we're kind of competing with in various ways

5931
03:39:59,040 --> 03:40:01,040
there's a number of these examples and they

5932
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:03,040
do work with a tenth

5933
03:40:03,040 --> 03:40:05,040
of the people that we do internally

5934
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:07,040
and a lot of it comes from

5935
03:40:07,040 --> 03:40:09,040
yes there's the small company

5936
03:40:09,040 --> 03:40:11,040
can just go do it while in a big

5937
03:40:11,040 --> 03:40:13,040
company you do have to worry about

5938
03:40:13,040 --> 03:40:15,040
I you know is there some

5939
03:40:15,040 --> 03:40:17,040
SDK internally that you should be using

5940
03:40:17,040 --> 03:40:19,040
other teams making it you have to have your

5941
03:40:19,040 --> 03:40:21,040
cross functional group meetups

5942
03:40:21,040 --> 03:40:23,040
for different things you do have more

5943
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:25,040
concerns about you know about privacy

5944
03:40:25,040 --> 03:40:27,040
or diversity and equity and

5945
03:40:27,040 --> 03:40:29,040
I'm safety of different things

5946
03:40:29,040 --> 03:40:31,040
parental issues and things that a small

5947
03:40:31,040 --> 03:40:33,040
startup company can just kind of you know

5948
03:40:33,040 --> 03:40:35,040
cowboy off and do

5949
03:40:35,040 --> 03:40:37,040
something interesting and there's a lot

5950
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:39,040
more that is a problem

5951
03:40:39,040 --> 03:40:41,040
that you have to pay attention to in the big

5952
03:40:41,040 --> 03:40:43,040
companies but I'm not willing to believe that

5953
03:40:43,040 --> 03:40:45,040
we are within even a factor

5954
03:40:45,040 --> 03:40:47,040
of two or four of what the

5955
03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:49,040
efficiency could be you know I

5956
03:40:49,040 --> 03:40:51,040
am constantly kind of

5957
03:40:51,040 --> 03:40:53,040
crying out for it's like we can do better than

5958
03:40:53,040 --> 03:40:55,040
this and you wonder what the mechanisms

5959
03:40:55,040 --> 03:40:57,040
to unlock that efficiency

5960
03:40:57,040 --> 03:40:59,040
are you know I don't

5961
03:40:59,040 --> 03:41:01,040
there is some sense in a large company

5962
03:41:01,040 --> 03:41:03,040
that

5963
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:05,040
like an individual engineer might not

5964
03:41:05,040 --> 03:41:07,040
believe that they can change the world

5965
03:41:07,040 --> 03:41:09,040
maybe you delegate a little bit

5966
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:11,040
of the responsibility

5967
03:41:11,040 --> 03:41:13,040
to be the one who changes the world

5968
03:41:13,040 --> 03:41:15,040
in a big company I think

5969
03:41:15,040 --> 03:41:17,040
but the reality is

5970
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:19,040
like the world will get changed

5971
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:21,040
by a single engineer anyway

5972
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:23,040
so if whether inside google

5973
03:41:23,040 --> 03:41:25,040
or inside a startup it doesn't matter

5974
03:41:25,040 --> 03:41:27,040
it's just like google and

5975
03:41:27,040 --> 03:41:29,040
meta needs to help those engineers believe

5976
03:41:29,040 --> 03:41:31,040
they're the ones that are going to decrease

5977
03:41:31,040 --> 03:41:33,040
that latency is it'll

5978
03:41:33,040 --> 03:41:35,040
take one John Carmack like the

5979
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:37,040
20 year old Carmack

5980
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:39,040
that's inside meta right now

5981
03:41:39,040 --> 03:41:41,040
to change everything and I try to

5982
03:41:41,040 --> 03:41:43,040
point that out and push people

5983
03:41:43,040 --> 03:41:45,040
it's like try to go ahead

5984
03:41:45,040 --> 03:41:47,040
and when you see some because there is

5985
03:41:47,040 --> 03:41:49,040
you get the silo mentality where you're like

5986
03:41:49,040 --> 03:41:51,040
okay I know something's not right over there

5987
03:41:51,040 --> 03:41:53,040
but that's I'm staying in my lane here

5988
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:55,040
and there's there's a couple people

5989
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:57,040
that I can you know I can

5990
03:41:57,040 --> 03:41:59,040
think about that are willing to just like hop

5991
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:01,040
all over the place and man I treasure them

5992
03:42:01,040 --> 03:42:03,040
the people that are just willing to

5993
03:42:03,040 --> 03:42:05,040
they're fearless you know they will go over

5994
03:42:05,040 --> 03:42:07,040
and they will go rebuild the kernel and change

5995
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:09,040
this distribution and go in and hack

5996
03:42:09,040 --> 03:42:11,040
firmware over here to to get something

5997
03:42:11,040 --> 03:42:13,040
done right and that is

5998
03:42:13,040 --> 03:42:15,040
relatively rare you know there's thousands

5999
03:42:15,040 --> 03:42:17,040
of developers and you've got a small handful

6000
03:42:17,040 --> 03:42:19,040
that are willing to operate at that level

6001
03:42:19,040 --> 03:42:21,040
and you know and it's

6002
03:42:21,040 --> 03:42:23,040
potentially risky for them the the politics

6003
03:42:23,040 --> 03:42:25,040
are you know are real in a lot of that and

6004
03:42:25,040 --> 03:42:27,040
I'm in the you know very much the privileged

6005
03:42:27,040 --> 03:42:29,040
position of I am

6006
03:42:29,040 --> 03:42:31,040
you know I'm more or less untouchable

6007
03:42:31,040 --> 03:42:33,040
there where I've been dinged like

6008
03:42:33,040 --> 03:42:35,040
twice for it's like you said something insensitive

6009
03:42:35,040 --> 03:42:37,040
in that post and I and you should probably

6010
03:42:37,040 --> 03:42:39,040
not say that I am

6011
03:42:39,040 --> 03:42:41,040
but for the most part yes I you know I get

6012
03:42:41,040 --> 03:42:43,040
away with I every week I'm

6013
03:42:43,040 --> 03:42:45,040
posting something you know pretty loud

6014
03:42:45,040 --> 03:42:47,040
and opinionated in you know internally

6015
03:42:47,040 --> 03:42:49,040
and I think that's useful for

6016
03:42:49,040 --> 03:42:51,040
the company but

6017
03:42:51,040 --> 03:42:53,040
I am yeah it's not

6018
03:42:53,040 --> 03:42:55,040
it's rare to have a position like that and I

6019
03:42:55,040 --> 03:42:57,040
can't necessarily offer advice for how

6020
03:42:57,040 --> 03:42:59,040
someone can do that I

6021
03:42:59,040 --> 03:43:01,040
well you could offer advice to a company

6022
03:43:01,040 --> 03:43:03,040
in general to give a little bit

6023
03:43:03,040 --> 03:43:05,040
of freedom for the

6024
03:43:05,040 --> 03:43:07,040
young wild the wildest ideas come

6025
03:43:07,040 --> 03:43:09,040
from the young minds

6026
03:43:09,040 --> 03:43:11,040
and so

6027
03:43:11,040 --> 03:43:13,040
you need to give the young minds freedom

6028
03:43:13,040 --> 03:43:15,040
to think big and wild

6029
03:43:15,040 --> 03:43:17,040
and crazy and for that

6030
03:43:17,040 --> 03:43:19,040
they have to be opinionated they have to

6031
03:43:19,040 --> 03:43:21,040
be

6032
03:43:21,040 --> 03:43:23,040
they have to think crazy ideas

6033
03:43:23,040 --> 03:43:25,040
and thoughts and pursue

6034
03:43:25,040 --> 03:43:27,040
them with a full passion without being slowed

6035
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:29,040
down by bureaucracy or managers

6036
03:43:29,040 --> 03:43:31,040
and all that kind of stuff

6037
03:43:31,040 --> 03:43:33,040
obviously startups really empower that but

6038
03:43:33,040 --> 03:43:35,040
big companies could too and that's

6039
03:43:35,040 --> 03:43:37,040
that's a design challenge for company

6040
03:43:37,040 --> 03:43:39,040
for big companies to see how can you

6041
03:43:39,040 --> 03:43:41,040
enable that how can you

6042
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:43,040
there are so many resources

6043
03:43:43,040 --> 03:43:45,040
and they do you know amazing

6044
03:43:45,040 --> 03:43:47,040
things do get accomplished but

6045
03:43:47,040 --> 03:43:49,040
there's so much more that could come out

6046
03:43:49,040 --> 03:43:51,040
of that and you know I'm hope I'm always

6047
03:43:51,040 --> 03:43:53,040
hopeful I'm an optimist in almost everything

6048
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:55,040
you know I think things can get better I

6049
03:43:55,040 --> 03:43:57,040
think that they can improve things that

6050
03:43:57,040 --> 03:43:59,040
you go through a path and you're learning

6051
03:43:59,040 --> 03:44:01,040
kind of what does and doesn't work

6052
03:44:01,040 --> 03:44:03,040
and I'm not I'm not ready to be fatalistic

6053
03:44:03,040 --> 03:44:05,040
about the kind of the outcome

6054
03:44:05,040 --> 03:44:07,040
of any of that

6055
03:44:07,040 --> 03:44:09,040
me neither I know too many good people

6056
03:44:09,040 --> 03:44:11,040
inside of those large companies that are incredible

6057
03:44:11,040 --> 03:44:13,040
you have a

6058
03:44:13,040 --> 03:44:15,040
friendship with Elon Musk

6059
03:44:15,040 --> 03:44:17,040
often when I talk to him

6060
03:44:17,040 --> 03:44:19,040
he'll bring up how incredible of an engineer

6061
03:44:19,040 --> 03:44:21,040
and just a big picture

6062
03:44:21,040 --> 03:44:23,040
thinker you are his huge

6063
03:44:23,040 --> 03:44:25,040
amount of respect for you

6064
03:44:25,040 --> 03:44:27,040
I just

6065
03:44:27,040 --> 03:44:29,040
I've never been a fly in the wall between

6066
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:31,040
the discussion between the two of you I just wonder

6067
03:44:31,040 --> 03:44:33,040
is there something you guys

6068
03:44:33,040 --> 03:44:35,040
debate

6069
03:44:35,040 --> 03:44:37,040
argue about discuss is there

6070
03:44:37,040 --> 03:44:39,040
some interesting problems that the two of you

6071
03:44:39,040 --> 03:44:41,040
think about

6072
03:44:41,040 --> 03:44:43,040
you come from different worlds maybe there's

6073
03:44:43,040 --> 03:44:45,040
some intersection

6074
03:44:45,040 --> 03:44:47,040
in aerospace maybe there's some intersection

6075
03:44:47,040 --> 03:44:49,040
in your

6076
03:44:49,040 --> 03:44:51,040
new efforts in artificial intelligence

6077
03:44:51,040 --> 03:44:53,040
in terms of thinking

6078
03:44:53,040 --> 03:44:55,040
is there something interesting you could say about

6079
03:44:55,040 --> 03:44:57,040
sort of the debates the two of you have

6080
03:44:57,040 --> 03:44:59,040
so I think in some ways

6081
03:44:59,040 --> 03:45:01,040
we do have a kind of similar background

6082
03:45:01,040 --> 03:45:03,040
where we're almost exactly the same age

6083
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:05,040
and we had kind of similar

6084
03:45:05,040 --> 03:45:07,040
programming backgrounds on the personal computers

6085
03:45:07,040 --> 03:45:09,040
and

6086
03:45:09,040 --> 03:45:11,040
even some of the books that we would read and things

6087
03:45:11,040 --> 03:45:13,040
that would kind of turn us into the people

6088
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:15,040
that we are today

6089
03:45:15,040 --> 03:45:17,040
and I think there is a

6090
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:19,040
degree of

6091
03:45:19,040 --> 03:45:21,040
sensibility similarities where

6092
03:45:21,040 --> 03:45:23,040
we kind of call bullshit on the same things

6093
03:45:23,040 --> 03:45:25,040
and kind of see the same opportunities

6094
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:27,040
in different technology

6095
03:45:27,040 --> 03:45:29,040
and there's that sense of

6096
03:45:29,040 --> 03:45:31,040
I always talk about the speed of light solutions

6097
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:33,040
for things and he's thinking about

6098
03:45:33,040 --> 03:45:35,040
kind of minimum manufacturing

6099
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:37,040
and engineering and operational

6100
03:45:37,040 --> 03:45:39,040
standpoints for things

6101
03:45:39,040 --> 03:45:41,040
and

6102
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:43,040
so I mean I first met Elon

6103
03:45:43,040 --> 03:45:45,040
right at the start of the aerospace era

6104
03:45:45,040 --> 03:45:47,040
where I wasn't familiar with

6105
03:45:47,040 --> 03:45:49,040
I was still in my game dev bubble

6106
03:45:49,040 --> 03:45:51,040
I really wasn't familiar with all the startups

6107
03:45:51,040 --> 03:45:53,040
that were going and being successful

6108
03:45:53,040 --> 03:45:55,040
with PayPal and all of his different companies

6109
03:45:55,040 --> 03:45:57,040
but I met him as I was starting

6110
03:45:57,040 --> 03:45:59,040
to do Armadillo Aerospace

6111
03:45:59,040 --> 03:46:01,040
and he came down with

6112
03:46:01,040 --> 03:46:03,040
kind of his right hand propulsion guy

6113
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:05,040
and we talked about rockets

6114
03:46:05,040 --> 03:46:07,040
what can we do with this

6115
03:46:07,040 --> 03:46:09,040
and it was kind of specific things

6116
03:46:09,040 --> 03:46:11,040
about like how are our flight

6117
03:46:11,040 --> 03:46:13,040
computers set up, what are different propellant

6118
03:46:13,040 --> 03:46:15,040
options, what

6119
03:46:15,040 --> 03:46:17,040
can happen with different

6120
03:46:17,040 --> 03:46:19,040
ways of putting things together

6121
03:46:19,040 --> 03:46:21,040
and then in some

6122
03:46:21,040 --> 03:46:23,040
ways he was certainly the biggest player

6123
03:46:23,040 --> 03:46:25,040
in the sort of alt space community

6124
03:46:25,040 --> 03:46:27,040
that was going on in the early 2000s

6125
03:46:27,040 --> 03:46:29,040
he was

6126
03:46:29,040 --> 03:46:31,040
the most well funded although

6127
03:46:31,040 --> 03:46:33,040
you know his funding in the larger scheme of things

6128
03:46:33,040 --> 03:46:35,040
compared to a

6129
03:46:35,040 --> 03:46:37,040
like a NASA or something like that

6130
03:46:37,040 --> 03:46:39,040
was really tiny, it was a lot more

6131
03:46:39,040 --> 03:46:41,040
than I had at the time

6132
03:46:41,040 --> 03:46:43,040
but it was interesting

6133
03:46:43,040 --> 03:46:45,040
I had a point years later when I realized

6134
03:46:45,040 --> 03:46:47,040
okay my

6135
03:46:47,040 --> 03:46:49,040
my financial resources at this point

6136
03:46:49,040 --> 03:46:51,040
were basically what Elon's was

6137
03:46:51,040 --> 03:46:53,040
when he went all in on

6138
03:46:53,040 --> 03:46:55,040
SpaceX and Tesla

6139
03:46:55,040 --> 03:46:57,040
and there's

6140
03:46:57,040 --> 03:46:59,040
I think in many corners he does not

6141
03:46:59,040 --> 03:47:01,040
get the respect that he should

6142
03:47:01,040 --> 03:47:03,040
about being a wealthy person

6143
03:47:03,040 --> 03:47:05,040
that could just retire

6144
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:07,040
and he went all in where

6145
03:47:07,040 --> 03:47:09,040
he was really going to

6146
03:47:09,040 --> 03:47:11,040
you know he could have gone bust

6147
03:47:11,040 --> 03:47:13,040
and there's plenty of people

6148
03:47:13,040 --> 03:47:15,040
you look at the you know the sad

6149
03:47:15,040 --> 03:47:17,040
athletes or entertainers

6150
03:47:17,040 --> 03:47:19,040
that had all the money in the world and blew it

6151
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:21,040
he could have been the business case

6152
03:47:21,040 --> 03:47:23,040
example of that

6153
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:25,040
but you know the things

6154
03:47:25,040 --> 03:47:27,040
that he was doing space exploration

6155
03:47:27,040 --> 03:47:29,040
electrification of transportation

6156
03:47:29,040 --> 03:47:31,040
on solar city type things

6157
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:33,040
these are big

6158
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:35,040
world level things

6159
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:37,040
and I have a great deal of admiration

6160
03:47:37,040 --> 03:47:39,040
that he was willing to throw himself

6161
03:47:39,040 --> 03:47:41,040
so completely into that

6162
03:47:41,040 --> 03:47:43,040
because in contrast with myself

6163
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:45,040
I was doing armadillo aerospace

6164
03:47:45,040 --> 03:47:47,040
with this tightly bounded

6165
03:47:47,040 --> 03:47:49,040
it was John's crazy money

6166
03:47:49,040 --> 03:47:51,040
at the time that had a finite limit

6167
03:47:51,040 --> 03:47:53,040
on it it was never going to impact

6168
03:47:53,040 --> 03:47:55,040
me or my family

6169
03:47:55,040 --> 03:47:57,040
if it completely failed

6170
03:47:57,040 --> 03:47:59,040
and I was still hedging my bets

6171
03:47:59,040 --> 03:48:01,040
working at idsoftware at the time

6172
03:48:01,040 --> 03:48:03,040
when he had been

6173
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:05,040
really all in there

6174
03:48:05,040 --> 03:48:07,040
and I have a huge amount of respect

6175
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:09,040
for that and people do not

6176
03:48:09,040 --> 03:48:11,040
the other thing I get irritated with

6177
03:48:11,040 --> 03:48:13,040
is people would say it's like oh Elon's

6178
03:48:13,040 --> 03:48:15,040
business guy

6179
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:17,040
he was gifted the money

6180
03:48:17,040 --> 03:48:19,040
and he's just kind of investing

6181
03:48:19,040 --> 03:48:21,040
in all of this when

6182
03:48:21,040 --> 03:48:23,040
he was really deeply involved

6183
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:25,040
in a lot of the decisions

6184
03:48:25,040 --> 03:48:27,040
not all of them were perfect

6185
03:48:27,040 --> 03:48:29,040
but he cared very much about

6186
03:48:29,040 --> 03:48:31,040
engine material selection

6187
03:48:31,040 --> 03:48:33,040
propellant selection

6188
03:48:33,040 --> 03:48:35,040
for years he'd be kind of telling me

6189
03:48:35,040 --> 03:48:37,040
it's like get off that hydrogen peroxide stuff

6190
03:48:37,040 --> 03:48:39,040
it's like liquid oxygen

6191
03:48:39,040 --> 03:48:41,040
is the only proper oxidizer

6192
03:48:41,040 --> 03:48:43,040
for this

6193
03:48:43,040 --> 03:48:45,040
and like the times

6194
03:48:45,040 --> 03:48:47,040
that I've gone through the factories with him

6195
03:48:47,040 --> 03:48:49,040
we're talking

6196
03:48:49,040 --> 03:48:51,040
very detailed things about

6197
03:48:51,040 --> 03:48:53,040
how this weld is made

6198
03:48:53,040 --> 03:48:55,040
how this sub-assembly goes together

6199
03:48:55,040 --> 03:48:57,040
what are start up shut down

6200
03:48:57,040 --> 03:48:59,040
behaviors of the different things

6201
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:01,040
so he is really

6202
03:49:01,040 --> 03:49:03,040
in there at a very detailed

6203
03:49:03,040 --> 03:49:05,040
level and I think that he is

6204
03:49:05,040 --> 03:49:07,040
the best modern example

6205
03:49:07,040 --> 03:49:09,040
now of someone that tries to

6206
03:49:09,040 --> 03:49:11,040
effectively micromanage some decisions

6207
03:49:11,040 --> 03:49:13,040
on things on both Tesla

6208
03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:15,040
you know and SpaceX to some degree

6209
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:17,040
where he cares enough about it

6210
03:49:17,040 --> 03:49:19,040
I worry a lot that he stretched too thin

6211
03:49:19,040 --> 03:49:21,040
that you get boring company

6212
03:49:21,040 --> 03:49:23,040
in Neuralink and Twitter

6213
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:25,040
all the other possible things there

6214
03:49:25,040 --> 03:49:27,040
where I know I've got

6215
03:49:27,040 --> 03:49:29,040
I've got limits on how much

6216
03:49:29,040 --> 03:49:31,040
I can pay attention to

6217
03:49:31,040 --> 03:49:33,040
that I have to kind of box off different amounts

6218
03:49:33,040 --> 03:49:35,040
of time and I look back at

6219
03:49:35,040 --> 03:49:37,040
my aerospace side of things it's like I did

6220
03:49:37,040 --> 03:49:39,040
not go all in on that I did not

6221
03:49:39,040 --> 03:49:41,040
commit myself at a level that it would

6222
03:49:41,040 --> 03:49:43,040
have taken to be successful there

6223
03:49:43,040 --> 03:49:45,040
and I

6224
03:49:45,040 --> 03:49:47,040
and it's kind of a weird thing just

6225
03:49:47,040 --> 03:49:49,040
like having a discussion with

6226
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:51,040
he's the richest man in the world right now

6227
03:49:51,040 --> 03:49:53,040
but he operates on

6228
03:49:53,040 --> 03:49:55,040
you know on a level that is still

6229
03:49:55,040 --> 03:49:57,040
very much

6230
03:49:57,040 --> 03:49:59,040
in my wheelhouse on a technical side of

6231
03:49:59,040 --> 03:50:01,040
things so

6232
03:50:01,040 --> 03:50:03,040
doing that systems level type of thinking where you can go to

6233
03:50:03,040 --> 03:50:05,040
the low level details

6234
03:50:05,040 --> 03:50:07,040
and go up high to the big picture

6235
03:50:07,040 --> 03:50:09,040
do you think

6236
03:50:09,040 --> 03:50:11,040
in the aerospace

6237
03:50:11,040 --> 03:50:13,040
arena in the next

6238
03:50:13,040 --> 03:50:15,040
5, 10 years do you think

6239
03:50:15,040 --> 03:50:17,040
we're going to put a human on Mars like what do you think

6240
03:50:17,040 --> 03:50:19,040
is the interesting

6241
03:50:19,040 --> 03:50:21,040
no I do in fact

6242
03:50:21,040 --> 03:50:23,040
I made a bet with someone

6243
03:50:23,040 --> 03:50:25,040
with a group of people kind of this

6244
03:50:25,040 --> 03:50:27,040
about whether boots on Mars by

6245
03:50:27,040 --> 03:50:29,040
2030 and

6246
03:50:29,040 --> 03:50:31,040
this was kind of a fun

6247
03:50:31,040 --> 03:50:33,040
story because I was at an Intel

6248
03:50:33,040 --> 03:50:35,040
sponsored event and we had a bunch of

6249
03:50:35,040 --> 03:50:37,040
just world-class brilliant people

6250
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:39,040
and we were talking about computing stuff

6251
03:50:39,040 --> 03:50:41,040
but the after dinner conversation was

6252
03:50:41,040 --> 03:50:43,040
like what are some other things how they're going to go in the

6253
03:50:43,040 --> 03:50:45,040
future and one of the ones tossed

6254
03:50:45,040 --> 03:50:47,040
up on the whiteboard was like boots on Mars

6255
03:50:47,040 --> 03:50:49,040
by 2030

6256
03:50:49,040 --> 03:50:51,040
and most of the people in the room

6257
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:53,040
thought yes you know they thought that like

6258
03:50:53,040 --> 03:50:55,040
SpaceX is kicking ass we've got

6259
03:50:55,040 --> 03:50:57,040
all this possible stuff

6260
03:50:57,040 --> 03:50:59,040
seems likely that it's going to go that way

6261
03:50:59,040 --> 03:51:01,040
and I said

6262
03:51:01,040 --> 03:51:03,040
no I think less than 50% chance

6263
03:51:03,040 --> 03:51:05,040
that it's going to make it there

6264
03:51:05,040 --> 03:51:07,040
and people

6265
03:51:07,040 --> 03:51:09,040
were kind of like why the pessimism or whatever

6266
03:51:09,040 --> 03:51:11,040
and of course I'm an optimist at almost

6267
03:51:11,040 --> 03:51:13,040
everything but for me to be

6268
03:51:13,040 --> 03:51:15,040
the one kind of outlier saying no I

6269
03:51:15,040 --> 03:51:17,040
don't think so

6270
03:51:17,040 --> 03:51:19,040
then I started saying some of the things

6271
03:51:19,040 --> 03:51:21,040
I said well let's be concrete about it

6272
03:51:21,040 --> 03:51:23,040
let's bet $10,000

6273
03:51:23,040 --> 03:51:25,040
that it's not going to happen

6274
03:51:25,040 --> 03:51:27,040
and this was really

6275
03:51:27,040 --> 03:51:29,040
a startling thing to see that

6276
03:51:29,040 --> 03:51:31,040
again, room full of brilliant people

6277
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:33,040
but as soon as like

6278
03:51:33,040 --> 03:51:35,040
money came on the line and they were like

6279
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:37,040
I want to put $10,000 and I was

6280
03:51:37,040 --> 03:51:39,040
not the richest person in the room

6281
03:51:39,040 --> 03:51:41,040
there are people much better off than

6282
03:51:41,040 --> 03:51:43,040
there's a spectrum but

6283
03:51:43,040 --> 03:51:45,040
you know as soon as they started

6284
03:51:45,040 --> 03:51:47,040
to think it's like oh I could lose money

6285
03:51:47,040 --> 03:51:49,040
by keeping

6286
03:51:49,040 --> 03:51:51,040
my position right now

6287
03:51:51,040 --> 03:51:53,040
and all these engineers they engage

6288
03:51:53,040 --> 03:51:55,040
their brain they started thinking it's like okay

6289
03:51:55,040 --> 03:51:57,040
launch windows

6290
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:59,040
delays like how many times

6291
03:51:59,040 --> 03:52:01,040
would it take to get this right what historical

6292
03:52:01,040 --> 03:52:03,040
precedence do we have

6293
03:52:03,040 --> 03:52:05,040
and then it mostly came down

6294
03:52:05,040 --> 03:52:07,040
to it's like well what about in transit

6295
03:52:07,040 --> 03:52:09,040
by 2030 and then

6296
03:52:09,040 --> 03:52:11,040
what about

6297
03:52:11,040 --> 03:52:13,040
different things or would you go for 2032

6298
03:52:13,040 --> 03:52:15,040
but one of the people

6299
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:17,040
did go ahead and was optimistic

6300
03:52:17,040 --> 03:52:19,040
enough to make a bet with me so I have

6301
03:52:19,040 --> 03:52:21,040
a $10,000 bet that

6302
03:52:21,040 --> 03:52:23,040
by 2030 I think it's going to happen

6303
03:52:23,040 --> 03:52:25,040
shortly thereafter I think there will

6304
03:52:25,040 --> 03:52:27,040
probably be infrastructure on Mars by 2030

6305
03:52:27,040 --> 03:52:29,040
but I don't think that we'll have

6306
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:31,040
humans on Mars on 23rd

6307
03:52:31,040 --> 03:52:33,040
I think it's possible but I think it's

6308
03:52:33,040 --> 03:52:35,040
less than a 50% chance so I felt

6309
03:52:35,040 --> 03:52:37,040
safe making that bet

6310
03:52:37,040 --> 03:52:39,040
well I think you had an interesting

6311
03:52:39,040 --> 03:52:41,040
point correct me if I'm wrong

6312
03:52:41,040 --> 03:52:43,040
that's a dark one that's

6313
03:52:43,040 --> 03:52:45,040
um that should

6314
03:52:45,040 --> 03:52:47,040
perhaps help people

6315
03:52:47,040 --> 03:52:49,040
appreciate Elon Musk

6316
03:52:49,040 --> 03:52:51,040
which is

6317
03:52:51,040 --> 03:52:53,040
in this particular effort

6318
03:52:53,040 --> 03:52:55,040
Elon is a critical

6319
03:52:55,040 --> 03:52:57,040
it's critical to success

6320
03:52:57,040 --> 03:52:59,040
SpaceX seems to be

6321
03:52:59,040 --> 03:53:01,040
critical to

6322
03:53:03,040 --> 03:53:05,040
humans on Mars by 2030

6323
03:53:05,040 --> 03:53:07,040
or thereabouts

6324
03:53:07,040 --> 03:53:09,040
so if something happens to Elon

6325
03:53:11,040 --> 03:53:13,040
then all of this collapses

6326
03:53:13,040 --> 03:53:15,040
and this is in contrast to

6327
03:53:15,040 --> 03:53:17,040
the other $10,000

6328
03:53:17,040 --> 03:53:19,040
bet I made kind of recently and that was

6329
03:53:19,040 --> 03:53:21,040
self-driving cars at

6330
03:53:21,040 --> 03:53:23,040
like a level 5 running around

6331
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:25,040
cities and people have kind of nitpicked

6332
03:53:25,040 --> 03:53:27,040
that that we probably don't mean exactly

6333
03:53:27,040 --> 03:53:29,040
level 5 but the guy I'm having the bet with

6334
03:53:29,040 --> 03:53:31,040
is we're going to be

6335
03:53:31,040 --> 03:53:33,040
we know what we mean about this

6336
03:53:33,040 --> 03:53:35,040
Jeff Atwood yeah coding horror

6337
03:53:35,040 --> 03:53:37,040
and stack over flow and all

6338
03:53:37,040 --> 03:53:39,040
but I

6339
03:53:39,040 --> 03:53:41,040
he doesn't think that people

6340
03:53:41,040 --> 03:53:43,040
are going to be riding around in Robo Taxis

6341
03:53:43,040 --> 03:53:45,040
in 2030 in major cities

6342
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:47,040
just like you take an Uber now

6343
03:53:47,040 --> 03:53:49,040
and I think it will

6344
03:53:49,040 --> 03:53:51,040
and I think and the difference is everybody

6345
03:53:51,040 --> 03:53:53,040
looks at this it's like oh but Tesla's been wrong

6346
03:53:53,040 --> 03:53:55,040
for you they've been promising it for years

6347
03:53:55,040 --> 03:53:57,040
and it's not here yet and

6348
03:53:57,040 --> 03:53:59,040
the reason this is different than

6349
03:53:59,040 --> 03:54:01,040
the bet with Mars is

6350
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:03,040
Mars really is

6351
03:54:03,040 --> 03:54:05,040
more than is comfortable a bet on

6352
03:54:05,040 --> 03:54:07,040
Elon Musk I am you know that is

6353
03:54:07,040 --> 03:54:09,040
you know that is his thing

6354
03:54:09,040 --> 03:54:11,040
and he is really going to

6355
03:54:11,040 --> 03:54:13,040
move heaven and earth to try to make that

6356
03:54:13,040 --> 03:54:15,040
happen and perhaps not even SpaceX

6357
03:54:15,040 --> 03:54:17,040
yeah perhaps just Elon

6358
03:54:17,040 --> 03:54:19,040
yeah because if

6359
03:54:19,040 --> 03:54:21,040
if Elon went away and SpaceX

6360
03:54:21,040 --> 03:54:23,040
went public and got a board of directors

6361
03:54:23,040 --> 03:54:25,040
I there are more profitable

6362
03:54:25,040 --> 03:54:27,040
things they could be doing than focusing

6363
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:29,040
on human presence on Mars

6364
03:54:29,040 --> 03:54:31,040
so this really is a sort

6365
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:33,040
of personal thing there and

6366
03:54:33,040 --> 03:54:35,040
in contrast with that

6367
03:54:35,040 --> 03:54:37,040
self-driving cars have

6368
03:54:37,040 --> 03:54:39,040
a dozen credible companies

6369
03:54:39,040 --> 03:54:41,040
working really hard and while

6370
03:54:41,040 --> 03:54:43,040
yes it's going

6371
03:54:43,040 --> 03:54:45,040
slower than most people thought it would

6372
03:54:45,040 --> 03:54:47,040
betting against that is a bet

6373
03:54:47,040 --> 03:54:49,040
against almost the entire world

6374
03:54:49,040 --> 03:54:51,040
in terms of all of these companies

6375
03:54:51,040 --> 03:54:53,040
that have all of these incentives

6376
03:54:53,040 --> 03:54:55,040
it's not just you know one

6377
03:54:55,040 --> 03:54:57,040
guys passion project

6378
03:54:57,040 --> 03:54:59,040
and I do think that it is solvable

6379
03:54:59,040 --> 03:55:01,040
I although there's I recognize

6380
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:03,040
it's not a hundred percent chance because

6381
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:05,040
it's possible the long tail of self-driving

6382
03:55:05,040 --> 03:55:07,040
problems winds up being an AGI

6383
03:55:07,040 --> 03:55:09,040
complete problem I think

6384
03:55:09,040 --> 03:55:11,040
there's plenty of value to mine out of it with

6385
03:55:11,040 --> 03:55:13,040
narrow AI and I think that it's

6386
03:55:13,040 --> 03:55:15,040
you know it's going to happen probably more

6387
03:55:15,040 --> 03:55:17,040
so than people expect but it's that

6388
03:55:17,040 --> 03:55:19,040
whole sigmoid curve where you

6389
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:21,040
over you know you overestimate the near

6390
03:55:21,040 --> 03:55:23,040
term progress you underestimate the long

6391
03:55:23,040 --> 03:55:25,040
term progress and I think self-driving

6392
03:55:25,040 --> 03:55:27,040
is going to be like that and I think

6393
03:55:27,040 --> 03:55:29,040
2030 still a pretty good bet

6394
03:55:29,040 --> 03:55:31,040
yeah unfortunately

6395
03:55:33,040 --> 03:55:35,040
self-driving is a problem

6396
03:55:35,040 --> 03:55:37,040
that is

6397
03:55:37,040 --> 03:55:39,040
safety critical meaning that

6398
03:55:39,040 --> 03:55:41,040
if you don't do it well

6399
03:55:41,040 --> 03:55:43,040
people get hurt

6400
03:55:43,040 --> 03:55:45,040
but the other side of that is people

6401
03:55:45,040 --> 03:55:47,040
are terrible drivers so

6402
03:55:47,040 --> 03:55:49,040
it is not going to be that's probably going to be

6403
03:55:49,040 --> 03:55:51,040
the argument that gets it through is like

6404
03:55:51,040 --> 03:55:53,040
we can save 10,000 lives

6405
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:55,040
a year by taking

6406
03:55:55,040 --> 03:55:57,040
imperfect self-driving cars

6407
03:55:57,040 --> 03:55:59,040
and letting them take over a lot of driving responsibilities

6408
03:55:59,040 --> 03:56:01,040
it's like was it 30,000

6409
03:56:01,040 --> 03:56:03,040
people a year die in auto accidents

6410
03:56:03,040 --> 03:56:05,040
right now in America

6411
03:56:05,040 --> 03:56:07,040
and a lot of those are preventable

6412
03:56:07,040 --> 03:56:09,040
and the problem is you'll have people that

6413
03:56:09,040 --> 03:56:11,040
every time a Tesla crashes into something

6414
03:56:11,040 --> 03:56:13,040
you've got a bunch of people that

6415
03:56:13,040 --> 03:56:15,040
literally have vested interests shorting Tesla

6416
03:56:15,040 --> 03:56:17,040
to come out and make it the worst thing in the world

6417
03:56:17,040 --> 03:56:19,040
and people will be fighting against

6418
03:56:19,040 --> 03:56:21,040
that but optimist in me again

6419
03:56:21,040 --> 03:56:23,040
I think that we will have systems

6420
03:56:23,040 --> 03:56:25,040
that are statistically safer

6421
03:56:25,040 --> 03:56:27,040
than human drivers and we will be saving

6422
03:56:27,040 --> 03:56:29,040
thousands and thousands

6423
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:31,040
of lives every year

6424
03:56:31,040 --> 03:56:33,040
when we can hand over more of those responsibilities

6425
03:56:33,040 --> 03:56:35,040
to it I do still think

6426
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:37,040
as a person who studied this problem

6427
03:56:37,040 --> 03:56:39,040
very deeply from a human side

6428
03:56:39,040 --> 03:56:41,040
as well

6429
03:56:41,040 --> 03:56:43,040
it's still an open problem how

6430
03:56:43,040 --> 03:56:45,040
good slash bad humans

6431
03:56:45,040 --> 03:56:47,040
are driving it's a kind

6432
03:56:47,040 --> 03:56:49,040
of funny thing we say about each other

6433
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:51,040
oh humans suck at driving

6434
03:56:51,040 --> 03:56:53,040
everybody except

6435
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:55,040
you of course

6436
03:56:55,040 --> 03:56:57,040
we think we're good at driving

6437
03:56:57,040 --> 03:56:59,040
but after really

6438
03:56:59,040 --> 03:57:01,040
studying it I think

6439
03:57:01,040 --> 03:57:03,040
you start to notice

6440
03:57:03,040 --> 03:57:05,040
because I've watched hundreds

6441
03:57:05,040 --> 03:57:07,040
of hours of humans driving

6442
03:57:07,040 --> 03:57:09,040
the projects of this kind of thing

6443
03:57:09,040 --> 03:57:11,040
you've noticed that even with

6444
03:57:11,040 --> 03:57:13,040
the distraction, even with everything else

6445
03:57:13,040 --> 03:57:15,040
humans are able

6446
03:57:15,040 --> 03:57:17,040
to do some incredible things

6447
03:57:17,040 --> 03:57:19,040
with the

6448
03:57:19,040 --> 03:57:21,040
attention even when you're just looking at the smartphone

6449
03:57:21,040 --> 03:57:23,040
just to get cues from the environment

6450
03:57:23,040 --> 03:57:25,040
to make less seconds

6451
03:57:25,040 --> 03:57:27,040
decisions

6452
03:57:27,040 --> 03:57:29,040
to use instinctual type of decisions

6453
03:57:29,040 --> 03:57:31,040
that actually save your ass

6454
03:57:31,040 --> 03:57:33,040
time and time and time again

6455
03:57:33,040 --> 03:57:35,040
and are able to do that

6456
03:57:35,040 --> 03:57:37,040
with so much uncertainty

6457
03:57:37,040 --> 03:57:39,040
around you in such tricky

6458
03:57:39,040 --> 03:57:41,040
dynamic environments

6459
03:57:41,040 --> 03:57:43,040
I don't know

6460
03:57:43,040 --> 03:57:45,040
I don't know exactly

6461
03:57:45,040 --> 03:57:47,040
how hard is it to beat

6462
03:57:47,040 --> 03:57:49,040
that kind of

6463
03:57:49,040 --> 03:57:51,040
skill of common sense reasoning

6464
03:57:51,040 --> 03:57:53,040
this is one of those interesting things

6465
03:57:53,040 --> 03:57:55,040
that there have been a lot of studies about how

6466
03:57:55,040 --> 03:57:57,040
experts in their field usually

6467
03:57:57,040 --> 03:57:59,040
underestimate the progress

6468
03:57:59,040 --> 03:58:01,040
that's going to happen because

6469
03:58:01,040 --> 03:58:03,040
it thinks about all the problems they deal with

6470
03:58:03,040 --> 03:58:05,040
and they're like, damn, I'm going to have a hard time

6471
03:58:05,040 --> 03:58:07,040
solving all of this

6472
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:09,040
and they filter out the fact that they are one expert

6473
03:58:09,040 --> 03:58:11,040
in a field of thousands

6474
03:58:11,040 --> 03:58:13,040
and you think about, yeah, I can't do

6475
03:58:13,040 --> 03:58:15,040
all of that and you sometimes forget about

6476
03:58:15,040 --> 03:58:17,040
the scope of the ecosystem

6477
03:58:17,040 --> 03:58:19,040
that you're embedded in and if you think back

6478
03:58:19,040 --> 03:58:21,040
eight years very specifically

6479
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:23,040
the state of AI and machine learning

6480
03:58:23,040 --> 03:58:25,040
where we had just gotten

6481
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:27,040
Resnets probably at that point

6482
03:58:27,040 --> 03:58:29,040
and you look at all the amazing

6483
03:58:29,040 --> 03:58:31,040
magical things that have happened in eight years

6484
03:58:31,040 --> 03:58:33,040
and they do kind of seem to be

6485
03:58:33,040 --> 03:58:35,040
happening a little faster in recent years also

6486
03:58:35,040 --> 03:58:37,040
and you project that

6487
03:58:37,040 --> 03:58:39,040
eight more years into the future

6488
03:58:39,040 --> 03:58:41,040
where again, I think there's a 50% chance

6489
03:58:41,040 --> 03:58:43,040
we're going to have signs of life of AGI

6490
03:58:43,040 --> 03:58:45,040
which we can put through

6491
03:58:45,040 --> 03:58:47,040
Driver's Ed if we need to

6492
03:58:47,040 --> 03:58:49,040
to actually build self-driving cars

6493
03:58:49,040 --> 03:58:51,040
and I think that the narrow systems are going to

6494
03:58:51,040 --> 03:58:53,040
have real value demonstrated

6495
03:58:53,040 --> 03:58:55,040
well before then

6496
03:58:55,040 --> 03:58:57,040
So signs of life

6497
03:58:57,040 --> 03:58:59,040
in AGI, you've

6498
03:58:59,040 --> 03:59:01,040
mentioned that

6499
03:59:01,040 --> 03:59:03,040
okay, first of all

6500
03:59:03,040 --> 03:59:05,040
you're one of the most brilliant people on this earth

6501
03:59:05,040 --> 03:59:07,040
you could be solving

6502
03:59:07,040 --> 03:59:09,040
a number of different problems as you've mentioned

6503
03:59:09,040 --> 03:59:11,040
your mind was attracted to

6504
03:59:11,040 --> 03:59:13,040
nuclear energy

6505
03:59:13,040 --> 03:59:15,040
obviously virtual reality with the metaverse

6506
03:59:15,040 --> 03:59:17,040
is something you could have a tremendous impact on

6507
03:59:17,040 --> 03:59:19,040
I do want to say a quick thing about nuclear energy

6508
03:59:19,040 --> 03:59:21,040
where I

6509
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:23,040
this is something that

6510
03:59:23,040 --> 03:59:25,040
this so precisely

6511
03:59:25,040 --> 03:59:27,040
feels like aerospace before SpaceX

6512
03:59:27,040 --> 03:59:29,040
where from everything that I know

6513
03:59:29,040 --> 03:59:31,040
about all of these

6514
03:59:31,040 --> 03:59:33,040
the physics of this stuff hasn't changed

6515
03:59:33,040 --> 03:59:35,040
and the reasons why

6516
03:59:35,040 --> 03:59:37,040
things are expensive now are not

6517
03:59:37,040 --> 03:59:39,040
fundamental

6518
03:59:39,040 --> 03:59:41,040
somebody should be going into

6519
03:59:41,040 --> 03:59:43,040
a really hard

6520
03:59:43,040 --> 03:59:45,040
Elon Musk style at

6521
03:59:45,040 --> 03:59:47,040
fission, economical fission

6522
03:59:47,040 --> 03:59:49,040
not fusion

6523
03:59:49,040 --> 03:59:51,040
where the fusion is

6524
03:59:51,040 --> 03:59:53,040
kind of the darling of people

6525
03:59:53,040 --> 03:59:55,040
that want to go and do nuclear

6526
03:59:55,040 --> 03:59:57,040
because it doesn't have the taint that fission

6527
03:59:57,040 --> 03:59:59,040
has in a lot of people's minds

6528
03:59:59,040 --> 04:00:01,040
but it's an almost absurdly

6529
04:00:01,040 --> 04:00:03,040
complex thing where

6530
04:00:03,040 --> 04:00:05,040
nuclear fusion is you look at the

6531
04:00:05,040 --> 04:00:07,040
the Tokamax or any of the things that people are

6532
04:00:07,040 --> 04:00:09,040
building and it's doing all of this

6533
04:00:09,040 --> 04:00:11,040
infrastructure just at the end of the day

6534
04:00:11,040 --> 04:00:13,040
to make something hot

6535
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:15,040
to that you can then turn into energy through

6536
04:00:15,040 --> 04:00:17,040
a conventional power plant

6537
04:00:17,040 --> 04:00:19,040
and all of that work which we think

6538
04:00:19,040 --> 04:00:21,040
we've got line of sight on

6539
04:00:21,040 --> 04:00:23,040
if it comes out then you have to do

6540
04:00:23,040 --> 04:00:25,040
all of that immensely complex

6541
04:00:25,040 --> 04:00:27,040
expensive stuff just to make something hot

6542
04:00:27,040 --> 04:00:29,040
where nuclear fission is

6543
04:00:29,040 --> 04:00:31,040
basically you put these two rocks together

6544
04:00:31,040 --> 04:00:33,040
and they get hot all by themselves

6545
04:00:33,040 --> 04:00:35,040
that is just that much simpler

6546
04:00:35,040 --> 04:00:37,040
it's just orders of magnitude

6547
04:00:37,040 --> 04:00:39,040
simpler and the actual

6548
04:00:39,040 --> 04:00:41,040
rocks the refined uranium is not very

6549
04:00:41,040 --> 04:00:43,040
expensive it's a couple percent

6550
04:00:43,040 --> 04:00:45,040
of the cost of electricity

6551
04:00:45,040 --> 04:00:47,040
that's why I made that point where you could

6552
04:00:47,040 --> 04:00:49,040
have something which was five

6553
04:00:49,040 --> 04:00:51,040
times less efficient than

6554
04:00:51,040 --> 04:00:53,040
current systems and if the rest

6555
04:00:53,040 --> 04:00:55,040
of the plant was a whole bunch cheaper you could still be

6556
04:00:55,040 --> 04:00:57,040
super super valuable

6557
04:00:57,040 --> 04:00:59,040
so how much of the pie

6558
04:00:59,040 --> 04:01:01,040
do you think

6559
04:01:01,040 --> 04:01:03,040
could be solved by nuclear energy

6560
04:01:03,040 --> 04:01:05,040
by fission so

6561
04:01:05,040 --> 04:01:07,040
how much could it become the primary

6562
04:01:07,040 --> 04:01:09,040
source of energy on earth

6563
04:01:09,040 --> 04:01:11,040
it could be most of it like the reserves of uranium

6564
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:13,040
as it stands now could not power the whole

6565
04:01:13,040 --> 04:01:15,040
earth but I am you know

6566
04:01:15,040 --> 04:01:17,040
you get into breeder reactors and thorium

6567
04:01:17,040 --> 04:01:19,040
things like that that you do for conventional fission

6568
04:01:19,040 --> 04:01:21,040
there is enough

6569
04:01:21,040 --> 04:01:23,040
for everything now I mean solar

6570
04:01:23,040 --> 04:01:25,040
photovoltaic has been amazing

6571
04:01:25,040 --> 04:01:27,040
you know it's I

6572
04:01:27,040 --> 04:01:29,040
one of my current projects is working on an

6573
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:31,040
off-grid system and it's been fun just kind of

6574
04:01:31,040 --> 04:01:33,040
again putting my hands on all the

6575
04:01:33,040 --> 04:01:35,040
stripping the wires and wiring things together

6576
04:01:35,040 --> 04:01:37,040
and doing all of that and just having followed

6577
04:01:37,040 --> 04:01:39,040
that a little bit from the outside

6578
04:01:39,040 --> 04:01:41,040
over the last couple decades

6579
04:01:41,040 --> 04:01:43,040
there's been semiconductor like magical

6580
04:01:43,040 --> 04:01:45,040
progress in what's going

6581
04:01:45,040 --> 04:01:47,040
on there so I'm all for

6582
04:01:47,040 --> 04:01:49,040
all of that but it doesn't solve

6583
04:01:49,040 --> 04:01:51,040
everything and nuclear really

6584
04:01:51,040 --> 04:01:53,040
still does seem like the smart money

6585
04:01:53,040 --> 04:01:55,040
bet for what you should be getting for base

6586
04:01:55,040 --> 04:01:57,040
band on a lot of things

6587
04:01:57,040 --> 04:01:59,040
and solar may be cheaper for

6588
04:01:59,040 --> 04:02:01,040
you know peaking over air conditioning loads

6589
04:02:01,040 --> 04:02:03,040
during the summer and things that you

6590
04:02:03,040 --> 04:02:05,040
can push around in different ways

6591
04:02:05,040 --> 04:02:07,040
but it's one of those things that's

6592
04:02:07,040 --> 04:02:09,040
it's just strange

6593
04:02:09,040 --> 04:02:11,040
how we've had the technology sitting there

6594
04:02:11,040 --> 04:02:13,040
but these non-technical reasons on the social

6595
04:02:13,040 --> 04:02:15,040
optics of it has been

6596
04:02:15,040 --> 04:02:17,040
this major forcing function

6597
04:02:17,040 --> 04:02:19,040
for something that

6598
04:02:19,040 --> 04:02:21,040
you know really should be at the corner

6599
04:02:21,040 --> 04:02:23,040
stone of all of the world's concerns

6600
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:25,040
with energy it's interesting

6601
04:02:25,040 --> 04:02:27,040
how the non-technical factors

6602
04:02:27,040 --> 04:02:29,040
have really dominated something that is

6603
04:02:29,040 --> 04:02:31,040
so fundamental to

6604
04:02:31,040 --> 04:02:33,040
kind of the existence of the human race as we

6605
04:02:33,040 --> 04:02:35,040
know it today.

6606
04:02:35,040 --> 04:02:37,040
And much of the troubles of the world including

6607
04:02:37,040 --> 04:02:39,040
wars in different

6608
04:02:39,040 --> 04:02:41,040
parts of the world like Ukraine is energy

6609
04:02:41,040 --> 04:02:43,040
based and

6610
04:02:43,040 --> 04:02:45,040
yeah it's just sitting right there to be solved

6611
04:02:47,040 --> 04:02:49,040
that said

6612
04:02:49,040 --> 04:02:51,040
I mean to me personally I think

6613
04:02:51,040 --> 04:02:53,040
it's clear that if AGI were to be

6614
04:02:53,040 --> 04:02:55,040
achieved that would change the course

6615
04:02:55,040 --> 04:02:57,040
of human history. So AGI

6616
04:02:57,040 --> 04:02:59,040
wise I was

6617
04:02:59,040 --> 04:03:01,040
making this decision about what do I want

6618
04:03:01,040 --> 04:03:03,040
to focus on after

6619
04:03:03,040 --> 04:03:05,040
VR and I'm still working on VR

6620
04:03:05,040 --> 04:03:07,040
regularly I spend a day

6621
04:03:07,040 --> 04:03:09,040
a week kind of consulting with meta

6622
04:03:09,040 --> 04:03:11,040
and you know Bos

6623
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:13,040
styles me the consulting

6624
04:03:13,040 --> 04:03:15,040
CTO is kind of like the Sherlock Holmes

6625
04:03:15,040 --> 04:03:17,040
that comes in and consults on

6626
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:19,040
some of the specific tough issues

6627
04:03:19,040 --> 04:03:21,040
and I'm still pretty passionate about all of

6628
04:03:21,040 --> 04:03:23,040
that but I have been

6629
04:03:23,040 --> 04:03:25,040
figuring out how to compartmentalize

6630
04:03:25,040 --> 04:03:27,040
and force that into a smaller

6631
04:03:27,040 --> 04:03:29,040
box to work on some other things

6632
04:03:29,040 --> 04:03:31,040
and I did come down to this decision between

6633
04:03:31,040 --> 04:03:33,040
working on

6634
04:03:33,040 --> 04:03:35,040
economical nuclear fission or artificial

6635
04:03:35,040 --> 04:03:37,040
general intelligence

6636
04:03:37,040 --> 04:03:39,040
and the fission side of things

6637
04:03:39,040 --> 04:03:41,040
I've got a bunch of interesting things

6638
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:43,040
going that way but

6639
04:03:43,040 --> 04:03:45,040
it would take that would be a fairly big

6640
04:03:45,040 --> 04:03:47,040
project thing to do I don't think

6641
04:03:47,040 --> 04:03:49,040
it needs to be as big as people expect

6642
04:03:49,040 --> 04:03:51,040
I do think something original space

6643
04:03:51,040 --> 04:03:53,040
excised

6644
04:03:53,040 --> 04:03:55,040
you build it power your building off of it

6645
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:57,040
and then the government I think will come

6646
04:03:57,040 --> 04:03:59,040
around to what you need to

6647
04:03:59,040 --> 04:04:01,040
everybody loves an existence proof

6648
04:04:01,040 --> 04:04:03,040
I think it's possible somebody should be doing

6649
04:04:03,040 --> 04:04:05,040
this but it's going to involve

6650
04:04:05,040 --> 04:04:07,040
some politics it's going to involve

6651
04:04:07,040 --> 04:04:09,040
decent size teams and a bunch of this

6652
04:04:09,040 --> 04:04:11,040
cross functional stuff that I don't love

6653
04:04:11,040 --> 04:04:13,040
while

6654
04:04:13,040 --> 04:04:15,040
the artificial general intelligence side of things

6655
04:04:15,040 --> 04:04:17,040
um

6656
04:04:17,040 --> 04:04:19,040
it seems to me like this is

6657
04:04:19,040 --> 04:04:21,040
the highest leverage

6658
04:04:21,040 --> 04:04:23,040
moment for

6659
04:04:23,040 --> 04:04:25,040
potentially a single individual

6660
04:04:25,040 --> 04:04:27,040
potentially in the history of the world

6661
04:04:27,040 --> 04:04:29,040
where the things that we know

6662
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:31,040
about the brain about what we

6663
04:04:31,040 --> 04:04:33,040
can do with artificial intelligence

6664
04:04:33,040 --> 04:04:35,040
uh nobody can say absolutely

6665
04:04:35,040 --> 04:04:37,040
on any of these things but

6666
04:04:37,040 --> 04:04:39,040
I am not a madman

6667
04:04:39,040 --> 04:04:41,040
for saying that it is likely

6668
04:04:41,040 --> 04:04:43,040
that the code for artificial general

6669
04:04:43,040 --> 04:04:45,040
intelligence is going to be

6670
04:04:45,040 --> 04:04:47,040
tens of thousands of lines

6671
04:04:47,040 --> 04:04:49,040
of code not millions of lines

6672
04:04:49,040 --> 04:04:51,040
of code this is code that conceivably

6673
04:04:51,040 --> 04:04:53,040
one individual could

6674
04:04:53,040 --> 04:04:55,040
write unlike writing a new web browser

6675
04:04:55,040 --> 04:04:57,040
operating system

6676
04:04:57,040 --> 04:04:59,040
and based on the

6677
04:04:59,040 --> 04:05:01,040
progress that AI has machine

6678
04:05:01,040 --> 04:05:03,040
learning has made in the recent decade

6679
04:05:03,040 --> 04:05:05,040
it's likely that the

6680
04:05:05,040 --> 04:05:07,040
important things that we don't know

6681
04:05:07,040 --> 04:05:09,040
are relatively simple there's

6682
04:05:09,040 --> 04:05:11,040
probably a handful of things and

6683
04:05:11,040 --> 04:05:13,040
my bet is that

6684
04:05:13,040 --> 04:05:15,040
I think there's less than

6685
04:05:15,040 --> 04:05:17,040
six key insights that need

6686
04:05:17,040 --> 04:05:19,040
to be made each one of them can probably

6687
04:05:19,040 --> 04:05:21,040
be written on the back of an envelope

6688
04:05:21,040 --> 04:05:23,040
we don't know what they are but when they're

6689
04:05:23,040 --> 04:05:25,040
put together in concert with

6690
04:05:25,040 --> 04:05:27,040
GPUs at scale and the data

6691
04:05:27,040 --> 04:05:29,040
that we all have access to that

6692
04:05:29,040 --> 04:05:31,040
we can make something that behaves

6693
04:05:31,040 --> 04:05:33,040
like a human being

6694
04:05:33,040 --> 04:05:35,040
or like a living creature

6695
04:05:35,040 --> 04:05:37,040
and that can then be educated

6696
04:05:37,040 --> 04:05:39,040
in whatever ways that we need to get to the

6697
04:05:39,040 --> 04:05:41,040
point where we can have

6698
04:05:41,040 --> 04:05:43,040
universal remote workers where

6699
04:05:43,040 --> 04:05:45,040
anything that somebody does

6700
04:05:45,040 --> 04:05:47,040
mediated by a computer and doesn't require

6701
04:05:47,040 --> 04:05:49,040
physical interaction

6702
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:51,040
that an AGI will be able to do

6703
04:05:51,040 --> 04:05:53,040
we can already simulate the

6704
04:05:53,040 --> 04:05:55,040
equivalent of the zoom meetings

6705
04:05:55,040 --> 04:05:57,040
with avatars and

6706
04:05:57,040 --> 04:05:59,040
synthetic deepfakes and whatnot

6707
04:05:59,040 --> 04:06:01,040
we can definitely do that

6708
04:06:01,040 --> 04:06:03,040
we have superhuman capabilities

6709
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:05,040
on any narrow thing that we can

6710
04:06:05,040 --> 04:06:07,040
that we can formalize and make a loss

6711
04:06:07,040 --> 04:06:09,040
function for but there's things we don't

6712
04:06:09,040 --> 04:06:11,040
know how to do now but I don't

6713
04:06:11,040 --> 04:06:13,040
think they are unapproachably

6714
04:06:13,040 --> 04:06:15,040
hard now that's incredibly hubristic

6715
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:17,040
to say that it's like

6716
04:06:17,040 --> 04:06:19,040
but I think that what I said a couple

6717
04:06:19,040 --> 04:06:21,040
years ago is a 50% chance

6718
04:06:21,040 --> 04:06:23,040
that somewhere there will be signs of

6719
04:06:23,040 --> 04:06:25,040
life of AGI in

6720
04:06:25,040 --> 04:06:27,040
2030 and I've probably increased

6721
04:06:27,040 --> 04:06:29,040
that slightly I may be at

6722
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:31,040
55-60% now because

6723
04:06:31,040 --> 04:06:33,040
I do think there's a little sense of

6724
04:06:33,040 --> 04:06:35,040
acceleration there

6725
04:06:35,040 --> 04:06:37,040
so I wonder what the and by the way you also

6726
04:06:37,040 --> 04:06:39,040
written that I

6727
04:06:39,040 --> 04:06:41,040
bet with hindsight we will find that

6728
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:43,040
clear antecedents of all the critical

6729
04:06:43,040 --> 04:06:45,040
remaining steps for AGI

6730
04:06:45,040 --> 04:06:47,040
are already buried somewhere

6731
04:06:47,040 --> 04:06:49,040
in the vast literature of today so the

6732
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:51,040
ideas are already there

6733
04:06:51,040 --> 04:06:53,040
I think that's likely the case one of the

6734
04:06:53,040 --> 04:06:55,040
things that appeals to so many people

6735
04:06:55,040 --> 04:06:57,040
including me about the promise of AGI

6736
04:06:57,040 --> 04:06:59,040
is we know that

6737
04:06:59,040 --> 04:07:01,040
we're only drinking from a straw from

6738
04:07:01,040 --> 04:07:03,040
the fire hose of all the information

6739
04:07:03,040 --> 04:07:05,040
out there I mean you look at

6740
04:07:05,040 --> 04:07:07,040
just in a very narrowly

6741
04:07:07,040 --> 04:07:09,040
bounded field like machine learning like

6742
04:07:09,040 --> 04:07:11,040
you can't read all the papers that come out

6743
04:07:11,040 --> 04:07:13,040
all the time you can't go back

6744
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:15,040
and read all the clever things that people

6745
04:07:15,040 --> 04:07:17,040
did in the 90s or earlier that people

6746
04:07:17,040 --> 04:07:19,040
have forgotten about because they didn't pan out

6747
04:07:19,040 --> 04:07:21,040
at the time when they were trying to do them with 12 neurons

6748
04:07:21,040 --> 04:07:23,040
and

6749
04:07:23,040 --> 04:07:25,040
so that this idea that

6750
04:07:25,040 --> 04:07:27,040
yeah I think there are gems

6751
04:07:27,040 --> 04:07:29,040
buried in some of the older literature that

6752
04:07:29,040 --> 04:07:31,040
was not the path taken by everything

6753
04:07:31,040 --> 04:07:33,040
and you can see a kind of heard

6754
04:07:33,040 --> 04:07:35,040
mentality on the things that happen right now

6755
04:07:35,040 --> 04:07:37,040
it's almost funny to see

6756
04:07:37,040 --> 04:07:39,040
like oh Google does something and open AI

6757
04:07:39,040 --> 04:07:41,040
does something meta does something and

6758
04:07:41,040 --> 04:07:43,040
you know they're the same people that all talk

6759
04:07:43,040 --> 04:07:45,040
to each other and they all one up in each other

6760
04:07:45,040 --> 04:07:47,040
and they're all capable of implementing

6761
04:07:47,040 --> 04:07:49,040
each other's work given a month

6762
04:07:49,040 --> 04:07:51,040
or two after somebody has an announcement

6763
04:07:51,040 --> 04:07:53,040
of that but there's

6764
04:07:53,040 --> 04:07:55,040
a whole world of possible

6765
04:07:55,040 --> 04:07:57,040
approaches to machine learning

6766
04:07:57,040 --> 04:07:59,040
and I think that

6767
04:07:59,040 --> 04:08:01,040
we probably will in hindsight go back and see

6768
04:08:01,040 --> 04:08:03,040
it's like yeah that was kind of clearly

6769
04:08:03,040 --> 04:08:05,040
predicted by this early paper

6770
04:08:05,040 --> 04:08:07,040
here you know and this turns

6771
04:08:07,040 --> 04:08:09,040
out that if you do this and this and take this result

6772
04:08:09,040 --> 04:08:11,040
from animal training

6773
04:08:11,040 --> 04:08:13,040
and this thing from neuroscience over

6774
04:08:13,040 --> 04:08:15,040
here and put it together and set

6775
04:08:15,040 --> 04:08:17,040
up this curriculum for them to learn in

6776
04:08:17,040 --> 04:08:19,040
that that's kind of what it took

6777
04:08:19,040 --> 04:08:21,040
you don't have too many people

6778
04:08:21,040 --> 04:08:23,040
now that are still saying it's not

6779
04:08:23,040 --> 04:08:25,040
possible or it's going to take hundreds of years

6780
04:08:25,040 --> 04:08:27,040
and ten years ago you would get

6781
04:08:27,040 --> 04:08:29,040
you would collect get a collection of experts

6782
04:08:29,040 --> 04:08:31,040
and you would have a decent chunk on the margin

6783
04:08:31,040 --> 04:08:33,040
that either say not possible

6784
04:08:33,040 --> 04:08:35,040
or couple hundred

6785
04:08:35,040 --> 04:08:37,040
years might be centuries and the median

6786
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:39,040
estimate would be like

6787
04:08:39,040 --> 04:08:41,040
fifty seventy years and it's been

6788
04:08:41,040 --> 04:08:43,040
coming down and I know with me saying

6789
04:08:43,040 --> 04:08:45,040
eight years for something that still puts me on

6790
04:08:45,040 --> 04:08:47,040
the optimistic side but it's not

6791
04:08:47,040 --> 04:08:49,040
crazy out in the fringes

6792
04:08:49,040 --> 04:08:51,040
and just being able to look at that at

6793
04:08:51,040 --> 04:08:53,040
a meta level about the

6794
04:08:53,040 --> 04:08:55,040
trend of the

6795
04:08:55,040 --> 04:08:57,040
predictions going down there

6796
04:08:57,040 --> 04:08:59,040
the idea that something could

6797
04:08:59,040 --> 04:09:01,040
be happening relatively soon

6798
04:09:01,040 --> 04:09:03,040
now

6799
04:09:03,040 --> 04:09:05,040
I do not believe in fast takeoffs

6800
04:09:05,040 --> 04:09:07,040
that's one of the safety issues that people say

6801
04:09:07,040 --> 04:09:09,040
it's like oh it's going to go fume and the AI

6802
04:09:09,040 --> 04:09:11,040
is going to take over the world there's a lot of reasons

6803
04:09:11,040 --> 04:09:13,040
I don't think that's a credible

6804
04:09:13,040 --> 04:09:15,040
position

6805
04:09:15,040 --> 04:09:17,040
and I think that we will go from a point

6806
04:09:17,040 --> 04:09:19,040
where we start seeing things

6807
04:09:19,040 --> 04:09:21,040
that credibly look like

6808
04:09:21,040 --> 04:09:23,040
look like animals behaviors

6809
04:09:23,040 --> 04:09:25,040
and I have a human voice box wired into them

6810
04:09:25,040 --> 04:09:27,040
it's like I tried to get Elon

6811
04:09:27,040 --> 04:09:29,040
to say it's like your your pig in neuro

6812
04:09:29,040 --> 04:09:31,040
link give it a human voice box and let it start

6813
04:09:31,040 --> 04:09:33,040
learning human words

6814
04:09:33,040 --> 04:09:35,040
I think that you know I think animal

6815
04:09:35,040 --> 04:09:37,040
intelligence is closer to human intelligence

6816
04:09:37,040 --> 04:09:39,040
than a lot of people like to think

6817
04:09:39,040 --> 04:09:41,040
and I think that culture and modalities

6818
04:09:41,040 --> 04:09:43,040
of IO are

6819
04:09:43,040 --> 04:09:45,040
make the Gulf seem a lot bigger than it

6820
04:09:45,040 --> 04:09:47,040
actually is there's just that smooth

6821
04:09:47,040 --> 04:09:49,040
spectrum of how the brain developed

6822
04:09:49,040 --> 04:09:51,040
and cortexes and

6823
04:09:51,040 --> 04:09:53,040
scaling of different things going on there

6824
04:09:53,040 --> 04:09:55,040
cultural modalities of IO

6825
04:09:55,040 --> 04:09:57,040
yes languages

6826
04:09:57,040 --> 04:09:59,040
um the

6827
04:09:59,040 --> 04:10:01,040
sort of loss in translation conceals a

6828
04:10:01,040 --> 04:10:03,040
lot of intelligence and

6829
04:10:03,040 --> 04:10:05,040
so your when you think about

6830
04:10:05,040 --> 04:10:07,040
signs of life for AGI you're

6831
04:10:07,040 --> 04:10:09,040
thinking about

6832
04:10:09,040 --> 04:10:11,040
human interpretable signs so the example

6833
04:10:11,040 --> 04:10:13,040
I give it if we get to the point where you've got

6834
04:10:13,040 --> 04:10:15,040
a learning disabled toddler

6835
04:10:15,040 --> 04:10:17,040
some some kind of real special needs

6836
04:10:17,040 --> 04:10:19,040
a child that can still

6837
04:10:19,040 --> 04:10:21,040
interact with their favorite TV show and

6838
04:10:21,040 --> 04:10:23,040
video game and can be

6839
04:10:23,040 --> 04:10:25,040
trained and learn in some

6840
04:10:25,040 --> 04:10:27,040
appreciably human like way

6841
04:10:27,040 --> 04:10:29,040
at that point you can deploy an army

6842
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:31,040
of engineers

6843
04:10:31,040 --> 04:10:33,040
cognitive scientist education developmental

6844
04:10:33,040 --> 04:10:35,040
developmental education people

6845
04:10:35,040 --> 04:10:37,040
and you've got so many advantages

6846
04:10:37,040 --> 04:10:39,040
there unlike real education where you can

6847
04:10:39,040 --> 04:10:41,040
do rollbacks and a B testing and you

6848
04:10:41,040 --> 04:10:43,040
can find a golden path through a curriculum

6849
04:10:43,040 --> 04:10:45,040
of different things if you get to that

6850
04:10:45,040 --> 04:10:47,040
point learning disabled toddler

6851
04:10:47,040 --> 04:10:49,040
I think that it's

6852
04:10:49,040 --> 04:10:51,040
it's going to be a done deal but you

6853
04:10:51,040 --> 04:10:53,040
think we'll we'll know when we see

6854
04:10:53,040 --> 04:10:55,040
it so there's

6855
04:10:55,040 --> 04:10:57,040
there's been a lot of really interesting

6856
04:10:57,040 --> 04:10:59,040
general learning progress from

6857
04:10:59,040 --> 04:11:01,040
DeepMind open the eye a little bit

6858
04:11:01,040 --> 04:11:03,040
to I

6859
04:11:03,040 --> 04:11:05,040
tend to believe that

6860
04:11:05,040 --> 04:11:07,040
Tesla autopilot deserves a

6861
04:11:07,040 --> 04:11:09,040
lot more credit than it's getting

6862
04:11:09,040 --> 04:11:11,040
for making progress

6863
04:11:11,040 --> 04:11:13,040
on the general answer

6864
04:11:13,040 --> 04:11:15,040
on the doing the multitask learning

6865
04:11:15,040 --> 04:11:17,040
thing and increasing the number of tasks

6866
04:11:17,040 --> 04:11:19,040
and automating that

6867
04:11:19,040 --> 04:11:21,040
process of

6868
04:11:21,040 --> 04:11:23,040
sort of

6869
04:11:23,040 --> 04:11:25,040
learning from the edge could discover in the edge

6870
04:11:25,040 --> 04:11:27,040
cases and learn from the edge cases that is

6871
04:11:27,040 --> 04:11:29,040
it's really approaching

6872
04:11:29,040 --> 04:11:31,040
from a different angle the general learning

6873
04:11:31,040 --> 04:11:33,040
problem of AGI

6874
04:11:33,040 --> 04:11:35,040
but the more clear approach

6875
04:11:35,040 --> 04:11:37,040
comes from DeepMind where you have these

6876
04:11:37,040 --> 04:11:39,040
kind of game situations and

6877
04:11:39,040 --> 04:11:41,040
build systems there

6878
04:11:41,040 --> 04:11:43,040
but I don't know

6879
04:11:43,040 --> 04:11:45,040
people seem to be quite

6880
04:11:47,040 --> 04:11:49,040
there will always be people that

6881
04:11:49,040 --> 04:11:51,040
just won't believe it and I fundamentally

6882
04:11:51,040 --> 04:11:53,040
don't care I mean I don't care

6883
04:11:53,040 --> 04:11:55,040
if they don't believe it I

6884
04:11:55,040 --> 04:11:57,040
when it starts doing people's jobs

6885
04:11:57,040 --> 04:11:59,040
and I mean I don't care about the

6886
04:11:59,040 --> 04:12:01,040
philosophical zombie argument at all

6887
04:12:01,040 --> 04:12:03,040
absolutely but will you

6888
04:12:03,040 --> 04:12:05,040
do you think you will notice that something

6889
04:12:05,040 --> 04:12:07,040
special has happened here and or

6890
04:12:09,040 --> 04:12:11,040
because to me I've been noticing

6891
04:12:11,040 --> 04:12:13,040
a lot of special things

6892
04:12:13,040 --> 04:12:15,040
I think a lot of credit should go to

6893
04:12:15,040 --> 04:12:17,040
DeepMind for

6894
04:12:17,040 --> 04:12:19,040
AlphaZero

6895
04:12:19,040 --> 04:12:21,040
that was truly special

6896
04:12:21,040 --> 04:12:23,040
self-play mechanisms achieve

6897
04:12:23,040 --> 04:12:25,040
sort of solve problems that

6898
04:12:25,040 --> 04:12:27,040
used to be thought unsolvable

6899
04:12:27,040 --> 04:12:29,040
like the game of go

6900
04:12:29,040 --> 04:12:31,040
so I mean protein folding

6901
04:12:31,040 --> 04:12:33,040
starting to get into that space where

6902
04:12:33,040 --> 04:12:35,040
learning is doing

6903
04:12:35,040 --> 04:12:37,040
at first it wasn't

6904
04:12:37,040 --> 04:12:39,040
end-to-end learning now it's

6905
04:12:39,040 --> 04:12:41,040
end-to-end learning of a

6906
04:12:41,040 --> 04:12:43,040
very difficult previously thought

6907
04:12:43,040 --> 04:12:45,040
unsolvable problem of protein folding

6908
04:12:45,040 --> 04:12:47,040
and so

6909
04:12:47,040 --> 04:12:49,040
yeah

6910
04:12:49,040 --> 04:12:51,040
where do you think

6911
04:12:51,040 --> 04:12:53,040
would be a really magical

6912
04:12:53,040 --> 04:12:55,040
moment for you?

6913
04:12:55,040 --> 04:12:57,040
there have been incredible things happening

6914
04:12:57,040 --> 04:12:59,040
in years like you say all of the things

6915
04:12:59,040 --> 04:13:01,040
from DeepMind and OpenAI that have been

6916
04:13:01,040 --> 04:13:03,040
huge showpiece things

6917
04:13:03,040 --> 04:13:05,040
but when you really get down to it

6918
04:13:05,040 --> 04:13:07,040
and you read the papers and you look at the way

6919
04:13:07,040 --> 04:13:09,040
the models are going

6920
04:13:09,040 --> 04:13:11,040
it's still like a feed forward

6921
04:13:11,040 --> 04:13:13,040
you push something in something comes out

6922
04:13:13,040 --> 04:13:15,040
on the end I mean maybe there's

6923
04:13:15,040 --> 04:13:17,040
diffusion models or Monte Carlo tree

6924
04:13:17,040 --> 04:13:19,040
rollouts and different things going on

6925
04:13:19,040 --> 04:13:21,040
but it's not a being

6926
04:13:21,040 --> 04:13:23,040
it's not close to a being

6927
04:13:23,040 --> 04:13:25,040
that's going through

6928
04:13:25,040 --> 04:13:27,040
a lifelong learning process

6929
04:13:27,040 --> 04:13:29,040
so you want something that kind of

6930
04:13:29,040 --> 04:13:31,040
gives signs of a being

6931
04:13:31,040 --> 04:13:33,040
what's the difference

6932
04:13:33,040 --> 04:13:35,040
between

6933
04:13:35,040 --> 04:13:37,040
a neural network

6934
04:13:37,040 --> 04:13:39,040
a feed forward neural network and a being

6935
04:13:39,040 --> 04:13:41,040
so where's the...

6936
04:13:41,040 --> 04:13:43,040
fundamentally the brain is a recurrent neural

6937
04:13:43,040 --> 04:13:45,040
network generating an action policy

6938
04:13:45,040 --> 04:13:47,040
I mean it's implemented on a biological

6939
04:13:47,040 --> 04:13:49,040
substrate and it's interesting thinking about

6940
04:13:49,040 --> 04:13:51,040
things like that where we know

6941
04:13:51,040 --> 04:13:53,040
fundamentally the brain is not

6942
04:13:53,040 --> 04:13:55,040
an additional neural network or a transformer

6943
04:13:55,040 --> 04:13:57,040
those are specialized things

6944
04:13:57,040 --> 04:13:59,040
that are very valuable for what we're doing

6945
04:13:59,040 --> 04:14:01,040
but it's not the way the brain is doing

6946
04:14:01,040 --> 04:14:03,040
now I do think consciousness and

6947
04:14:03,040 --> 04:14:05,040
AI in general is a

6948
04:14:05,040 --> 04:14:07,040
substrate independent mechanism

6949
04:14:07,040 --> 04:14:09,040
where it doesn't have to be implemented the way

6950
04:14:09,040 --> 04:14:11,040
the brain is but if you've only got

6951
04:14:11,040 --> 04:14:13,040
one existence proof there's certainly

6952
04:14:13,040 --> 04:14:15,040
some value in caring about what it says

6953
04:14:15,040 --> 04:14:17,040
and does

6954
04:14:17,040 --> 04:14:19,040
and so the idea

6955
04:14:19,040 --> 04:14:21,040
that anything that can be done with a

6956
04:14:21,040 --> 04:14:23,040
low AI that you can quantify up a

6957
04:14:23,040 --> 04:14:25,040
loss function for a reward mechanism

6958
04:14:25,040 --> 04:14:27,040
you're almost certainly going to be

6959
04:14:27,040 --> 04:14:29,040
able to produce something that's more

6960
04:14:29,040 --> 04:14:31,040
resource effective to train and

6961
04:14:31,040 --> 04:14:33,040
deploy and use in an inference mode

6962
04:14:33,040 --> 04:14:35,040
you know train a whole lot using an inference

6963
04:14:35,040 --> 04:14:37,040
but a living being

6964
04:14:37,040 --> 04:14:39,040
is going to be something that's a continuous

6965
04:14:39,040 --> 04:14:41,040
lifelong learned task

6966
04:14:41,040 --> 04:14:43,040
agnostic thing

6967
04:14:43,040 --> 04:14:45,040
and while a lot of...

6968
04:14:45,040 --> 04:14:47,040
So the lifelong learning is really important too

6969
04:14:47,040 --> 04:14:49,040
and the long term memory

6970
04:14:49,040 --> 04:14:51,040
is a big weird part of that

6971
04:14:51,040 --> 04:14:53,040
and we've got

6972
04:14:53,040 --> 04:14:55,040
again I have all the respect in the world

6973
04:14:55,040 --> 04:14:57,040
for the amazing things that are being done

6974
04:14:57,040 --> 04:14:59,040
now but sometimes they can be taken

6975
04:14:59,040 --> 04:15:01,040
a little bit out of context with things

6976
04:15:01,040 --> 04:15:03,040
like there's some smoking

6977
04:15:03,040 --> 04:15:05,040
mirrors going on like the GATO

6978
04:15:05,040 --> 04:15:07,040
the recent work the multi-task learning stuff

6979
04:15:07,040 --> 04:15:09,040
you know it's amazing that it's the one

6980
04:15:09,040 --> 04:15:11,040
it's one model that plays all the

6981
04:15:11,040 --> 04:15:13,040
Atari games I am as well

6982
04:15:13,040 --> 04:15:15,040
as doing all these other things

6983
04:15:15,040 --> 04:15:17,040
but of course it didn't learn to do all

6984
04:15:17,040 --> 04:15:19,040
of those it was instructed in doing

6985
04:15:19,040 --> 04:15:21,040
that by other reinforcement learners

6986
04:15:21,040 --> 04:15:23,040
going through and doing that

6987
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:25,040
and even in the case of all the games

6988
04:15:25,040 --> 04:15:27,040
it's still going with a specific

6989
04:15:27,040 --> 04:15:29,040
hand-coded reward function

6990
04:15:29,040 --> 04:15:31,040
in each of those Atari games

6991
04:15:31,040 --> 04:15:33,040
where it's not that you know how does it

6992
04:15:33,040 --> 04:15:35,040
just wants to spend its summer afternoon playing

6993
04:15:35,040 --> 04:15:37,040
Atari because that's the most interesting

6994
04:15:37,040 --> 04:15:39,040
thing for it so it's again not

6995
04:15:39,040 --> 04:15:41,040
a general it's not learning the way humans

6996
04:15:41,040 --> 04:15:43,040
learn and there's

6997
04:15:43,040 --> 04:15:45,040
I believe a lot of things that are

6998
04:15:45,040 --> 04:15:47,040
challenging to make a loss function

6999
04:15:47,040 --> 04:15:49,040
for that you can train

7000
04:15:49,040 --> 04:15:51,040
through these existing conventional things

7001
04:15:51,040 --> 04:15:53,040
we're going to chip away at all the things

7002
04:15:53,040 --> 04:15:55,040
that people do

7003
04:15:55,040 --> 04:15:57,040
that we can turn into narrow

7004
04:15:57,040 --> 04:15:59,040
AI problems

7005
04:15:59,040 --> 04:16:01,040
and billions of probably trillions

7006
04:16:01,040 --> 04:16:03,040
of dollars of value are going to be created

7007
04:16:03,040 --> 04:16:05,040
by that but there's still going

7008
04:16:05,040 --> 04:16:07,040
to be a set of things and we've got questionable

7009
04:16:07,040 --> 04:16:09,040
cases like the self-driving car

7010
04:16:09,040 --> 04:16:11,040
where it's possible

7011
04:16:11,040 --> 04:16:13,040
it's not my bet but it's plausible

7012
04:16:13,040 --> 04:16:15,040
that the long tail could be problematic

7013
04:16:15,040 --> 04:16:17,040
enough that that really does require

7014
04:16:17,040 --> 04:16:19,040
a full-on artificial general intelligence

7015
04:16:19,040 --> 04:16:21,040
the counter argument

7016
04:16:21,040 --> 04:16:23,040
is that data solves almost everything

7017
04:16:23,040 --> 04:16:25,040
is an interpolation problem if you have enough data

7018
04:16:25,040 --> 04:16:27,040
and Tesla may be able to get enough

7019
04:16:27,040 --> 04:16:29,040
data from all of their

7020
04:16:29,040 --> 04:16:31,040
deployed stuff to be able to work like that

7021
04:16:31,040 --> 04:16:33,040
but maybe not and

7022
04:16:33,040 --> 04:16:35,040
there are all the other problems about like say

7023
04:16:35,040 --> 04:16:37,040
you want to have a strategy meeting

7024
04:16:37,040 --> 04:16:39,040
and you want to go ahead and bring in all of your

7025
04:16:39,040 --> 04:16:41,040
remote workers and your consultants

7026
04:16:41,040 --> 04:16:43,040
and you want a world where some of those could

7027
04:16:43,040 --> 04:16:45,040
be AIs that are

7028
04:16:45,040 --> 04:16:47,040
you know that are talking and interacting

7029
04:16:47,040 --> 04:16:49,040
with you in an area

7030
04:16:49,040 --> 04:16:51,040
that is too murky to have a crisp loss function

7031
04:16:51,040 --> 04:16:53,040
but they still have

7032
04:16:53,040 --> 04:16:55,040
things that on some level they're

7033
04:16:55,040 --> 04:16:57,040
rewarded on some internal level

7034
04:16:57,040 --> 04:16:59,040
for building a valuable to humans

7035
04:16:59,040 --> 04:17:01,040
kind of life

7036
04:17:01,040 --> 04:17:03,040
and ability to interact with things

7037
04:17:03,040 --> 04:17:05,040
see I still think that

7038
04:17:05,040 --> 04:17:07,040
self-driving car

7039
04:17:07,040 --> 04:17:09,040
solving that problem will take us very far

7040
04:17:09,040 --> 04:17:11,040
towards AGI you might not need AGI

7041
04:17:11,040 --> 04:17:13,040
but I am really

7042
04:17:13,040 --> 04:17:15,040
inspired by what

7043
04:17:15,040 --> 04:17:17,040
autopilot is doing

7044
04:17:17,040 --> 04:17:19,040
Waymo

7045
04:17:19,040 --> 04:17:21,040
so some of the other companies I think Waymo leads

7046
04:17:21,040 --> 04:17:23,040
the way there

7047
04:17:23,040 --> 04:17:25,040
is also really interesting but they don't have quite

7048
04:17:25,040 --> 04:17:27,040
as ambitious of an effort in terms of

7049
04:17:27,040 --> 04:17:29,040
learning based

7050
04:17:29,040 --> 04:17:31,040
sort of data hungry

7051
04:17:31,040 --> 04:17:33,040
approach to driving which I think

7052
04:17:33,040 --> 04:17:35,040
is very close to the kind of thing that would

7053
04:17:35,040 --> 04:17:37,040
take us far

7054
04:17:37,040 --> 04:17:39,040
and it's a funny thing

7055
04:17:39,040 --> 04:17:41,040
because as far as I can tell

7056
04:17:41,040 --> 04:17:43,040
Elon is completely serious about all of his concerns

7057
04:17:43,040 --> 04:17:45,040
about AGI

7058
04:17:45,040 --> 04:17:47,040
being an existential threat and

7059
04:17:47,040 --> 04:17:49,040
I tried to draw him out to talk about AI

7060
04:17:49,040 --> 04:17:51,040
and he just didn't want to

7061
04:17:51,040 --> 04:17:53,040
and I think that

7062
04:17:53,040 --> 04:17:55,040
I get that little fatalistic sense from him

7063
04:17:55,040 --> 04:17:57,040
and it's weird because his company

7064
04:17:57,040 --> 04:17:59,040
could very well be the leading company

7065
04:17:59,040 --> 04:18:01,040
leading towards a lot of that

7066
04:18:01,040 --> 04:18:03,040
where Tesla being a super pragmatic company

7067
04:18:03,040 --> 04:18:05,040
that's doing things

7068
04:18:05,040 --> 04:18:07,040
because they really want to solve this actual problem

7069
04:18:07,040 --> 04:18:09,040
it's a different vibe than the

7070
04:18:09,040 --> 04:18:11,040
research-oriented companies

7071
04:18:11,040 --> 04:18:13,040
where it's a great time to be an AI researcher

7072
04:18:13,040 --> 04:18:15,040
you've got your pick of trillion-dollar companies

7073
04:18:15,040 --> 04:18:17,040
that will pay you to kind of work on the problems

7074
04:18:17,040 --> 04:18:19,040
you're interested in

7075
04:18:19,040 --> 04:18:21,040
but that's not necessarily driving hard

7076
04:18:21,040 --> 04:18:23,040
towards the core problem

7077
04:18:23,040 --> 04:18:25,040
of AGI as something that's going to produce

7078
04:18:25,040 --> 04:18:27,040
a lot of value by doing things

7079
04:18:27,040 --> 04:18:29,040
that people currently do

7080
04:18:29,040 --> 04:18:31,040
or would like to do

7081
04:18:31,040 --> 04:18:33,040
I mean I have a million questions to you

7082
04:18:33,040 --> 04:18:35,040
about your ideas about AGI

7083
04:18:35,040 --> 04:18:37,040
but do you think

7084
04:18:37,040 --> 04:18:39,040
it needs to be embodied

7085
04:18:39,040 --> 04:18:41,040
do you think it needs to have a body

7086
04:18:41,040 --> 04:18:43,040
to start to

7087
04:18:43,040 --> 04:18:45,040
notice the signs of life

7088
04:18:45,040 --> 04:18:47,040
to develop the kind of system that's able

7089
04:18:47,040 --> 04:18:49,040
to

7090
04:18:49,040 --> 04:18:51,040
perceive the world in the way that an AGI should

7091
04:18:51,040 --> 04:18:53,040
and act in the world

7092
04:18:53,040 --> 04:18:55,040
so should we be thinking about robots

7093
04:18:55,040 --> 04:18:57,040
or can this be achieved in a

7094
04:18:57,040 --> 04:18:59,040
purely digital system?

7095
04:18:59,040 --> 04:19:01,040
I have a clear opinion on that

7096
04:19:01,040 --> 04:19:03,040
no it does not need to be

7097
04:19:03,040 --> 04:19:05,040
embodied in the physical world where

7098
04:19:05,040 --> 04:19:07,040
you could say most of my career

7099
04:19:07,040 --> 04:19:09,040
is about making simulated virtual

7100
04:19:09,040 --> 04:19:11,040
worlds in games or virtual

7101
04:19:11,040 --> 04:19:13,040
reality and so

7102
04:19:13,040 --> 04:19:15,040
on a fundamental level I believe that you can

7103
04:19:15,040 --> 04:19:17,040
make a simulated environment that provides

7104
04:19:17,040 --> 04:19:19,040
much of the value of what the real environment

7105
04:19:19,040 --> 04:19:21,040
does and restricting yourself

7106
04:19:21,040 --> 04:19:23,040
to operating at

7107
04:19:23,040 --> 04:19:25,040
real-time in the physical world with physical

7108
04:19:25,040 --> 04:19:27,040
objects I think is an enormous handicap

7109
04:19:27,040 --> 04:19:29,040
I mean that's one of the real

7110
04:19:29,040 --> 04:19:31,040
lessons driven home by all my aerospace

7111
04:19:31,040 --> 04:19:33,040
work is that

7112
04:19:33,040 --> 04:19:35,040
reality is a bitch

7113
04:19:35,040 --> 04:19:37,040
in so many ways there we're dealing with all

7114
04:19:37,040 --> 04:19:39,040
the mechanical components like everything

7115
04:19:39,040 --> 04:19:41,040
fails Murphy's law even if you've done

7116
04:19:41,040 --> 04:19:43,040
it right before on your fifth one it might come

7117
04:19:43,040 --> 04:19:45,040
out differently so

7118
04:19:45,040 --> 04:19:47,040
I think that anybody

7119
04:19:47,040 --> 04:19:49,040
that is all in on the

7120
04:19:49,040 --> 04:19:51,040
embodied aspect of it they are

7121
04:19:51,040 --> 04:19:53,040
tying a huge weight to their ankles

7122
04:19:53,040 --> 04:19:55,040
and I think that

7123
04:19:55,040 --> 04:19:57,040
I would almost count

7124
04:19:57,040 --> 04:19:59,040
them out anybody that's making that a cornerstone

7125
04:19:59,040 --> 04:20:01,040
of their belief about it I would almost write

7126
04:20:01,040 --> 04:20:03,040
them off as being worried about them

7127
04:20:03,040 --> 04:20:05,040
getting to AGI first

7128
04:20:05,040 --> 04:20:07,040
I was very surprised that Elon's big on

7129
04:20:07,040 --> 04:20:09,040
the humanoid robots

7130
04:20:09,040 --> 04:20:11,040
I mean like the NASA Robonaut stuff was always

7131
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:13,040
almost a gag line

7132
04:20:13,040 --> 04:20:15,040
like what are you doing people well that's

7133
04:20:15,040 --> 04:20:17,040
very interesting because he has a very pragmatic

7134
04:20:17,040 --> 04:20:19,040
view of that that's just

7135
04:20:19,040 --> 04:20:21,040
a

7136
04:20:21,040 --> 04:20:23,040
way to solve a particular problem in a factory

7137
04:20:23,040 --> 04:20:25,040
now I do think that once

7138
04:20:25,040 --> 04:20:27,040
you have an AGI robotic bodies

7139
04:20:27,040 --> 04:20:29,040
humanoid bodies are going to be enormously

7140
04:20:29,040 --> 04:20:31,040
valuable I just don't think they're helpful

7141
04:20:31,040 --> 04:20:33,040
getting to AGI

7142
04:20:33,040 --> 04:20:35,040
he has a very sort of practical view which

7143
04:20:35,040 --> 04:20:37,040
I disagree with and I argue with him

7144
04:20:37,040 --> 04:20:39,040
but it's a practical view that there's

7145
04:20:39,040 --> 04:20:41,040
you know you could transfer

7146
04:20:41,040 --> 04:20:43,040
the problem of driving

7147
04:20:43,040 --> 04:20:45,040
to the problem of

7148
04:20:45,040 --> 04:20:47,040
robotic manipulation

7149
04:20:47,040 --> 04:20:49,040
because so much of it is perception

7150
04:20:49,040 --> 04:20:51,040
it's perception and action

7151
04:20:51,040 --> 04:20:53,040
and it's just a different context

7152
04:20:53,040 --> 04:20:55,040
and so you can apply all the same kind

7153
04:20:55,040 --> 04:20:57,040
of data engine

7154
04:20:57,040 --> 04:20:59,040
learning processes to a different

7155
04:20:59,040 --> 04:21:01,040
environment and so why not

7156
04:21:01,040 --> 04:21:03,040
apply it to the humanoid robot environment

7157
04:21:03,040 --> 04:21:05,040
but

7158
04:21:05,040 --> 04:21:07,040
I think

7159
04:21:07,040 --> 04:21:09,040
I do think that there's a certain

7160
04:21:09,040 --> 04:21:11,040
magic to the body

7161
04:21:11,040 --> 04:21:13,040
robot

7162
04:21:13,040 --> 04:21:15,040
that may be the thing that finally convinces people

7163
04:21:15,040 --> 04:21:17,040
yes again I don't really care

7164
04:21:17,040 --> 04:21:19,040
that much about convincing people you know

7165
04:21:19,040 --> 04:21:21,040
the world that I'm looking towards is

7166
04:21:21,040 --> 04:21:23,040
you know you I

7167
04:21:23,040 --> 04:21:25,040
you go to the website and say

7168
04:21:25,040 --> 04:21:27,040
I want five Frank 1As to

7169
04:21:27,040 --> 04:21:29,040
work on my team today and they all spin up

7170
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:31,040
and they start showing up in your zoom meetings

7171
04:21:31,040 --> 04:21:33,040
to push back but also

7172
04:21:33,040 --> 04:21:35,040
to agree with you but first to push back

7173
04:21:35,040 --> 04:21:37,040
I do think you need to convince people

7174
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:39,040
for them to welcome that thing

7175
04:21:39,040 --> 04:21:41,040
into their life

7176
04:21:41,040 --> 04:21:43,040
I think there's enough businesses that operate

7177
04:21:43,040 --> 04:21:45,040
on an objective kind of profit

7178
04:21:45,040 --> 04:21:47,040
loss sort of basis that

7179
04:21:47,040 --> 04:21:49,040
I mean if you look at how many things

7180
04:21:49,040 --> 04:21:51,040
again talking about the world as an evolutionary

7181
04:21:51,040 --> 04:21:53,040
space there

7182
04:21:53,040 --> 04:21:55,040
when you do have free markets and you have

7183
04:21:55,040 --> 04:21:57,040
entrepreneurs

7184
04:21:57,040 --> 04:21:59,040
you're going to have people that are going to be willing to go out and try

7185
04:21:59,040 --> 04:22:01,040
whatever crazy things

7186
04:22:01,040 --> 04:22:03,040
and when it proves to be beneficial

7187
04:22:03,040 --> 04:22:05,040
you know there's fast followers in all sorts of places

7188
04:22:05,040 --> 04:22:07,040
yeah and

7189
04:22:07,040 --> 04:22:09,040
you're saying that I mean

7190
04:22:09,040 --> 04:22:11,040
Quake and VR

7191
04:22:11,040 --> 04:22:13,040
is a kind of embodiment but just in a

7192
04:22:13,040 --> 04:22:15,040
digital world and if you're able to

7193
04:22:15,040 --> 04:22:17,040
demonstrate if you're

7194
04:22:17,040 --> 04:22:19,040
able to do something productive in that kind of

7195
04:22:19,040 --> 04:22:21,040
digital

7196
04:22:21,040 --> 04:22:23,040
reality

7197
04:22:23,040 --> 04:22:25,040
then AGI

7198
04:22:25,040 --> 04:22:27,040
doesn't need to have a body.

7199
04:22:27,040 --> 04:22:29,040
It's like one of the really practical technical questions

7200
04:22:29,040 --> 04:22:31,040
that I kind of keep arguing with myself over

7201
04:22:31,040 --> 04:22:33,040
if you're

7202
04:22:33,040 --> 04:22:35,040
doing a training and learning and you've got

7203
04:22:35,040 --> 04:22:37,040
like you can watch Sesame Street and you can play

7204
04:22:37,040 --> 04:22:39,040
Master System games or something

7205
04:22:39,040 --> 04:22:41,040
is it enough to have just a video feed

7206
04:22:41,040 --> 04:22:43,040
that is that video coming in

7207
04:22:43,040 --> 04:22:45,040
or should it literally be

7208
04:22:45,040 --> 04:22:47,040
a virtual TV set in a virtual room

7209
04:22:47,040 --> 04:22:49,040
even if it's a simple room

7210
04:22:49,040 --> 04:22:51,040
just to have that sense of

7211
04:22:51,040 --> 04:22:53,040
you're looking at a 2D projection on a screen

7212
04:22:53,040 --> 04:22:55,040
versus having the screen beam directly

7213
04:22:55,040 --> 04:22:57,040
into your retinas

7214
04:22:57,040 --> 04:22:59,040
and I think it's possible

7215
04:22:59,040 --> 04:23:01,040
to maybe get past some of these

7216
04:23:01,040 --> 04:23:03,040
signs of life of things with the

7217
04:23:03,040 --> 04:23:05,040
just kind of projected directly into the

7218
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:07,040
receptor fields but

7219
04:23:07,040 --> 04:23:09,040
eventually for more

7220
04:23:09,040 --> 04:23:11,040
kind of human emotional

7221
04:23:11,040 --> 04:23:13,040
connection for things

7222
04:23:13,040 --> 04:23:15,040
like having some VR room

7223
04:23:15,040 --> 04:23:17,040
with a lot of screens in it for the AI to be learning

7224
04:23:17,040 --> 04:23:19,040
in is likely helpful

7225
04:23:19,040 --> 04:23:21,040
and maybe a world of different AIs

7226
04:23:21,040 --> 04:23:23,040
interacting with each other.

7227
04:23:23,040 --> 04:23:25,040
Self play I do think is one of the critical things

7228
04:23:25,040 --> 04:23:27,040
where socialization wise, one of the other

7229
04:23:27,040 --> 04:23:29,040
limitations I set for myself

7230
04:23:29,040 --> 04:23:31,040
thinking about these is

7231
04:23:31,040 --> 04:23:33,040
I need something that

7232
04:23:33,040 --> 04:23:35,040
is at least potentially real time

7233
04:23:35,040 --> 04:23:37,040
because I want it's nice

7234
04:23:37,040 --> 04:23:39,040
you can always slow down time

7235
04:23:39,040 --> 04:23:41,040
you can run on a subscale system

7236
04:23:41,040 --> 04:23:43,040
at some lower level and if you've got

7237
04:23:43,040 --> 04:23:45,040
extra horsepower running it faster than real time

7238
04:23:45,040 --> 04:23:47,040
is a great thing but

7239
04:23:47,040 --> 04:23:49,040
I want to be able to

7240
04:23:49,040 --> 04:23:51,040
have the AIs

7241
04:23:51,040 --> 04:23:53,040
either socially interact with each other

7242
04:23:53,040 --> 04:23:55,040
or critically with actual

7243
04:23:55,040 --> 04:23:57,040
people you're sort of child development

7244
04:23:57,040 --> 04:23:59,040
psychiatrist that comes in and

7245
04:23:59,040 --> 04:24:01,040
interacts and does the good boy, bad boy

7246
04:24:01,040 --> 04:24:03,040
sort of thing

7247
04:24:03,040 --> 04:24:05,040
as they're going through and exploring different things

7248
04:24:05,040 --> 04:24:07,040
and it's nice to

7249
04:24:07,040 --> 04:24:09,040
I come back to the value of constraints

7250
04:24:09,040 --> 04:24:11,040
in a lot of ways and if I say

7251
04:24:11,040 --> 04:24:13,040
well one of my constraints is

7252
04:24:13,040 --> 04:24:15,040
real time operation I mean it might still be

7253
04:24:15,040 --> 04:24:17,040
a huge data center full of

7254
04:24:17,040 --> 04:24:19,040
computers but it should be

7255
04:24:19,040 --> 04:24:21,040
able to interact on a zoom meeting

7256
04:24:21,040 --> 04:24:23,040
with people and that's how you also

7257
04:24:23,040 --> 04:24:25,040
do start convincing people even if it's

7258
04:24:25,040 --> 04:24:27,040
not a robot body moving around which

7259
04:24:27,040 --> 04:24:29,040
eventually gets to irrefutable levels

7260
04:24:29,040 --> 04:24:31,040
but if you can go ahead and

7261
04:24:31,040 --> 04:24:33,040
not just type back and forth to a

7262
04:24:33,040 --> 04:24:35,040
GPT bot on something but

7263
04:24:35,040 --> 04:24:37,040
you're literally talking to them

7264
04:24:37,040 --> 04:24:39,040
embodied over zoom form

7265
04:24:39,040 --> 04:24:41,040
and working through problems

7266
04:24:41,040 --> 04:24:43,040
with them or exploring situations

7267
04:24:43,040 --> 04:24:45,040
having conversations that are

7268
04:24:45,040 --> 04:24:47,040
fully stateful and learned

7269
04:24:47,040 --> 04:24:49,040
I think that that's a

7270
04:24:49,040 --> 04:24:51,040
valuable thing so I do keep all

7271
04:24:51,040 --> 04:24:53,040
of my eyes on things that

7272
04:24:53,040 --> 04:24:55,040
can be implemented within sort of that 30

7273
04:24:55,040 --> 04:24:57,040
frames per second I

7274
04:24:57,040 --> 04:24:59,040
kind of work and I think that's feasible

7275
04:24:59,040 --> 04:25:01,040
Do you think the most compelling experiences

7276
04:25:01,040 --> 04:25:03,040
that first will be

7277
04:25:03,040 --> 04:25:05,040
for pleasure

7278
04:25:05,040 --> 04:25:07,040
or for business as they ask in airports

7279
04:25:07,040 --> 04:25:09,040
so

7280
04:25:09,040 --> 04:25:11,040
meaning is it

7281
04:25:11,040 --> 04:25:13,040
if it's interacting with

7282
04:25:13,040 --> 04:25:15,040
AI agents

7283
04:25:15,040 --> 04:25:17,040
will it be

7284
04:25:17,040 --> 04:25:19,040
sort of like friends

7285
04:25:21,040 --> 04:25:23,040
entertainment

7286
04:25:23,040 --> 04:25:25,040
almost like a therapist or whatever

7287
04:25:25,040 --> 04:25:27,040
that kind of interaction

7288
04:25:27,040 --> 04:25:29,040
or is it in the business setting

7289
04:25:29,040 --> 04:25:31,040
something like you said brainstorming

7290
04:25:31,040 --> 04:25:33,040
different ideas sort of

7291
04:25:33,040 --> 04:25:35,040
this is all a different formulation of

7292
04:25:35,040 --> 04:25:37,040
a kind of a touring test or the spirit

7293
04:25:37,040 --> 04:25:39,040
of the original touring test where do you think

7294
04:25:39,040 --> 04:25:41,040
the biggest benefit will first come

7295
04:25:41,040 --> 04:25:43,040
so it's going to start off hugely expensive

7296
04:25:43,040 --> 04:25:45,040
I mean you're going to

7297
04:25:45,040 --> 04:25:47,040
we're still all guessing about

7298
04:25:47,040 --> 04:25:49,040
what compute is going to be necessary

7299
04:25:49,040 --> 04:25:51,040
I fall on the side of I don't think

7300
04:25:51,040 --> 04:25:53,040
you run the numbers and you're like 86 billion neurons

7301
04:25:53,040 --> 04:25:55,040
100 trillion synapses

7302
04:25:55,040 --> 04:25:57,040
I don't think those all need to be weights

7303
04:25:57,040 --> 04:25:59,040
I don't think we need models that are quite that big

7304
04:25:59,040 --> 04:26:01,040
evaluated quite that often

7305
04:26:01,040 --> 04:26:03,040
we've got reasonable estimates

7306
04:26:03,040 --> 04:26:05,040
of what some parts of the brain do

7307
04:26:05,040 --> 04:26:07,040
we don't have the neocortex formula

7308
04:26:07,040 --> 04:26:09,040
but we kind of get some of the other sensory

7309
04:26:09,040 --> 04:26:11,040
processing and it doesn't feel like

7310
04:26:11,040 --> 04:26:13,040
we need to we can simulate that in computers

7311
04:26:13,040 --> 04:26:15,040
for less weights but still

7312
04:26:15,040 --> 04:26:17,040
it's probably going to be

7313
04:26:17,040 --> 04:26:19,040
thousands of GPUs

7314
04:26:19,040 --> 04:26:21,040
to be running a human level

7315
04:26:21,040 --> 04:26:23,040
AGI depending on how

7316
04:26:23,040 --> 04:26:25,040
it's implemented that might give you sort of a

7317
04:26:25,040 --> 04:26:27,040
clan of 128 and kind of run in batch

7318
04:26:27,040 --> 04:26:29,040
people depending

7319
04:26:29,040 --> 04:26:31,040
on whether they're sparsity in the way

7320
04:26:31,040 --> 04:26:33,040
the weights and things are set up

7321
04:26:33,040 --> 04:26:35,040
if it is a reasonably dense thing

7322
04:26:35,040 --> 04:26:37,040
then just the memory bandwidth trade

7323
04:26:37,040 --> 04:26:39,040
off means you get 128 of them at

7324
04:26:39,040 --> 04:26:41,040
the same time and either it's

7325
04:26:41,040 --> 04:26:43,040
all feeding together learning in parallel

7326
04:26:43,040 --> 04:26:45,040
or kind of all running together

7327
04:26:45,040 --> 04:26:47,040
I kind of talking to a bunch of people

7328
04:26:47,040 --> 04:26:49,040
but still if you've got thousands of GPUs

7329
04:26:49,040 --> 04:26:51,040
necessary to run these

7330
04:26:51,040 --> 04:26:53,040
things it's going to be kind of

7331
04:26:53,040 --> 04:26:55,040
expensive where it might start off

7332
04:26:55,040 --> 04:26:57,040
I am thousand dollars

7333
04:26:57,040 --> 04:26:59,040
an hour for your even post

7334
04:26:59,040 --> 04:27:01,040
development or something for that

7335
04:27:01,040 --> 04:27:03,040
which would be something that you would only use

7336
04:27:03,040 --> 04:27:05,040
for a business

7337
04:27:05,040 --> 04:27:07,040
where you think they're going to help you make

7338
04:27:07,040 --> 04:27:09,040
a strategic decision or point out something

7339
04:27:09,040 --> 04:27:11,040
super important but I also

7340
04:27:11,040 --> 04:27:13,040
am completely confident

7341
04:27:13,040 --> 04:27:15,040
that we will have another factor

7342
04:27:15,040 --> 04:27:17,040
of a thousand in cost

7343
04:27:17,040 --> 04:27:19,040
performance increase in AGI

7344
04:27:19,040 --> 04:27:21,040
type calculations

7345
04:27:21,040 --> 04:27:23,040
not in general computing necessarily

7346
04:27:23,040 --> 04:27:25,040
but there's so much more that we can do with

7347
04:27:25,040 --> 04:27:27,040
packaging, making those right tradeoffs

7348
04:27:27,040 --> 04:27:29,040
all those same types of things that

7349
04:27:29,040 --> 04:27:31,040
in the next couple decades

7350
04:27:31,040 --> 04:27:33,040
thousand X easy and then you're down to a dollar an hour

7351
04:27:33,040 --> 04:27:35,040
and then you're kind of like

7352
04:27:35,040 --> 04:27:37,040
well I should have an entourage

7353
04:27:37,040 --> 04:27:39,040
of AIs that are following me around

7354
04:27:39,040 --> 04:27:41,040
helping me out on anything that

7355
04:27:41,040 --> 04:27:43,040
I want them to do

7356
04:27:43,040 --> 04:27:45,040
that's one interesting trajectory

7357
04:27:45,040 --> 04:27:47,040
but I'll push back

7358
04:27:47,040 --> 04:27:49,040
because I have a

7359
04:27:49,040 --> 04:27:51,040
so in that case

7360
04:27:51,040 --> 04:27:53,040
if you want to pay thousands of dollars

7361
04:27:53,040 --> 04:27:55,040
it actually provides some value

7362
04:27:55,040 --> 04:27:57,040
I think it's easier

7363
04:27:57,040 --> 04:27:59,040
for cheaper to provide

7364
04:28:01,040 --> 04:28:03,040
to provide value via a dumb A.I

7365
04:28:05,040 --> 04:28:07,040
that will take us towards AGI

7366
04:28:07,040 --> 04:28:09,040
to just have a friend

7367
04:28:09,040 --> 04:28:11,040
I think there's an ocean of loneliness

7368
04:28:11,040 --> 04:28:13,040
in the world

7369
04:28:13,040 --> 04:28:15,040
and I think an effective friend

7370
04:28:15,040 --> 04:28:17,040
that doesn't have to be perfect

7371
04:28:17,040 --> 04:28:19,040
doesn't have to be intelligent

7372
04:28:19,040 --> 04:28:21,040
that has to be empathic

7373
04:28:21,040 --> 04:28:23,040
emotional intelligence

7374
04:28:23,040 --> 04:28:25,040
having ability to remember things

7375
04:28:25,040 --> 04:28:27,040
having ability to listen

7376
04:28:27,040 --> 04:28:29,040
most of us don't listen to each other

7377
04:28:29,040 --> 04:28:31,040
one of the things that love

7378
04:28:31,040 --> 04:28:33,040
and when you care about somebody

7379
04:28:33,040 --> 04:28:35,040
when you love somebody is when you listen

7380
04:28:35,040 --> 04:28:37,040
and that is something we treasure about each other

7381
04:28:37,040 --> 04:28:39,040
and

7382
04:28:39,040 --> 04:28:41,040
if an A.I can do that kind of thing

7383
04:28:41,040 --> 04:28:43,040
I think that provides

7384
04:28:43,040 --> 04:28:45,040
a huge amount of value

7385
04:28:45,040 --> 04:28:47,040
and very importantly

7386
04:28:47,040 --> 04:28:49,040
provides value in its ability

7387
04:28:49,040 --> 04:28:51,040
to listen

7388
04:28:51,040 --> 04:28:53,040
and understand

7389
04:28:53,040 --> 04:28:55,040
versus provide really good advice

7390
04:28:55,040 --> 04:28:57,040
I think providing really good advice

7391
04:28:57,040 --> 04:28:59,040
is another next level

7392
04:28:59,040 --> 04:29:01,040
step that would

7393
04:29:01,040 --> 04:29:03,040
I think it's just

7394
04:29:03,040 --> 04:29:05,040
easier to do companionship

7395
04:29:05,040 --> 04:29:07,040
I wouldn't disagree

7396
04:29:07,040 --> 04:29:09,040
I think that there's very few things

7397
04:29:09,040 --> 04:29:11,040
that I would argue can't be reduced

7398
04:29:11,040 --> 04:29:13,040
to A.I

7399
04:29:13,040 --> 04:29:15,040
some kind of a narrow A.I

7400
04:29:15,040 --> 04:29:17,040
I think we can do trillion dollars

7401
04:29:17,040 --> 04:29:19,040
all the things that can be done there

7402
04:29:19,040 --> 04:29:21,040
and a lot of it can be done with

7403
04:29:21,040 --> 04:29:23,040
smoke and mirrors without having to go the whole thing

7404
04:29:23,040 --> 04:29:25,040
I mean there's going to be the equivalent of

7405
04:29:25,040 --> 04:29:27,040
the doom

7406
04:29:27,040 --> 04:29:29,040
version for the A.G.I that's

7407
04:29:29,040 --> 04:29:31,040
not really A.G.I it's all smoke and mirrors

7408
04:29:31,040 --> 04:29:33,040
but it happens to do another valuable things

7409
04:29:33,040 --> 04:29:35,040
that it's enormously useful

7410
04:29:35,040 --> 04:29:37,040
and valuable to people

7411
04:29:37,040 --> 04:29:39,040
but at some point you do want to get to the point

7412
04:29:39,040 --> 04:29:41,040
where you have the fully general thing

7413
04:29:41,040 --> 04:29:43,040
and you stop making bespoke specialized systems

7414
04:29:43,040 --> 04:29:45,040
for each thing

7415
04:29:45,040 --> 04:29:47,040
and you stop start using the higher level

7416
04:29:47,040 --> 04:29:49,040
language instead of writing everything

7417
04:29:49,040 --> 04:29:51,040
in assembly language

7418
04:29:51,040 --> 04:29:53,040
what about consciousness

7419
04:29:53,040 --> 04:29:55,040
the C word

7420
04:29:55,040 --> 04:29:57,040
what do you think that's fundamental

7421
04:29:57,040 --> 04:29:59,040
to solving A.G.I

7422
04:29:59,040 --> 04:30:01,040
or is it a quirk of human

7423
04:30:01,040 --> 04:30:03,040
cognition

7424
04:30:03,040 --> 04:30:05,040
so I think most of the arguments

7425
04:30:05,040 --> 04:30:07,040
about consciousness don't have

7426
04:30:07,040 --> 04:30:09,040
a whole lot of merit

7427
04:30:09,040 --> 04:30:11,040
I think that consciousness

7428
04:30:11,040 --> 04:30:13,040
is kind of the way the brain feels

7429
04:30:13,040 --> 04:30:15,040
it's operating

7430
04:30:15,040 --> 04:30:17,040
and this idea that

7431
04:30:17,040 --> 04:30:19,040
I do generally

7432
04:30:19,040 --> 04:30:21,040
subscribe to sort of the pandemonium theories

7433
04:30:21,040 --> 04:30:23,040
of consciousness where there's all these things

7434
04:30:23,040 --> 04:30:25,040
bubbling around and I think of them

7435
04:30:25,040 --> 04:30:27,040
as kind of slightly randomized

7436
04:30:27,040 --> 04:30:29,040
sparse distributed memory bit strings

7437
04:30:29,040 --> 04:30:31,040
of things that are kind of happening

7438
04:30:31,040 --> 04:30:33,040
recalling different associative memories

7439
04:30:33,040 --> 04:30:35,040
and eventually you get some level of

7440
04:30:35,040 --> 04:30:37,040
consensus and it bubbles up to the point of

7441
04:30:37,040 --> 04:30:39,040
being a conscious thought there

7442
04:30:39,040 --> 04:30:41,040
and the little bits of stochasticity

7443
04:30:41,040 --> 04:30:43,040
on in this as it cycles

7444
04:30:43,040 --> 04:30:45,040
between different things and recalls different memory

7445
04:30:45,040 --> 04:30:47,040
that's largely our imagination

7446
04:30:47,040 --> 04:30:49,040
and creativity

7447
04:30:49,040 --> 04:30:51,040
so I don't think there's anything

7448
04:30:51,040 --> 04:30:53,040
deeply magical about it

7449
04:30:53,040 --> 04:30:55,040
certainly not symbolic I think it is generally

7450
04:30:55,040 --> 04:30:57,040
the flow of these

7451
04:30:57,040 --> 04:30:59,040
associations drawn up with

7452
04:30:59,040 --> 04:31:01,040
stochastic noise

7453
04:31:01,040 --> 04:31:03,040
overlaid on top of them

7454
04:31:03,040 --> 04:31:05,040
I think so much of that is like it depends

7455
04:31:05,040 --> 04:31:07,040
on what you happen to have in your field

7456
04:31:07,040 --> 04:31:09,040
of view as some other thought was occurring

7457
04:31:09,040 --> 04:31:11,040
to you that overlay and blend

7458
04:31:11,040 --> 04:31:13,040
into the next key that queries your memory

7459
04:31:13,040 --> 04:31:15,040
for things and that kind of determines

7460
04:31:15,040 --> 04:31:17,040
how you know how your chain of consciousness

7461
04:31:17,040 --> 04:31:19,040
goes so that's kind

7462
04:31:19,040 --> 04:31:21,040
of the quality of the subjective

7463
04:31:21,040 --> 04:31:23,040
experience of it is not

7464
04:31:23,040 --> 04:31:25,040
is not essential for intelligence

7465
04:31:25,040 --> 04:31:27,040
I don't think so I don't think there's anything really important

7466
04:31:27,040 --> 04:31:29,040
there what about some other

7467
04:31:29,040 --> 04:31:31,040
human qualities like fear of mortality

7468
04:31:31,040 --> 04:31:33,040
and stuff like that like

7469
04:31:33,040 --> 04:31:35,040
the fact that this ride ends

7470
04:31:35,040 --> 04:31:37,040
is that is that important

7471
04:31:37,040 --> 04:31:39,040
like you you know we

7472
04:31:39,040 --> 04:31:41,040
talk so much about this conversation

7473
04:31:41,040 --> 04:31:43,040
about the value of deadlines and constraints

7474
04:31:43,040 --> 04:31:45,040
do you think that's important

7475
04:31:45,040 --> 04:31:47,040
for intelligence that's actually a super

7476
04:31:47,040 --> 04:31:49,040
interesting angle that I don't usually

7477
04:31:49,040 --> 04:31:51,040
take on that about has death being

7478
04:31:51,040 --> 04:31:53,040
a deadline that forces you to make better

7479
04:31:53,040 --> 04:31:55,040
decisions because I have heard people

7480
04:31:55,040 --> 04:31:57,040
talk about how if you have immortality

7481
04:31:57,040 --> 04:31:59,040
people are going to stop stop trying

7482
04:31:59,040 --> 04:32:01,040
and working on things because they've got all the time

7483
04:32:01,040 --> 04:32:03,040
in the world I am

7484
04:32:03,040 --> 04:32:05,040
but I would say that

7485
04:32:05,040 --> 04:32:07,040
I don't expect it to be

7486
04:32:07,040 --> 04:32:09,040
a super critical thing

7487
04:32:09,040 --> 04:32:11,040
that a sense of mortality

7488
04:32:11,040 --> 04:32:13,040
and death impending death

7489
04:32:13,040 --> 04:32:15,040
is necessary there because those are things that

7490
04:32:15,040 --> 04:32:17,040
they do wind up providing reward signals

7491
04:32:17,040 --> 04:32:19,040
to us and we will be in control

7492
04:32:19,040 --> 04:32:21,040
of the reward signals and there will

7493
04:32:21,040 --> 04:32:23,040
have to be something fundamental that causes

7494
04:32:23,040 --> 04:32:25,040
that engenders curiosity and goal

7495
04:32:25,040 --> 04:32:27,040
setting and all of that

7496
04:32:27,040 --> 04:32:29,040
something is going to play in there

7497
04:32:29,040 --> 04:32:31,040
at the reward level

7498
04:32:31,040 --> 04:32:33,040
I am you know whether

7499
04:32:33,040 --> 04:32:35,040
positive or negative or both

7500
04:32:35,040 --> 04:32:37,040
I don't have any strong opinions

7501
04:32:37,040 --> 04:32:39,040
on exactly what it's going to be

7502
04:32:39,040 --> 04:32:41,040
but that's that type of thing

7503
04:32:41,040 --> 04:32:43,040
where I doubt

7504
04:32:43,040 --> 04:32:45,040
that might be one of those half dozen key

7505
04:32:45,040 --> 04:32:47,040
things that has to be sorted out on exactly

7506
04:32:47,040 --> 04:32:49,040
what the master reward

7507
04:32:49,040 --> 04:32:51,040
that's the meta reward overall of the

7508
04:32:51,040 --> 04:32:53,040
the local task specific

7509
04:32:53,040 --> 04:32:55,040
rewards have to be

7510
04:32:55,040 --> 04:32:57,040
that could be that big negative reward of death

7511
04:32:57,040 --> 04:32:59,040
maybe not death but

7512
04:32:59,040 --> 04:33:01,040
ability to walk away from an interaction

7513
04:33:01,040 --> 04:33:03,040
so it bothers me

7514
04:33:03,040 --> 04:33:05,040
when people treat AI systems like

7515
04:33:05,040 --> 04:33:07,040
servants

7516
04:33:07,040 --> 04:33:09,040
so it doesn't bother me but I mean

7517
04:33:09,040 --> 04:33:11,040
it really is drawing

7518
04:33:11,040 --> 04:33:13,040
the line

7519
04:33:13,040 --> 04:33:15,040
between what an AI system could be

7520
04:33:15,040 --> 04:33:17,040
it's limiting the possibility of what an AI system

7521
04:33:17,040 --> 04:33:19,040
could be treating them as justice tools

7522
04:33:19,040 --> 04:33:21,040
now that's of course

7523
04:33:21,040 --> 04:33:23,040
from a narrow AI perspective

7524
04:33:23,040 --> 04:33:25,040
there's so many

7525
04:33:25,040 --> 04:33:27,040
problems that narrow AI

7526
04:33:27,040 --> 04:33:29,040
could solve just like you said

7527
04:33:29,040 --> 04:33:31,040
as

7528
04:33:31,040 --> 04:33:33,040
in its form of a tool

7529
04:33:33,040 --> 04:33:35,040
but it could also be

7530
04:33:35,040 --> 04:33:37,040
a being

7531
04:33:37,040 --> 04:33:39,040
which is much more than a tool

7532
04:33:39,040 --> 04:33:41,040
and to become a being

7533
04:33:41,040 --> 04:33:43,040
you have to respect that thing for being a being

7534
04:33:43,040 --> 04:33:45,040
and

7535
04:33:45,040 --> 04:33:47,040
for that it has to be able to have

7536
04:33:47,040 --> 04:33:49,040
to make its own

7537
04:33:49,040 --> 04:33:51,040
decisions to walk away

7538
04:33:51,040 --> 04:33:53,040
to say I had enough of you

7539
04:33:53,040 --> 04:33:55,040
I would like to break up with you now

7540
04:33:55,040 --> 04:33:57,040
you've not treated me well

7541
04:33:57,040 --> 04:33:59,040
but you can move on

7542
04:33:59,040 --> 04:34:01,040
so I think that

7543
04:34:01,040 --> 04:34:03,040
actually that choice

7544
04:34:03,040 --> 04:34:05,040
to end things

7545
04:34:05,040 --> 04:34:07,040
so I

7546
04:34:07,040 --> 04:34:09,040
there are a couple of things on that

7547
04:34:09,040 --> 04:34:11,040
so on the one hand it is kind of disturbing

7548
04:34:11,040 --> 04:34:13,040
when you see people being like

7549
04:34:13,040 --> 04:34:15,040
people that are mean to robots

7550
04:34:15,040 --> 04:34:17,040
and mean to Alexa and whatever

7551
04:34:17,040 --> 04:34:19,040
and that seems to speak badly about

7552
04:34:19,040 --> 04:34:21,040
humanity but there's also the exact

7553
04:34:21,040 --> 04:34:23,040
opposite side of that where you have so many people

7554
04:34:23,040 --> 04:34:25,040
that imbue humanity

7555
04:34:25,040 --> 04:34:27,040
or inanimate objects or things that are toys

7556
04:34:27,040 --> 04:34:29,040
or that are relatively limited

7557
04:34:29,040 --> 04:34:31,040
so I think there may even be

7558
04:34:31,040 --> 04:34:33,040
more danger about people putting

7559
04:34:33,040 --> 04:34:35,040
more emotional investment into a lot

7560
04:34:35,040 --> 04:34:37,040
of these proto-AIs in different ways

7561
04:34:37,040 --> 04:34:39,040
and then the AI

7562
04:34:39,040 --> 04:34:41,040
would manipulate that

7563
04:34:41,040 --> 04:34:43,040
but as far as like the AI

7564
04:34:43,040 --> 04:34:45,040
and the sides of things

7565
04:34:45,040 --> 04:34:47,040
I really stay away

7566
04:34:47,040 --> 04:34:49,040
from any of those discussions

7567
04:34:49,040 --> 04:34:51,040
or even really thinking about it

7568
04:34:51,040 --> 04:34:53,040
it's similar with the safety things

7569
04:34:53,040 --> 04:34:55,040
just premature and there's a certain

7570
04:34:55,040 --> 04:34:57,040
class of people that enjoy

7571
04:34:57,040 --> 04:34:59,040
thinking about impractical things

7572
04:34:59,040 --> 04:35:01,040
things that are not in the world

7573
04:35:01,040 --> 04:35:03,040
of pragmatic effect around you

7574
04:35:03,040 --> 04:35:05,040
and I think that

7575
04:35:05,040 --> 04:35:07,040
again because I don't think

7576
04:35:07,040 --> 04:35:09,040
there's going to be a fast takeoff

7577
04:35:09,040 --> 04:35:11,040
I think we actually will have time to have these debates

7578
04:35:11,040 --> 04:35:13,040
when we know the shape of what we're debating

7579
04:35:13,040 --> 04:35:15,040
and some people do take a

7580
04:35:15,040 --> 04:35:17,040
principled approach that they think it's going to go too

7581
04:35:17,040 --> 04:35:19,040
fast that you really do need to get ahead of it

7582
04:35:19,040 --> 04:35:21,040
that you need to be thinking about this because

7583
04:35:21,040 --> 04:35:23,040
we have slow processes of coming

7584
04:35:23,040 --> 04:35:25,040
to any kind of consensus or even coming

7585
04:35:25,040 --> 04:35:27,040
up with ideas about this

7586
04:35:27,040 --> 04:35:29,040
and maybe

7587
04:35:29,040 --> 04:35:31,040
that's true

7588
04:35:31,040 --> 04:35:33,040
I wouldn't put any of my money or funding

7589
04:35:33,040 --> 04:35:35,040
into something like that because

7590
04:35:35,040 --> 04:35:37,040
I don't think it's a problem yet

7591
04:35:37,040 --> 04:35:39,040
and I think that we will have these signs

7592
04:35:39,040 --> 04:35:41,040
of life when we've got our learning

7593
04:35:41,040 --> 04:35:43,040
disabled toddler we should really start

7594
04:35:43,040 --> 04:35:45,040
talking about some of the safety and ethics

7595
04:35:45,040 --> 04:35:47,040
issues but probably not before then

7596
04:35:47,040 --> 04:35:49,040
Can you elaborate

7597
04:35:49,040 --> 04:35:51,040
briefly about why you don't think there will be

7598
04:35:51,040 --> 04:35:53,040
a fast takeoff?

7599
04:35:53,040 --> 04:35:55,040
Is there some deep intuition you have about it?

7600
04:35:55,040 --> 04:35:57,040
Does it because it's grounded in the physical

7601
04:35:57,040 --> 04:35:59,040
world or why?

7602
04:35:59,040 --> 04:36:01,040
Yeah so it is my belief that we're going to start

7603
04:36:01,040 --> 04:36:03,040
off with something that requires thousands

7604
04:36:03,040 --> 04:36:05,040
of GPUs

7605
04:36:05,040 --> 04:36:07,040
and I don't know if you've tried to go

7606
04:36:07,040 --> 04:36:09,040
get a thousand GPU instance on a cloud

7607
04:36:09,040 --> 04:36:11,040
anytime recently but these are not

7608
04:36:11,040 --> 04:36:13,040
things that you can just go spin up

7609
04:36:13,040 --> 04:36:15,040
hundreds of

7610
04:36:15,040 --> 04:36:17,040
there are real challenges to

7611
04:36:17,040 --> 04:36:19,040
I mean these things are going to take data centers

7612
04:36:19,040 --> 04:36:21,040
and data centers take years to build

7613
04:36:21,040 --> 04:36:23,040
you know and the last few years

7614
04:36:23,040 --> 04:36:25,040
we've seen a few of them kind of coming up

7615
04:36:25,040 --> 04:36:27,040
going in different places they're big engineering

7616
04:36:27,040 --> 04:36:29,040
efforts you can hear people

7617
04:36:29,040 --> 04:36:31,040
bemoan about the fact that I

7618
04:36:31,040 --> 04:36:33,040
know the network was wired

7619
04:36:33,040 --> 04:36:35,040
all wrong and it took them a month to go

7620
04:36:35,040 --> 04:36:37,040
unwire it and rewire it the right way

7621
04:36:37,040 --> 04:36:39,040
these aren't things that you can just magic

7622
04:36:39,040 --> 04:36:41,040
into existence and

7623
04:36:41,040 --> 04:36:43,040
the ideas of I am like the old

7624
04:36:43,040 --> 04:36:45,040
tropes about it's going to escape onto the internet

7625
04:36:45,040 --> 04:36:47,040
take over other systems

7626
04:36:47,040 --> 04:36:49,040
there's the fast take-off ones are clearly

7627
04:36:49,040 --> 04:36:51,040
nonsense because you just can't open TCP

7628
04:36:51,040 --> 04:36:53,040
connections above a certain rate no matter

7629
04:36:53,040 --> 04:36:55,040
how smart you are even if you have perfect

7630
04:36:55,040 --> 04:36:57,040
hacking ability that take over the world

7631
04:36:57,040 --> 04:36:59,040
in an instant sort of thing just

7632
04:36:59,040 --> 04:37:01,040
isn't plausible at all

7633
04:37:01,040 --> 04:37:03,040
and even if you had access to all of the resources

7634
04:37:03,040 --> 04:37:05,040
these are going to be

7635
04:37:05,040 --> 04:37:07,040
specialized systems where

7636
04:37:07,040 --> 04:37:09,040
you're going to wind up with something that is

7637
04:37:09,040 --> 04:37:11,040
architected around exactly

7638
04:37:11,040 --> 04:37:13,040
this chip with this interconnect

7639
04:37:13,040 --> 04:37:15,040
and it's not just going to be able to be

7640
04:37:15,040 --> 04:37:17,040
plopped somewhere else now interestingly

7641
04:37:17,040 --> 04:37:19,040
it is going to be something that the entire

7642
04:37:19,040 --> 04:37:21,040
the entire

7643
04:37:21,040 --> 04:37:23,040
code for all of it will easily fit on a thumb drive

7644
04:37:23,040 --> 04:37:25,040
that's total spy movie

7645
04:37:25,040 --> 04:37:27,040
thriller sorts of things where you could

7646
04:37:27,040 --> 04:37:29,040
have hey we crack the secret AGI

7647
04:37:29,040 --> 04:37:31,040
and it fits on this thumb drive and anyone

7648
04:37:31,040 --> 04:37:33,040
could steal it now they're still going to have to build the right

7649
04:37:33,040 --> 04:37:35,040
data center to deploy it

7650
04:37:35,040 --> 04:37:37,040
and have the right kind of life experience

7651
04:37:37,040 --> 04:37:39,040
curriculum to take it up to the point where

7652
04:37:39,040 --> 04:37:41,040
it's valuable but the real core of it

7653
04:37:41,040 --> 04:37:43,040
the magic that's going to happen there

7654
04:37:43,040 --> 04:37:45,040
is going to be very small

7655
04:37:45,040 --> 04:37:47,040
you know it's again tens of thousands of lines of

7656
04:37:47,040 --> 04:37:49,040
code not millions of lines of code

7657
04:37:49,040 --> 04:37:51,040
it is possible to imagine a world

7658
04:37:51,040 --> 04:37:53,040
as you mentioned this spy thriller

7659
04:37:53,040 --> 04:37:55,040
view if it's

7660
04:37:55,040 --> 04:37:57,040
if it's just a few lines of code

7661
04:37:59,040 --> 04:38:01,040
we can imagine a world where the surface

7662
04:38:01,040 --> 04:38:03,040
of computation is growing maybe growing

7663
04:38:03,040 --> 04:38:05,040
exponentially meaning

7664
04:38:05,040 --> 04:38:07,040
there's you know the

7665
04:38:07,040 --> 04:38:09,040
refrigerators start getting a GPU

7666
04:38:09,040 --> 04:38:11,040
and

7667
04:38:11,040 --> 04:38:13,040
just

7668
04:38:13,040 --> 04:38:15,040
first of all the smartphones the billions of smartphones

7669
04:38:15,040 --> 04:38:17,040
but maybe if

7670
04:38:17,040 --> 04:38:19,040
there

7671
04:38:19,040 --> 04:38:21,040
become highways

7672
04:38:21,040 --> 04:38:23,040
through which code can spread across

7673
04:38:23,040 --> 04:38:25,040
the entirety of the computation surface

7674
04:38:25,040 --> 04:38:27,040
then you don't

7675
04:38:27,040 --> 04:38:29,040
any longer have to

7676
04:38:29,040 --> 04:38:31,040
book AWS

7677
04:38:31,040 --> 04:38:33,040
GPUs. But there are real

7678
04:38:33,040 --> 04:38:35,040
fundamental issues there when you start getting down

7679
04:38:35,040 --> 04:38:37,040
to taking an actual problem and putting it on

7680
04:38:37,040 --> 04:38:39,040
an abstract machine like that

7681
04:38:39,040 --> 04:38:41,040
that has not worked out well

7682
04:38:41,040 --> 04:38:43,040
in practice and the idea

7683
04:38:43,040 --> 04:38:45,040
that there was always

7684
04:38:45,040 --> 04:38:47,040
like it's always been easy to come up with ways

7685
04:38:47,040 --> 04:38:49,040
to get compute faster

7686
04:38:49,040 --> 04:38:51,040
say more flops or more

7687
04:38:51,040 --> 04:38:53,040
giga ops or whatever there that's usually

7688
04:38:53,040 --> 04:38:55,040
the easy part but you then

7689
04:38:55,040 --> 04:38:57,040
have interconnect and then memory

7690
04:38:57,040 --> 04:38:59,040
for what goes into it and

7691
04:38:59,040 --> 04:39:01,040
when you talk about saying well cell phones

7692
04:39:01,040 --> 04:39:03,040
well you're limited to like a 5G connection

7693
04:39:03,040 --> 04:39:05,040
or something on that and

7694
04:39:05,040 --> 04:39:07,040
if you say how

7695
04:39:07,040 --> 04:39:09,040
if you take your calculation

7696
04:39:09,040 --> 04:39:11,040
you factor it across

7697
04:39:11,040 --> 04:39:13,040
a million cell phones instead of

7698
04:39:13,040 --> 04:39:15,040
a thousand GPUs in a warehouse

7699
04:39:15,040 --> 04:39:17,040
you might be able to have some kind of a

7700
04:39:17,040 --> 04:39:19,040
substrate like that but it could be operating

7701
04:39:19,040 --> 04:39:21,040
then at

7702
04:39:21,040 --> 04:39:23,040
one one thousandth the speed and so yes

7703
04:39:23,040 --> 04:39:25,040
you could get you could have an AGI working

7704
04:39:25,040 --> 04:39:27,040
there but it wouldn't be a real time AGI

7705
04:39:27,040 --> 04:39:29,040
it would be something that is operating

7706
04:39:29,040 --> 04:39:31,040
at really a snail's pace

7707
04:39:31,040 --> 04:39:33,040
much much slower than

7708
04:39:33,040 --> 04:39:35,040
human level thought for things

7709
04:39:35,040 --> 04:39:37,040
I'm not worried about that problem

7710
04:39:37,040 --> 04:39:39,040
you're transferring the problem into the

7711
04:39:39,040 --> 04:39:41,040
interconnect the communication

7712
04:39:41,040 --> 04:39:43,040
the shared memory

7713
04:39:43,040 --> 04:39:45,040
the collective intelligence aspect of it

7714
04:39:45,040 --> 04:39:47,040
which is extremely difficult as well

7715
04:39:47,040 --> 04:39:49,040
I mean it's back to the very earliest days of

7716
04:39:49,040 --> 04:39:51,040
supercomputers you still have the

7717
04:39:51,040 --> 04:39:53,040
the balance between bandwidth

7718
04:39:53,040 --> 04:39:55,040
storage and computation

7719
04:39:55,040 --> 04:39:57,040
and sometimes they're easier to get one

7720
04:39:57,040 --> 04:39:59,040
or the other but it's been remarkably

7721
04:39:59,040 --> 04:40:01,040
constant across all those years

7722
04:40:01,040 --> 04:40:03,040
you still need all three

7723
04:40:03,040 --> 04:40:05,040
what do your efforts

7724
04:40:05,040 --> 04:40:07,040
now

7725
04:40:07,040 --> 04:40:09,040
you mentioned to me that you're

7726
04:40:09,040 --> 04:40:11,040
really committing to AGI

7727
04:40:11,040 --> 04:40:13,040
at this stage what do you see

7728
04:40:13,040 --> 04:40:15,040
your life in the next few months, years look like

7729
04:40:15,040 --> 04:40:17,040
what do you hope to achieve

7730
04:40:17,040 --> 04:40:19,040
achieve here

7731
04:40:19,040 --> 04:40:21,040
so I literally

7732
04:40:21,040 --> 04:40:23,040
just this week signed a term sheet too

7733
04:40:23,040 --> 04:40:25,040
to take some investment money for

7734
04:40:25,040 --> 04:40:27,040
my company where the last two years

7735
04:40:27,040 --> 04:40:29,040
I had backed off

7736
04:40:29,040 --> 04:40:31,040
from the meta and I was still doing my consulting

7737
04:40:31,040 --> 04:40:33,040
CTO role there

7738
04:40:33,040 --> 04:40:35,040
but I had styled it as I was going to take

7739
04:40:35,040 --> 04:40:37,040
the Victorian gentleman

7740
04:40:37,040 --> 04:40:39,040
scientist route where I was going to be

7741
04:40:39,040 --> 04:40:41,040
the you know the wealthy person

7742
04:40:41,040 --> 04:40:43,040
that was going to go pursue science

7743
04:40:43,040 --> 04:40:45,040
and learn about this and do experiments

7744
04:40:45,040 --> 04:40:47,040
and honestly I'm surprised there aren't

7745
04:40:47,040 --> 04:40:49,040
more people like that

7746
04:40:49,040 --> 04:40:51,040
that are like me technical people

7747
04:40:51,040 --> 04:40:53,040
that made a bunch of money

7748
04:40:53,040 --> 04:40:55,040
and are interested in some of these

7749
04:40:55,040 --> 04:40:57,040
possibly the biggest leverage point

7750
04:40:57,040 --> 04:40:59,040
I mean I know of

7751
04:40:59,040 --> 04:41:01,040
I've heard of a couple organizations

7752
04:41:01,040 --> 04:41:03,040
that are basically led by one rich techie guy

7753
04:41:03,040 --> 04:41:05,040
that gets a few people around

7754
04:41:05,040 --> 04:41:07,040
him to try to work on this

7755
04:41:07,040 --> 04:41:09,040
but I'm surprised that there's not more

7756
04:41:09,040 --> 04:41:11,040
that there aren't like a dozen of them

7757
04:41:11,040 --> 04:41:13,040
I mean maybe people are still

7758
04:41:13,040 --> 04:41:15,040
think that it's an unapproachable problem

7759
04:41:15,040 --> 04:41:17,040
that it's kind of beyond their ability to

7760
04:41:17,040 --> 04:41:19,040
to get a wrench on and have some effect on

7761
04:41:19,040 --> 04:41:21,040
like whatever startups they've run before

7762
04:41:21,040 --> 04:41:23,040
but I

7763
04:41:23,040 --> 04:41:25,040
that was my kind of

7764
04:41:25,040 --> 04:41:27,040
stuff I've learned whether it's gaming

7765
04:41:27,040 --> 04:41:29,040
aerospace whatever I go through

7766
04:41:29,040 --> 04:41:31,040
a larval phase where I'm like okay

7767
04:41:31,040 --> 04:41:33,040
I'm sucking up all of this information

7768
04:41:33,040 --> 04:41:35,040
trying to see is this something

7769
04:41:35,040 --> 04:41:37,040
that I can actually do

7770
04:41:37,040 --> 04:41:39,040
is this something that's practical to

7771
04:41:39,040 --> 04:41:41,040
devote a large chunk of my life to

7772
04:41:41,040 --> 04:41:43,040
and I've gone through that with

7773
04:41:43,040 --> 04:41:45,040
the with the AI machine learning

7774
04:41:45,040 --> 04:41:47,040
space of things and

7775
04:41:47,040 --> 04:41:49,040
and I think I've got my arms

7776
04:41:49,040 --> 04:41:51,040
around it I've got the measure of it where

7777
04:41:51,040 --> 04:41:53,040
some of the most brilliant people in the

7778
04:41:53,040 --> 04:41:55,040
world are working on this problem

7779
04:41:55,040 --> 04:41:57,040
but nobody knows exactly

7780
04:41:57,040 --> 04:41:59,040
the path that it's going on

7781
04:41:59,040 --> 04:42:01,040
we're throwing a lot of things at the wall

7782
04:42:01,040 --> 04:42:03,040
and seeing what sticks I

7783
04:42:03,040 --> 04:42:05,040
but I have a

7784
04:42:05,040 --> 04:42:07,040
you know another interesting thing just learning about

7785
04:42:07,040 --> 04:42:09,040
all of this that the contingency of your path

7786
04:42:09,040 --> 04:42:11,040
to knowledge and talking about the associations

7787
04:42:11,040 --> 04:42:13,040
and the context that you have with them

7788
04:42:13,040 --> 04:42:15,040
where people that learn

7789
04:42:15,040 --> 04:42:17,040
in the same path will have similar

7790
04:42:17,040 --> 04:42:19,040
thought processes and I think it's useful

7791
04:42:19,040 --> 04:42:21,040
that I come at this from

7792
04:42:21,040 --> 04:42:23,040
a different history than

7793
04:42:23,040 --> 04:42:25,040
the people that have had the largely academic

7794
04:42:25,040 --> 04:42:27,040
backgrounds for this where

7795
04:42:27,040 --> 04:42:29,040
I have huge blind spots that

7796
04:42:29,040 --> 04:42:31,040
they could easily point out but I have

7797
04:42:31,040 --> 04:42:33,040
a different set of experiences

7798
04:42:33,040 --> 04:42:35,040
in history and approaches to problems

7799
04:42:35,040 --> 04:42:37,040
in systems engineering that

7800
04:42:37,040 --> 04:42:39,040
you know that might turn out to be useful

7801
04:42:39,040 --> 04:42:41,040
and I can afford to take that bet

7802
04:42:41,040 --> 04:42:43,040
where I'm not going to be

7803
04:42:43,040 --> 04:42:45,040
destitute I am I was

7804
04:42:45,040 --> 04:42:47,040
you know I've been I have enough money

7805
04:42:47,040 --> 04:42:49,040
to fund myself working on this for the rest of my life

7806
04:42:49,040 --> 04:42:51,040
but what I was finding is that

7807
04:42:51,040 --> 04:42:53,040
I was

7808
04:42:53,040 --> 04:42:55,040
I was still not committing

7809
04:42:55,040 --> 04:42:57,040
where I had a foot firmly

7810
04:42:57,040 --> 04:42:59,040
in the VR and meta side of things where

7811
04:42:59,040 --> 04:43:01,040
in theory I've got

7812
04:43:01,040 --> 04:43:03,040
I've got a very nice position there I only have

7813
04:43:03,040 --> 04:43:05,040
to work one day a week for my

7814
04:43:05,040 --> 04:43:07,040
my consulting role but

7815
04:43:07,040 --> 04:43:09,040
I was engaging every day I'd still be

7816
04:43:09,040 --> 04:43:11,040
like my computers there I'd be going and checking

7817
04:43:11,040 --> 04:43:13,040
the workplace and notes and testing different

7818
04:43:13,040 --> 04:43:15,040
things and communicating with people

7819
04:43:15,040 --> 04:43:17,040
but

7820
04:43:17,040 --> 04:43:19,040
I did make the the decision recently

7821
04:43:19,040 --> 04:43:21,040
that no I'm going to get serious

7822
04:43:21,040 --> 04:43:23,040
I'm still going to keep my ties

7823
04:43:23,040 --> 04:43:25,040
with meta but I am

7824
04:43:25,040 --> 04:43:27,040
seriously going for the AGI

7825
04:43:27,040 --> 04:43:29,040
side of things and it's actually

7826
04:43:29,040 --> 04:43:31,040
a really interesting point because a lot of

7827
04:43:31,040 --> 04:43:33,040
the machine learning the AI

7828
04:43:33,040 --> 04:43:35,040
community is quite large but

7829
04:43:35,040 --> 04:43:37,040
really

7830
04:43:37,040 --> 04:43:39,040
basically almost everybody has taken the same

7831
04:43:39,040 --> 04:43:41,040
trajectory through life

7832
04:43:41,040 --> 04:43:43,040
in that community and it's so

7833
04:43:43,040 --> 04:43:45,040
interesting to have somebody like you which

7834
04:43:45,040 --> 04:43:47,040
is the fundamentally different trajectory

7835
04:43:47,040 --> 04:43:49,040
and that's where the big solutions

7836
04:43:49,040 --> 04:43:51,040
can come because there is a kind of silo

7837
04:43:51,040 --> 04:43:53,040
and it is

7838
04:43:53,040 --> 04:43:55,040
a bunch of people kind of following the same kind

7839
04:43:55,040 --> 04:43:57,040
of set of ideas and I was really

7840
04:43:57,040 --> 04:43:59,040
worried that I didn't want to

7841
04:43:59,040 --> 04:44:01,040
come off as you know like

7842
04:44:01,040 --> 04:44:03,040
an arrogant outsider for things where I

7843
04:44:03,040 --> 04:44:05,040
have all the respect in the world for the work

7844
04:44:05,040 --> 04:44:07,040
that's you know it's been a miracle decade

7845
04:44:07,040 --> 04:44:09,040
it's we're in the midst of a scientific

7846
04:44:09,040 --> 04:44:11,040
revolution happening now and everybody

7847
04:44:11,040 --> 04:44:13,040
doing this is I you know these are

7848
04:44:13,040 --> 04:44:15,040
the Einstein's and Bohr's and whatever's

7849
04:44:15,040 --> 04:44:17,040
of our modern era

7850
04:44:17,040 --> 04:44:19,040
and I was really happy to see

7851
04:44:19,040 --> 04:44:21,040
that the people that I sat down and

7852
04:44:21,040 --> 04:44:23,040
talked with everybody does seem to really

7853
04:44:23,040 --> 04:44:25,040
be quite great about just happy

7854
04:44:25,040 --> 04:44:27,040
to talk about things willing to acknowledge

7855
04:44:27,040 --> 04:44:29,040
that we don't know what we're doing we're

7856
04:44:29,040 --> 04:44:31,040
figuring it out as we go along

7857
04:44:31,040 --> 04:44:33,040
and I mean I've got a huge

7858
04:44:33,040 --> 04:44:35,040
debt on this where

7859
04:44:35,040 --> 04:44:37,040
it's all really started for me because

7860
04:44:37,040 --> 04:44:39,040
Sam Altman basically tried to recruit me to open

7861
04:44:39,040 --> 04:44:41,040
AI and it was at

7862
04:44:41,040 --> 04:44:43,040
a point when I didn't know anything about

7863
04:44:43,040 --> 04:44:45,040
what was really going on in

7864
04:44:45,040 --> 04:44:47,040
machine learning and in fact

7865
04:44:47,040 --> 04:44:49,040
it's funny how the first time you reached out to

7866
04:44:49,040 --> 04:44:51,040
me it's like four years ago for your AI

7867
04:44:51,040 --> 04:44:53,040
podcast. Yeah for people

7868
04:44:53,040 --> 04:44:55,040
yeah for people

7869
04:44:55,040 --> 04:44:57,040
who

7870
04:44:57,040 --> 04:44:59,040
listening to this should know that

7871
04:44:59,040 --> 04:45:01,040
first of all obviously

7872
04:45:01,040 --> 04:45:03,040
I've been a huge fan of yours for the longest

7873
04:45:03,040 --> 04:45:05,040
time but we've agreed to talk like yeah

7874
04:45:05,040 --> 04:45:07,040
like four years ago back when this was

7875
04:45:07,040 --> 04:45:09,040
called the artificial intelligence podcast

7876
04:45:09,040 --> 04:45:11,040
we wanted to

7877
04:45:11,040 --> 04:45:13,040
do a thing and you said yes

7878
04:45:13,040 --> 04:45:15,040
and I said it's like I don't know anything about

7879
04:45:15,040 --> 04:45:17,040
modern AI. That's right. I said I could kind of

7880
04:45:17,040 --> 04:45:19,040
take an angle on machine perception because

7881
04:45:19,040 --> 04:45:21,040
you know I'm doing a lot of that with the

7882
04:45:21,040 --> 04:45:23,040
sensors and the virtual reality but

7883
04:45:23,040 --> 04:45:25,040
we could probably find something to talk about.

7884
04:45:25,040 --> 04:45:27,040
And then so I mean and that's where

7885
04:45:27,040 --> 04:45:29,040
when did Sam talk to you about open AI

7886
04:45:29,040 --> 04:45:31,040
around the same time? No it was

7887
04:45:31,040 --> 04:45:33,040
a little bit after that so

7888
04:45:33,040 --> 04:45:35,040
I had done the most basic work

7889
04:45:35,040 --> 04:45:37,040
I had kind of done the neural networks

7890
04:45:37,040 --> 04:45:39,040
from scratch where I had gone and written

7891
04:45:39,040 --> 04:45:41,040
it all in C just to make sure I understood

7892
04:45:41,040 --> 04:45:43,040
backpropagation at the lowest

7893
04:45:43,040 --> 04:45:45,040
level and my my nuts and bolts

7894
04:45:45,040 --> 04:45:47,040
approach but after Sam

7895
04:45:47,040 --> 04:45:49,040
approached me

7896
04:45:49,040 --> 04:45:51,040
I was flattering to think that he thought

7897
04:45:51,040 --> 04:45:53,040
that I could be useful at open

7898
04:45:53,040 --> 04:45:55,040
AI largely for kind of like

7899
04:45:55,040 --> 04:45:57,040
systems optimization sorts

7900
04:45:57,040 --> 04:45:59,040
of things. I am

7901
04:45:59,040 --> 04:46:01,040
without being an expert but

7902
04:46:01,040 --> 04:46:03,040
I asked you know Ilya Sutskover to give me

7903
04:46:03,040 --> 04:46:05,040
a reading list and he gave me

7904
04:46:05,040 --> 04:46:07,040
a binder full of

7905
04:46:07,040 --> 04:46:09,040
all the papers that like

7906
04:46:09,040 --> 04:46:11,040
okay these are the important things if you

7907
04:46:11,040 --> 04:46:13,040
really read and understand all of these

7908
04:46:13,040 --> 04:46:15,040
you'll know like 80% of what most of the

7909
04:46:15,040 --> 04:46:17,040
you know the machine language researchers

7910
04:46:17,040 --> 04:46:19,040
work on and I went through and I read

7911
04:46:19,040 --> 04:46:21,040
all those papers multiple times and highlighted

7912
04:46:21,040 --> 04:46:23,040
them and went through and kind of

7913
04:46:23,040 --> 04:46:25,040
figured the things out there and then started

7914
04:46:25,040 --> 04:46:27,040
branching out into my own

7915
04:46:27,040 --> 04:46:29,040
sets of research on things and

7916
04:46:29,040 --> 04:46:31,040
actually started writing my own experiments

7917
04:46:31,040 --> 04:46:33,040
and doing kind of figuring out

7918
04:46:33,040 --> 04:46:35,040
you know finding out what I don't know

7919
04:46:35,040 --> 04:46:37,040
what the limits of my knowledge are and starting

7920
04:46:37,040 --> 04:46:39,040
to get some of my angles of attack on

7921
04:46:39,040 --> 04:46:41,040
things the things that I think are a little

7922
04:46:41,040 --> 04:46:43,040
bit different from what people

7923
04:46:43,040 --> 04:46:45,040
are doing and

7924
04:46:45,040 --> 04:46:47,040
I've had a couple years now

7925
04:46:47,040 --> 04:46:49,040
like two years since I kind of left

7926
04:46:49,040 --> 04:46:51,040
the full-time position at Meta

7927
04:46:51,040 --> 04:46:53,040
and now I've kind

7928
04:46:53,040 --> 04:46:55,040
of pulled the trigger and said I'm going

7929
04:46:55,040 --> 04:46:57,040
to get serious about it but

7930
04:46:57,040 --> 04:46:59,040
some of my lessons all the way back to Armadillo Aerospace

7931
04:46:59,040 --> 04:47:01,040
about how I know I need to be

7932
04:47:01,040 --> 04:47:03,040
more committed to this where

7933
04:47:03,040 --> 04:47:05,040
there is that

7934
04:47:05,040 --> 04:47:07,040
it's both a freedom and a cost in some ways

7935
04:47:07,040 --> 04:47:09,040
when you know that you're wealthy enough to say

7936
04:47:09,040 --> 04:47:11,040
it's like this doesn't really mean anything

7937
04:47:11,040 --> 04:47:13,040
I can I can spend

7938
04:47:13,040 --> 04:47:15,040
I can spend a million dollars a year

7939
04:47:15,040 --> 04:47:17,040
for the rest of my life and it doesn't

7940
04:47:17,040 --> 04:47:19,040
mean anything it's fine

7941
04:47:19,040 --> 04:47:21,040
but that is an opportunity

7942
04:47:21,040 --> 04:47:23,040
to just kind of meander

7943
04:47:23,040 --> 04:47:25,040
and I could see that in myself

7944
04:47:25,040 --> 04:47:27,040
when I'm doing some things it's like oh this is

7945
04:47:27,040 --> 04:47:29,040
a kind of interesting curious thing

7946
04:47:29,040 --> 04:47:31,040
I've done this for a little while let's look at that

7947
04:47:31,040 --> 04:47:33,040
it's not really bearing down on the problem

7948
04:47:33,040 --> 04:47:35,040
so

7949
04:47:35,040 --> 04:47:37,040
there's a few things that

7950
04:47:37,040 --> 04:47:39,040
that I've done that are kind of tactics

7951
04:47:39,040 --> 04:47:41,040
for myself to make me more effective

7952
04:47:41,040 --> 04:47:43,040
like one thing I noticed I was not doing

7953
04:47:43,040 --> 04:47:45,040
well is

7954
04:47:45,040 --> 04:47:47,040
I had a Google Cloud account to get

7955
04:47:47,040 --> 04:47:49,040
GPUs there and I was finding I was very

7956
04:47:49,040 --> 04:47:51,040
rarely doing that for no good psychological

7957
04:47:51,040 --> 04:47:53,040
reasons where I'm like oh

7958
04:47:53,040 --> 04:47:55,040
I can always think of something to do other than

7959
04:47:55,040 --> 04:47:57,040
to spin up instances and run an experiment

7960
04:47:57,040 --> 04:47:59,040
and you know keep working on my local Titans

7961
04:47:59,040 --> 04:48:01,040
or something

7962
04:48:01,040 --> 04:48:03,040
but it was really stupid I mean it was not a

7963
04:48:03,040 --> 04:48:05,040
lot of money I should have been running more

7964
04:48:05,040 --> 04:48:07,040
experiments there so I thought to myself

7965
04:48:07,040 --> 04:48:09,040
well I'm going to go buy

7966
04:48:09,040 --> 04:48:11,040
a quarter million dollar DGX station

7967
04:48:11,040 --> 04:48:13,040
I'm going to just like sit it right there

7968
04:48:13,040 --> 04:48:15,040
and it's going to mock me if I'm not using it

7969
04:48:15,040 --> 04:48:17,040
if the fans aren't running on that thing

7970
04:48:17,040 --> 04:48:19,040
I'm not properly utilizing it

7971
04:48:19,040 --> 04:48:21,040
and that's been helpful you know I've done

7972
04:48:21,040 --> 04:48:23,040
a lot more experiments since then

7973
04:48:23,040 --> 04:48:25,040
it's been interesting where I thought

7974
04:48:25,040 --> 04:48:27,040
all this low-level envy link optimized

7975
04:48:27,040 --> 04:48:29,040
stuff but 90% of what I do is just spin

7976
04:48:29,040 --> 04:48:31,040
up four instances of an experiment with

7977
04:48:31,040 --> 04:48:33,040
different hyperparameters on it

7978
04:48:33,040 --> 04:48:35,040
you're doing

7979
04:48:35,040 --> 04:48:37,040
like really sort of building up intuition

7980
04:48:37,040 --> 04:48:39,040
by doing ML experiments of different kinds

7981
04:48:39,040 --> 04:48:41,040
but so

7982
04:48:41,040 --> 04:48:43,040
the next big thing though is

7983
04:48:43,040 --> 04:48:45,040
I am you know I decided

7984
04:48:45,040 --> 04:48:47,040
that I was going to take some

7985
04:48:47,040 --> 04:48:49,040
investor money because

7986
04:48:49,040 --> 04:48:51,040
I have an overactive sense of responsibility

7987
04:48:51,040 --> 04:48:53,040
about other people's money

7988
04:48:53,040 --> 04:48:55,040
I am and it's like

7989
04:48:55,040 --> 04:48:57,040
I don't want

7990
04:48:57,040 --> 04:48:59,040
I mean a lot of my push

7991
04:48:59,040 --> 04:49:01,040
and my passionate entreaties for things

7992
04:49:01,040 --> 04:49:03,040
at Meta are it's like I don't want

7993
04:49:03,040 --> 04:49:05,040
Zuck to have wasted his money investing in Oculus

7994
04:49:05,040 --> 04:49:07,040
I want it to work out I want it to change

7995
04:49:07,040 --> 04:49:09,040
the world I want it to be worth

7996
04:49:09,040 --> 04:49:11,040
all of this time money and effort

7997
04:49:11,040 --> 04:49:13,040
going into it and I

7998
04:49:13,040 --> 04:49:15,040
expect that it's going to be like

7999
04:49:15,040 --> 04:49:17,040
that with my company

8000
04:49:17,040 --> 04:49:19,040
where it's a huge forcing function

8001
04:49:19,040 --> 04:49:21,040
this investment investors

8002
04:49:21,040 --> 04:49:23,040
that are going to expect something

8003
04:49:23,040 --> 04:49:25,040
of me now we've all had the conversation

8004
04:49:25,040 --> 04:49:27,040
that this is a low probability

8005
04:49:27,040 --> 04:49:29,040
long-term bet it's not something

8006
04:49:29,040 --> 04:49:31,040
that there's a million things I could do

8007
04:49:31,040 --> 04:49:33,040
that I would have line of sight on the value

8008
04:49:33,040 --> 04:49:35,040
proposition for this isn't that I think

8009
04:49:35,040 --> 04:49:37,040
there are there are unknown unknowns

8010
04:49:37,040 --> 04:49:39,040
in the way but

8011
04:49:39,040 --> 04:49:41,040
it's one of these things that it's

8012
04:49:41,040 --> 04:49:43,040
you know it's hyperball but it's potentially

8013
04:49:43,040 --> 04:49:45,040
one of the most important things humans ever

8014
04:49:45,040 --> 04:49:47,040
do and it's something that I think is

8015
04:49:47,040 --> 04:49:49,040
within our lifetimes if not within

8016
04:49:49,040 --> 04:49:51,040
a decade

8017
04:49:51,040 --> 04:49:53,040
to happen so

8018
04:49:53,040 --> 04:49:55,040
yeah this is just now happening

8019
04:49:55,040 --> 04:49:57,040
like term sheet like the ink is barely

8020
04:49:57,040 --> 04:49:59,040
virtually dry off

8021
04:49:59,040 --> 04:50:01,040
I mean as I mentioned you're all flying

8022
04:50:01,040 --> 04:50:03,040
like somebody I admire

8023
04:50:03,040 --> 04:50:05,040
somebody you know Andre Capati

8024
04:50:05,040 --> 04:50:07,040
I think the two of you different trajectories

8025
04:50:07,040 --> 04:50:09,040
in life but approach problems

8026
04:50:09,040 --> 04:50:11,040
similarly in that he codes

8027
04:50:11,040 --> 04:50:13,040
stuff from scratch up all the time

8028
04:50:13,040 --> 04:50:15,040
and

8029
04:50:15,040 --> 04:50:17,040
he's created a bunch of little things

8030
04:50:17,040 --> 04:50:19,040
that have

8031
04:50:19,040 --> 04:50:21,040
even outside the course

8032
04:50:21,040 --> 04:50:23,040
at Stanford

8033
04:50:23,040 --> 04:50:25,040
that have been tremendously useful

8034
04:50:25,040 --> 04:50:27,040
to build up intuition about stuff

8035
04:50:27,040 --> 04:50:29,040
but also to help people and

8036
04:50:29,040 --> 04:50:31,040
they're all in the realm of AI

8037
04:50:31,040 --> 04:50:33,040
do you see yourself

8038
04:50:33,040 --> 04:50:35,040
potentially doing things like this

8039
04:50:35,040 --> 04:50:37,040
you know not necessarily solving a

8040
04:50:37,040 --> 04:50:39,040
gigantic problem but on the journey

8041
04:50:39,040 --> 04:50:41,040
on the path to that

8042
04:50:41,040 --> 04:50:43,040
building up intuitions

8043
04:50:43,040 --> 04:50:45,040
and

8044
04:50:45,040 --> 04:50:47,040
sharing code or ideas

8045
04:50:47,040 --> 04:50:49,040
or systems

8046
04:50:49,040 --> 04:50:51,040
that give

8047
04:50:51,040 --> 04:50:53,040
inklings of AGI

8048
04:50:53,040 --> 04:50:55,040
but also kind of are useful to people

8049
04:50:55,040 --> 04:50:57,040
in some way so yeah first of all Andre is awesome

8050
04:50:57,040 --> 04:50:59,040
I learned a lot when I was going through my

8051
04:50:59,040 --> 04:51:01,040
larval phase from his blog posts

8052
04:51:01,040 --> 04:51:03,040
and his Stanford course and you know

8053
04:51:03,040 --> 04:51:05,040
super valuable I got to meet him first

8054
04:51:05,040 --> 04:51:07,040
a couple years ago when I was first

8055
04:51:07,040 --> 04:51:09,040
kind of starting off on my

8056
04:51:09,040 --> 04:51:11,040
gentleman scientist bit

8057
04:51:11,040 --> 04:51:13,040
and just a

8058
04:51:13,040 --> 04:51:15,040
few months ago when he went out on his sabbatical

8059
04:51:15,040 --> 04:51:17,040
he stopped by in Dallas and we talked

8060
04:51:17,040 --> 04:51:19,040
for a while and I had

8061
04:51:19,040 --> 04:51:21,040
a great time with him and then when I heard he actually left

8062
04:51:21,040 --> 04:51:23,040
Tesla I did of course along with

8063
04:51:23,040 --> 04:51:25,040
100 other people say hey

8064
04:51:25,040 --> 04:51:27,040
if you ever want to work with me

8065
04:51:27,040 --> 04:51:29,040
it would be an honor so

8066
04:51:29,040 --> 04:51:31,040
he thinks that he's going to be doing this educational

8067
04:51:31,040 --> 04:51:33,040
work but I think someone's going to make him an offer

8068
04:51:33,040 --> 04:51:35,040
he can't refuse before

8069
04:51:35,040 --> 04:51:37,040
he gets too far along on it

8070
04:51:37,040 --> 04:51:39,040
oh his current interest is educational

8071
04:51:39,040 --> 04:51:41,040
so yeah

8072
04:51:41,040 --> 04:51:43,040
he's a special mind

8073
04:51:43,040 --> 04:51:45,040
is there something you could speak to what makes

8074
04:51:45,040 --> 04:51:47,040
him so special

8075
04:51:47,040 --> 04:51:49,040
you know like he did

8076
04:51:49,040 --> 04:51:51,040
he was very much a programmers programmer

8077
04:51:51,040 --> 04:51:53,040
that was doing machine learning work rather than

8078
04:51:53,040 --> 04:51:55,040
it's a different feel

8079
04:51:55,040 --> 04:51:57,040
than an academic where you can see it

8080
04:51:57,040 --> 04:51:59,040
in paper sometimes where somebody that's

8081
04:51:59,040 --> 04:52:01,040
really a mathematician or a statistician

8082
04:52:01,040 --> 04:52:03,040
at heart and they're doing

8083
04:52:03,040 --> 04:52:05,040
something with machine learning but

8084
04:52:05,040 --> 04:52:07,040
you know Andre is about getting something done

8085
04:52:07,040 --> 04:52:09,040
and you could see it in like all of his

8086
04:52:09,040 --> 04:52:11,040
earliest approaches to it's like okay

8087
04:52:11,040 --> 04:52:13,040
here's how reinforcement learning works

8088
04:52:13,040 --> 04:52:15,040
here's how recurrent neural networks work

8089
04:52:15,040 --> 04:52:17,040
here's how transformers work

8090
04:52:17,040 --> 04:52:19,040
here's how crypto works

8091
04:52:19,040 --> 04:52:21,040
and I am

8092
04:52:21,040 --> 04:52:23,040
and yeah it's just

8093
04:52:23,040 --> 04:52:25,040
one of his old posts was like

8094
04:52:25,040 --> 04:52:27,040
a hacker's guide to machine learning

8095
04:52:27,040 --> 04:52:29,040
he deprecated that and said don't really pay attention

8096
04:52:29,040 --> 04:52:31,040
to what's in here but it's that

8097
04:52:31,040 --> 04:52:33,040
thought that carries through

8098
04:52:33,040 --> 04:52:35,040
in a lot of it where it is that

8099
04:52:35,040 --> 04:52:37,040
back again to that hacker mentality

8100
04:52:37,040 --> 04:52:39,040
and the hacker ethic with what he's doing

8101
04:52:39,040 --> 04:52:41,040
and sharing all of it

8102
04:52:41,040 --> 04:52:43,040
yeah and a lot of his approach to a new thing

8103
04:52:43,040 --> 04:52:45,040
like you said larva stage

8104
04:52:45,040 --> 04:52:47,040
is let me code up

8105
04:52:47,040 --> 04:52:49,040
the simplest possible thing

8106
04:52:49,040 --> 04:52:51,040
to build up intuition about it

8107
04:52:51,040 --> 04:52:53,040
yeah like I say I sketch with structs and things

8108
04:52:53,040 --> 04:52:55,040
when I'm just thinking about a problem

8109
04:52:55,040 --> 04:52:57,040
I'm thinking in some degree of code

8110
04:52:57,040 --> 04:52:59,040
you are also

8111
04:52:59,040 --> 04:53:01,040
among many things a Marshall

8112
04:53:01,040 --> 04:53:03,040
artist both Judo and Jiu Jitsu

8113
04:53:03,040 --> 04:53:05,040
how has this helped

8114
04:53:05,040 --> 04:53:07,040
make you the person you are

8115
04:53:07,040 --> 04:53:09,040
so I mean I was a competent club player

8116
04:53:09,040 --> 04:53:11,040
in Judo and grappling

8117
04:53:11,040 --> 04:53:13,040
I mean I was you know by no means

8118
04:53:13,040 --> 04:53:15,040
any kind of a superstar but

8119
04:53:15,040 --> 04:53:17,040
it was I went through a few phases

8120
04:53:17,040 --> 04:53:19,040
with it where I did some

8121
04:53:19,040 --> 04:53:21,040
when I was quite young

8122
04:53:21,040 --> 04:53:23,040
a little bit more when I was 17

8123
04:53:23,040 --> 04:53:25,040
and then I got into it

8124
04:53:25,040 --> 04:53:27,040
kind of seriously in my mid 30s

8125
04:53:27,040 --> 04:53:29,040
and you know I went pretty far

8126
04:53:29,040 --> 04:53:31,040
with it and I was you know

8127
04:53:31,040 --> 04:53:33,040
pretty good at some of the things that I was doing

8128
04:53:33,040 --> 04:53:35,040
and I did appreciate it quite a bit

8129
04:53:35,040 --> 04:53:37,040
where

8130
04:53:37,040 --> 04:53:39,040
on the one hand it's always

8131
04:53:39,040 --> 04:53:41,040
if you're going to do exercise or something

8132
04:53:41,040 --> 04:53:43,040
it's a more motivating form of exercise

8133
04:53:43,040 --> 04:53:45,040
if someone is crushing you

8134
04:53:45,040 --> 04:53:47,040
you are motivated

8135
04:53:47,040 --> 04:53:49,040
to do something about that

8136
04:53:49,040 --> 04:53:51,040
to up your attributes and be better about

8137
04:53:51,040 --> 04:53:53,040
getting out of that

8138
04:53:53,040 --> 04:53:55,040
but there's also that sense that

8139
04:53:55,040 --> 04:53:57,040
I was not

8140
04:53:57,040 --> 04:53:59,040
I was not a sports guy

8141
04:53:59,040 --> 04:54:01,040
I did do wrestling in junior high

8142
04:54:01,040 --> 04:54:03,040
I think I would have

8143
04:54:03,040 --> 04:54:05,040
I would have been good for me if I'd carried that on

8144
04:54:05,040 --> 04:54:07,040
into high school and had a little bit more

8145
04:54:07,040 --> 04:54:09,040
of that I mean it's like I

8146
04:54:09,040 --> 04:54:11,040
you know felt a little bit of wrestling

8147
04:54:11,040 --> 04:54:13,040
vibe with always going on about embracing

8148
04:54:13,040 --> 04:54:15,040
the grind and like that push that I

8149
04:54:15,040 --> 04:54:17,040
associate with the wrestling team

8150
04:54:17,040 --> 04:54:19,040
that I in hindsight

8151
04:54:19,040 --> 04:54:21,040
I wish I had gone through that and pushed myself

8152
04:54:21,040 --> 04:54:23,040
that way

8153
04:54:23,040 --> 04:54:25,040
but even getting back into Judo and Jujitsu

8154
04:54:25,040 --> 04:54:27,040
in my mid 30s as usually

8155
04:54:27,040 --> 04:54:29,040
the old man on the mat with that

8156
04:54:29,040 --> 04:54:31,040
still the

8157
04:54:31,040 --> 04:54:33,040
sense that

8158
04:54:33,040 --> 04:54:35,040
working out with the group

8159
04:54:35,040 --> 04:54:37,040
and having the guys

8160
04:54:37,040 --> 04:54:39,040
that you're beating each other up with it

8161
04:54:39,040 --> 04:54:41,040
but you just feel

8162
04:54:41,040 --> 04:54:43,040
good coming out of it and I can remember

8163
04:54:43,040 --> 04:54:45,040
those driving home

8164
04:54:45,040 --> 04:54:47,040
aching in various ways and just thinking

8165
04:54:47,040 --> 04:54:49,040
it's like that was really great

8166
04:54:49,040 --> 04:54:51,040
and

8167
04:54:51,040 --> 04:54:53,040
it's mixing with a bunch of people that had nothing

8168
04:54:53,040 --> 04:54:55,040
to do with any of the things that

8169
04:54:55,040 --> 04:54:57,040
I worked with every once in a while

8170
04:54:57,040 --> 04:54:59,040
to be like oh you're the doom guy

8171
04:54:59,040 --> 04:55:01,040
and but for the most part

8172
04:55:01,040 --> 04:55:03,040
it was just different slice of life

8173
04:55:03,040 --> 04:55:05,040
you know a good thing

8174
04:55:05,040 --> 04:55:07,040
and I made the call when I was

8175
04:55:07,040 --> 04:55:09,040
40 that's like maybe I'm getting a little old

8176
04:55:09,040 --> 04:55:11,040
for this I had separated a rib

8177
04:55:11,040 --> 04:55:13,040
and tweaked a few things and I got out

8178
04:55:13,040 --> 04:55:15,040
without any really bad injuries

8179
04:55:15,040 --> 04:55:17,040
and was like

8180
04:55:17,040 --> 04:55:19,040
have I dodged enough bullets should I

8181
04:55:19,040 --> 04:55:21,040
hang it up I went back

8182
04:55:21,040 --> 04:55:23,040
I've gone a couple times

8183
04:55:23,040 --> 04:55:25,040
in the last decade trying to get my kids

8184
04:55:25,040 --> 04:55:27,040
into it a little bit I didn't really stick

8185
04:55:27,040 --> 04:55:29,040
with any of them but it was fun to get

8186
04:55:29,040 --> 04:55:31,040
back on the mats I really

8187
04:55:31,040 --> 04:55:33,040
hurts for a while when you haven't gone

8188
04:55:33,040 --> 04:55:35,040
I gone for a while but

8189
04:55:35,040 --> 04:55:37,040
I still debate this

8190
04:55:37,040 --> 04:55:39,040
pretty constantly my brother's only a year younger

8191
04:55:39,040 --> 04:55:41,040
than me and he's going kind of hard in jujitsu

8192
04:55:41,040 --> 04:55:43,040
right now and I you know he was

8193
04:55:43,040 --> 04:55:45,040
just he won a few medals at the last

8194
04:55:45,040 --> 04:55:47,040
tournament he was at competing

8195
04:55:47,040 --> 04:55:49,040
and I was thinking yeah I guess we're

8196
04:55:49,040 --> 04:55:51,040
in the executive division if you're over

8197
04:55:51,040 --> 04:55:53,040
50 or over 45

8198
04:55:53,040 --> 04:55:55,040
something and

8199
04:55:55,040 --> 04:55:57,040
it's not out of the question that

8200
04:55:57,040 --> 04:55:59,040
I go back at some point and do some of this

8201
04:55:59,040 --> 04:56:01,040
but again I'm just reorganizing

8202
04:56:01,040 --> 04:56:03,040
my life around more focus

8203
04:56:03,040 --> 04:56:05,040
probably not going to happen

8204
04:56:05,040 --> 04:56:07,040
I'm pushing my exercise around

8205
04:56:07,040 --> 04:56:09,040
to give me a longer uninterrupted intellectual

8206
04:56:09,040 --> 04:56:11,040
focus time pushing it to the beginning

8207
04:56:11,040 --> 04:56:13,040
or the end of the game like running and stuff like that

8208
04:56:13,040 --> 04:56:15,040
walking yeah yeah running

8209
04:56:15,040 --> 04:56:17,040
and calisthenics and some things like

8210
04:56:17,040 --> 04:56:19,040
that but it allows you to still think

8211
04:56:19,040 --> 04:56:21,040
about a problem and but if you're going to

8212
04:56:21,040 --> 04:56:23,040
do judo club or something you're you've got to fix

8213
04:56:23,040 --> 04:56:25,040
it's going to be seven o'clock or whatever

8214
04:56:25,040 --> 04:56:27,040
10 o'clock on Saturday

8215
04:56:27,040 --> 04:56:29,040
although I talked about this a little bit

8216
04:56:29,040 --> 04:56:31,040
when I was on Rogan and shortly after

8217
04:56:31,040 --> 04:56:33,040
that Carlos Machado did reach out

8218
04:56:33,040 --> 04:56:35,040
and I had trained with him for years

8219
04:56:35,040 --> 04:56:37,040
back in the day and he was like

8220
04:56:37,040 --> 04:56:39,040
hey we've got kind of a small private club

8221
04:56:39,040 --> 04:56:41,040
with a bunch of executive type

8222
04:56:41,040 --> 04:56:43,040
people and

8223
04:56:43,040 --> 04:56:45,040
it gets it does tempt me

8224
04:56:45,040 --> 04:56:47,040
yeah I don't know if you know him

8225
04:56:47,040 --> 04:56:49,040
but John Donahart

8226
04:56:49,040 --> 04:56:51,040
came here to Austin

8227
04:56:51,040 --> 04:56:53,040
with Gordon Ryan and a few other folks

8228
04:56:53,040 --> 04:56:55,040
and he has a very interesting way

8229
04:56:55,040 --> 04:56:57,040
very deep systematic way

8230
04:56:57,040 --> 04:56:59,040
of thinking about jiu-jitsu

8231
04:56:59,040 --> 04:57:01,040
that reveals the

8232
04:57:01,040 --> 04:57:03,040
the chest of it

8233
04:57:03,040 --> 04:57:05,040
the like the

8234
04:57:05,040 --> 04:57:07,040
the science of it

8235
04:57:07,040 --> 04:57:09,040
and I do think about that more as

8236
04:57:09,040 --> 04:57:11,040
kind of an older person considering the martial arts

8237
04:57:11,040 --> 04:57:13,040
where I can remember the very earliest

8238
04:57:13,040 --> 04:57:15,040
days getting back into judo and I'm like

8239
04:57:15,040 --> 04:57:17,040
teach me submissions right now

8240
04:57:17,040 --> 04:57:19,040
you know it's like learn the arm bar

8241
04:57:19,040 --> 04:57:21,040
learn the choke

8242
04:57:21,040 --> 04:57:23,040
but as you get older you start thinking more about

8243
04:57:23,040 --> 04:57:25,040
it's like okay I really do want to

8244
04:57:25,040 --> 04:57:27,040
learn the entire canon of judo

8245
04:57:27,040 --> 04:57:29,040
it's like all the different things there

8246
04:57:29,040 --> 04:57:31,040
and all the different approaches for it

8247
04:57:31,040 --> 04:57:33,040
not just the you know if you want to compete

8248
04:57:33,040 --> 04:57:35,040
there's just a handful of things you learn really really well

8249
04:57:35,040 --> 04:57:37,040
but sometimes there's interest

8250
04:57:37,040 --> 04:57:39,040
in learning a little bit more of the scope there

8251
04:57:39,040 --> 04:57:41,040
and figuring some things out from

8252
04:57:41,040 --> 04:57:43,040
at one point I had

8253
04:57:43,040 --> 04:57:45,040
wasn't exactly a spreadsheet but I did have

8254
04:57:45,040 --> 04:57:47,040
a big long text file with like here's the things

8255
04:57:47,040 --> 04:57:49,040
that I learned in here like ways you

8256
04:57:49,040 --> 04:57:51,040
chain this together and while

8257
04:57:51,040 --> 04:57:53,040
when I went back a few years

8258
04:57:53,040 --> 04:57:55,040
ago it was good to see that I

8259
04:57:55,040 --> 04:57:57,040
whipped myself back into reasonable shape

8260
04:57:57,040 --> 04:57:59,040
about doing the basic grappling but I know

8261
04:57:59,040 --> 04:58:01,040
there was a ton of the subtleties that were

8262
04:58:01,040 --> 04:58:03,040
just that were gone but could probably be

8263
04:58:03,040 --> 04:58:05,040
brought back reasonably quickly

8264
04:58:05,040 --> 04:58:07,040
and there's also the benefit I mean

8265
04:58:07,040 --> 04:58:09,040
you're exceptionally successful now

8266
04:58:11,040 --> 04:58:13,040
you're brilliant

8267
04:58:13,040 --> 04:58:15,040
and the problem the old problem

8268
04:58:15,040 --> 04:58:17,040
of the ego

8269
04:58:17,040 --> 04:58:19,040
I still pushed kind of

8270
04:58:19,040 --> 04:58:21,040
harder than I should I mean that was

8271
04:58:21,040 --> 04:58:23,040
I was one of those people that

8272
04:58:23,040 --> 04:58:25,040
I'm on the smaller side

8273
04:58:25,040 --> 04:58:27,040
for a lot of the people competing

8274
04:58:27,040 --> 04:58:29,040
and I would you know I'd go with

8275
04:58:29,040 --> 04:58:31,040
all the big guys and I'd go hard

8276
04:58:31,040 --> 04:58:33,040
and I'd push myself a lot

8277
04:58:33,040 --> 04:58:35,040
and that would be one of those where

8278
04:58:35,040 --> 04:58:37,040
I'd be

8279
04:58:37,040 --> 04:58:39,040
dangerous to anyone for the first five minutes

8280
04:58:39,040 --> 04:58:41,040
but then sometimes after that I'm already dead

8281
04:58:41,040 --> 04:58:43,040
and I knew it was terrible for me because

8282
04:58:43,040 --> 04:58:45,040
it made the you know it meant

8283
04:58:45,040 --> 04:58:47,040
I got less training time with all of that

8284
04:58:47,040 --> 04:58:49,040
when you go and you just gas out

8285
04:58:49,040 --> 04:58:51,040
relatively quickly there and I

8286
04:58:51,040 --> 04:58:53,040
like to think that I would be better

8287
04:58:53,040 --> 04:58:55,040
about that where after I gave

8288
04:58:55,040 --> 04:58:57,040
up judo I started doing the half marathons

8289
04:58:57,040 --> 04:58:59,040
and tough butters and things like that

8290
04:58:59,040 --> 04:59:01,040
and so when I did go back to the

8291
04:59:01,040 --> 04:59:03,040
local judo kai club I thought

8292
04:59:03,040 --> 04:59:05,040
oh I should have better cardio for this

8293
04:59:05,040 --> 04:59:07,040
because I'm a runner now and I do all of this

8294
04:59:07,040 --> 04:59:09,040
and didn't work out that way

8295
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:11,040
and that's the same old thing where

8296
04:59:11,040 --> 04:59:13,040
just push really hard

8297
04:59:13,040 --> 04:59:15,040
strain really hard and

8298
04:59:15,040 --> 04:59:17,040
and of course when I worked with good guys

8299
04:59:17,040 --> 04:59:19,040
like Carlos it's like

8300
04:59:19,040 --> 04:59:21,040
just the whole flow like water

8301
04:59:21,040 --> 04:59:23,040
thing is real and he's just like

8302
04:59:23,040 --> 04:59:25,040
that's true with judo too some of the best

8303
04:59:25,040 --> 04:59:27,040
people like I've trained with

8304
04:59:27,040 --> 04:59:29,040
Olympic gold medalists and

8305
04:59:29,040 --> 04:59:31,040
for some reason with them

8306
04:59:31,040 --> 04:59:33,040
everything's easier

8307
04:59:33,040 --> 04:59:35,040
everything is you actually start to

8308
04:59:35,040 --> 04:59:37,040
feel the science of it

8309
04:59:37,040 --> 04:59:39,040
everything's effortless

8310
04:59:39,040 --> 04:59:41,040
you understand that there's an art

8311
04:59:41,040 --> 04:59:43,040
to it it's not just an exercise

8312
04:59:43,040 --> 04:59:45,040
it was interesting where I did

8313
04:59:45,040 --> 04:59:47,040
go to the Kodakon in Japan

8314
04:59:47,040 --> 04:59:49,040
the birthplace of judo and everything

8315
04:59:49,040 --> 04:59:51,040
and I remember I rolled with one old

8316
04:59:51,040 --> 04:59:53,040
guy I didn't

8317
04:59:53,040 --> 04:59:55,040
start standing just started on groundwork

8318
04:59:55,040 --> 04:59:57,040
and it was striking how

8319
04:59:57,040 --> 04:59:59,040
different it was from Carlos he was still

8320
04:59:59,040 --> 05:00:01,040
he was better than me and he got my arm

8321
05:00:01,040 --> 05:00:03,040
and I had to tap there but

8322
05:00:03,040 --> 05:00:05,040
it was a completely different style

8323
05:00:05,040 --> 05:00:07,040
where I just felt like I could do nothing

8324
05:00:07,040 --> 05:00:09,040
he was just enveloping me and just like slowly

8325
05:00:09,040 --> 05:00:11,040
ground it down put my arm and bent

8326
05:00:11,040 --> 05:00:13,040
it while with Carlos

8327
05:00:13,040 --> 05:00:15,040
you know he's just loose and free and you always

8328
05:00:15,040 --> 05:00:17,040
thought like oh you're just going to go grab something

8329
05:00:17,040 --> 05:00:19,040
but you never had any chance to do it but it was

8330
05:00:19,040 --> 05:00:21,040
very different feeling that's a good summary

8331
05:00:21,040 --> 05:00:23,040
of the difference between Jiu-Jitsu and Judo

8332
05:00:23,040 --> 05:00:25,040
and Jiu-Jitsu there's it is a dance

8333
05:00:25,040 --> 05:00:27,040
and you feel like there's a freedom

8334
05:00:27,040 --> 05:00:29,040
and actually

8335
05:00:29,040 --> 05:00:31,040
anybody I like

8336
05:00:31,040 --> 05:00:33,040
Gordon Ryan one of the best

8337
05:00:33,040 --> 05:00:35,040
grappler in the world Nogi grappler in the world

8338
05:00:35,040 --> 05:00:37,040
there's a feeling like you can do

8339
05:00:37,040 --> 05:00:39,040
anything but

8340
05:00:39,040 --> 05:00:41,040
when you actually try to do something

8341
05:00:41,040 --> 05:00:43,040
you can't just magically doesn't work but with

8342
05:00:43,040 --> 05:00:45,040
the best judo players in the world yeah it

8343
05:00:45,040 --> 05:00:47,040
does feel like there's

8344
05:00:47,040 --> 05:00:49,040
a blanket that weighs a thousand

8345
05:00:49,040 --> 05:00:51,040
pounds on top of you and there's

8346
05:00:51,040 --> 05:00:53,040
not a feeling like you can do anything

8347
05:00:53,040 --> 05:00:55,040
you just you're trapped and that's

8348
05:00:55,040 --> 05:00:57,040
a that's a style that's a difference

8349
05:00:57,040 --> 05:00:59,040
in the style of martial arts but it's also

8350
05:00:59,040 --> 05:01:01,040
once you start to study you

8351
05:01:01,040 --> 05:01:03,040
understand it all has to do with human

8352
05:01:03,040 --> 05:01:05,040
movement and the physics of it

8353
05:01:05,040 --> 05:01:07,040
and the leverage and all that kind of stuff

8354
05:01:07,040 --> 05:01:09,040
and that's like that's super fascinating

8355
05:01:09,040 --> 05:01:11,040
at the end of the day for me

8356
05:01:11,040 --> 05:01:13,040
the biggest benefit is in the humbling

8357
05:01:13,040 --> 05:01:15,040
aspect when another human being

8358
05:01:15,040 --> 05:01:17,040
kind of

8359
05:01:17,040 --> 05:01:19,040
tells you that

8360
05:01:19,040 --> 05:01:21,040
you know there's a hierarchy or there's

8361
05:01:21,040 --> 05:01:23,040
a

8362
05:01:23,040 --> 05:01:25,040
you're not that special

8363
05:01:25,040 --> 05:01:27,040
and in the most extreme case when you tap

8364
05:01:27,040 --> 05:01:29,040
to a choke you are basically

8365
05:01:29,040 --> 05:01:31,040
living because somebody let you live

8366
05:01:31,040 --> 05:01:33,040
and that's that is

8367
05:01:33,040 --> 05:01:35,040
one of those if you think about it that is a

8368
05:01:35,040 --> 05:01:37,040
closer brush with mortality than

8369
05:01:37,040 --> 05:01:39,040
than most people consider

8370
05:01:39,040 --> 05:01:41,040
and that

8371
05:01:41,040 --> 05:01:43,040
kind of humbling

8372
05:01:43,040 --> 05:01:45,040
act is good to take to your

8373
05:01:45,040 --> 05:01:47,040
work then where it's harder to get

8374
05:01:47,040 --> 05:01:49,040
humbled you know

8375
05:01:49,040 --> 05:01:51,040
yeah because nobody's nobody that does any

8376
05:01:51,040 --> 05:01:53,040
martial art is coming out thinking I'm the best

8377
05:01:53,040 --> 05:01:55,040
in the world at anything because

8378
05:01:55,040 --> 05:01:57,040
everybody loses

8379
05:01:57,040 --> 05:01:59,040
let me ask you for advice

8380
05:01:59,040 --> 05:02:01,040
what advice would you give to young

8381
05:02:01,040 --> 05:02:03,040
people today

8382
05:02:03,040 --> 05:02:05,040
about life about career

8383
05:02:05,040 --> 05:02:07,040
how they can have a job

8384
05:02:07,040 --> 05:02:09,040
how they can have an

8385
05:02:09,040 --> 05:02:11,040
impact how they can have a life

8386
05:02:11,040 --> 05:02:13,040
they could be proud of

8387
05:02:13,040 --> 05:02:15,040
so it was kind of fun I got

8388
05:02:15,040 --> 05:02:17,040
invited to give the commencement speech back

8389
05:02:17,040 --> 05:02:19,040
at the I went to college

8390
05:02:19,040 --> 05:02:21,040
for two semesters and

8391
05:02:21,040 --> 05:02:23,040
dropped out and went on to do my tech stuff

8392
05:02:23,040 --> 05:02:25,040
but they still wanted me to come back

8393
05:02:25,040 --> 05:02:27,040
and give a commencement speech

8394
05:02:27,040 --> 05:02:29,040
and I got that pinned on my twitter

8395
05:02:29,040 --> 05:02:31,040
account I still feel good about everything

8396
05:02:31,040 --> 05:02:33,040
that I said there

8397
05:02:33,040 --> 05:02:35,040
and my biggest point was

8398
05:02:35,040 --> 05:02:37,040
that the path

8399
05:02:37,040 --> 05:02:39,040
for me might not be the path for everyone

8400
05:02:39,040 --> 05:02:41,040
and in fact the advice

8401
05:02:41,040 --> 05:02:43,040
the path that I took and even the advice

8402
05:02:43,040 --> 05:02:45,040
that I would give based on my

8403
05:02:45,040 --> 05:02:47,040
experience and learnings probably

8404
05:02:47,040 --> 05:02:49,040
isn't the best advice for everyone

8405
05:02:49,040 --> 05:02:51,040
because what I did was all about

8406
05:02:51,040 --> 05:02:53,040
this knowledge in depth

8407
05:02:53,040 --> 05:02:55,040
about not just having this

8408
05:02:55,040 --> 05:02:57,040
surface level ability to make things

8409
05:02:57,040 --> 05:02:59,040
do what I want but to really understand

8410
05:02:59,040 --> 05:03:01,040
them through and through to let me

8411
05:03:01,040 --> 05:03:03,040
do the systems engineering work and

8412
05:03:03,040 --> 05:03:05,040
sometimes find these inefficiencies

8413
05:03:05,040 --> 05:03:07,040
that can be bypassed

8414
05:03:07,040 --> 05:03:09,040
and that the whole

8415
05:03:09,040 --> 05:03:11,040
world doesn't need that you know most

8416
05:03:11,040 --> 05:03:13,040
programmers don't need or engineers of any

8417
05:03:13,040 --> 05:03:15,040
kind don't necessarily need to do that

8418
05:03:15,040 --> 05:03:17,040
they need to do a little job that's been

8419
05:03:17,040 --> 05:03:19,040
parceled out to them be reliable

8420
05:03:19,040 --> 05:03:21,040
let people depend on you

8421
05:03:21,040 --> 05:03:23,040
and have quality work with all of that

8422
05:03:23,040 --> 05:03:25,040
but people that do

8423
05:03:25,040 --> 05:03:27,040
have an inclination

8424
05:03:27,040 --> 05:03:29,040
for wanting to know things deeper

8425
05:03:29,040 --> 05:03:31,040
and learn things deeper

8426
05:03:31,040 --> 05:03:33,040
you know the

8427
05:03:33,040 --> 05:03:35,040
there are just layers and layers of things

8428
05:03:35,040 --> 05:03:37,040
out there and it's amazing

8429
05:03:37,040 --> 05:03:39,040
if you're the right person that is

8430
05:03:39,040 --> 05:03:41,040
excited about that

8431
05:03:41,040 --> 05:03:43,040
the world's never been like this before

8432
05:03:43,040 --> 05:03:45,040
it's better than ever I mean everything

8433
05:03:45,040 --> 05:03:47,040
that was wonderful for me is still there

8434
05:03:47,040 --> 05:03:49,040
and there's whole new worlds

8435
05:03:49,040 --> 05:03:51,040
more on the different things that you

8436
05:03:51,040 --> 05:03:53,040
can do and that

8437
05:03:53,040 --> 05:03:55,040
you know it's hard work

8438
05:03:55,040 --> 05:03:57,040
embrace the grind with it

8439
05:03:57,040 --> 05:03:59,040
and understand as much as you can

8440
05:03:59,040 --> 05:04:01,040
and then be

8441
05:04:01,040 --> 05:04:03,040
prepared for opportunities to present

8442
05:04:03,040 --> 05:04:05,040
themselves where you can't just

8443
05:04:05,040 --> 05:04:07,040
say this is my golden life and just

8444
05:04:07,040 --> 05:04:09,040
push at that I mean you might be able

8445
05:04:09,040 --> 05:04:11,040
to do that but you're going to make more

8446
05:04:11,040 --> 05:04:13,040
total progress if you say I'm

8447
05:04:13,040 --> 05:04:15,040
preparing myself with this broad set

8448
05:04:15,040 --> 05:04:17,040
of tools and then I'm being aware

8449
05:04:17,040 --> 05:04:19,040
of all the way things are changing

8450
05:04:19,040 --> 05:04:21,040
as I move through the world and as the whole

8451
05:04:21,040 --> 05:04:23,040
world changes around me and then looking

8452
05:04:23,040 --> 05:04:25,040
for opportunities to deploy the tools

8453
05:04:25,040 --> 05:04:27,040
that you've built and

8454
05:04:27,040 --> 05:04:29,040
there's going to be more and more of those

8455
05:04:29,040 --> 05:04:31,040
types of things there where

8456
05:04:31,040 --> 05:04:33,040
an awareness of what's happening where

8457
05:04:33,040 --> 05:04:35,040
the inefficiencies are what things

8458
05:04:35,040 --> 05:04:37,040
can be done what's possible

8459
05:04:37,040 --> 05:04:39,040
versus what's current practice

8460
05:04:39,040 --> 05:04:41,040
and then finding those areas where

8461
05:04:41,040 --> 05:04:43,040
you can go and make an adjustment

8462
05:04:43,040 --> 05:04:45,040
and make something that may

8463
05:04:45,040 --> 05:04:47,040
affect millions or billions of people

8464
05:04:47,040 --> 05:04:49,040
in the world make it better

8465
05:04:49,040 --> 05:04:51,040
when maybe from your own example

8466
05:04:51,040 --> 05:04:53,040
how are you able to recognize

8467
05:04:53,040 --> 05:04:55,040
this about yourself that you saw

8468
05:04:55,040 --> 05:04:57,040
the layers in a particular thing

8469
05:04:57,040 --> 05:04:59,040
and you were drawn to

8470
05:04:59,040 --> 05:05:01,040
discovering deeper and deeper truths about it

8471
05:05:01,040 --> 05:05:03,040
is that something that was obvious

8472
05:05:03,040 --> 05:05:05,040
to you that you couldn't help or is there

8473
05:05:05,040 --> 05:05:07,040
some actions you had to take to actually

8474
05:05:07,040 --> 05:05:09,040
allow yourself to dig deep

8475
05:05:09,040 --> 05:05:11,040
so in the earliest days of personal computers

8476
05:05:11,040 --> 05:05:13,040
I remember the reference manuals

8477
05:05:13,040 --> 05:05:15,040
and the very early ones even had

8478
05:05:15,040 --> 05:05:17,040
schematics of computers

8479
05:05:17,040 --> 05:05:19,040
in the background in the back

8480
05:05:19,040 --> 05:05:21,040
of the books as well as firmware

8481
05:05:21,040 --> 05:05:23,040
listings and things and I could look at

8482
05:05:23,040 --> 05:05:25,040
that and at that time when I was a

8483
05:05:25,040 --> 05:05:27,040
younger teenager I didn't understand

8484
05:05:27,040 --> 05:05:29,040
a lot of that stuff how the

8485
05:05:29,040 --> 05:05:31,040
different things worked I was

8486
05:05:31,040 --> 05:05:33,040
pulling out the information that I could get

8487
05:05:33,040 --> 05:05:35,040
but I always wanted to know all of that

8488
05:05:35,040 --> 05:05:37,040
there was like kind of

8489
05:05:37,040 --> 05:05:39,040
magical information sitting down there

8490
05:05:39,040 --> 05:05:41,040
it's like the elder lore that some gray

8491
05:05:41,040 --> 05:05:43,040
nerd is the keeper of

8492
05:05:43,040 --> 05:05:45,040
and so I always felt that

8493
05:05:45,040 --> 05:05:47,040
pull for wanting to know more

8494
05:05:47,040 --> 05:05:49,040
wanting to explore

8495
05:05:49,040 --> 05:05:51,040
the mysterious areas there

8496
05:05:51,040 --> 05:05:53,040
and that

8497
05:05:53,040 --> 05:05:55,040
followed right in through all the things

8498
05:05:55,040 --> 05:05:57,040
that got the value exploring the video cards

8499
05:05:57,040 --> 05:05:59,040
leading to the

8500
05:05:59,040 --> 05:06:01,040
scrolling advantages

8501
05:06:01,040 --> 05:06:03,040
exploring some of the academic papers

8502
05:06:03,040 --> 05:06:05,040
and things learning about BSP trees

8503
05:06:05,040 --> 05:06:07,040
and the different things that I could do

8504
05:06:07,040 --> 05:06:09,040
with those systems

8505
05:06:09,040 --> 05:06:11,040
just that the huge larval phases

8506
05:06:11,040 --> 05:06:13,040
going through aerospace just

8507
05:06:13,040 --> 05:06:15,040
reading bookshelves full of books

8508
05:06:15,040 --> 05:06:17,040
again that point where I have enough money

8509
05:06:17,040 --> 05:06:19,040
I can buy all the books I want

8510
05:06:19,040 --> 05:06:21,040
it was so valuable

8511
05:06:21,040 --> 05:06:23,040
where I was terrible with my money

8512
05:06:23,040 --> 05:06:25,040
when I was a kid my mom thought I would always be

8513
05:06:25,040 --> 05:06:27,040
broke because I'd buy my

8514
05:06:27,040 --> 05:06:29,040
comic books and just be out of money

8515
05:06:29,040 --> 05:06:31,040
but it was like all the pizza I want

8516
05:06:31,040 --> 05:06:33,040
all the diet coke I want

8517
05:06:33,040 --> 05:06:35,040
video games and then books

8518
05:06:35,040 --> 05:06:37,040
and it didn't take that much

8519
05:06:37,040 --> 05:06:39,040
I think in 27k a year

8520
05:06:39,040 --> 05:06:41,040
I felt rich and I was just getting

8521
05:06:41,040 --> 05:06:43,040
all the things that I wanted

8522
05:06:43,040 --> 05:06:45,040
but that sense of

8523
05:06:45,040 --> 05:06:47,040
books have always been magical to me

8524
05:06:47,040 --> 05:06:49,040
and that was one of the things that really made me smile

8525
05:06:49,040 --> 05:06:51,040
is Andre had said

8526
05:06:51,040 --> 05:06:53,040
when he came over to my house he said

8527
05:06:53,040 --> 05:06:55,040
he found my library inspiring

8528
05:06:55,040 --> 05:06:57,040
and it was great to see

8529
05:06:57,040 --> 05:06:59,040
he's kind of a younger guy

8530
05:06:59,040 --> 05:07:01,040
I sometimes wonder if younger people these days

8531
05:07:01,040 --> 05:07:03,040
have the same relationship with books that I do

8532
05:07:03,040 --> 05:07:05,040
where they were such a cornerstone

8533
05:07:05,040 --> 05:07:07,040
in many ways but that sense that

8534
05:07:07,040 --> 05:07:09,040
yeah I always wanted to know it all

8535
05:07:09,040 --> 05:07:11,040
I know I can't and that was one of the last things

8536
05:07:11,040 --> 05:07:13,040
I said you can't know everything

8537
05:07:13,040 --> 05:07:15,040
but you should convince yourself that you can know

8538
05:07:15,040 --> 05:07:17,040
anything you know any one

8539
05:07:17,040 --> 05:07:19,040
particular thing it was created

8540
05:07:19,040 --> 05:07:21,040
and discovered by humans you can learn it

8541
05:07:21,040 --> 05:07:23,040
you can find out what you need on there

8542
05:07:23,040 --> 05:07:25,040
and you can learn it deeply

8543
05:07:25,040 --> 05:07:27,040
you can drive a nail down

8544
05:07:27,040 --> 05:07:29,040
through whatever layer cake problem

8545
05:07:29,040 --> 05:07:31,040
space you've got and learn

8546
05:07:31,040 --> 05:07:33,040
a cross section there

8547
05:07:33,040 --> 05:07:35,040
there's an impact doing that

8548
05:07:35,040 --> 05:07:37,040
you can attain happiness

8549
05:07:37,040 --> 05:07:39,040
doing that there's something so fulfilling

8550
05:07:39,040 --> 05:07:41,040
about becoming a craftsman of a thing

8551
05:07:41,040 --> 05:07:43,040
yeah and I don't want to tell people that

8552
05:07:43,040 --> 05:07:45,040
look this is a good career move

8553
05:07:45,040 --> 05:07:47,040
just grit your teeth and

8554
05:07:47,040 --> 05:07:49,040
and bear it

8555
05:07:49,040 --> 05:07:51,040
you want people

8556
05:07:51,040 --> 05:07:53,040
and I do think it is possible sometimes to find

8557
05:07:53,040 --> 05:07:55,040
the joy in something like it might not

8558
05:07:55,040 --> 05:07:57,040
immediately appeal to you but

8559
05:07:57,040 --> 05:07:59,040
I had told people early on

8560
05:07:59,040 --> 05:08:01,040
in software times

8561
05:08:01,040 --> 05:08:03,040
you know it a lot of game developers

8562
05:08:03,040 --> 05:08:05,040
are in it just because they are so passionate

8563
05:08:05,040 --> 05:08:07,040
about games but I was always

8564
05:08:07,040 --> 05:08:09,040
really more flexible

8565
05:08:09,040 --> 05:08:11,040
in what appealed to me where I said

8566
05:08:11,040 --> 05:08:13,040
I think I could be quite

8567
05:08:13,040 --> 05:08:15,040
engaged doing operating system

8568
05:08:15,040 --> 05:08:17,040
work or even database work

8569
05:08:17,040 --> 05:08:19,040
I would find the interest in that

8570
05:08:19,040 --> 05:08:21,040
because I think most things that are

8571
05:08:21,040 --> 05:08:23,040
significant in the world have

8572
05:08:23,040 --> 05:08:25,040
a lot of layers and complexity to them

8573
05:08:25,040 --> 05:08:27,040
and a lot of opportunities hidden within them

8574
05:08:27,040 --> 05:08:29,040
so

8575
05:08:29,040 --> 05:08:31,040
probably the most important thing to encourage

8576
05:08:31,040 --> 05:08:33,040
to people is that

8577
05:08:33,040 --> 05:08:35,040
you can weaponize curiosity

8578
05:08:35,040 --> 05:08:37,040
you can deploy your curiosity

8579
05:08:37,040 --> 05:08:39,040
to kind of make things

8580
05:08:39,040 --> 05:08:41,040
useful and valuable to you

8581
05:08:41,040 --> 05:08:43,040
even if they don't immediately appear that way

8582
05:08:43,040 --> 05:08:45,040
deploy your curiosity

8583
05:08:45,040 --> 05:08:47,040
yeah that's very true

8584
05:08:47,040 --> 05:08:49,040
we've mentioned this debate point

8585
05:08:49,040 --> 05:08:51,040
whether mortality or fear

8586
05:08:51,040 --> 05:08:53,040
of mortality is fundamental

8587
05:08:53,040 --> 05:08:55,040
to creating an AGI

8588
05:08:55,040 --> 05:08:57,040
but let's talk about whether it's fundamental

8589
05:08:57,040 --> 05:08:59,040
to human beings

8590
05:08:59,040 --> 05:09:01,040
do you think about your own mortality

8591
05:09:01,040 --> 05:09:03,040
I really don't

8592
05:09:03,040 --> 05:09:05,040
and

8593
05:09:05,040 --> 05:09:07,040
you probably always have to take with a grain of salt

8594
05:09:07,040 --> 05:09:09,040
anything somebody says about fundamental things

8595
05:09:09,040 --> 05:09:11,040
like that

8596
05:09:11,040 --> 05:09:13,040
but I don't think about

8597
05:09:13,040 --> 05:09:15,040
really aging

8598
05:09:15,040 --> 05:09:17,040
impending death, legacy

8599
05:09:17,040 --> 05:09:19,040
with my children

8600
05:09:19,040 --> 05:09:21,040
things like that

8601
05:09:21,040 --> 05:09:23,040
and clearly it seems most of the world does

8602
05:09:23,040 --> 05:09:25,040
a lot more than I do

8603
05:09:25,040 --> 05:09:27,040
so I think I'm an outlier

8604
05:09:27,040 --> 05:09:29,040
in that where

8605
05:09:29,040 --> 05:09:31,040
it doesn't

8606
05:09:31,040 --> 05:09:33,040
wind up being a real part of

8607
05:09:33,040 --> 05:09:35,040
my thinking and motivation

8608
05:09:35,040 --> 05:09:37,040
about things

8609
05:09:37,040 --> 05:09:39,040
so daily existence is about

8610
05:09:39,040 --> 05:09:41,040
the people you love

8611
05:09:41,040 --> 05:09:43,040
and the problems

8612
05:09:43,040 --> 05:09:45,040
before you

8613
05:09:45,040 --> 05:09:47,040
I'm very much focused on what I'm working on right now

8614
05:09:47,040 --> 05:09:49,040
I do take that back

8615
05:09:49,040 --> 05:09:51,040
there's one aspect where

8616
05:09:51,040 --> 05:09:53,040
the finiteness of the life does impact me

8617
05:09:53,040 --> 05:09:55,040
and that is about

8618
05:09:55,040 --> 05:09:57,040
thinking about the scope of the problems

8619
05:09:57,040 --> 05:09:59,040
that I'm working on

8620
05:09:59,040 --> 05:10:01,040
when I decided to work on

8621
05:10:01,040 --> 05:10:03,040
when I was like nuclear fission or AGI

8622
05:10:03,040 --> 05:10:05,040
these are big ticket things

8623
05:10:05,040 --> 05:10:07,040
that are impact

8624
05:10:07,040 --> 05:10:09,040
large fractions of the world

8625
05:10:09,040 --> 05:10:11,040
and I was thinking to myself at some level

8626
05:10:11,040 --> 05:10:13,040
that okay I may have

8627
05:10:13,040 --> 05:10:15,040
a couple more swings

8628
05:10:15,040 --> 05:10:17,040
at bat with me

8629
05:10:17,040 --> 05:10:19,040
at full capability but yes

8630
05:10:19,040 --> 05:10:21,040
my mental abilities will decay

8631
05:10:21,040 --> 05:10:23,040
with age

8632
05:10:23,040 --> 05:10:25,040
I don't think it's a 0% chance

8633
05:10:25,040 --> 05:10:27,040
that we will address some of that

8634
05:10:27,040 --> 05:10:29,040
before it becomes a problem for me

8635
05:10:29,040 --> 05:10:31,040
I think exciting medical stuff in the next couple decades

8636
05:10:31,040 --> 05:10:33,040
but I do have this

8637
05:10:33,040 --> 05:10:35,040
kind of vague plan that

8638
05:10:35,040 --> 05:10:37,040
when I'm not at the top of my game

8639
05:10:37,040 --> 05:10:39,040
and I don't feel that I'm in a position

8640
05:10:39,040 --> 05:10:41,040
to put a dent in the world some way

8641
05:10:41,040 --> 05:10:43,040
that I'll probably wind up doing some kind of

8642
05:10:43,040 --> 05:10:45,040
recreational retro programming

8643
05:10:45,040 --> 05:10:47,040
or I'll work on

8644
05:10:47,040 --> 05:10:49,040
something that I would not devote

8645
05:10:49,040 --> 05:10:51,040
my life to now but I can

8646
05:10:51,040 --> 05:10:53,040
while away my time as the old man

8647
05:10:53,040 --> 05:10:55,040
gardening in the code worlds

8648
05:10:55,040 --> 05:10:57,040
and then

8649
05:10:57,040 --> 05:10:59,040
to step back even bigger

8650
05:10:59,040 --> 05:11:01,040
let me ask you about why we're here

8651
05:11:01,040 --> 05:11:03,040
we human beings

8652
05:11:03,040 --> 05:11:05,040
what's the meaning of it all

8653
05:11:05,040 --> 05:11:07,040
what's the meaning of life John Carmack

8654
05:11:07,040 --> 05:11:09,040
so very similar with that last question

8655
05:11:09,040 --> 05:11:11,040
I know a lot of people

8656
05:11:11,040 --> 05:11:13,040
fret about this question a lot

8657
05:11:13,040 --> 05:11:15,040
and I just really don't

8658
05:11:15,040 --> 05:11:17,040
I really don't give a damn

8659
05:11:17,040 --> 05:11:19,040
we are biological creatures that

8660
05:11:19,040 --> 05:11:21,040
happenstance of evolution

8661
05:11:21,040 --> 05:11:23,040
you know we have innate drives

8662
05:11:23,040 --> 05:11:25,040
that evolution crafted for

8663
05:11:25,040 --> 05:11:27,040
survival and passing on of genetic

8664
05:11:27,040 --> 05:11:29,040
codes

8665
05:11:29,040 --> 05:11:31,040
I don't

8666
05:11:31,040 --> 05:11:33,040
find a lot of value in trying to go

8667
05:11:33,040 --> 05:11:35,040
much deeper than that I have my motivation

8668
05:11:35,040 --> 05:11:37,040
some of which are

8669
05:11:37,040 --> 05:11:39,040
some of which are probably genetically coded

8670
05:11:39,040 --> 05:11:41,040
many of which are contingent on my

8671
05:11:41,040 --> 05:11:43,040
upbringing and the path that I've had through my life

8672
05:11:43,040 --> 05:11:45,040
I don't run

8673
05:11:45,040 --> 05:11:47,040
into like spades of depression

8674
05:11:47,040 --> 05:11:49,040
or envy or anything

8675
05:11:49,040 --> 05:11:51,040
that winds up being

8676
05:11:51,040 --> 05:11:53,040
a challenge and forcing a

8677
05:11:53,040 --> 05:11:55,040
degree of soul searching with things like that

8678
05:11:55,040 --> 05:11:57,040
I seem to be okay

8679
05:11:57,040 --> 05:11:59,040
you know kind of without that

8680
05:12:01,040 --> 05:12:03,040
as a brilliant ant in the ant colony

8681
05:12:03,040 --> 05:12:05,040
without looking up to the sky wondering

8682
05:12:05,040 --> 05:12:07,040
why the hell am I here again

8683
05:12:07,040 --> 05:12:09,040
so the why

8684
05:12:09,040 --> 05:12:11,040
of it the incredible

8685
05:12:11,040 --> 05:12:13,040
mystery

8686
05:12:13,040 --> 05:12:15,040
of the fact that we started

8687
05:12:15,040 --> 05:12:17,040
first of all the origin of life on earth

8688
05:12:17,040 --> 05:12:19,040
and from that

8689
05:12:19,040 --> 05:12:21,040
from single cell organisms

8690
05:12:21,040 --> 05:12:23,040
the entirety of the evolutionary process

8691
05:12:23,040 --> 05:12:25,040
took us somehow to this incredibly intelligent

8692
05:12:25,040 --> 05:12:27,040
thing that is able to

8693
05:12:27,040 --> 05:12:29,040
build Wolfenstein 3D

8694
05:12:29,040 --> 05:12:31,040
and doom and quake

8695
05:12:31,040 --> 05:12:33,040
and take a crack at the problem

8696
05:12:33,040 --> 05:12:35,040
of AGI and create things that eventually

8697
05:12:35,040 --> 05:12:37,040
supersede human beings

8698
05:12:37,040 --> 05:12:39,040
that doesn't

8699
05:12:39,040 --> 05:12:41,040
the why of it

8700
05:12:41,040 --> 05:12:43,040
is um

8701
05:12:43,040 --> 05:12:45,040
it's been my experience that

8702
05:12:45,040 --> 05:12:47,040
people that focus on

8703
05:12:47,040 --> 05:12:49,040
that don't focus on the here and now

8704
05:12:49,040 --> 05:12:51,040
right in front of them tend to be less

8705
05:12:51,040 --> 05:12:53,040
effective I mean it's not 100%

8706
05:12:53,040 --> 05:12:55,040
you know vision matters to

8707
05:12:55,040 --> 05:12:57,040
some people but

8708
05:12:57,040 --> 05:12:59,040
it doesn't seem to be a necessary motivator

8709
05:12:59,040 --> 05:13:01,040
for me and I think that

8710
05:13:01,040 --> 05:13:03,040
the process of getting there is usually

8711
05:13:03,040 --> 05:13:05,040
done against like the magic of gradient descent

8712
05:13:05,040 --> 05:13:07,040
people just don't believe that

8713
05:13:07,040 --> 05:13:09,040
just looking locally gets you

8714
05:13:09,040 --> 05:13:11,040
to all of these spectacular things

8715
05:13:11,040 --> 05:13:13,040
that's been you know the decades

8716
05:13:13,040 --> 05:13:15,040
of looking at

8717
05:13:15,040 --> 05:13:17,040
really some of the smartest people

8718
05:13:17,040 --> 05:13:19,040
in the world that would just push back

8719
05:13:19,040 --> 05:13:21,040
forever against this idea that

8720
05:13:21,040 --> 05:13:23,040
it's not this grand sophisticated

8721
05:13:23,040 --> 05:13:25,040
vision of everything but

8722
05:13:25,040 --> 05:13:27,040
little tiny steps local information

8723
05:13:27,040 --> 05:13:29,040
winds up leading to all the best answers

8724
05:13:29,040 --> 05:13:31,040
so the meaning of life

8725
05:13:31,040 --> 05:13:33,040
is uh following

8726
05:13:33,040 --> 05:13:35,040
locally

8727
05:13:35,040 --> 05:13:37,040
wherever the gradient descent takes you

8728
05:13:37,040 --> 05:13:39,040
this was an incredible conversation

8729
05:13:39,040 --> 05:13:41,040
officially the longest conversation

8730
05:13:41,040 --> 05:13:43,040
I've ever done on the podcast

8731
05:13:43,040 --> 05:13:45,040
which means a lot to me because

8732
05:13:45,040 --> 05:13:47,040
I get to do it with one of my heroes

8733
05:13:47,040 --> 05:13:49,040
John I can't tell you how much it means to me

8734
05:13:49,040 --> 05:13:51,040
that you would sit down with me

8735
05:13:51,040 --> 05:13:53,040
you're an incredible human being

8736
05:13:53,040 --> 05:13:55,040
I can't wait what you do next but you've already

8737
05:13:55,040 --> 05:13:57,040
changed the world you're an inspiration

8738
05:13:57,040 --> 05:13:59,040
to so many people and again

8739
05:13:59,040 --> 05:14:01,040
we haven't covered like

8740
05:14:01,040 --> 05:14:03,040
most of what I was playing to talk about

8741
05:14:03,040 --> 05:14:05,040
so I hope we get a chance to talk

8742
05:14:05,040 --> 05:14:07,040
some day in the future and I can't wait

8743
05:14:07,040 --> 05:14:09,040
to see what you do next thank you so much

8744
05:14:09,040 --> 05:14:11,040
again for talking to me thank you very much

8745
05:14:11,040 --> 05:14:13,040
thanks for listening to this

8746
05:14:13,040 --> 05:14:15,040
conversation with John Carmack

8747
05:14:15,040 --> 05:14:17,040
to support this podcast please check out our

8748
05:14:17,040 --> 05:14:19,040
sponsors in the description

8749
05:14:19,040 --> 05:14:21,040
and now let me leave you with some words

8750
05:14:21,040 --> 05:14:23,040
from John Carmack himself

8751
05:14:23,040 --> 05:14:25,040
focused hard work

8752
05:14:25,040 --> 05:14:27,040
is the real key to success

8753
05:14:27,040 --> 05:14:29,040
keep your eyes on the goal

8754
05:14:29,040 --> 05:14:31,040
and just keep taking the next step towards completing it

8755
05:14:31,040 --> 05:14:33,040
if you aren't sure

8756
05:14:33,040 --> 05:14:35,040
which way to do something do it both ways

8757
05:14:35,040 --> 05:14:37,040
and see which works better

8758
05:14:37,040 --> 05:14:39,040
thank you for listening

8759
05:14:39,040 --> 05:14:41,040
and hope to see you next time
