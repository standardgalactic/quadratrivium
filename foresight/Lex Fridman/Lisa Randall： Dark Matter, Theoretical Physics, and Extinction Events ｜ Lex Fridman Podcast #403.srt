00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
The following is a conversation with Lisa Randall, a theoretical physicist and cosmologist at Harvard.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,040
Her work involves improving our understanding of particle physics, supersymmetry,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,360
bariogenesis, cosmological inflation, and dark matter. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,320
here's Lisa Randall. One of the things you work on and write about is dark matter.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,320
We can't see it, but there's a lot of it in the universe. You also end one of your books with

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,920
a Beatles song quote, got to be good looking because he's so hard to see. What is dark matter?

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,800
How should we think about it, given that we can't see it? How should we visualize it in our mind

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
and die? I think one of the really important things that physics teaches you is just our

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,760
limitations, but also our abilities. So the fact that we can deduce the existence of something

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,760
that we don't directly see is really a tribute to people that we can do that. But it's also

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,440
something that tells you you can't overly rely on your direct senses. If you just relied on

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,440
just what you see directly, you would miss so much of what's happening in the world.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,200
And we can generalize this, but we're just for now to focus on dark matter.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,320
It's something we know is there, and it's not just one way we know it's there. In my book,

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,200
Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs, I talk about the many different ways, there's eight or nine,

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,600
that we deduce not just the existence of dark matter, but how much is there? And they all agree.

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Now, how do we know it's there? Because of its gravitational force. And individually,

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,840
a particle doesn't have such a big gravitational force. In fact, gravity is an extremely weak

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,520
force compared to other forces we know about in nature. But there's a lot of dark matter out there.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,760
It carries a lot of energy, five times the amount of energy, as the matter we know that's

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,720
in atoms, etc. So you can ask, how should we think about it? Well, it's just another form of matter

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,080
that doesn't interact with light, or at least as far as we know. So it interacts gravitationally,

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,400
it clumps, it forms galaxies, but it doesn't interact with light, which means we just don't

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,520
see it. And most of our detection, before gravitational wave detectors, we only saw

26
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,440
things because of their interactions with light in some sense. So in theory, it behaves just like

27
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,560
any other matter, it just doesn't interact with light. So when we say it interacts just like

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,120
any other form of matter, we have to be careful. Because gravitationally, it interacts like other

29
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,280
forms of matter, but it doesn't experience electromagnetism, which is why it has a different

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,360
distribution. So in our galaxy, it's roughly spherical, unless it has its own interactions,

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,200
that's another story. But we know that it's roughly spherical. Whereas ordinary matter

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,720
can radiate and clumps into a desk. And that's why we see the Milky Way desk.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,360
So on large scales in some sense, yes, all the matter is similar in some sense. In fact,

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,400
dark matter is in some sense more important, because it can collapse more readily than ordinary

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,720
matter, because ordinary matter has radiative forces, which makes it hard to collapse on small

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,280
scales. So actually, it's dark matter that sort of drives galaxy formation. And then ordinary

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
matter kind of comes along with that. And there's also just more of it. And because there's more

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,240
of it, it can start collapsing sooner. That is to say the energy density in dark matter dominates

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,960
over radiation earlier than you would if you just had ordinary matter.

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
So it's part of the story of the origin of a galaxy, part of the story of the end of the

41
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
galaxy, and part of the story of all the various interactions throughout.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,880
Exactly. I mean, in my book, I make kind of sort of jokes about, you know, it's like

43
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,160
when we think about a building, we think about the architect, we think about, you know, the high

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,400
level, but we forget about all the workers that did all the grunt work. And in fact,

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,600
dark matter was really important in the formation of our universe. And we forget that sometimes.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:15,840
That's a metaphor on top of a metaphor. Okay. The unheard voices that do the actual work.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,400
Exactly. No, but it is a metaphor, but it also captures something because

48
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,920
the fact is we don't directly see it. So we forget it's there, or we don't understand it's there,

49
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,200
or we think it's not. The fact that we don't see it makes it no less legitimate. It just means that

50
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,560
we have challenges in order to find out exactly what it is.

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
Yeah, but the things we cannot see that nevertheless have

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,480
gravitational interaction with the things we can't see is

53
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,560
at the layman level is just mind blowing, you know?

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,880
It is and it isn't because I think what it's teaching us is that we're human. The universe is

55
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,680
what it is. And we're trying to interact with that universe and discover what it is. We've

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,240
discovered amazing things. In fact, I would say it's more surprising that the matter that we know

57
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,640
about constitutes as big a fraction of the universe as it does. I mean, we're limited, we're human.

58
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,800
And the fact that we see 5% of the energy density of the universe,

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,920
you know, about one-sixth of the energy density in matter, that's kind of remarkable. I mean,

60
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,240
why should that be? There could be anything. Anything could be out there, yet the universe

61
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,560
that we see is a significant fraction. Yeah, but a lot of our intuition, I think,

62
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,320
operates using visualizations in the mind. That's absolutely true. And it's certainly

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,640
writing books. I realized also how many of our words are based on how we see the world.

64
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,200
And that's true. And that's actually one of the fantastic things about physics is that it teaches

65
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,040
you how to go beyond your median intuition to develop intuitions that apply at different

66
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,440
distances, different scales, different ways of thinking about things. Yeah, how do you anthropomorphize

67
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,200
dark matter? I just did, I think. I made it the grant workers. Oh yeah, that's good.

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,920
That's why you get paid the big bucks and write the great books. Okay, so you also write in that

69
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,960
book about dark matter having to do something with the extinction events, the extinction of the

70
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,320
dinosaurs, which is kind of a fascinating presentation of how everything is connected.

71
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,120
So I guess the disturbances from the dark matter, they create gravitational disturbances in the

72
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,880
ore cloud at the edge of our solar system. And then that increases the rate of asteroids hitting

73
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,080
Earth. So I want to be really clear, this was a speculative theory. I love it though. I mean,

74
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:55,600
and I liked it too. And we still don't know for sure, but we can, what we liked about it,

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,280
so let me take a step back. So we usually assume that dark matter is what we, being physicists,

76
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,520
that it's just one thing. It's just basically not interacting, aside from gravity,

77
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,080
or very weakly interacting matter. But again, we have to get outside the mindset of just humans

78
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,160
and ask what else could be there. And so what we suggested is that there's a fraction of dark

79
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,720
matter, not all the dark matter, but some of the dark matter, maybe it has interactions of its own.

80
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,560
Just the same way in our universe, we have lots of different types of matter. We have nuclei,

81
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,840
we have electrons, we have forces. We have lots of, it's not a simple model, the standard model,

82
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,800
but it does have some basic ingredients. So maybe dark matter also has some interesting

83
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,560
structure to it. So maybe there's some small fraction. And the interesting thing is that

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,880
if some of the dark matter does radiate, and I like to call it dark light, because it's

85
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,160
light that we don't see, but dark matter would see, it could radiate that, and then it could

86
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,000
perhaps collapse into a disc the same way ordinary matter collapsed into the Milky Way disc.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,760
So it's not all the dark matter, it's a fraction. But it could conceivably be a very thin disc of

88
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,720
dark matter, thin dense disc of dark matter. And so then the question is, do they exist?

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,680
And people have done studies now to think about whether they can find them. I mean,

90
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
it's an interesting target. It's something you can measure by measuring the positions and velocities

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,120
of stars. You can find out what the structure of the Milky Way is. But the fun proposal was that

92
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
the solar system orbits around the galaxy. And as it does so, it goes a little bit up and down,

93
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,040
kind of like horses on a carousel. And the suggestion was every time it goes through,

94
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,480
you have an enhanced probability that you would dislodge something from the edge of the solar

95
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,280
system in something called the Oort cloud. So the idea was that at those times, you're more

96
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,440
likely to have these cataclysmic events, such as the amazing one that actually caused the last

97
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,520
extinction that we know of for sure. It wasn't so amazing for the dinosaurs.

98
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
Or for two thirds of the species on the planet. Yeah, but as it gets amazing for humans,

99
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,200
what really is amazing, I mean, I talk about this in Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs,

100
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,640
it's just an amazing scientific story, because it really is one of the real stories that combine

101
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,960
together different fields of science. Geologists at the time, people thought that things happen

102
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,000
slowly and this would be a cataclysmic event. And also, I have to say, if you think about it,

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
it sounds like a story like a five-year-old would make up. Maybe the dinosaurs were killed by some

104
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,240
big rock that came and hit the earth, but then there really was a scientific story behind it.

105
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
And that's also why I like the dark disk, because there's a scientific story behind it.

106
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
So as far-fetched as it might sound, you could actually go and look for the experimental

107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,840
consequences or the observational consequences to test whether it's true.

108
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I wish you could know high-resolution details of where that asteroid came from,

109
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,120
like where in the Oort cloud, why it happened, is it in fact because of Dark Matter? Just

110
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,880
like the full tracing back to the origin of the universe? Because humans seem to be somewhat special,

111
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,280
but it just seems like so many fascinating events at all scales of physics had to happen.

112
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,320
So I'm really, really glad you mentioned that, because actually, that was one of the main points

113
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,440
of my book, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs. One of the reasons I wrote it was because I really think

114
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
we are abusing the planet. We're changing the planet way too quickly. And just like anything else,

115
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,120
when you alter things, it's good to think about the history of what it took to get here.

116
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,320
And as you point out, it took many operations on many different scales. We had to have the

117
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
formation of structure, the formation of galaxies, the formation of the solar system,

118
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,400
the formation of our planet, the formation of humans. I mean, there's so many steps that go

119
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,160
into this. And humans, in some part, were the result of the fact that this big object hit the

120
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,120
earth, made the dinosaurs go extinct, and mammals developed. I mean, it is an incredible story.

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,800
And yes, something else might come of it, but it won't be us if we mess with it too much.

122
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,560
But it is on a grand scale. Earth is a pretty resilient system.

123
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Can you just clarify? It's fascinating. The shape of things, so the shape of the Milky Way

124
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,680
of the observable stuff is mostly flat. And you said Dark Matter tends to be spherical,

125
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,120
but a subset of that might be a flat disk. So you wanted to hear about the shape of things?

126
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,040
Yes, please. So structure formed early on, and now our structure that we live in is,

127
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,960
so we know about the Milky Way Galaxy. So the Milky Way Galaxy has the disk you can see in a

128
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:55,840
dry, dark place. That's where stars and light is. But you can also measure, in some ways,

129
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,280
that dark matter. And we believe that dark matter is more or less spherically distributed.

130
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,360
And like we said, there's a lot of it, not necessarily in the disk, but just because

131
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,120
it's a sphere, there's a lot of it sitting there. And the reason it doesn't collapse,

132
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,680
as far as we know, is that it doesn't really, it can't radiate the same way. So because it can

133
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,160
radiate ordinary matter collapses, and it's actually because of conservation of angular momentum,

134
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,880
it stays a disk and it doesn't just collapse to the center. So our suggestion was that maybe

135
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,280
there are some components of dark matter that also radiate. Like I said, that's far from proven.

136
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,920
People have looked for a disk. They see some evidence of some disks of certain densities. But

137
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,880
these are all questions that are worth asking. Basically, if we can figure it out from existing

138
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,160
measurements, why not try? Okay, so there's not all dark matters made the same? Well,

139
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,560
that's a possibility. We actually don't know what dark matter is. In the first place,

140
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,320
we don't know what most of it is. We don't know what a fraction is. I mean, it's hard to measure.

141
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Why is it hard to measure? For exactly the reason you said earlier, we don't see it.

142
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,800
So we want to think of possibilities for what it can be, especially if those give rise to some

143
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,400
observational consequences. I mean, it's a tough game because it's not something that's just

144
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,080
there for the taking. You have to think about what it could be and how you might find it.

145
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,840
And the way you detect it is gravitational effects on things we can see.

146
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,440
That would be the way you detect the type of dark matter I've been talking about.

147
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,320
People have suggestions for other forms of dark matter. They could be particles called axions.

148
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,320
They could be other types of particles. And then there are different ways of detecting it. I mean,

149
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,400
the most popular candidate for dark matter, probably until pretty recently because they

150
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,560
haven't found it, is something called WIMPs, weekly interacting mass of particles.

151
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,400
Particles that have mass about the same as the Higgs boson mass.

152
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,200
And it turns out that you would get about the right density of dark matter.

153
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,400
But then people really like that, of course, because it is connected to the standard model,

154
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,760
the particles that we know about. And if it's connected to that,

155
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,960
we have a better chance of actually seeing it. Fortunately or unfortunately,

156
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,760
it's also a better chance that you can rule it out because you can look for it.

157
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,240
And so far, no one has found it. We're still looking for it.

158
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,680
Is that one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider?

159
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,720
That was originally one of the hopes of the Large Hadron Collider.

160
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,200
I'd say at this point, it would be very unlikely given what they've already

161
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,560
accomplished. But there are these underground detectors, xenon detectors that look for

162
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,840
dark matter coming in. And they are going to try to achieve a much stronger bound

163
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,040
than it exists today.

164
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,720
Just take that tangent. Looking back now, what's the biggest to you in sight?

165
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,800
To humanity that the LHC has been able to provide?

166
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,080
It's interesting. It's both a major victory. The Higgs boson was proposed 50 years ago,

167
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,720
and it was discovered. The Higgs mechanism seemed to be the only way to explain elementary

168
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
particle masses, and it was right. So on the one hand, it was a major victory.

169
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,440
On the other hand, I've been in physics long enough to know it was also

170
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,400
a cautionary tale in some sense, because at the time I started out in physics,

171
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,640
we had some proposed something in the United States called the superconducting supercollider.

172
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,160
A lot of physicists, I'll say particularly in Europe, but I'd say a lot of physicists

173
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,560
were saying when that the Large Hadron Collider would have the energy reach necessary

174
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,880
to discover what underlies the standard model. We don't want to just discover the standard model,

175
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,080
we want to know what the next step is. And I think here, people were more cautious about that.

176
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,920
They wanted to have a more comprehensive search that could get to higher energies,

177
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,960
more events, so that we could really more definitively rule it out.

178
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,720
But in that case, many people thought they knew what would be there. It happened to be

179
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,400
a theory called supersymmetry. So a lot of physicists thought it would be supersymmetry.

180
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,400
I mean, it's one of the many factors, I think, that went into the fact that

181
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,920
the Large Hadron Collider became the only machine in town, and the superconducting supercollider

182
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,440
would have just been a much, if it really had achieved what it was supposed to,

183
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,560
would have been a much more robust test of the space. So I'd say for humanity,

184
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,640
it's both a tribute to the ability to discover and the ability of really believing in things,

185
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,240
so they have the confidence to go look for them. But it's also a cautionary tale that

186
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,040
you don't want to assume things before they've been actually found. So you want to do things in,

187
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,680
you want to believe in your theories, but you also want to question them at the same time

188
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,840
in ways that you're more likely to discover the truth.

189
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,280
But it's also an illustration of grand engineering efforts that humanity can take on,

190
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,520
and maybe a lesson that you could go even bigger.

191
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,120
I'm really glad you said that, though, too, because that's absolutely true. I mean,

192
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,320
it really is an impressive, it's impressive in so many ways. It's impressive

193
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
technologically, it's impressive at an engineering level. It's also impressive that so many countries

194
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,760
work together to do this. It wasn't just one country, and how it was, it was also impressive

195
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:11,360
in that it was a long-term project that people committed to and made it happen. So it is a

196
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,640
demonstration that when people set their minds to things and they commit to it, that they can do

197
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,560
something amazing. But also in the United States, maybe a lesson that bureaucracy can slow things

198
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:31,120
down. Bureaucracy and politics, and economics, many things can make them faster and make them

199
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,600
slower. So science is the way to make progress. Politics is the way to slow that progress down.

200
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,280
Well, I don't want to overstate that because without politics, you know, the LEC won't happen

201
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:53,120
either. You need broccoli. But sometimes I do think, I mean, you're not asking this question,

202
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,440
but sometimes I do think when I think about some of these conflicts,

203
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,200
sometimes it's just good to have a project that people work on together. And there were some

204
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
efforts to do that in science, too, to have Palestinians and Israelis work together,

205
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,760
project called Sesame. I think it's not a bad idea when you can do that, when you can get,

206
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,600
you know, sort of forget the politics and just focus on some particular project,

207
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,840
sometimes that can work. Some kind of forcing function, some kind of deadline that gets people

208
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,680
to sit in a room together. And you're working on a thing, but as part of that, you realize

209
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,800
the common humanity, that you all have the same concerns, the same hopes, the same fears,

210
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,840
the same that you are all human. And that's an accidental side effect of working together

211
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,320
on a thing. That's absolutely true. And it's one of the reasons CERN was formed, actually.

212
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,600
It was post World War II. And a lot of European physicists had actually left Europe. And they

213
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,560
wanted to see Europeans work together and sort of rebuild. And it worked. I mean, they did.

214
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,440
And it's true. And I often think that, you know, one of the major problems is we just

215
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,520
don't meet enough people so that everyone thinks when they seem like the other,

216
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,800
it's more easy to forget their humanity. So I think it is important to have these connections.

217
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,160
Given the complexity, all cosmological scales involved here that led to the extension of

218
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,640
the dinosaurs, when you look out at the future of Earth, do you worry about future extinction

219
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,840
events? I do think that we might be in the middle of an extinction right now, if you

220
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,200
define it by the number of species that are getting killed off. And it's subtle, but it's

221
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,160
a complex system. The way things respond to events is sometimes things evolve. Sometimes

222
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,080
animals just move to another place. And the way we've developed the Earth, it's very hard for

223
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,080
species just to move somewhere else. And we're seeing that with people now too. I mean, I know

224
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,720
people are worried just about AI taking over. And that's a totally different story. We just

225
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,280
don't think about the future very much. We think about what we're doing now. And we certainly don't

226
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
think enough about all the animals that we're destroying, all the things that are precursors

227
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:19,360
to humans that we sort of rely on. It's interesting just to think whether the things that threaten us

228
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,440
is the stuff we see that's happening gradually, or the stuff we don't really see that's going to

229
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,000
happen all of a sudden. And sometimes I think about what should we be more worried about?

230
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,600
Because it seems like with the asteroids or nuclear war, it could be stuff that just happens

231
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:46,320
one day. When I say one day, meaning over a span of a few days or a few months, but not on a scale

232
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:53,760
of decades and centuries. Because we sometimes mostly talk about stuff that's happening gradually,

233
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,600
but we can be really surprised. It's actually really interesting. And that was actually one of

234
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,120
the reasons it took a while to determine what it was that it caused the last extinction. Because

235
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,920
people did think at the time, many people thought that things were more gradual. And the idea of

236
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,320
extinction was actually a novel concept at some point. I mean, these aren't predictable events

237
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,280
necessarily. They're only predictable on a grand scale. But sometimes they are. And I think

238
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,800
people were pretty aware that nuclear weapons were dangerous. I'm not sure people are as aware now

239
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:38,880
as they were, say, 20 or 30 years ago. And that certainly worries me. I have to say I was not as

240
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,520
worried about AI as other people, but now I understand. And it's more that as soon as you

241
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,440
create things that we lose control over, it's scary. And the other thing that we're learning from

242
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,160
the events today is that it takes a few bad actors. It takes everyone to make things work well.

243
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,920
It takes not that many things to make things go wrong. It's the issue with disease. We can find

244
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,440
out what causes a disease. But to make things better is not necessarily that simple. Sometimes it is.

245
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,720
But for things to be healthy, a lot of things have to work. For things to go wrong,

246
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,080
only one thing has to go wrong. And so it's amazing that we do it. And the same is true for

247
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,040
democracy, for democracy to work. A lot of people have to believe in it. A few bad actors can

248
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:32,480
destroy things sometimes. So a lot of the things that we really rely on are delicate

249
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,600
equilibrium situations. And there is some robustness in the systems. We try to build in robustness.

250
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,880
But a few extreme events can sometimes alter things. And I think that's what people are

251
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,120
scared of today in many ways. They're scared of it for democracy. They're scared of it for peace.

252
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,600
They're scared of it for AI. I think they're not as scared as they should be about nuclear weapons,

253
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,920
to be honest. I think that's a more serious danger than people realize. I think people are a little

254
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,360
bit more scared about pandemics than they were before. But I still say they're not super scared

255
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,160
about it. So you're right. There are these major events that can happen. And we are setting things

256
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,960
up so that they might happen. And we should be thinking about them. The question is who should

257
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
be thinking about them? How should we be thinking about them? How do you make things happen on a

258
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,200
global scale? Because that's really what we need. It certainly shouldn't be a source of division.

259
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,200
It should be a source of grand collaboration, probably. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah. I just

260
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,800
wonder what it would be like to be a dinosaur. It must have been beautiful to look at that

261
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:44,880
asteroid, just enter the atmosphere. Until everything just... Man, that would be one of the

262
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,600
things I would travel back in time to. That's just to watch it. That's also one of the things

263
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,680
that I think you probably could do with virtual reality. I don't think you have to be there and

264
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,440
get extinct. So you just explain that. I think there's something... It's an event. You're just

265
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,600
watching. You're not doing anything. You're just looking at it. So maybe you could just recreate it.

266
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,160
I actually heard that there's a nuclear weapon explosion experience in virtual reality that's

267
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:16,400
good to remind you about what it would feel like. I have to say, I got an award from the Museum of

268
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,040
Nuclear History and Technology in the Southwest. I went to visit the museum, which turned out to

269
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,560
be mostly a museum of nuclear weapons. The scary thing is that they look really cool. It's true

270
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,760
that you have that, yes, this is scary, but you also have this, this is cool feeling. I think

271
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,120
we have to get around that because I kind of think that, yes, you can be in that, but I'm not

272
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,640
sure that's going to make people scared. Have they actually asked afterwards, are you more or less

273
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,680
scared? That's a good... That's a really good point. I mean, that's a good summary of just humanity in

274
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,360
general. We're attracted to creating cool stuff even though it can be dangerous. Actually,

275
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,960
that was the really interesting thing about visiting that museum actually. It was very nice

276
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,800
because I had a tour from people who had been working there on the Cold War and actually

277
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,600
one or two people from the Manhattan Project. It was a very cool tour. You just realized just how

278
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,160
just the thing itself gets you so excited. I think that's something that sometimes these

279
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,880
movies miss. Just the thing itself, you're not thinking about the overall consequences.

280
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
In some ways, it was like the early Silicon Valley. People were just thinking, what if we did

281
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,320
this? What if we did that? Not keeping track of what the peripheral consequences are.

282
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,040
You definitely see that happening with AI now. I think that was the moral of the

283
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,560
battle that just happened, that it's just full speed ahead.

284
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:50,000
Which gives me a really great transition to another quote in your book. You write about

285
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,840
the experience of facing the sublime in physics and you quote Ryan Arilke.

286
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,520
For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we are still just able to endure,

287
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,680
and we're so odd because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. It's pretty intense.

288
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
I think it applies to nuclear weapons.

289
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,560
At a more mundane perhaps level, I think it applies. It's really interesting. One of the

290
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:28,720
things I found when I wrote these books is some people love certainty. Scientists many

291
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
revel in uncertainty. It's not that you want to be uncertain. You want to solve it.

292
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,280
You're at this edge where it's really frustrating because you don't really want to not know the

293
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,560
answer. Of course, if you knew the answer, that would be done. You're always at this

294
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,240
edge where you're trying to sort things out. There is something scary. You don't know if

295
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,440
there's going to be a solution. You don't know if you're going to find it. It's not something

296
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,760
that can destroy the Earth. It's just something that you do on your individual level. Then,

297
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,760
of course, there are much bigger things like the ones you're talking about where they could

298
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
actually be dangerous. The stuff I do, I just want to be clear. I'm doing theoretical physics,

299
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,520
not very dangerous, but sometimes things end up having bigger consequences than you think.

300
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,920
Yeah, but dangerous in a very pragmatic sense, but isn't it still in part terrifying when you

301
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:27,040
think of just the size of things? The power of this thing in terms of

302
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,160
its potential gravitational effects, just the cosmological objects of a black hole at the

303
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,680
center of our galaxy. This might be why I'm a physicist or why I differ from other people,

304
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,400
because I'm not such a big fan of humanity in some ways. Some ways I am. The idea that we were

305
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,560
everything would be really boring to me. I love the idea that there's so much more out there,

306
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,560
that there's a bigger universe and there's lots to discover and that we're not all there is.

307
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm going to be disappointing if we were all there is.

308
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,440
Yeah, and the full diversity of other stuff is pretty interesting.

309
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,760
We have no idea how much there is. We know what we can observe so far. The idea that there's other

310
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,360
stuff out there that we yet have to figure out, it's exciting. Let me ask you an out-there question.

311
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,840
Uh-oh. Okay. So if you think of humans on earth, life on earth,

312
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,600
as this pocket of complexity that emerged, and there's a bunch of conditions that came to be,

313
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,280
and there's Darwinian evolution, however life originated, do you think it's possible there's

314
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,480
some pockets of complexity of that sort inside dark matter that we can't see?

315
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,440
So that's possible. Chemistry and biology evolving in different ways.

316
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,760
And that's one of the reasons we suggest. I mean, it's not the reason, but it would be true if

317
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,400
there were that type of interactions we'd suggest. I mean, it would need more complex ones.

318
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,760
And we don't know. I will say that the conditions that give rise to life and complexity,

319
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,080
they're complex, they're unlikely. So it's not like there's great odds that would happen.

320
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,720
But there's no reason to know that it doesn't happen. It's worth investigating,

321
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,160
are there other forces that exist in the dark matter sector? That's exactly it.

322
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,000
So the dark matter sector doesn't have all the forces of the standard model of physics?

323
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,680
Right. As far as we know, it doesn't have any. It might have it at some low level,

324
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,640
but it could have its own forces, just like the dark matter might not experience our light.

325
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,080
Maybe it has its light that we don't experience.

326
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,920
So there could be other kinds of forces?

327
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,120
I mean, there could be other kinds of forces even within our sector that are too weak for us

328
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,880
to have discovered so far, or that exist at different scales than we know about.

329
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,720
I mean, we detect what interacts strongly enough with our detectors to detect.

330
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,320
So it's worth asking. And that's one of the reasons we build big colliders to see, are there

331
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,360
other forces, other particles that exist, say, at higher energies at shorter distance scales

332
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,800
than we've explored so far? So it's not just in the dark matter sector, even in our sector.

333
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
There could be a whole bunch of stuff we don't yet know.

334
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,960
So maybe let's zoom out and look at the standard model of particle physics.

335
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,720
How does dark matter fit into it? First of all, what is it? Can you explain what the standard model is?

336
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:34,960
So the standard model of particle physics is basically tells us about nature's most basic

337
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,400
elements and their interactions. And so it's the substructure as far as we understand it.

338
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,840
So if you look at atoms, we know they have nuclei and electrons.

339
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,320
Nuclei have protons and neutrons in them. Protons and neutrons have particles called quarks

340
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,280
that are held together by something called the strong force.

341
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,120
They interact through the strong force, the strong nuclear force,

342
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,840
with something called the weak nuclear force and electromagnetism.

343
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,000
So basically all those particles and their interactions describe many, many things we

344
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,320
understand. That's the standard model. We now know about the Higgs boson,

345
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,640
which is associated with how elementary particles get their mass. So that piece of the puzzle has

346
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,480
also been completed. We also know that there are kind of a weird array of masses of elementary

347
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,440
particles. There's not just the up and down quark, but there are heavier versions of the up and down

348
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,640
quark, charm and strange top and bottom. There's not just the electron, there's a muon and a tau.

349
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
There are particles called neutrinos, which are under intense study now,

350
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
which are partnered with the leptons through the weak interactions. So we really do know

351
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,040
these basic elements. And we know the forces, we know, I mean, when we're doing particle

352
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,080
physics experiments, we can usually even ignore gravity, except in exceptional cases that we

353
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,320
can talk about. So those are the basic elements in their interactions. Dark matter stands outside

354
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,160
that it's not interacting through those forces. So when we look at the world around us, we don't

355
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,400
usually see the effects of dark matter. It's because there's so much of it that we do,

356
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,080
and it doesn't have those forces that we know about. But the standard model has worked spectacularly

357
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,120
while it's been tested to a high degree of precision. People are still testing it. And

358
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,000
one of the things we do as physicists is we actually wanted to break down on some of it.

359
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,360
We're looking for the precision measurement or the energy or whatever it will take,

360
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,800
where the standard model is no longer working. Not that it's not working

361
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,360
approximately, but we're looking for the deviations. And those deviations are critical

362
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,840
because they can tell us what underlies the standard model, which is what we really want to see next.

363
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,640
Where can you find the places where the standard model breaks down?

364
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,320
Like what are the places you can see those tiny little deviations?

365
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,120
So we don't know yet, but we know the kinds of things you wouldn't want to look for.

366
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,480
So one obvious place to look is at higher energy. We're looking at the large hadron collider,

367
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,680
but we'd love to go beyond that. Higher energy means shorter distances, and it means things

368
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,160
that we just couldn't produce before. I mean, E equals mc squared. So if you have a heavy

369
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,800
particle and you don't have enough energy to make it, you'll never see it. So that's one place.

370
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,280
The other place is precision measurements. You know, the standard model has been tested

371
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,480
exquisitely. So if it's been tested at 1%, you want to look at a tenth of a percent.

372
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,800
And there are some processes that we know shouldn't even happen at all in the standard model or happen

373
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,480
at a very suppressed level. And those are other things that we look for. So all of those things

374
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,200
could indicate there's something beyond what we know about, which of course would be very exciting.

375
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,520
When you just step back and look at the standard model, the quarks and all the different particles

376
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:58,080
and neutrinos, isn't it wild how this little system came to being creates, underpins everything we see?

377
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Absolutely. And that's why we'd like to understand it better. We want to know,

378
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,440
is it part of some bigger sector? Why are these particles, why do they have the masses they do?

379
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,440
Why is it exposed and so light compared to the mass it could have had,

380
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,720
which we might have even expected based on the principles of special relativity and quantum

381
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,000
mechanics? So that's a really big question. Why are they what they are? And they originate,

382
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,920
there's like some mechanism that created the whole thing? That's one of the things we're trying to

383
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:33,440
study. Why is it what it is? I mean, even just like the mechanism that creates stuff, like the way a

384
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,560
human being is created from a single cell to embryogenesis, like the whole thing,

385
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,200
like you build up this thing, all of it, this whole thing comes to be from just like a tiny little-

386
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,960
Don't forget, it is interacting with the environment.

387
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,720
Sure. Okay, right, right, right. It's not, it's not, right.

388
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,440
It's important.

389
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,960
Well, that's a really good question is how much of it is the environment? Is it just

390
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,120
the environment acting on a set of constraints and

391
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,040
like how much of it is just the information in the DNA or the information?

392
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,560
How much is it in the initial conditions of the universe versus the some other thing acting on it?

393
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,920
These are big questions. These are big questions in pretty much every field.

394
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,000
You know, we, for the universe, we do consider it, you know, it's everything there is

395
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,240
by definition, but people now think about it as one of many universes in, of course,

396
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,800
it's a misnomer, but could there be other places where there are self-contained gravitational

397
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,920
systems that we don't even interact with? So, but those are really important questions.

398
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,440
And the only way we're going to answer them is, you know, we go back as far as we can.

399
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,840
We try to think theoretically and we try to think about observational consequences.

400
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
That's all we can do.

401
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,320
One interesting way to explore the standard model is to look at your

402
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,400
fun, nuanced disagreement with Carlo Revelli.

403
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,640
When you talked about him writing in his book, electrons don't always exist.

404
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,120
They exist when they interact. They materialize in a place when they collide with something else.

405
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,200
And you wrote that, well, I'll just read the whole thing because it's kind of interesting.

406
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,720
Stocks may not achieve a precise value until they are traded,

407
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,880
but that doesn't mean we can't approximate their worth until they change hands.

408
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,000
Similarly, electrons might not have definite properties, but they do exist.

409
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,680
It's true that the electron doesn't exist as a classical object with definite

410
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,960
position until the position is measured, but something was there which physicists

411
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,520
use a wave function to describe. It's a fascinating nuanced disagreement.

412
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,160
Do electrons always exist or not? Does a tree fall in the forest if nobody's there to see it?

413
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,440
So I like to think of the universe as being out there whether or not.

414
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,440
I mean, it would be really weird if the only time things came into existence was when I

415
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,000
saw them or I measured them. There's a lot of weird stuff.

416
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,600
I mean, I could believe that the Middle East doesn't exist because I'm not there now.

417
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,880
I mean, that would be kind of ridiculous. I think we would all agree on that.

418
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,000
So I think there's only so much that we can attribute to our own powers of seeing.

419
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,960
So and the whole system doesn't come into being because I'm measuring it.

420
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,520
And so what is weird, and this isn't even a disagreement about the standard model.

421
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,240
This is a disagreement about how you interpret quantum mechanics.

422
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,040
I mean, I would say that those wave functions are real.

423
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,960
I mean, one of the things that don't forget that particle physics does that

424
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
quantum field theory says is that electrons can be created and destroyed.

425
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
It's not that every electron has to be in the universe.

426
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,120
I mean, that can be, I mean, that's what happens at colliders.

427
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,880
Particles get created and destroyed.

428
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,760
But that doesn't mean that if I have an electron in an atom, it's not there.

429
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,240
It's really there. And we know about it. It's charge is there.

430
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,760
So physics is a kind of way to see the world.

431
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,800
So at the bottom, what's the bottom turtle?

432
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,160
Do you have a sense that there's a bottom reality

433
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,120
that we're trying to approximate with physics?

434
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,560
I think we always have in our head, maybe, that we'd like to find that.

435
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,680
But I have to, I mean, I might not seem so,

436
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
but I think I'm kind of more humble than a lot of physicists.

437
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,720
I'm not sure that we're ever going to get to that bottom level.

438
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,240
But I do think we're going to keep penetrating different layers and get further.

439
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,360
I just wonder how far away we are, you know?

440
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,880
We all wonder that.

441
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,640
It's not even like, what's even the measure of how far away we are?

442
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,360
I mean, one way you can measure it is just by our everyday lives.

443
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
In terms of our everyday lives, we've measured everything.

444
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,280
In terms of what underlies it, there's a lot more to see.

445
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,720
And so part of it has to do with how far we think we can go.

446
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,960
I mean, it might be that the nature of reality changes so much that

447
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,720
even these terms are different.

448
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,760
Maybe we'll measure, you know, the notion of distance itself might break down at some point.

449
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,120
But also to push back on that we've measured everything,

450
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,920
maybe there's stuff we haven't even considered as measurable.

451
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,720
For example, consciousness or there's,

452
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,720
there might be stuff just like you said, forces unseen undetected.

453
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,840
So it's an interesting thing.

454
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,360
So one, and this is often a confusion that happens.

455
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,920
So there's sort of the fundamental stuff underlying it.

456
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
And then there's sort of the higher levels, what, you know,

457
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,680
what we'll call like an effective theory at some level, you know?

458
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,280
So we're not always working.

459
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,400
I mean, when I throw a ball, I don't tell you where every atom is.

460
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,440
I tell you there's a ball.

461
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,240
And so there might be different layers of reality that are built on terms,

462
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,400
on terms of the matter that we know about in terms of the stuff we know about that.

463
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,800
And when I say we've measured everything, I say that with a grain of salt.

464
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,440
I mean, I measure everything about the standard mom.

465
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,160
So, so there's lots of phenomena that we don't understand that we,

466
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,520
but often there are complex phenomena that will be given in terms

467
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,600
of the fundamental ingredients that we know about.

468
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,600
But that is an interesting question because yes, there's phenomena that are

469
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,160
at the higher level of abstractions that emerge.

470
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,400
But maybe like with consciousness, there is far out people that,

471
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,240
you know, think that consciousness is panpsychist, right?

472
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,520
That there's going to be almost like a fundamental force of physics

473
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,840
that's consciousness that permeates all matter, right?

474
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,080
I mean, usually when you have a crazy, sorry, okay, when you have a far out theory,

475
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,800
the thing you do is you test all the possibilities within the constructs that exist.

476
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,320
So you don't just jump to the most far out possibility.

477
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,440
I mean, you can do that.

478
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,720
But then to see if it's true, you either have to find evidence of it,

479
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
or you have to show that it's not possible without that.

480
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
And we're very far from that.

481
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,800
I think one of the criticisms of your theory on the dinosaurs was that

482
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,120
it requires, if I remember correctly, for dark matter to be weirder than it already is.

483
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,800
And then I think you had a clever response to that.

484
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,320
Can you remind?

485
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,240
I'm not sure I remember why I said them, but I mean,

486
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,320
we have no idea how weird dark matter is.

487
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,440
I mean, it's based on everyone thinking they know what dark matter is.

488
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,040
I mean, so weirder than it already is.

489
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
I mean, it's not already anything.

490
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,680
We don't know what it is.

491
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,200
So there's no normalization here.

492
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,040
So dark matter, do we know that if dark matter varies in density?

493
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
It definitely does in the universe.

494
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,720
Just like, I mean, so for example, there's more dark matter in galaxies

495
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,640
than there is between galaxies.

496
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,920
So it clumps.

497
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,520
I mean, so it's matter.

498
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,200
So it's distributed like matter.

499
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,840
It is matter.

500
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,920
It does clump.

501
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,520
But the full details of how it clumps and the complexity of the clumping.

502
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,920
It's understood pretty well.

503
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,040
People do simulations.

504
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,720
I mean, where people are always looking for things,

505
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,000
including us as particle physics, it's sort of at small scales.

506
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
Are the deviations on small scales?

507
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,040
So that indicating other interactions or other processes

508
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,640
or interactions with variants that is to say normal matter

509
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,080
that we don't understand.

510
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,480
But on large scales, we have a pretty good understanding

511
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,680
of dark matter distribution.

512
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
You were part of a recent debate on, quote,

513
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,120
can science uncover reality?

514
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
Let me ask you this question then.

515
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,600
What do you think is the limits of science?

516
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
I'm smart enough to know I have no idea.

517
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
And also, it's not even clear what science means, right?

518
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,240
Because there's the science that we do, which is particle physics.

519
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,080
We try to find fundamental things and figure out what their effects are.

520
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,760
There's science like biology where, you know, it's at a higher level.

521
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,360
The kind of questions you ask are different.

522
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,640
The kind of measurements are different.

523
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,760
The kind of science that's going to happen in the sort of more numerical age,

524
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,080
I mean, or even AI, or like, what does it mean to answer a question?

525
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,680
Does it mean that we can predict it?

526
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,120
Does it mean that we can reproduce it?

527
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,720
So I think we're coming up against sort of the definition

528
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,040
of what we mean by science as human beings.

529
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,440
So in terms of the science that we can do,

530
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,840
I don't think we'll know it until we get there.

531
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,160
I'm, you know, we're trying to solve hard problems.

532
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,080
And, you know, we've made progress.

533
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,480
I mean, if you think of how much science has advanced in the last century or century and a half,

534
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,280
it's incredible.

535
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,320
I mean, you know, we didn't even know the universe was expanding

536
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,080
at the beginning of the 20th century.

537
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,000
We didn't know about quantum mechanics in the beginning of the century.

538
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,520
We didn't know about special relativity.

539
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,720
That's a lot in a relatively short time on,

540
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,040
depending on how you think of time.

541
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,400
So I think it would be premature to say we know the limitations.

542
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,600
And at various points throughout that history, we thought we solved everything

543
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,520
or declared or at least various people.

544
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,800
Where we was various people.

545
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,200
Exactly.

546
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:21,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Declared that we've solved everything.

548
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,480
So this is also a good place to, maybe could you describe the difference between top down

549
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,000
and bottom up approaches to theoretical physics that you talked about in the book?

550
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,320
So you could try to jump in and say, I have a theory that I think is so perfect

551
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,080
that I can predict everything from it or at least predict some salient features from it.

552
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,120
That's top down.

553
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,560
That would be top down.

554
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,480
Bottom up is more like the questions we just asked.

555
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,600
Why are masses what they are?

556
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,800
We measure things.

557
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,920
We want to put them together.

558
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,720
And usually a good approach is to combine the two.

559
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,040
If you ask a very specific question, but combine it with the methods of

560
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,040
knowing that there could be a fundamental theory and denying it.

561
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,160
Sometimes you make progress.

562
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,480
The community tends to get segmented or fragmented into people who do one or the other.

563
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,000
But there are definitely times, I mean, some of my best collaborations have been

564
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
with people who were more top down than I am.

565
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,760
So that we come up with interesting ideas that we went to thought of if either one

566
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,440
of us was working individually.

567
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,520
Would you say the truly big leaps happened top down like Einstein?

568
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,360
Einstein was not a top down person in the beginning.

569
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,760
He was special relativity.

570
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,960
It was very much him thinking about, you know, they were thought experiments,

571
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,480
but he was very much, you know, the original theory about relativity

572
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,120
is something like on the nature of electromagnetism, he was trying to understand

573
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,560
how Maxwell's laws could make sense when they were, you know, seem to have different

574
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,480
symmetries than what we had thought they were.

575
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,640
So he was very much a bottom up person.

576
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,440
In fact, he resisted top down for a long time.

577
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,120
Then when he tried to do the theory of general relativity or the general theory of relativity,

578
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,080
whichever you want to call it, incorporating gravity into the system where you need some

579
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:13,840
feedback, then he was helped by a mathematician who had developed some differential geometry

580
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,080
and helped him figure out how to write down that.

581
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,320
And after that, he thought top down was the way to go,

582
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,240
but he actually didn't make that much progress.

583
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,520
But certainly, so I think it's, you know, naive to think it was just one or the other.

584
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,400
In fact, a lot of people who made real progress were rooted in actual measurements.

585
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,800
Well, speaking of mathematicians, what do you use a difference?

586
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,960
Because you've had a bit of a foot in both between physics and mathematics

587
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,640
in the way it helps us understand the world.

588
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,000
Well, to be frank, there's a lot more overlap in physics and math, I think, than has been.

589
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,720
I mean, well, maybe not more, but there's certainly a lot.

590
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,440
But I think, again, the kinds of questions you're asking are usually different.

591
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:59,200
Mathematicians like the structure itself, physicists are trying to concentrate on,

592
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,360
to some extent, on the consequences for the world.

593
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,840
But there is a lot of overlap.

594
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,160
The string theory is an example.

595
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,680
There's certain theories where there's a certain kind of mathematical beauty to it.

596
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,640
There's also, you know, there's also some really cool ideas that you get in particle physics

597
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,440
where you can describe what's going on and connect it to other ideas.

598
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,640
That's also really beautiful.

599
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,720
You know, I think, I think basically insights can be beautiful.

600
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,000
You know, they might seem simple, but sometimes and sometimes they genuinely are.

601
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,640
And sometimes they're built on a whole system that you have to understand before.

602
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,680
I mean, if you actually saw Einstein's equations written out in components,

603
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,680
you wouldn't think it's so beautiful.

604
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,200
You write in a compact way.

605
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:41,760
It looks nice.

606
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,040
What do you think about the successes and the failures of string theory?

607
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,320
To what degree do you think it succeeded?

608
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,600
To what degree is it not succeeded yet or has failed?

609
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,600
I think to talk about any science in terms of success and failure often misses the point,

610
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,760
because there's not some absolute thing.

611
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,280
And I think I do think that string theorists were a bit overly ambitious,

612
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,800
not overly ambitious, but a little bit overly arrogant in the beginning,

613
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,840
thinking they could solve many problems that they weren't going to solve.

614
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,000
That's not to say the methods and advances in string theory don't exist.

615
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,760
But they certainly weren't able to immediately solve all the problems I thought they could solve.

616
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,880
But it has given us tools.

617
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,480
It has given us some insights.

618
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,040
But it becomes almost a sociological question of how much it should be one or the other.

619
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,840
I do think that you can get caught up in the problems themselves.

620
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,640
And sometimes you can get caught up in the methods and just do other examples.

621
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,520
So the real physics insights often come from people who are thinking about physics as well as

622
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,360
the math.

623
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,440
Because you mentioned AI, is there hope that AI might be able to help

624
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,680
find some interesting insights?

625
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,800
I mean, another question, another way to ask this question is,

626
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,520
how special are humans that we're able to discover novel insights about the world?

627
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,920
That's a great question.

628
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,560
And it depends on what kind of insights and we're going to find that out.

629
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I mean, you know, it's because it's hard to think about something that doesn't quite exist yet.

630
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,840
I mean, I could just think about something, take a step back.

631
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,640
You know, it's a little bit like trying to understand three, four dimensions,

632
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,160
you go back to three dimensions, you know, so to go to something you can imagine.

633
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,160
So you can sort of say a lot of the things in a very different level about the internet.

634
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,320
You could say, you know, has the internet helped do things?

635
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,600
And that's, you know, it definitely took on a life of its own in some sense.

636
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,480
But it's also something that we're able to tame.

637
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,720
You know, I know that I myself wouldn't have been able to write books if the internet didn't exist

638
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,280
because I wouldn't have had the time to go to the library and look everything up.

639
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,880
And it helped me enormously.

640
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,360
And in some sense, AI could be that in a very nice world.

641
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:08,320
It could be a tool that helps us go a step further than we would and a lot more efficiently.

642
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,400
And it's already done that to some extent.

643
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,040
Or it could be like the parts of the internet that we can control that are

644
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,360
ruining politics or whatever.

645
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,000
So and there's certainly a lot of indications that can do that.

646
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,720
Then there are even bigger things that, you know, people speculate about,

647
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,040
about AI being able to do its own things.

648
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,080
But in terms of actually figuring things out, you know, we're in the early stages.

649
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,800
Yeah, there's several directions here.

650
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,480
One is like on the theorem proof side.

651
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,440
So Wolfram Alpha where everything is much more precise.

652
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,640
And we have large language model type of stuff.

653
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,960
One of the limitations of those is it seems to come up with convincing looking things,

654
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,200
which we don't know if it's true or not.

655
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,000
And that's a big problem for physics.

656
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,560
So large language models are more or less like generalizations of stuff that we have.

657
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:04,320
So the question is, so there's still breakthroughs in AI waiting to happen.

658
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,640
And maybe they are happening and maybe they'll be good.

659
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,200
Maybe not.

660
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,760
But that's not quite the same.

661
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,960
I mean, maybe to some in some cases, it's just pattern recognition that leads to important things.

662
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,080
But sometimes it could be something more insightful than that that I can't even put my finger on.

663
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,120
So it forces us to, I mean, we don't really understand how smart we are.

664
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,240
We don't understand how we think about things all that well, actually.

665
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,560
But one thing is true that we are a lot more efficient right now than computers.

666
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,200
And coming up with things, we require a lot less energy to do that.

667
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,520
So if computers figure out how to do that, then it's going to be a totally different ball game.

668
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,280
And so there are clearly kinds of connections that we don't know how we're making,

669
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,640
but we are making them.

670
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,000
And so that's going to be interesting.

671
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,640
So I say we're in early stages, but this is changing very rapidly.

672
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:02,880
But right now, I don't think that it's actually discovered new laws of physics.

673
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,640
But could it in the future?

674
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,360
Maybe it can.

675
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:13,440
It will raise big questions about what is special about humans that we don't quite appreciate.

676
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,120
There could be things that are like that leap of insight that happens, truly novel ideas.

677
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,800
That could potentially be very difficult to do.

678
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,720
So there are sort of abstract questions like that.

679
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,520
There's also questions of how is it that we can address to some extent,

680
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,200
how will AI be used in the context of the world we live in?

681
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,400
At least our country is based on capitalism and a certain political system.

682
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,680
And how will global politics deal with it?

683
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,320
How will our capitalist system deal with it?

684
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,360
What will be the things that we focus on doing with it?

685
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:57,360
How much will researchers get control of it to be able to ask different sorts of questions?

686
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,840
I mean, while it was starting out, people were doing these kind of toy problems.

687
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,920
But what will it actually be applied to?

688
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,000
And what will it be optimized to do?

689
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
There's a lot of questions out there that it's really important we start addressing.

690
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:20,400
What to you is the most beautiful and solved problem in physics and cosmology?

691
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,880
What to you is really exciting if we can unlock the mystery of in the next few decades.

692
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,520
So is it what's the most beautiful and solved problem?

693
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,120
Or what is the most beautiful and solved problem?

694
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,320
I think we can make progress on.

695
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,400
Oh boy, we make progress on in the next few centuries.

696
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,960
Most of the questions, the big questions have to do with what underlies things,

697
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,360
how things started, what's at the base of it.

698
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,240
There's also just basic questions like that you asked earlier,

699
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,920
how far will science take us?

700
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,280
How much can we understand?

701
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,240
There are questions like how we got here, what underlies it, are there, you know,

702
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,200
but also, I mean, there's really deep questions like, you know, what fraction

703
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,320
are we actually seeing?

704
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,280
If there are these other forces, if there is another way of seeing the world,

705
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,400
are there galaxies, you know, universes beyond their own that if there's so totally different,

706
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,760
how do we even comprehend them?

707
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,800
I mean, how do we detect like, what would we even think about them?

708
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,760
So there's a lot about trying to get beyond.

709
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,360
It's always just getting beyond our limited vision and limited experience

710
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,360
and trying to see what underlies it, both at small scales and at large scales.

711
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,040
We just don't know the answers.

712
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,720
I mean, I'd like to think that we understand more about dark matter,

713
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,560
about dark energy, about are there extra dimensions, things that we actually work on.

714
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,760
Because there's probably a lot beyond what we work on that's yet to be discovered.

715
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,840
Yeah, understanding the extra dimensions piece

716
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,280
will be really interesting.

717
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,320
Totally.

718
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,440
I mean, if it is, you know, how the universe went from higher dimensions to what we see,

719
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
are the extra dimensions present everywhere?

720
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,680
I mean, you know, one of the really interesting pieces of physics we did,

721
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,560
that I talked about in my first book, War Procedures, is finding out that there can be

722
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,200
a higher dimension, but only locally do you think there's a gravity of a lower dimension.

723
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,880
So it could be like, only locally do we think we live in three dimensions,

724
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,880
that could be higher dimensions is different.

725
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,640
That's not actually the gravity we have, but there's all sorts of phenomena that might be

726
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,080
out there that we don't know about.

727
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,040
All sorts of evolution things, time dependence that we don't know about.

728
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,000
And of course, that's from the point of view of particle physics,

729
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,800
from the point of view of other kinds of physics, we're just beginning.

730
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:39,360
So who knows?

731
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,440
Yeah, if the physics changes throughout, is not homogeneous throughout the universe, that's,

732
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,520
that'll be weird.

733
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:53,120
I mean, you know, for the observable universe, it's the same, but beyond the observable universe,

734
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,520
who knows?

735
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,160
What advice would you give?

736
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,320
You've had an exceptional career.

737
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,440
What advice would you give to young people, maybe high school, college,

738
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,200
on how to have a career that can be proud of and a life that can be proud of?

739
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,080
I think the weird thing about being a scientist or an academic in general is,

740
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,120
you have to believe really strongly in what you do while questioning it all the time.

741
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,640
You can't, you know, and that's, that's a hard balance to have.

742
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,800
Sometimes it helps to collaborate with people, but to really believe that you could have good

743
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,960
ideas at the same time, knowing they could all be wrong.

744
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,560
That's, that's, that's a tough tightrope to walk sometimes, but to really test them out.

745
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,080
The other thing is sometimes, you know, if you get too far buried,

746
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:42,480
you look out and you think, oh, there's so much out there, and sometimes it's just good to

747
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,160
bring it back home and just think, okay, can I have as good ideas as the person next to me,

748
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,720
rather than, you know, the greatest physicist who ever lived.

749
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,320
But right now, like you said, I think there's lots of big issues out there and it's hard to

750
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:54,880
balance that.

751
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,320
And sometimes it's hard to forget the role of physics, but I think, you know, Wilson said it

752
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,640
really well when he said, you know, when they were building Fermilab, it was like,

753
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,600
this won't defend the country, but it'll make it worth defending.

754
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,600
You know, there's just the idea that, you know, in all this chaos, it's still important that we

755
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:12,880
still make progress in these things.

756
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
And sometimes, you know, when major world events are happening, it's easy to forget that.

757
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,480
And I think those are important too.

758
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,080
You don't want to forget those, but to try to keep that balance because we don't want to

759
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,760
lose what it is that makes humans special.

760
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,520
So that's the big picture.

761
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,040
Would you also lose yourself in the simple joy of puzzle solving?

762
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,000
Yeah. Yeah.

763
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,840
I mean, that's, we all like solving puzzles.

764
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,400
And actually one of the things that drives me in my research is inconsistencies.

765
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,720
When things don't make sense, it really bugs me.

766
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,360
And it just will go in, you know, different directions to see how could these things fit

767
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,080
together.

768
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,720
So it bugs you, but that motivates you.

769
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,520
Yeah, totally.

770
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,640
Until it doesn't.

771
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,000
Because I think, because I have this underlying belief that it should make sense,

772
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,320
even though the world comes at you in many ways and tells you nothing should make sense.

773
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,920
But if you believe that it makes sense, then you look for underlying logic.

774
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,800
And I think that's just good advice for everything to try to find like,

775
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,920
why is it the way it is?

776
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,760
I think, you know, we talk, I talk about effective theory in my second book,

777
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,360
not going to have his door a lot.

778
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,840
You know, it's sort of rather than ask the big questions.

779
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,920
Sometimes we just ask the questions about the immediate things that we can measure.

780
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,040
And we can, like I said, we can sometimes tell one that will fail,

781
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,640
but we can have these effective theories.

782
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,920
And sometimes I think, you know, when we approach these big questions,

783
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,160
it's good to do an effective theory point.

784
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,840
You know, why do I find this satisfying?

785
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
Why is the world we have the way it is?

786
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,160
We think things are beautiful that we live in.

787
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,440
I mean, you know, I'm not sure if we had different senses

788
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,000
or different ways of looking at things, we wouldn't necessarily find it beautiful.

789
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,120
But I have to say, you know, it is kind of fantastic that no matter how many times I

790
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,280
see a sunset, I will always find it beautiful.

791
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,640
It's like, I don't think I ever see a sunset as a whatever.

792
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,920
You know, it's just always beautiful.

793
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,360
You'll always, you know, and so there's, there are things as humans, you know,

794
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,880
clearly resonate with us, but, you know, we were maybe evolved that way.

795
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,680
That's about us.

796
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,640
But in terms of figuring out the universe,

797
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,800
it's kind of amazing how far we've gotten.

798
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,760
You know, we have discovered many, many wonderful things,

799
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,760
but there's a lot more out there.

800
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,960
And I hope, I hope we have the opportunity to keep going.

801
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,960
And with effective theories, one small step at a time,

802
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,040
just keep unraveling the mystery.

803
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,880
But also having in mind the big questions,

804
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,120
but doing one small step at a time, exactly.

805
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,160
Yeah, looking out to the stars, you said the sunset.

806
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,800
For me, it's the sunset, the sunrise, and just looking at the stars.

807
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:38,880
It's wondering what's all out there and having a lot of hope that humans will figure it out.

808
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,720
Right. I like it.

809
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:49,120
Lisa, thank you for being one of the humans in the world for that are pushing it forward and

810
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,280
figuring out this beautiful puzzle of ours.

811
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,480
And thank you for talking today.

812
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,360
This is amazing.

813
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:53,760
Thank you.

814
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,600
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Lisa Randall.

815
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,800
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

816
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,400
And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

817
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,920
The important thing is to not stop questioning.

818
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,760
Curiosity has its own reason for existence.

819
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,200
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
