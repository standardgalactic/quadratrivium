0	4320	The following is a conversation with Daniel Schmacktenberger, a founding member of the
4320	10000	Consilience Project that is aimed at improving public sense-making and dialogue. He is interested
10000	16160	in understanding how we humans can be the best version of ourselves as individuals and as
16160	23520	collectives at all scales. Quick mention of our sponsors, Groud News, Netsuite, FourSigmatic,
23520	28480	Magic Spoon, and BetterHelp. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.
29360	33040	As a side note, let me say that I got a chance to talk to Daniel on and off the
33040	38560	mic for a couple of days. We took a long walk the day before our conversation. I really enjoyed
38560	44000	meeting him just on a basic human level. We talked about the world around us with words that carried
44000	50880	hope for us individual ants actually contributing something of value to the colony. These conversations
50880	56560	are the reasons I love human beings, our insatiable striving to lessen the suffering in the world.
56560	61600	But more than that, there's a simple magic to two strangers meeting for the first time
61600	66480	and sharing ideas, becoming fast friends and creating something that is far greater than
66480	71120	the sum of our parts. I've gotten to experience some of that same magic here in Austin with
71120	77280	a few new friends and in random bars in my travels across this country, where a conversation leaves
77280	83280	me with a big stupid smile on my face and a new appreciation of this too short, too beautiful life.
84160	89920	This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Daniel Schmacktenberger.
91040	98400	If aliens were observing Earth through the entire history just watching us and we're tasked with
98400	102320	summarizing what happened until now, what do you think they would say? What do you think they
102320	108080	would write up in that summary? Like it has to be pretty short, less than a page. Like in The
108160	112640	Tracker's Guide, there's, I think, like a paragraph or a couple sentences.
113920	118800	How would you summarize, sorry, how would the alien summarize, do you think, all of human
118800	125360	civilization? My first thoughts take more than a page. They'd probably distill it.
126560	132480	Because if they watched, well, I mean, first I have no idea if their senses are even attuned to
132480	137280	similar stuff to what our senses are attuned to or what the nature of their consciousness is like
137280	142320	relative to ours. And so let's assume that they're kind of like us, just technologically more advanced
142320	146000	to get here from wherever they are. That's the first kind of constraint on the thought experiment.
147120	152800	And then if they've watched throughout all of history, they saw the burning of Alexandria. They
152800	158800	saw that 2000 years ago in Greece, we were producing things like clocks, the anti-Catharea
158800	164320	mechanism, and then that technology got lost. They saw that there wasn't just a steady dialectic of
164320	169040	progress. So every once in a while, there's a giant fire that destroys a lot of things.
169600	176320	There's a giant like commotion that destroys a lot of things. Yeah, and it's usually self-induced.
178320	185520	They would have seen that. And so as they're looking at us now as we move past the nuclear
186080	191120	weapons age into the full globalization, Anthropocene, exponential tech age,
192080	199120	still making our decisions relatively similarly to how we did in the Stone Age as far as rivalry
199120	203920	game theory type stuff, I think they would think that this is probably most likely one of the
203920	207360	planets that is not going to make it to being intergalactic because we blow ourselves up in
207360	214800	the technological adolescence. And if we are going to, we're going to need some major progress
214800	222080	rapidly in the social technologies that can guide and bind and direct the physical technologies
222640	225280	so that we are safe vessels for the amount of power we're getting.
227840	234000	Actually, Hitchhiker's Guide has an estimation about how much of a risk this particular thing
235600	241280	poses to the rest of the galaxy. And I think, I forget what it was, I think it was medium or low.
242240	250080	So their estimation would be that this species of ant-like creatures is not going to survive long.
250080	255120	There's ups and downs in terms of technological innovation. The fundamental nature of their
255120	260480	behavior from a game theory perspective hasn't really changed. They have not learned in any
260480	268480	fundamental way how to control and properly incentivize or properly do the mechanism design
269200	275920	of games to ensure long-term survival. And then they move on to another planet. Do you
277200	282320	think there is in a more slightly more serious question, do you think there's
283200	289120	some number or perhaps a very, very large number of intelligent alien civilizations out there?
291120	297280	Yes, it would be hard to think otherwise. I know, I think Postrum had a new article not
297280	302000	that long ago on why that might not be the case, that the Drake equation might not be the
302000	308320	kind of in-story on it. But when I look at the total number of Kepler planets just that we're
308320	314960	aware of just galactically and also like when those life forms were discovered in Mono Lake,
314960	319600	that didn't have the same six primary atoms that I think you had arsenic replacing phosphorus as one
319600	324720	of the primary aspects of its energy metabolism, we get to think about that the building blocks
324720	329040	might be more different. So the physical constraints even that the planets have to have might be more
329040	337040	different. It seems really unlikely not to mention interesting things that we've observed that are
337040	344160	still unexplained as you've had guests on your show discussing tic-tac. Oh, the ones that have visited.
344160	351360	Yeah. Well, let's dive right into that. What do you make sense of the rich human psychology
352160	359440	of there being hundreds of thousands, probably millions of witnesses of UFOs of different kinds
359440	366240	on earth, most of which I presume are conjured up by the human mind through the perception system?
367200	372880	Some number might be true. Some number might be reflective of actual physical objects, whether
372880	380080	it's, you know, drones or testing military technology that's secret or otherworldly technology.
380800	385200	What do you make sense of all of that? Because it's gaining quite a bit of popularity recently.
386400	397040	There is some sense in which that's, that's us humans being hopeful and dreaming of otherworldly
397040	405520	creatures as a way to escape the juroriness of our of the human condition. But in another sense,
405520	412800	it could be, it really could be something truly exciting that science should turn its eye towards.
413440	418640	So what do you, where do you place it? Speaking of turning eye towards, this is one of those
418640	424880	super fascinating, actually super consequential, possibly topics that I wish I had more time to
424880	428400	study and just haven't allocated. So I don't have firm beliefs on this because I haven't
428400	431760	got to study it as much as I want. So what I'm going to say comes from a superficial assessment.
431760	440400	While we know there are plenty of things that people thought of as UFO sightings that we can
440400	445440	fully write off, we have other better explanations for them. What we're interested in is the ones
445440	448800	that we don't have better explanations for, and then not just immediately jumping to
450400	455280	a theory of what it is, but holding it as unidentified and being being curious and earnest.
456240	463040	I think the, the tic-tac one is quite interesting and made it in major media recently, but I don't
463040	470320	know if you ever saw the disclosure project. Guy named Stephen Greer organized a bunch of mostly
470320	478400	U.S. military and some commercial flight. People who had direct observation and classified information
479360	486240	disclosing it at a CNN briefing. And so you saw high-ranking generals, admirals, fighter pilots,
486240	493840	all describing things that they saw on radar with visual, with their own eyes or cameras,
494640	500880	and also describing some phenomena that had some consistency across different people. And
500880	505120	I find this interesting enough that I think it would be silly to just dismiss it.
505840	511840	And specifically, like we can, we can ask the question, how much of it is natural phenomena,
511840	518080	ball lightning or something like that? And this is why I'm more interested in what fighter pilots
518080	526480	and astronauts and people who are trained in being able to identify flying objects and
527040	533920	atmospheric phenomena have to say about it. I think the thing, then you could say, well,
533920	541280	are they more advanced military craft? Is it some kind of human craft? The interesting thing that
541280	547040	a number of them describe is something that's kind of like right angles at speed, or not right
547040	551600	angles, acute angles at speed, but something that looks like a different relationship to inertia
551600	557600	than physics makes sense for us. I don't think that there are any human technologies that are
557600	563760	doing that, even in really deep underground black projects. Now, one could say, okay, well,
563760	568960	could it be a hologram? Well, would it show up on radar if radar is also seeing it? And so,
570080	576080	I don't know. I think there's enough, I mean, and for that to be a massive coordinated psi op,
576080	584960	is it as interesting and ridiculous in a way as the idea that it's UFOs from some extra planetary
584960	592400	source? So, it's up there on the interesting topics. To me, if it is at all alien technology,
593360	600960	it is the dumbest version of alien technology. It's so far away, it's like the old, old crappy VHS
600960	606880	tapes of alien technology. These are like crappy drones that just floated, or even like space,
606880	614640	to the level of like space junk, because it is so close to our human technology. We talk about
614720	620560	it moves in ways that's unlike what we understand about physics, but it still has very similar
621600	627840	kind of geometric notions and something that we humans can perceive with our eyes, all those
627840	634240	kinds of things. I feel like alien technology, most likely, would be something that we would not
634240	639680	be able to perceive, not because they're hiding, but because it's so far advanced that it would be
640640	648000	much, it would be beyond the cognitive capabilities of us humans. Just as you were saying, as per your
648000	655600	answer for aliens summarizing Earth, it's the starting assumption is they have similar perception
655600	661040	systems, they have similar cognitive capabilities, and that very well may not be the case.
662080	668480	Let me ask you about staying in aliens for just a little longer, because I think it's a good
668480	678720	transition talking about governments and human societies. Do you think if a US government or
678720	686480	any government was in possession of an alien spacecraft, or of information related to alien
686480	698880	spacecraft, they would have the capacity, structurally would they have the processes, would
698880	707200	they be able to communicate that to the public effectively, or would they keep it secret in a
707200	714000	room and do nothing with it, both of to try to preserve military secrets, but also because of
714000	718800	the incompetence that's inherent to bureaucracies, or either?
721920	728320	Well, we can certainly see when certain things become declassified 25 or 50 years later that
728320	733200	there were things that the public might have wanted to know that were kept secret for a very
733200	740560	long time, for reasons of at least supposedly national security, which is also a nice source
740560	748080	of plausible deniability for people covering their ass for doing things that would be problematic and
749520	762160	other purposes. There are, there's a scientist at Stanford who supposedly got some material that
762160	768800	was recovered from Area 51 type area did analysis on it using, I believe, electron microscopy and
768800	776880	a couple other methods and came to the idea that it was a nanotech alloy that was something we
776880	782560	didn't currently have the ability to do was not naturally occurring. So there, I've heard some
782560	786080	things and again, like I said, I'm not going to stand behind any of these because I haven't
786080	795120	done the level of study to have high confidence. I think what you said also about would it be
795120	801520	super low tech alien craft? Like would they necessarily move their atoms around in space?
802080	805360	Or might they do something more interesting than that? Might they be able to
806720	811200	have a different relationship to the concept of space or information or consciousness or
812720	818080	one of the things that the craft supposedly do is not only accelerate and turn in a way that looks
818080	823120	not inertial but also disappear. So there's a question as to like the two are not necessarily
823120	829280	mutually exclusive and it could be possible to, some people run a hypothesis that they
829280	833760	create intentional amounts of exposure as an invitation of a particular kind.
836000	842880	Who knows? Interesting field. We tend to assume like SETI that's listening out for aliens out there.
844560	848560	I've just been recently reading more and more about gravitational waves and you have
849280	856720	orbiting black holes that orbit each other. They generate ripples in space time
858720	863840	on my for fun at night when I lay in bed. I think about what it would be like to ride those waves
863840	870240	when they, not the low magnitude they are as when they reach earth but get closer to the black holes
870240	876880	because they'll basically be shrinking and expanding us in all dimensions, including time.
877760	881840	So it's actually ripples through space time that they generate.
882880	887600	Why is it that you couldn't use that? It travels at the speed of light.
890640	894000	It travels at a speed which is a very weird thing to say when you're
895840	900880	morphing space time. You could argue it's faster than the speed of light.
901840	904000	So if you're able to communicate by
905840	911760	to summon enough energy to generate black holes and to force them to orbit each other,
912400	920240	why not travel as the ripples in space time? Whatever the hell that means somehow combined
920240	926560	with wormholes. So if you're able to communicate through like we don't think of gravitational
926560	932560	waves as something you can communicate with because the the radio will be have to be a very
932560	938960	large size of very dense but perhaps that's it. You know perhaps that's one way to communicate.
938960	946800	It's a very effective way and that would explain like we wouldn't even be able to make sense of that
946800	952640	of the physics that results in an alien species that's able to control gravity at that scale.
953200	958400	I think he just jumped up the Kardashev scale so far. You're not just harnessing the power of
958400	967040	a star but harnessing the power of mutually rotating black holes. That's way above my
967040	974320	physics pay grade to think about including even non-rotating black hole versions of
974320	982320	transwarp travel. I think you know you can talk with Eric more about that. I think he has better
982320	989200	ideas on it than I do. My hope for the future of humanity mostly does not rest in the near term
989200	995200	on our ability to get to other habitable planets in time. And even more than that in the list of
995200	1001040	possible solutions of how to improve human civilization orbiting black holes is not in
1001040	1006960	on the first page for you. Not on the first page. Okay I bet you did not expect us to start this
1006960	1015680	conversation here but I'm glad the places it went. I am excited under my smaller scale of
1016800	1026160	Mars, Europa, Titan, Venus potentially having very like bacteria like life forms just on a
1027120	1033840	on a small human level. It's a little bit scary but mostly really exciting that there might be
1033840	1042320	life elsewhere in the volcanoes and the oceans all around us. Teaming, having little societies
1042880	1048240	and whether there's properties about that kind of life that's somehow different than ours.
1048240	1053680	I don't know what would be more exciting if those colonies of single cell type organisms
1053920	1061360	what would be more exciting if they're different or they're the same. If they're the same that means
1063040	1068720	through the rest of the universe there's life forms like us something like us
1069920	1074320	everywhere. If they're different that's also really exciting because there's
1075520	1082320	life forms everywhere they're not like us. That's a little bit scary. I don't know what's
1082400	1089200	scarier actually. It's both scary and exciting no matter what right. The idea that they could
1089200	1093200	be very different is philosophically very interesting for us to open our aperture on
1093200	1100080	what life and consciousness and self-replicating possibilities could look like. The question
1100080	1104000	on are they different or the same? Obviously there's lots of life here that is the same in
1104000	1109200	some ways and different in other ways. When you take the thing that we call an invasive species
1109200	1114560	is something that's still pretty the same hydrocarbon based thing but co-evolved with
1114560	1117600	co-selective pressures in a certain environment we move it to another environment it might be
1117600	1122480	devastating to that whole ecosystem because it's just different enough that it messes up the self
1122480	1131280	stabilizing dynamics of that ecosystem. The question of would they be different in ways
1131280	1136880	where we could still figure out a way to inhabit a biosphere together or fundamentally not.
1136880	1142400	Fundamentally the nature of how they operate and the nature of how we operate would be
1142400	1150240	incommensurable is a deep question. Well we offline talked about memetic theory. It seems
1150240	1156000	like if there were sufficiently different where we would not even we can coexist on different
1156000	1163280	planes it seems like a good thing. If we're close enough together to where we'd be competing then
1163600	1167520	you're getting into the world of viruses and pathogens and all those kinds of things
1167520	1174480	to where we would one of us would die off quickly through basically mass murder
1175200	1182640	without even even accidentally. Even accidentally. If we just had a self replicating single celled
1182640	1190800	kind of creature that happened to not work well for the hydrocarbon life that was here
1190800	1195440	they got introduced because either output something that was toxic or utilized up the
1195440	1201120	same resource too quickly and it just replicated faster and mutated faster. It wouldn't be a
1202560	1208560	memetic theory conflict theory kind of harm it would just be a von Neumann machine a self
1208560	1213680	replicating machine that was fundamentally incompatible with these kinds of self replicating
1213680	1219680	systems with faster ootaloops. For one final time putting your alien lies God had on.
1220800	1229200	You look at human civilization do you think about the 7.8 billion people on earth as individual
1229200	1239200	little creatures individual little organisms or do you think of us as one organism with a collective
1239200	1246400	intelligence? What's the proper framework through which to analyze it again as an alien?
1246400	1249680	So that I know where you're coming from when you have asked the question the same way
1250240	1253680	before the industrial revolution before the agricultural revolution when there were half
1253680	1261040	a billion people and no telecommunications connecting them? I would indeed ask the question
1261040	1269360	the same way but I would be less confident about about your conclusions. It would be an
1269360	1273840	actually more interesting way to ask the question at that time but I was nevertheless asked at the
1273840	1279680	same way yes. Well let's go back further and smaller than rather than just a single human
1279680	1288400	or the entire human species let's look at a relatively isolated tribe. In the relatively
1288400	1295440	isolated probably sub Dunbar number sub kind of 150 people tribe do I look at that as one
1296640	1301600	entity where evolution is selecting for based on group selection or do I think of it as 150
1301600	1308880	individuals that are interacting in some way? Well could those individuals exist without the group?
1309920	1320400	No. The evolutionary adaptiveness of humans was involved critically group selection and
1320400	1326400	individual humans alone trying to figure out stone tools and protection and whatever aren't
1326400	1337120	what was selected for and so I think the or is the wrong frame. I think it's individuals are
1337120	1343120	affecting the group that they're a part of they're also dependent upon and being affected by the group
1343120	1349200	that they're part of and so this now starts to get in deep into political theories also which is
1350080	1354400	theories that orient towards the collective at different scales whether a tribal scale or an
1354400	1358720	empire or a nation state or something and ones that orient towards the individual liberalism and
1358720	1364640	stuff like that and I think there's very obvious failure modes on both sides and so the relationship
1364640	1368400	between them is more interesting to me than either of them the relationship between the individual
1368400	1373200	and the collective and the question around how to have a virtuous process between those so a good
1373200	1378560	social system would be one where the organism of the individual and the organism of the group of
1378560	1383200	individuals is they're both synergistic to each other so what is best for the individuals and
1383200	1390160	what's best for the whole is aligned but there is nevertheless an individual they're not it's a
1390160	1401600	it's a matter of degrees I suppose but what is what defines a human more the the social network
1401600	1407600	within a which they've been brought up through which they've developed their intelligence or is
1407680	1416080	it their own sovereign individual self like what's your intuition of how much not just for
1416080	1423680	evolutionary survival but as intellectual beings how much do we need others for our development
1424400	1431280	yeah I think we have a weird sense of this today relative to most previous periods of
1431360	1438320	sapien history I think the vast majority of sapien history is tribal like depending upon your
1438960	1446160	early human model two or three hundred thousand years of homo sapiens in little tribes where
1446160	1452080	they depended upon that tribe for survival and excommunication from the tribe was was fatal
1452640	1457280	I think they and our whole evolutionary genetic history is in that environment and the amount
1457280	1463840	of time we've been out of it is is relatively so tiny and then we still depended upon extended
1463840	1470720	families and local communities more and the big kind of giant market complex where I can provide
1470720	1474480	something to the market to get money to be able to get other things from the market where it
1474480	1478480	seems like I don't need anyone it's almost like disintermediating our sense of need even though
1479360	1484880	even though you're my ability to talk to each other using these mics and the phones that we
1484880	1489360	coordinated on took millions of people over six continents to be able to run the supply chains
1489360	1492480	that made all the stuff that we depend on but we don't notice that we depend upon them they all
1492480	1500080	seem fungible um if you take a baby obviously that you didn't even get to a baby without a mom
1500080	1504640	was it dependent or we depended upon each other right without two two parents at minimum and
1504640	1510160	they depended upon other people but if we take that baby and we put it out in the wild it obviously
1510160	1514720	dies so if we let it grow up for a little while the minimum amount of time where it starts to
1514720	1518160	have some autonomy and then we put it out in the wild and there this has happened a few times
1519040	1526560	it doesn't learn language and it doesn't learn the artic the small motor articulation
1526560	1532160	that we learn it doesn't learn the type of consciousness that we end up having that is
1532160	1539040	socialized so i think i think we take for granted how much conditioning affects us
1539920	1550560	um it is possible that uh it affects basically 99.9 or maybe the whole thing the whole thing is
1550560	1557360	the connection between us humans and that we're we're uh no better than apes without our human
1557360	1564320	connections because that that thinking of it that way forces us to think very differently
1564320	1570800	about human society and how to progress forward if the connections are fundamental i just have
1570800	1575040	to object to the no better than apes because better here i think you mean a specific thing which
1575040	1579120	means have capacities that are fundamentally different than i think apes also depend upon
1579200	1587280	troops um yes and i i think the idea of humans as better than nature in some kind of
1588000	1592880	ethical sense ends up having heaps of problems we'll table that we can come back to it but
1592880	1597120	when we say what is unique about homo sapien capacity relative to the other animals we currently
1597680	1602480	inhabit the biosphere with and i'm saying it that way because there were other early hominids that
1602480	1610160	had some of these capacities uh we believe our tool creation and our language creation and our
1610160	1614720	coordination are all kind of the results of a certain type of capacity for abstraction
1615840	1620320	and other animals will use tools but they don't evolve the tools they use they keep using the
1620320	1626640	same types of tools that they basically can find so a chimp will notice that a rock can cut a vine
1626640	1631120	that it wants to and it'll even notice that a sharper rock will cut it better and experientially
1631120	1634640	it'll use the sharper rock and if you even give it a knife it'll probably use the knife because
1634640	1640400	it's experiencing the effectiveness but it doesn't make stone tools because that requires
1640400	1645760	understanding why one is sharper than the other what is the abstract principle called sharpness
1645760	1651360	to then be able to invent a sharper thing that same abstraction makes language and the ability
1651360	1658800	for abstract representation which makes the ability to coordinate in a more advanced set of ways
1658800	1663360	so i do think our ability to coordinate with each other is pretty fundamental to the selection
1663360	1670080	of what we are as a species i wonder if that coordination that connection is actually the
1670080	1674960	thing that gives birth to consciousness that gives birth to well let's start with self-awareness
1675840	1681840	more like theory of mind theory of mind yeah you know i i suppose there's experiments that show
1681840	1686720	that there's other mammals that have a very crude theory of mind i'm not sure maybe dogs
1687440	1691520	something like that but actually dogs probably has to do with that they co-evolved with humans
1692320	1699600	see it'd be interesting if that theory of mind is what leads to consciousness in the way we think
1699600	1705600	about it is the richness of the subjective experience that is consciousness i have an
1705600	1712000	inkling sense that that only exists because we're social creatures that that doesn't come
1712960	1719440	with this with the hardware and the software in the in the beginning that's like that's learned
1719440	1727040	as an effective tool for communication almost like we we think we i think we think that consciousness
1727040	1738000	is fundamental and maybe it's not there's a bunch of folks kind of criticize the idea that the
1738080	1743360	illusion of consciousness is consciousness that it is just a facade we use to
1745280	1751280	to help us construct theories of mind you almost put yourself in the world as a subjective being
1751920	1758560	in that experience you want to reach the experience as an individual person so that i could empathize
1758560	1765040	with your experience i find that notion compelling mostly because it allows you to then create robots
1765680	1773360	that become conscious not by being quote-unquote conscious but by just learning to fake it till
1773360	1781520	they make it is uh creative you know present the facade of consciousness and with it with the task
1781520	1788000	of uh making that facade very convincing to us humans and thereby it will become conscious
1788000	1795600	have a sense that in some way that will make them conscious if they're sufficiently convincing to
1795600	1808320	humans is there some element of that that you uh that you find convincing this is a much harder
1808320	1815360	set of questions and deep end of the pool than starting with the aliens was um we went from
1815360	1823280	aliens to consciousness this is not the trajectory i was expecting nor you but let us walk a while
1824000	1829920	we can walk a while and i don't think we will do it justice so what do we mean by consciousness
1830800	1838000	versus conscious self-reflective awareness what do we mean by awareness qualia theory of mind
1838000	1844800	there's a lot of terms that we think of as slightly different things and um subjectivity
1844800	1852640	first person uh i i don't remember exactly the quote but i remember when reading when sam
1852640	1857440	harris wrote the book free will and then denet critiqued it and then there was some writing
1857440	1864080	back and forth between the two because normally they're on the same side of kind of arguing
1864720	1870000	for critical thinking and logical fallacies and philosophy of science against um supernatural
1870000	1877440	ideas and here denet believed there is something like free will he is a determinist compatible
1877440	1883040	list but no consciousness and radical limitivist and sam was saying no there is consciousness
1883040	1888160	but there's no free will and that's like the most fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses they
1888160	1890880	disagreed on but neither of them could say it was because the other one didn't understand the
1890880	1895600	philosophy of science um or logical fallacies and and they kind of spoke past each other and at the
1895600	1899840	end if i remember correctly sam said something that i thought was quite insightful which was to
1899840	1904960	the effect of it seems to because they weren't making any progress and shared understanding
1904960	1911440	it seems that we simply have different intuitions about this and what you could see was that
1912400	1917040	what the words meant right at the level of symbol grounding might be quite different
1919120	1923440	one of them might have had deeply different enough life experiences that what is being
1923440	1928240	referenced and then also different associations of what the words mean this is why when trying to
1928320	1933360	address these things charles sanders per said the first philosophy has to be semiotics because
1933360	1938160	if you don't get semiotics right we end up importing different ideas and bad ideas right into the
1938160	1942320	nature of the language that we're using and then it's very hard to do epistemology or ontology
1942320	1948000	together uh so i'm saying this to say why i don't think we're going to get very far is i think
1948000	1953280	we would have to go very slowly in terms of defining what we mean by words and fundamental
1953280	1959760	concepts um well and also allowing our minds to drift together for a time so there are
1960320	1967280	definitions of these terms aligned i think there's some there's a beauty that some people
1967280	1978000	enjoy with sam that he is quite stubborn on his definitions of terms without often clearly revealing
1978080	1983920	that definition so in his mind he can like he could sense that he can deeply understand what he
1983920	1989680	means exactly by a term like free will and consciousness and you're right he's very he's
1989680	1996960	very specific in fascinating ways that not only does he think that free will is an illusion
1998400	2005280	he thinks he's able not thinks he says he's able to just remove himself from the experience of free
2005280	2014560	will and just be like for minutes at a time hours at a time like really experiences if he has no
2014560	2024720	free will like he's a leaf flowing down the river and given that he's very sure that consciousness
2024720	2030800	is fundamental so here's a this conscious leaf that's subjectively experiencing the floating
2031360	2037200	and yet there's no ability to control and make any decisions for it for itself it's only a
2039040	2045120	the decisions have all been made there's some aspect to which the terminology there perhaps
2045120	2050800	is the problem so that's a particular kind of meditative experience and the people in the
2050800	2054720	vedantic tradition and some of the buddhist traditions thousands of years ago described
2054800	2058000	similar experiences and somewhat similar conclusions some slightly different
2059200	2067760	there are other types of phenomenal experience that are the phenomenal experience of pure agency
2068560	2074160	and you know like the the catholic theologian but evolutionary theorist ter dishardan describes
2074160	2080240	this and that rather than a creator agent god in the beginning there's a creative impulse or a
2080240	2085280	creative process and he was would go into a type of meditation that identified as the pure essence
2085280	2093680	of that kind of creative process and I think the types of experiences we've had and then
2094480	2098400	one the types of experiences we've had make a big deal to the nature of how we do symbol grounding
2098400	2103520	the other thing is the types of experiences we have can't not be interpreted through our existing
2103520	2108000	interpretive frames and most of the time our interpretive frames are unknown even to us
2108000	2116720	some of them and so this is a tricky this is a tricky topic so I guess there's a bunch of
2116720	2121600	directions we could go with it but I want to come back to what the impulse was that was
2121600	2126960	interesting around what is consciousness and how does it relate to us as social beings and how
2126960	2133200	does it relate to the possibility of consciousness with it ai's right you're keeping us on track
2133200	2138560	which is which is wonderful you're a wonderful hiking partner okay yes let's go back to the
2138560	2144400	initial impulse of what is consciousness and how does the social impulse connect to consciousness
2145760	2152400	is consciousness a consequence of that social connection I'm gonna state a position and not
2152400	2157360	argue it because it's honestly like it's a long hard thing to argue and we can totally do it another
2157360	2168080	time if you want I don't subscribe to consciousness as an emergent property of biology or neural
2168080	2177040	networks obviously a lot of people do obviously the the philosophy of science orient towards that
2177840	2189440	in not absolutely but largely I think of the nature of first person the universe of first person
2189440	2199520	of of qualia as experience sensation desire emotion phenomenology the but the the felt
2199520	2203920	sense not the we say emotion and we think of a neurochemical pattern or an endocrine pattern
2203920	2210800	but all of the physical stuff the third person stuff has position and momentum and charge and
2210800	2217280	stuff like that that is measurable repeatable I think of the nature of first person and third
2217280	2223920	person as ontologically orthogonal to each other not reducible to each other there are different
2223920	2230160	kinds of stuff and so I think about the evolution of third person that we're quite used to thinking
2230160	2235440	about from subatomic particles to atoms to molecules to on and on I think about a similar
2235440	2240720	kind of and corresponding evolution in the domain of first person from the way whitehead talked about
2240720	2246160	kind of prehension or proto qualia in earlier phases of self-organization and to higher orders
2246160	2252720	of it and that there's correspondence but that neither like the like the idealists do we reduce
2252720	2257840	third person to first person which is what idealists do or neither like the physical lists or do we
2257840	2265040	reduce first person to third person obviously bone talked about an implicate order that was
2265040	2269920	deeper than and gave rise to the explicate order of both nagle talks about something like that I
2269920	2274560	have a slightly different sense of that but again I'll just kind of not argue how that occurs for
2274560	2279920	a moment and say so rather than say does consciousness emerge from I'll talk about do
2280880	2288720	higher capacities of consciousness emerge in relationship with so it's not first person as
2288720	2293600	a category emerging from third person but increased complexity within the nature of first person
2293600	2300480	and third person co-evolving do I think that it seems relatively likely that more advanced neural
2300480	2307520	networks have deeper phenomenology more complex where it goes just from basic sensation to
2307520	2314800	to emotion to social awareness to abstract cognition to self-reflexive abstract cognition
2314800	2318960	yeah but I wouldn't say that's the emergence of consciousness I would say it's increased
2318960	2323600	complexity within the domain of first person corresponding to increased complexity and the
2323600	2328000	correspondence should not automatically be seen as causal we can get into the arguments for why
2328000	2334880	that often is the case so what I say that obviously the sapien brain is pretty unique
2335520	2341600	and a single sapien now has that right even if it took sapiens evolving in tribes based on group
2341600	2347040	selection to make that brain so the group made it now that brain is there now if I take that a
2347040	2351360	single person with that brain out of the group and try to raise them in a box they'll still not be
2351360	2357600	very interesting even with the brain but the brain does give hardware capacities that if conditioned
2357600	2365680	in relationship can have interesting things emerge so do I think that the the human biology
2367040	2372560	types of human consciousness and types of social interaction all co-emerged and co-evolved yes
2374080	2378880	as a smaller side as you're talking about the biology let me comment that I spent this is what
2378880	2384160	I do this is what I do with my life this is why we'll never accomplish anything is I spent much of
2384160	2390160	the morning trying to calculate trying to do research on how many computations the brain performs
2390160	2397360	and how many how much energy it uses versus the state of the rcpus and gpus now arriving at
2398320	2406000	about 20 quadrillion so that's 2 to the 10 to the 16 computations so synaptic firings per second
2406080	2411040	that the brain does and that's about a million times faster than the uh
2412960	2421840	the let's say the 20 thread state of the arts intel cpu the the 10th generation and then
2421840	2428640	there's similar calculation for the for the for the gpu and all ended up also trying to compute
2428640	2434400	that it takes 10 watts to run the brain about and then what does that mean in terms of calories per
2434400	2440160	day killer calories that's about two for an average human brain that's
2441520	2449040	250 to 300 calories a day and so it ended up being a calculation where you're doing about
2450400	2457840	20 quadrillion calculations that that are fueled by something like depending on your diet three
2457920	2465280	bananas so three bananas results in uh in a computation that's about a million times more
2465280	2469920	powerful than the current state of the art computers now let's take that one step further
2470480	2475360	there's some assumptions built in there the assumption is that one what the brain is doing
2475360	2481200	is just computation two the the relevant computations are synaptic firings and that there's
2481200	2487600	nothing other than synaptic firings that we have to to factor so I'm forgetting his name
2487600	2494960	right now there's a very uh famous neuroscientist at stanford just passed away recently who did a
2494960	2500320	lot of the pioneering work on glial cells and showed that his assessment glial cells did a huge
2500320	2504640	amount of the thinking not just neurons and it opened up this entirely different field of like
2504640	2508880	what the brain is and what consciousness is you look at demasio's work on embodied cognition
2508880	2513680	and how much of what we would consider consciousness or feeling is happening outside of the nervous
2513680	2518160	system completely happening in endocrine process involving lots of other cells and
2518160	2523680	signal communication uh you talk to somebody like penrose who you've had on the show and even
2523680	2528240	though the penrose hammerhoff conjecture is probably not right is there something like that
2528240	2531920	that might be the case where we're actually having to look at stuff happening at the level of quantum
2531920	2539120	computation of microtubules I'm not arguing for any of those I'm arguing that we don't know how big
2539120	2544720	the unknown unknown set is well at the very least this is this has become like an infomercial for
2544720	2552480	the human brain at the very but wait there's more at the very least the three bananas buys you a
2552480	2559280	million times at the very least at the very least and then you could have uh and then the synaptic
2559280	2563360	firings we're referring to is strictly the electrical signals that could be the mechanical
2563360	2567440	transmission of information like this chemical transmission of information there's there's all
2567440	2572720	kinds of other stuff going on and there's memory that's built in that's also all tied in not to
2572720	2579040	mention which I'm learning more and more about it's not just about the uh the neurons it's also
2579040	2584960	about the immune system that's somehow helping with the computation so the entirety and the entire
2584960	2590640	body is helping with the computation so the three bananas they could buy you a lot it could buy you
2590640	2601440	a lot but on the topic of sort of the greater degrees of complexity emerging in consciousness
2602160	2608800	I think few things are as beautiful and inspiring as taking a step outside of the human brain
2608800	2618240	just looking at systems or simple rules create incredible complexity uh not create incredible
2618320	2625520	complexity emerges so one of the simplest things to do that with is uh cellular automata
2626240	2633600	and there's I don't know what it is and maybe you can speak to it we can certainly we will
2633600	2642400	certainly talk about the implications of this but there's so few things that are as awe inspiring to
2642400	2648640	me as knowing the rules of a system and not being able to predict what the heck it looks like and it
2648640	2656720	creates incredibly beautiful complexity that when zoomed out on looks like there's actual organisms
2656720	2667680	doing things that are much uh that operate on a scale much higher than the underlying mechanism
2667680	2672880	so with cellular automata that's cells that are born and die born or die and they only know about
2672880	2677200	each other's neighbors and there's simple rules that govern that interaction of birth and death
2677840	2685440	and then they create at scale organisms that look like they take up hundreds or thousands of cells
2685440	2690160	and they're moving they're moving around they're communicating they're sending signals to each other
2690800	2699440	and you forget at moment of time before you remember that the simple rules on cells is all
2699440	2709760	that it took to create that that's it's sad in that we can't come up with a simple description of that
2709760	2720000	system that generalizes the behavior of the large organisms we can only come up with
2720000	2724240	can only hope to come up with the thing the fundamental physics or the fundamental rules
2724240	2729040	of that system i suppose it's sad that we can't predict everything we know about the mathematics
2729040	2734640	of those systems it seems like we can't really in a nice way like economics tries to do to predict
2734640	2740640	how this whole thing will unroll but it's beautiful because how simple it is underneath it all
2741280	2749920	so what do you make of the emergence of complexity from simple rules what the hell is that about
2750720	2756560	yeah well we can see that something like flocking behavior the murmuration can can be computer
2756560	2761680	coded it's not a very hard set of rules to be able to see some of those really amazing types of
2761680	2767920	complexity and the whole field of complexity science and some of the sub disciplines like
2767920	2774480	stigmer g are are studying how following fairly simple responses to a pheromone signal do ant
2774480	2778640	colonies do this amazing thing where the what what you might describe as the organizational
2778640	2783600	or computational capacity of the colony is so profound relative to what each individual
2784240	2790560	ants is doing i am not um anywhere near as well versed in the cutting edge of cellular
2790560	2795200	automatas i would like unfortunately i in terms of topics that i would like to get to and haven't
2795200	2802640	like uh et's more um all forms a new kind of science i have only skimmed and read reviews of
2802640	2809680	and not read the whole thing or his newer work since um but his idea of the four basic kind of
2809680	2814480	categories of uh emergent phenomena that can come from cellular automata and that one of them is
2814480	2823760	kind of interesting and looks a lot like complexity rather than just chaos or homogeneity or um
2823760	2833120	self-termination or whatever i think this is very interesting it does not instantly make
2833120	2838560	me think that uh biology is operating on a similarly small set of rules and or that human
2838560	2848080	consciousness is i'm i'm not that reductionistly oriented and um so if you look at say santa fe
2848080	2852560	institute one of the co-founders stewart kaufman um his work he should you should really get him on
2852560	2858240	your show so a lot of the questions that you like one of kaufman's you know more recent books after
2858240	2861840	investigations and some of the real fundamental stuff was called reinventing the sacred and it
2861840	2867520	had to do with some of these exact questions uh in kind of non-reductionist approach but that is not
2867520	2873600	just silly hippie ism um and he was very interested in highly non-argodic systems where
2873600	2878080	you couldn't take a lot of behavior over a small period of time and predict what the behavior of
2878080	2883840	subsets over a longer period of time would do um and then going further someone who spent
2883840	2887600	some time at santa fe institute and then kind of made a whole new field that you should have on
2887600	2893360	dave snowden who some people call the father of anthro complexity or what is the complexity
2893360	2899600	unique to humans uh he says something to the effect of that modeling humans as termites really
2899600	2906320	doesn't cut it like we we we don't respond exactly identically to the same pheromone stimulus using
2906320	2910800	stigmer g like it works for flows of traffic and some very simple human behaviors but it really
2910800	2915520	doesn't work for trying to make sense of the sistine chapel and picasso and general relativity
2915520	2922400	creation and stuff like that and it's because the the termites are not doing abstraction forecasting
2922400	2926720	deep into the future and making choices now based on forecasts of the future not just adaptive
2926720	2931680	signals in the moment and evolutionary code from history that's really different right like making
2931680	2939120	choices now that can factor deep modeling of the future um and with humans our uniqueness
2939120	2943840	one to the next in terms of response to similar stimuli is much higher than it is with a termite
2944560	2949440	um one of the interesting things there is that their uniqueness is extremely low they're basically
2949440	2953120	fungible within a class right there's different classes but within a class they're basically
2953120	2960000	fungible and their system uses that very high numbers and lots of um loss right lots of death
2960000	2964880	the termite feels that way don't you think we humans are deceiving ourselves about our uniqueness
2964880	2970160	perhaps it doesn't just isn't there some sense in which this emergence just creates different
2970160	2975120	higher and higher levels of abstraction where every at every layer each organism feels unique
2975680	2981920	is that possible that we're all equally dumb but at different scales no i think uniqueness is evolving
2981920	2991280	hmm i think that hydrogen atoms are more similar to each other than cells of the same type are and
2991280	2996080	i think that cells are more similar to each other than humans are and i think that highly
2996880	3001920	k selected species are more unique than r selected species so they're different evolutionary
3001920	3008560	processes the r selected species where you have a whole a lot of death and very high birth rates
3009360	3016320	you're not looking for as much individuality within or individual possible expression to cover
3016320	3020320	the evolutionary search space within an individual you're looking at it more in terms of a numbers
3020320	3026720	game um so yeah i would say there's probably more difference between one orca and the next
3026720	3031680	than there is between one cape buffalo and the next given that it would be interesting to get
3031760	3036400	your thoughts about mimetic theory where we're imitating each other
3039440	3046880	in the context of this idea of uniqueness how much truth is there to that how compelling is
3046880	3056880	this world view to you of gerardian mimetic theory of desire where maybe you can explain it from
3056880	3062800	your perspective but it seems like imitating each other is the fundamental property of the
3062800	3069840	behavior of human civilization well imitation is not unique to humans right monkeys imitate
3071600	3078800	so a certain amount of learning through observing is not unique to humans humans do more of it
3080400	3085920	it's actually kind of worth speaking to this for a moment um monkeys can learn new behaviors new
3086880	3092000	we've even seen teaching an ape sign language and then the ape teaching other apes sign language
3092960	3099600	so that's a kind of mimesis right kind of learning through imitation and that needs to happen if they
3099600	3105040	need to learn or develop capacities that are not just coded by their genetics right so within the
3105040	3110800	same genome they're learning new things based on the environment and so based on someone else learn
3110800	3118000	something first and so let's pick it up uh how much a creature is the result of just its genetic
3118000	3123120	programming and how much it's learning is a very interesting question and i think this is a place
3123120	3128800	where humans really show up radically different than everything else and you can see it in the
3128800	3136960	in the neoteny how long we're basically fetal um that a the closest ancestors to us if we look at a
3136960	3143520	chimp a chimp can hold on to its mother's fur while she moves around day one and obviously we see
3143520	3149440	horses up and walking within 20 minutes the fact that it takes a human a year to be walking and it
3149440	3153200	takes a horse 20 minutes and you say how many multiples of 20 minutes go into a year like that's
3153200	3159040	a long period of helplessness that it wouldn't work for a horse right like they or anything else
3159840	3166320	and and not only could we not hold on to mom in the first day it's three months before we can move
3166320	3173360	our head volitionally um so it's like why why are we embryonic for so long basically it's like
3174640	3179680	like it's still fetal on the outside had to be because couldn't keep growing inside and actually
3179680	3186480	ever get out with big heads and narrower hips from going upright um so here's a place where
3186480	3192960	there's a coevolution of the pattern of humans specifically here are our neoteny and what that
3193040	3200880	portends to learning with our being toolmaking and environment modifying creatures which is because
3200880	3205760	we have the abstraction to make tools we change our environments more than other creatures change
3205760	3211920	their environments the next most environment modifying creature tusks is like a beaver and then
3211920	3217600	you wear an la you fly into lax and you look at the just orthogonal grid going on forever in all
3217600	3222640	directions and you know we we've recently come into the Anthropocene where the surface of the
3222640	3227040	earth is changing more from human activity than geological activity and then beavers and you're
3227040	3234160	like okay wow we're really in a class of our own in terms of environment modifying yeah um so as
3234160	3242080	soon as we started toolmaking we were able to change our environments much more radically we
3242080	3246640	could put on clothes and go to a cold place right and this is really important because
3247200	3252000	we actually went and became apex predators in every environment we functioned like apex predators
3252000	3257440	but polar bear can't leave the Arctic right and the the lion can't leave the savannah and an orca
3257440	3260720	can't leave the ocean and we went became apex predators in all those environments because of
3260720	3264640	our tool creation capacity we could become better predators than them adapted to the environment or
3264640	3271760	at least with our tools adapted to the environment so then every aspect towards any organism in any
3271760	3278960	environment were incredibly good at becoming apex predators yes and nothing else can do that kind
3278960	3284880	of thing there there is no other apex predator that you see the other apex predator is only getting
3284880	3288880	better at being a predator through evolutionary process that's super slow and that super slow
3288880	3293360	process creates co-selective process with their environment so as the predator becomes a tiny
3293360	3298080	bit faster it eats more of the slow prey the genes of the fast prey and breed and the prey becomes
3298080	3303920	faster and so there's this kind of balancing and we in because of our tool making we increased our
3303920	3309040	predatory capacity faster than anything else could increase its resilience to it as a result we
3309040	3314400	started out stripping the environment and extincting species following stone tools and going and
3314400	3317680	becoming apex predator everywhere this is why we can't keep applying apex predator theories because
3317680	3322480	we're not an apex predator we're an apex predator but we're something much more than that um like
3322560	3328720	just for an example the the top apex predator in the world in orca an orca can eat one big fish at
3328720	3335200	a time like one tuna and it'll miss most of the time or one seal and we can put a mile long drift
3335200	3341360	net out on a single boat and pull up an entire school of them right we can deplete the entire
3341360	3346240	oceans of them that's not an orca right like that's not an apex predator um and that's not even
3346240	3351360	including that we can then genetically engineer different creatures we can extinct species we can
3351360	3355280	devastate whole ecosystems we can make built worlds that have no natural things that are just
3355280	3359840	human built worlds we can build new types of natural creatures synthetic life so we are much
3359840	3363760	more like little gods than we are like apex predators now but we're still behaving as apex
3363760	3368320	predators and little gods that behave as apex predators causes a problem kind of core to my
3368320	3375760	assessment of the world so what does it mean to be a predator so a predator is uh somebody that
3376560	3384320	effectively can mine the resources from a place so for their survival or is it also just purely
3385280	3391760	like higher level objectives of violence and what is can predators be predators towards
3391760	3396640	the same each other towards the same species like are we think are we using the word predator
3396640	3403040	sort of generally which then connects to conflict and uh military conflict violent conflict
3403280	3408480	in the space of uh human species obviously we can say that plants are mining the resources of
3408480	3412720	their environment in a particular way using photosynthesis to be able to pull minerals
3412720	3418640	out of the soil and nitrogen and carbon out of the air and like that um and we can say herbivores
3418640	3423280	are being able to mine and concentrate that so I wouldn't say mining the environment is unique
3423280	3428400	to predator predator is you know uh
3431280	3439600	generally being defined as mining other animals right we don't consider herbivores predators
3439600	3446880	but um animal which requires some type of violence capacity because animals move plants don't move
3446880	3452160	so requires some capacity to overtake something that can move and try to get away
3454000	3459680	we'll go back to the juridzing then we'll come back here why are we neoteness why are we embryonic
3459680	3467040	for so long because are we did we just move from the savannah to the arctic and we need to learn
3467040	3472560	new stuff if we came genetically programmed we would not be able to do that are we throwing
3472560	3477360	spears or are we fishing or are we running an industrial supply chain or are we texting what
3477360	3482640	is the adaptive behavior horses today in the wild and horses 10 000 years ago are doing pretty
3482640	3488880	much the same stuff and so since we make tools and we evolve our tools and then change our
3488880	3493040	environment so quickly and other animals are largely the result of their environment but
3493040	3498320	we're environment modifying so rapidly we need to come without too much programming so we can
3498320	3505120	learn the environment we're in learn the language right which is uh gonna be very important learn
3505120	3511280	the tool making learn the um and so we have a very long period of relative helpless of helplessness
3511360	3515840	because we aren't coded how to behave yet because we're imprinting a lot of software on how to
3515840	3521440	behave that is useful to that particular time so our mimesis is not it's not unique to humans but
3521440	3526960	the total amount of it is really unique and this is also where the uniqueness can go up right is
3526960	3531760	because we are less just the result of the genetics and that means the kind of learning
3531760	3537440	through history that they got coded in genetics and more the result of it's almost like our hardware
3537440	3542960	selected for software right like if evolution is kind of doing these think of as a hardware
3542960	3549200	selection i have problems with computer metaphors for biology but i'll use this one here um that
3550400	3556880	we have not had hardware changes since the beginning of sapiens but our world is really
3556880	3563680	really different and that's all changes in software right changes in on the same fundamental genetic
3563680	3569520	substrate what we're doing with these brains and minds and bodies and social groups and like that
3570400	3580640	and so um now giord specifically was looking at when we watch other people talking so we
3580640	3584240	learn language you and i would have a hard time learning mandarin today or it'd take a lot of
3584240	3587920	work we'd be learning how to conjugate verbs and stuff but a baby learns it instantly without
3587920	3591520	anyone even really trying to teach it just through mimesis so it's a it's a powerful thing
3592320	3595360	they're obviously more neuroplastic than we are when they're doing that and all their
3595360	3599520	attention is allocated to that but they're also learning how to move their bodies and
3599520	3603760	they're learning all kinds of stuff through mimesis one of the things that giord says is
3603760	3608800	they're also learning what to want and they learn what to want they learn desire by watching
3608800	3613840	what other people want and so intrinsic to this people end up wanting what other people want
3613840	3620160	and if we can't have what other people have without taking it away from them then that
3620160	3626000	becomes a source of conflict so the mimesis of desire is the fundamental generator of conflict
3626000	3633920	and then the conflict energy within a group of people will build over time this is a very very
3633920	3639120	crude interpretation of the theory can we just pause on that for people who are not familiar
3639120	3644320	and for me who hasn't i'm loosely familiar but haven't internalized it but every time i think
3644320	3649040	about it's a very compelling view of the world whether it's true or not it's quite
3650480	3655680	it's like when you take everything Freud says as truth it's a very interesting way to think about
3655680	3665120	the world and in the same way thinking about the memetic theory of desire that everything we want
3667600	3674400	is imitation of other people's wants we don't have any original wants we're constantly imitating
3674480	3682080	others and so and not just others but you know others we're exposed to so there's these like
3682080	3688560	little local pockets however defined local of people like imitating each other and one that's
3688560	3694240	super empowering because then you can pick which group you can join like what what do you want to
3694240	3700560	imitate it's it's uh it's the old like you know whoever your friends are that's what your life
3700560	3706560	is gonna be like that's really powerful i mean it's depressing that we're so unoriginal but it's
3706560	3713680	also liberating in that if this holds true that we can choose our life by choosing the people we
3713680	3720000	hang out with so okay thoughts that are very compelling that seem like they're more absolute
3720000	3726720	than they actually are end up also being dangerous we want communism i'm i'm gonna discuss here where
3726800	3732000	i think we need to amend this particular theory but specifically you just said something that
3732000	3736800	everyone who's paid attention knows is true experientially which is who you're around
3736800	3744160	affects who you become and as as libertarian and self-determining and sovereign as we'd like to be
3745920	3751040	everybody i think knows that if you got put in the maximum security prison aspects of your
3751040	3755360	personality would have to adapt or you wouldn't survive there right you would become different if
3755360	3760080	you were if if you grew up in dar four versus finland you would be different with your same
3760080	3766400	genetics like just just no real question about that um and that even today if you hang out in a
3766400	3773520	place with ultramarathoners as your roommates or um all people who are obese as your roommates
3773520	3777280	the statistical likelihood of what happens to your fitness is pretty clear right like the
3777280	3782560	behavioral science of this is pretty clear so uh the whole saying we are the average of the five
3782560	3786800	people we spend the most time around i think the more self-reflective someone is and the more time
3786800	3791280	they spend by themselves in self-reflection the less this is true but it's still true so one of the
3791280	3796960	best things someone can do to become more self-determined is be self-determined about the
3796960	3801200	environments they want to put themselves in because to the degree that there is some self-determination
3801200	3805600	and some determination by the environment don't be fighting an environment that is predisposing
3805600	3809440	you in bad directions try to put yourself in an environment that is predisposing the things
3809440	3814240	that you want in turn try to affect the environment in ways to predispose positive things for those
3814240	3819520	around you or perhaps also to there's probably interesting ways to play with this you could
3819520	3827040	probably put yourself like form connections that have this perfect tension in all directions to
3827040	3831760	where you're actually free to decide whatever the heck you want because the set of wants
3831760	3838320	within your circle of interactions is so conflicting that you're free to choose whichever
3838320	3842880	one so if there's enough tension as opposed to everybody aligned like a flock of birds
3843520	3848160	yeah i mean you definitely want that all of the dialectics would be balanced
3849760	3857280	so if you have someone who is extremely oriented to self-empowerment and someone who is extremely
3857280	3861600	oriented to kind of empathy and compassion both the dialectic of those is better than either of
3861600	3867760	them on their own if you have both of them inhabiting being inhabited better than you by
3867760	3873200	the same person spending time around that person will probably do well for you i think the thing
3873200	3877280	you just mentioned is super important when it comes to cognitive schools which is
3879520	3885200	i think one of the fastest things people can do to improve their learning and they're not just
3885200	3892480	cognitive learning but their meaningful problem solving communication and civic capacity capacity
3892480	3897360	to participate as a citizen with other people and making the world better is to be seeking
3897360	3903120	dialectical synthesis all the time and so in the hegelian sense if you have a thesis
3904400	3909280	you have an antithesis so maybe we have libertarianism on one side and marxist kind
3909280	3916960	of communism on the other side and one is arguing that the individual is the unit of choice and so
3916960	3922480	we want to increase the freedom and support of individual choice because as they make more
3922480	3926160	agentic choices it'll produce a better hole for everybody the other side saying well the
3926160	3929680	individuals are conditioned by their environment who would choose to be born into darfur rather
3929680	3938080	than finland so we actually need to collectively make environments that are good because that the
3938080	3943360	environment conditions the individuals so you have a thesis and an antithesis and then hegel's
3943360	3947440	ideas you have a synthesis which is a kind of higher order truth that understands how those
3947440	3952560	relate in a way that neither of them do and so it is actually at a higher order of complexity
3952560	3956960	so the first part would be can i steal man each of these can i argue each one well enough
3956960	3961680	that the proponents of it are like totally you got that and not just argue it rhetorically but
3961680	3966800	can i inhabit it where i can try to see and feel the world the way someone seeing and feeling the
3966800	3971680	world that way would because once i do then i don't want to screw those people because there's
3971680	3976000	truth in it right and i'm not going to go back to war with them i'm going to go to finding solutions
3976000	3980160	it could actually work at a higher order if i don't go to a higher order then there's war
3980160	3986080	and but then the higher order thing would be well it seems like the individual does affect
3986960	3991280	the commons and the collective and other people it also seems like the collective conditions
3991280	3995680	individuals at least statistically and i can cherry pick out the one guy who got out of the ghetto
3996720	4000720	and pulled himself up by his bootstraps but i can also say statistically that most people born
4000720	4006960	into the ghetto show up differently than most people born into the hamptons and so unless you
4006960	4010480	want to argue that and have you take your child from the hamptons and put them in the ghetto then
4010480	4016560	like come on be realistic about this thing so how do we make we don't want social systems that make
4017520	4023840	weak dependent individuals right the welfare argument but we also don't want no social system
4023840	4030720	that supports individuals to do better we want we don't want individuals where their self-expression
4030720	4035920	and agency fucks the environment and everybody else and employs slave labor and whatever so can
4035920	4041760	we make it to where individuals are creating holes that are better for conditioning other
4041760	4046800	individuals can we make it to where we have holes that are conditioning increased agency and sovereignty
4046800	4052240	right that would be the synthesis so the thing that i'm coming to here is if people have that as
4052240	4056560	a frame and sometimes it's not just thesis nante thesis it's like eight different views right
4057360	4062480	can i steal man each view this is not just can i take the perspective but am i seeking them am i
4062480	4069120	actively trying to inhabit other people's perspective then can i really try to essentialize
4069120	4073920	it and argue the the best points of it both the sense making about reality and the values
4074480	4080160	why these values actually matter then just like i want to seek those perspectives then i want to
4080160	4087840	seek is there a higher order set of understandings that could fulfill the values of and synthesize
4087840	4091840	the sense making of all of them simultaneously maybe i won't get it but i want to be seeking it
4091840	4096880	and i want to be seeking progressively better ones so this is perspective seeking driving
4096880	4108080	perspective taking and then seeking synthesis i think that that one cognitive disposition might
4108080	4115040	be the most helpful thing would you put a title dialectic synthesis on that process because that
4115040	4122720	seems to be such a part so like this rigorous empathy like like it's not just empathy it's
4122720	4128320	empathy with rigor like you really want to understand and embody different worldviews and
4128320	4134720	then try to find a higher order synthesis okay so i remember last night you told me when we first
4134720	4140720	met uh you said that you looked in somebody's eyes and you felt that you had suffered in some
4140720	4145680	ways that they had suffered and so you could trust them shared pathos right creates a certain sense
4145680	4150800	of kind of shared bonding and shared intimacy so empathy is actually feeling the suffering of
4150800	4155840	somebody else and feeling the the depth of their sentience so i don't want to fuck them anymore
4155840	4160000	and i mean i hurt them i don't want to behave in a i don't want my proposition to go through
4160880	4164000	when i go and inhabit the perspective of the other people they feel that's really going to
4164000	4169600	mess them up right and so the rigorous empathy it's different than just compassion which is i
4169600	4174480	generally care like i have a generalized care but i don't know what it's like to be them i can
4174480	4178800	never know what it's like to be them perfectly and that there's a humility you have to have which is
4178800	4185280	my most rigorous attempt is still not it my most rigorous attempt mine to know what it's like to
4185280	4188960	be a woman is still not it i have no question that if i was actually a woman it would be different
4188960	4193600	than my best guesses i have no question if i was actually black it's be different than my best guesses
4194320	4198560	so there's a humility in that which keeps me listening because i don't think that i know fully
4198560	4203600	but i want to and i'm going to keep trying better to and then i want to across them and
4203600	4208240	then i want to say is there a way we can forward together and not have to be in more it has to
4208240	4212960	be something that could meet the values that everyone holds it could reconcile the partial
4212960	4219040	sense making that everyone holds and they could offer a way forward that is more agreeable than
4219040	4224000	the partial perspectives at war with each other but the so the more you succeeded this empathy
4224000	4230160	with humility the more you're carrying the burden of their of other people's pain essentially
4230800	4235840	now this goes back to the question of do i see us as one being or 7.8 billion
4238640	4239600	i think them
4242240	4247920	if i'm overwhelmed with my own pain i can't empathize that much because i don't have the bandwidth i
4247920	4252320	don't have the capacity if i don't feel like i can do something about a particular problem
4252320	4257200	in the world it's hard to feel it because it's just too devastating and so a lot of people go numb
4257200	4262880	and even go nihilistic because they just don't feel the agency so as i actually become more empowered
4262880	4267840	as an individual and have more sense of agency i also become more empowered to be more empathetic
4267840	4272880	for others and be more connected to that shared burden and want to be able to make choices on
4272880	4282320	behalf of and in and in benefit of so this way of living seems like a way of living that would
4282320	4289360	solve a lot of problems in society from a cellular automata perspective so if you have a bunch of
4289360	4294960	little like little agents behaving in this way my intuition there'll be interesting complexities
4294960	4300880	that emerge but my intuition is it will create a society that's very different and recognizably
4301520	4308640	better than the one we have today how much um like oh wait hold that question because i want
4308640	4312480	to come back to it but this brings us back to jarred which we didn't answer the conflict theory
4312480	4316480	yes because about how to get past the conflict theory yes you know the robert for us poem about
4316480	4320560	the two paths he never had enough time to return back to the other we're gonna have to do that
4320560	4328400	quite a lot we're gonna be uh living that poem over and over again but yes how how to uh let's
4328400	4333520	return back okay so the rest of the argument goes you learn to want what other people want
4333520	4338160	therefore fundamental conflict based in our desire because we want the thing that somebody else has
4338720	4344240	and then people are can they're in conflict over trying to get the same stuff power status
4344240	4350400	attention physical stuff a mate whatever it is and then the we learn the conflict by watching
4350400	4356080	and so then the conflict becomes a medic so the and you know we become on the palestinian side of
4356080	4359840	the israeli side of the communist the capitalist side or the left or right politically or whatever
4359840	4366800	it is and until eventually the conflict energy in the system builds up so much that some type of
4366800	4371600	violence is needed to get the bad guy whoever it is that we're going to blame and you know jarred
4371600	4376240	talks about why scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to minimize the amount of violence let's blame
4376240	4380720	let's blame it a a scapegoat as being more relevant than they really were but if we all
4380720	4385280	believe it then we can all kind of calm down with the conflict energy it's a really interesting
4385360	4390240	concept by the way i mean you went you beautifully summarized it but the idea that there's a scapegoat
4390240	4395680	that there's a this kind of thing naturally still conflict and then they find the other some group
4395680	4401440	that's the other that's either real artificial as the cause of the conflict well it's always
4401440	4406080	artificial because the cause of the conflict in jarred is the mimesis of desire itself and how
4406080	4411600	do we attack that how do we attack that it's our own desire so this now gets to something more like
4411600	4417600	buddha said right which was desire is the cause of suffering um jarred and buddha would kind of
4417600	4425280	agree in this way so and so but that's that explains i mean again it's a compelling description
4425280	4432960	of human history that we do tend to come up with the other and uh okay kind of i just i just had
4432960	4438640	such a funny experience with someone critiquing jarred the other day in such a elegant and
4438640	4449120	beautiful and simple way it's a a friend who's uh grew up aboriginal australian uh as a scholar of
4449120	4456560	aboriginal social technologies and he's like nah man jarred just made shit up about how tribes
4456560	4461520	worked like we come from a tribe we've got tens of thousands of years and we didn't have increasing
4461520	4465440	conflict and then scapegoat and kill someone we'd have a little bit of conflict and then we would
4465440	4469600	dance and then everybody'd be fine like we'd dance around the campfire everyone would like
4469600	4473440	kind of physically get the energy out we'd look in each other's eyes we'd have positive bonding
4473440	4479600	and then we're fine and nobody nobody no scapegoats and i think that's called the joe rogan theory of
4479600	4484640	desire which is uh he's like all all of human problems have to do with the fact that you don't
4484640	4490320	do enough hard shit in your day uh so maybe maybe just dance it because he says like doing
4490320	4494320	exercise and running on that treadmill gets gets all the demons out maybe just dance and gets all
4494320	4499440	the demons out so this is why i say we have to be careful with taking an idea that seems too
4499440	4504640	explanatory and then taking it as a given and then saying well now that we're stuck with the fact that
4505600	4510000	conflict is inexorable because human because mimetic desire and therefore how do we deal with
4510000	4514000	the inexorability of the conflict and how to sublimate violence well no the whole thing might
4514000	4518800	be actually gibberish meaning it's only true in certain conditions and other conditions it's not
4518800	4523120	true so the deeper question is under which conditions is that true under which conditions is
4523120	4526960	it not true what do those other conditions make possible and look like and in general we should
4526960	4533440	stay away from really compelling models of reality because there's something about about our brains
4533440	4538320	that these models become sticky and we can't even think outside of them so it's not that we stay away
4538320	4543040	from them it's that we know that the model of reality is never reality that's the key thing
4543680	4547680	humility again it goes back to just having the humility that you don't have a perfect model of
4547680	4553840	reality there's an the model of reality could never be reality the process of modeling is inherently
4554800	4561520	information reduction and i can never show that the unknown unknown set has been factored
4563920	4570480	it's back to the cellular automata you can't you can't put the genie back in the bottle like
4570480	4575200	when you realize it's unfortunately sadly impossible to
4578080	4582000	to create a model of cellular automata even if you know the basic rules
4582800	4591440	that predict to even any degree of accuracy what how that system will evolve which is fascinating
4591440	4597440	mathematically sorry i i think about it quite a lot it's very annoying wolfram has this rule 30
4599200	4605600	like you should be able to predict it it's so simple but you can't predict what's going to be
4606240	4611280	like there's a there's a problem he defines like try to predict some aspect of the middle
4611280	4616000	middle column of the system just anything about it what's going to happen in the future and you
4616000	4625040	can't you can't it sucks because then we can't make sense of this world you know really in a
4625040	4631840	reality in a definitive way it's always like in the striving like it we're always striving
4632400	4637120	yeah i don't think this sucks that so that's a feature not a bug
4638240	4643680	well that's assuming a designer um i would say i don't think it sucks i think it's
4644480	4652160	not only beautiful but maybe necessary for beauty the mess so you're uh so you're
4652160	4656480	you're just a great jordan pierce and you should clean up your room so you like the rooms messy
4656480	4664480	it's uh it's essential for the for beauty it's not it's not that it's okay i take i have no idea
4664480	4669440	if it was intended this way and so i'm just interpreting it a way i like the commandment
4669440	4677760	about having no false idols to me the way i interpret that is meaningful is that reality
4677760	4682960	sacred to me i have a reverence for reality but i know my best understanding of it is never complete
4682960	4691920	i know my best model of it is a model where i tried to make some kind of predictive capacity
4691920	4696560	by reducing the complexity of it to a set of stuff that i could observe and then a subset
4696560	4700640	of that stuff that i thought was the causal dynamics and then some set of you know mechanisms
4700640	4706160	that are involved and what we find is that it can be super useful like newtonian gravity can
4706160	4711120	help us do ballistic curves and all kinds of super useful stuff and then we get to the place where it
4711120	4718160	doesn't explain what's happening at the cosmological scale or at a quantum scale and at each time what
4718160	4725040	we're finding is uh we exclude itself and it also doesn't explain the reconciliation of gravity
4725040	4729920	with quantum mechanics and the other kind of fundamental laws and the so models can be useful
4729920	4736800	but they're never true with a capital t meaning they're never an actual real full they're never
4736800	4740720	a complete description of what's happening in real systems they can be a complete description
4740720	4745040	of what's happening in an artificial system that was the result of applying a model so the model
4745040	4748560	of a circuit board and the circuit board are the same thing but i would argue that the model of a
4748560	4755120	cell and the cell are not the same thing and i would say this is key to what we call complexity
4755120	4762320	versus the complicated which is a distinction davis noden made well in defining the difference
4762320	4768320	between simple complicated complex and chaotic systems but one of the definers in complex systems
4768320	4772240	is that no matter how you model the complex system it will still have some emergent behavior
4772240	4777840	not predicted by the model can you elaborate on the complex versus the complicated complicated
4777840	4782640	means we can fully explicate the phase space of all the things that it can do we can program it
4784000	4789840	all human not all for the most part human built things are complicated they don't self organize
4791040	4795520	they don't self repair they're not self evolving and we can make a blueprint for them
4796240	4801680	where sorry for human systems for human technologies human technologies sorry it's okay so so
4801680	4808640	non that are basically the application of models right right and engineering is kind of applied
4808640	4816880	science science as the modeling process and but with but humans are complex complex stuff with
4816880	4822320	biological type stuff um and sociological type stuff it more has generator functions
4822960	4828800	and even those can't be fully explicated then it has or our explication can't prove that it
4828800	4832800	has closure of what would be in the unknown unknown set where we keep finding like oh it's
4832800	4836560	just the genome oh well now it's the genome and the epigenome and then a recursive change on the
4836560	4841040	epigenome because of the proteome and then there's mitochondrial dna and then virus is affected and
4841040	4847440	fuck right so it's like we get overexcited when we think we found the thing so on facebook you
4847440	4851440	know how you can list your relationship is complicated it should actually say it's it's
4851440	4857440	complex that's the more accurate description you uh self terminating is a really interesting idea
4857440	4866080	that you talk about quite a bit first of all what is a self terminating system and i think you have
4866080	4872640	a sense correct me if i'm wrong that human civilization as it currently is is a self terminating
4872640	4880400	system why do you have that intuition combined with the definition of what's of self terminating
4880400	4892880	means okay so if we look at human societies historically human civilizations uh it's not
4892880	4896880	that hard to realize that most of the major civilizations and empires of the past don't
4896880	4902000	exist anymore so they had a life cycle they died for some reason so we don't still have any
4902720	4907440	the early egyptian empire or inka or maya or aztec or any of those right and so
4908720	4912960	they they terminated sometimes it seems like they were terminated from the outside in war
4912960	4915920	sometimes it seems like they self terminate when we look at easter island it was a self
4915920	4921600	termination um so let's go ahead and take an island situation if i have an island
4921600	4925760	and we are consuming the resources on that island faster than the resources can replicate
4925760	4930000	themselves and there's a finite space there that system is going to self terminate it's not
4930000	4934480	gonna be able to keep doing that thing because you'll get to a place of there's no resources left
4935040	4940800	and then you get uh so now if i'm utilizing the resources faster than they can replicate
4941680	4945600	or faster than they can replenish and i'm actually growing our population in the process
4945600	4951680	so i'm even increasing the rate of the utilization of resources i might get an exponential curve and
4951680	4956240	then hit a wall and then just collapse the exponential curve rather than do an s curve
4956240	4964560	or some other kind of thing um so self terminating system is any system that depends upon a substrate
4965440	4970160	system that is debasing its own substrate that is debasing what it depends upon
4970960	4976960	so you're right that uh if you look at empires they rise and fall throughout human history
4977520	4983520	but but not this time bro where this one's gonna last forever that's
4984560	4989360	i like that idea i think that if we don't understand why all the previous ones failed we
4989360	4993760	can't ensure that and so i think it's very important to understand it well so that we can
4993760	5000800	have that be a designed outcome with some what decent probability so we're it's sort of in terms
5000800	5005920	of consuming the resources on the island we're a clever bunch and we keep coming up
5007280	5015040	especially when the on the horizon there is a termination point we keep coming up with clever
5015040	5021600	ways of avoiding disaster of avoiding collapse of constructing this is where technological
5021600	5026640	innovation this is where growth comes in coming up with different ways to improve productivity and
5026640	5031760	the way society functions such that we consume less resources or get a lot more from the resources we
5031760	5041680	have so there's some sense in which there's a human ingenuity is a source for optimism
5041680	5048000	about the future of this particular system that uh that may not be self terminating if if there's
5048000	5056480	more innovation than there is consumption so um over consumption of resources just one way I think
5056480	5065040	can self-terminate we're just kind of starting here but um there are reasons for optimism and
5065040	5069200	pessimism then they're both worth understanding and there's failure modes on understanding either
5069200	5077040	without the other um as we mentioned previously there there's what I would call naive techno
5077040	5082960	optimism naive techno capital optimism that says uh stuff just has been getting better and better
5082960	5086320	and we wouldn't want to live in the dark ages and tech has done all this awesome stuff and
5087680	5092160	we know the proponents of those models and that stuff is going to kind of keep getting better
5092160	5095760	of course there are problems but human ingenuity rises to its apply and demand will solve the
5095760	5101520	problems whatever would you put rick or as well on that or in that bucket is there some
5102800	5107680	specific people you have in mind or naive optimism is truly naive to where you're
5107680	5112480	essentially just have an optimism that's blind to any kind of realities of the way technology
5112480	5122400	progresses I don't think that anyone who thinks about it and writes about it is perfectly naive
5122400	5128080	gotcha but there might play time it's a platonic ideal there there might be a bias in the nature
5128080	5134560	of the assessment I would also say there's kind of naive techno pessimism and there are
5135440	5145280	um critics of technology I mean you read the unabomber's manifesto on why technology can't
5145280	5149680	not result in our self termination so we have to take it out before it gets any further um
5151040	5157440	but also if you read a lot of the ex-risk community you know boss drum and friends uh it's like our
5158080	5162240	total number of existential risks and the total probability of them is going up
5162240	5172000	and so I think that there are we have to hold together where our positive possibilities and
5172000	5177280	our risk possibilities are both increasing and then say for the positive possibilities to be
5177280	5183840	realized long term all of the catastrophic risks have to not happen any of the catastrophic risks
5183840	5189280	happening is enough to keep that positive outcome from occurring so how do we ensure that none of
5189280	5194000	them happen if we want to say let's have a civilization that doesn't collapse so again
5194000	5199120	collapse theory it's worth looking at books like um the collapse of complex societies by
5199120	5208480	joseph tainter it does an analysis of that many of the societies fell for internal institutional
5208480	5214800	decay civilizational decay reasons um baudrillard in simulation in simulacra looks at a very different
5214800	5218880	way of looking at how institutional decay and the collective intelligence of a system happens and
5218880	5223840	it becomes kind of more internally parasitic on itself um obviously jarrod diamond made a more
5223840	5229600	popular book called collapse um and as we were mentioning the anti-catharia mechanism has been
5229600	5235520	getting attention in the news lately but it's like a 2000 year old clock right like like metal gears
5235520	5244480	and does that mean we lost like 1500 years of technological progress um and from a society that
5244480	5252720	was relatively technologically advanced um so what i'm interested in here is being able to say okay
5252720	5261120	well why did previous societies fail can we understand that abstractly enough that we can
5262640	5267680	make a civilizational model that isn't just trying to solve one type of failure but solve the
5267680	5273360	underlying things that generate the failures as a whole are there some underlying generator functions
5273360	5278720	or patterns that would make a system self-terminating and can we solve those and have that be the
5278720	5284720	kernel of a new civilizational model that is not self-terminating and can we then be able to actually
5284720	5289280	look at the categories of extras we're aware of and see that we actually have resilience in the
5289280	5295440	presence of those not just resilience but anti fragility and i would say for the optimism to
5295440	5301280	be grounded it has to actually be able to understand the risk space well and have adequate solutions
5301280	5311840	for it so can we try to dig into some basic intuitions about the underlying sources of catastrophic
5311840	5317680	failures of the system and overconsumption that's built in into self-terminating systems so both
5317680	5323840	the overconsumption which is like the slow death and then then there's the fast death of nuclear
5323840	5329840	war and all those kinds of things a agi biotech bioengineering nanotechnology nano my favorite
5329840	5339680	nano bots okay nano bots are my favorite because it sounds so cool to me that i could just know
5339680	5344400	that i would be one of the scientists that would be full steam ahead in building them without
5346000	5350160	sufficiently thinking about the negative consequence i would definitely be i would be
5350160	5357440	podcasting all about the negative consequences but when i go back home i'd be i just in my heart
5357440	5365840	know the amount of excitement is a dumb descendant of ape no offense to apes uh so i want to backtrack
5365840	5376640	on my previous comments about uh negative comments about apes uh that i have that sense of excitement
5376640	5382000	that would result in problems so sorry a lot of things said but what's can we start to pull
5382000	5389600	it a thread because you've also provided kind of a beautiful general approach to this which is this
5389600	5396320	dialectic synthesis or just rigorous empathy whatever whatever word we want to put to it
5396880	5401680	that seems to be from the individual perspective is one way to sort of live in the world as we
5401680	5407920	try to figure out how to construct non-self-terminating systems so what what are some underlying sources
5407920	5416720	yeah first i have to say uh i i actually really respect Drexler for emphasizing gray goo and
5416720	5423760	engines of creation back in the day um to make sure the world was paying adequate attention to
5423760	5429280	the risks of the the nanotech um as someone who was right at the cutting edge of what could be
5432320	5437280	there's definitely game theoretic advantage to those who focus on the opportunities and
5437280	5446720	don't focus on the risks or pretend there aren't risks um because they get to market first um and
5446720	5451920	then they externalize all of the costs through limited liability or whatever it is to the commons
5451920	5455120	or wherever happen to have it other people are going to have to solve those but now they have
5455120	5458880	the power and capital associated the person who looked at the risks and tried to do better design
5458880	5464320	and go slower um is probably not going to move into positions of as much power influence as quickly
5464320	5468720	so this one of the issues we have to deal with is some of the the bad game theoretic dispositions
5468720	5475120	in the system relative to its own um stability and the key aspect to that sorry to interrupt is
5475120	5481520	the externalities generated yes what flavors of catastrophic risk are we talking about here
5481520	5486560	what's your favorite flavor in terms of ice cream so mine is coconut nobody seems to like
5486560	5495360	coconut ice cream uh so ice cream aside what's uh what do you most worry about there's a catastrophic
5495360	5503040	risk that will help us kind of um make concrete the the the discussion we're having about how
5503040	5508640	to fix this whole thing yeah i think it's worth taking a historical perspective briefly to just
5508640	5514000	kind of orient everyone to it we don't have to um go all the way back to the aliens who've seen all
5514000	5520480	of civilization but to just recognize that um for all of human history as far as we're aware
5522640	5528480	there were existential risks to civilizations and they happened right like there were civilizations
5528480	5533840	that were killed in war um that tribes that were killed in tribal warfare whatever so
5534560	5538960	people faced existential risk to the group that they identified with it's just those were local
5538960	5544160	phenomena right they it wasn't a fully global phenomena so an empire could fall in surrounding
5544160	5552080	empires didn't fall maybe they came in filled the space um the first time that we were able to
5552880	5557440	think about catastrophic risk not from like a solar flare or something that we couldn't control but
5557440	5561840	from something that humans would actually create at a global level was world war two in the bomb
5562800	5566240	because it was the first time that we had tech big enough that could actually
5567040	5570560	mess up everything at a global level that could mess up habitability we just weren't
5570560	5574720	powerful enough to do that before it's it's not that we didn't behave in ways that would have
5574720	5580880	done it we just only behaved in those ways at the scale we could affect and so it's important to get
5580880	5586080	that there's the entire world before world war two where we don't have the ability to make a
5586080	5591520	non-habitable biosphere non-habitable for us and then there's world war two and the beginning
5591600	5597280	of a completely new phase where global human-induced catastrophic risk is now a real thing
5598400	5603200	and that was such a big deal that it changed the entire world in a really fundamental way
5603200	5608320	which is you know when you study history it's amazing how big a percentage of history is
5608320	5613360	studying war right in the the history of wars you study european history and whatever it's generals
5613360	5619360	and wars and empire expansions and and so the the major empires near each other never had really
5619360	5623840	long periods of time where they weren't engaged in war or preparation for war or something like
5623840	5630640	that was humans don't have a good precedent in the post-tribal phase the civilization phase of
5630640	5636560	being able to solve conflicts without war for very long world war two was the first time where
5637520	5642960	we could have a war that no one could win and so the superpowers couldn't fight again they couldn't
5642960	5647920	do a real kinetic war they could do diplomatic wars and cold war type stuff and they could fight
5647920	5652240	proxy wars through other countries that didn't have the big weapons and so mutually assured
5652240	5657600	destruction and like coming out of world war two we actually realized that nation states couldn't
5657600	5663360	prevent world war and so we needed a new type of of supervening government in addition to nation
5663360	5669200	states which was the whole bread and woods world the united nations the world bank the imf the
5669200	5675280	globalization trade type agreements mutually assured destruction that was how do we have
5675280	5679680	some coordination beyond just nation states between them since we have to stop war between at
5679680	5687200	least the superpowers and it was pretty successful given that we've had like 75 years of no superpower
5687200	5694080	on superpower war um we've had lots of proxy wars during that time we've had you know cold war
5695680	5702000	and i would say we're in a new phase now where the bread and wood solution is basically over
5702000	5709200	almost over being described the bread was solution yeah so the bread and woods the series of agreements
5709200	5717680	for how the nations would be able to engage with each other in a solution other than war
5718640	5724640	was these igos these intergovernmental organizations and was the idea of globalization
5724640	5727600	since we could have global effects we needed to be able to think about things globally
5728240	5732320	where we had trade relationships with each other where it would not be profitable
5732320	5736320	to war with each other it'd be more profitable to actually be able to trade with each other so our own
5736320	5744080	self-interest was you know going to drive our non-war interest um and so this started to look like
5744080	5748640	and obviously this this couldn't have happened that much earlier either because industrialization
5748640	5753360	hadn't gotten far enough to be able to do massive global industrial supply chains and ships stuff
5753360	5758160	around you know quickly but like we were mentioning earlier almost all the electronics that we
5758160	5763040	used today just basic cheap stuff for us is made on six continents made in many countries there's
5763040	5767120	no single country in the world that could actually make many of the things that we have and from the
5767120	5773520	raw material extraction to the plastics and polymers and the you know etc and so the idea
5773520	5779040	the idea that we made a world that could do that kind of trade and create massive gdp growth we
5779040	5785200	could all work together to be able to mine natural resources and grow stuff with the rapid gdp growth
5785200	5789440	there was the idea that everybody could keep having more without having to take each other stuff
5790480	5795920	and so that that was part of kind of the the breton woods post world war two model the other was
5795920	5799680	that we would be so economically interdependent that blowing each other up would never make sense
5799760	5809200	that worked for a while now it also brought us up into planetary boundaries faster the
5809920	5814720	unrenovable use of resource and turning those resources into pollution on the other side of
5814720	5822400	the supply chain so obviously that faster gdp growth meant uh the overfishing of the oceans
5822400	5828000	and the cutting down of the trees and the climate change and the uh mining toxic mining tailings
5828000	5831920	going into the water and the mountaintop removal mining and all those types of things that's the
5831920	5838080	overall consumption side of the of the risk that we're talking about and so the answer of let's do
5838080	5846880	positive gdp is the answer rapidly and exponentially obviously accelerated the planetary boundary side
5846880	5851600	and that started to be that that was thought about for a long time but it started to be modeled
5851600	5859440	with the club of rome and limits of growth um and it but it's just very obvious to say if you
5859440	5864080	have a linear materials economy where you take stuff out of the earth faster whether it's fish or
5864080	5868720	trees or or or and you take or oil and you take it out of the earth faster than it can replenish
5868720	5873760	itself and you turn it into trash after using it for a short period of time you put the trash in
5873760	5878880	the environment faster than it can process itself and there's toxicity associated with both sides
5878880	5884960	of this you can't run an exponentially growing linear materials economy on a finite planet forever
5884960	5889920	that's not a hard thing to figure out and it has to be exponential if there's an exponentiation
5889920	5895680	the monetary supply because of interest and then fractional reserve banking and to then be able to
5895680	5899760	keep up with the growing monetary supply you have to have growth of goods and services and so that's
5899760	5906960	that kind of thing that has happened um but you also see that when you get these supply chains
5906960	5911600	that are so interconnected across the world you get increased fragility because a a collapse or
5911600	5915760	problem in one area then affects the whole world in a much bigger area as opposed to the issues
5915760	5922640	being local right so we got to see with covid and an issue that started in one part of china
5922640	5928480	affecting the whole world so much more rapidly than would have happened before breton woods right
5928480	5933120	before international travel supply chains you know that whole kind of thing and with a bunch of
5933120	5936000	second and third order effects that people wouldn't have predicted okay we have to stop
5936800	5943360	certain kinds of travel because of viral contaminants but the countries doing agriculture depend upon
5943360	5946960	fertilizer they don't produce that is shipped into them and depend upon pesticides they don't
5946960	5952240	produce so we got both crop failures and crops being eaten by locusts in scale in northern
5952240	5955680	africa and iran and things like that because they couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so then you
5955680	5962160	get massive starvation or future kind of hunger issues because of supply chain shutdowns so you
5962160	5967360	get this increased fragility and cascade dynamics where a small problem can end up leading to cascade
5967360	5979440	effects and also we went from two superpowers with one catastrophe weapon to now that same
5979440	5987040	catastrophe weapon is there's more countries that have it eight or nine countries that have it and
5987040	5992480	there's a lot more types of catastrophe weapons we now have catastrophe weapons with
5992480	5997440	weaponized drones that can hit infrastructure targets with bio with in fact every new type of
5997440	6003440	tech has created an arms race so we have not with the un or the other kind of intergovernmental
6003440	6008560	organizations we haven't been able to really do nuclear deproliferation we've actually had more
6008560	6013600	countries get nukes and keep getting faster nukes the race to hypersonics and things like that
6014320	6021520	um and every new type of technology that has emerged has created an arms race and so you
6021520	6026000	can't do mutually assured destruction with multiple agents the way you can with two agents
6026640	6032080	two agents it's a much easier to create a stable Nash equilibrium that's forced but the ability
6032080	6036480	to modern say if these guys shoot who do i shoot do i shoot them do i shoot everybody do i and so
6036480	6040720	you get a three-body problem you get a very complex type of thing when you have multiple agents and
6040800	6044880	multiple different types of catastrophe weapons including ones that can be much more easily
6044880	6048320	produced than nukes nukes are really hard to produce there's only uranium in a few areas
6048320	6054800	uranium enrichment is hard icbm's are hard but weaponized drones hitting smart targets is not
6054800	6058640	so hard there's a lot of other things where basically the scale at being able to manufacture
6058640	6064400	them is going way way down to where even non-state actors can have them and so when we talk about
6064880	6070160	exponential tech and the decentralization of exponential tech what that means is
6070160	6076400	decentralized catastrophe weapon capacity and especially in a world of increasing numbers of
6076400	6084960	people feeling disenfranchised frantic whatever for different reasons so uh i would say where the
6084960	6089440	Bretton Woods world doesn't prepare us to be able to deal with lots of different agents having
6089440	6093520	lots of different types of catastrophe weapons you can't put mutually assured destruction on
6093520	6098960	where you can't keep doing growth of the materials economy in the same way because
6098960	6104320	of hitting planetary boundaries and where the fragility dynamics are actually now their own
6104320	6109200	source of catastrophic risk so now we're so like there was all the world until world war two and
6109200	6113440	world war two is just from a from a civilization timescale point of view is just a second ago
6114400	6118560	it seems like a long time but it is really not we get a short period of relative peace at the
6118560	6122560	level of superpowers while building up the military capacity for much much much worse
6122560	6129040	war the entire time and then now we're at this new phase where the things that allowed us to make
6129040	6133760	it through the nuclear power are not the same systems that will let us make it through the next
6133760	6142240	stage so what is this next post Bretton Woods how how do we become safe vessels safe stewards
6143040	6149200	of many different types of exponential technology is uh a key question when we're thinking about
6149200	6158160	x-risk okay so and i'd like to try to answer the how a few thought a few ways but first
6158160	6166000	on the mutually assured destruction do you give credit to the idea of two superpowers
6167200	6172320	not blowing each other up with nuclear weapons to the simple game theoretic model of mutually
6172320	6178960	assured destruction or something you've said previously this idea of inverse correlation
6178960	6186480	which i tend to believe between the now you were talking about tech but i think it's
6187120	6194160	maybe broadly true the inverse correlation between competence and propensity for destruction so
6195120	6202080	the better the the the bigger your weapons not because you're afraid of mutually assured
6202080	6208880	self-destruction but because we're human beings and there's a deep moral fortitude there that's
6208880	6214880	somehow aligned with competence and being good at your job that like it's very hard to be uh
6215200	6226880	a psychopath and be good at killing at scale is do you share any of that intuition kind of
6228640	6233360	i think most people would say that alexander the great and gang is con and napoli and were
6233360	6239920	effective people that were good at their job uh that were actually maybe asymmetrically
6240880	6246720	good at being able to organize people and do certain kinds of things that were
6247600	6251920	pretty oriented towards certain types of destruction or pretty willing to
6252960	6256080	maybe they would say they were oriented towards empire expansion but pretty willing to
6256640	6261680	commit certain acts of destruction in the name of it what are you worried about the gang is con
6262640	6270240	or you could argue he's not a psychopath uh that are you worried about gang is con are you
6270240	6278080	worried about hitler are you worried about a terrorist who is has a very different ethic which
6278080	6287520	is not even for uh it's not trying to preserve and build and expand my community it's more about
6287520	6294240	just destruction in itself is the goal i think the thing that you're looking at that i do agree
6294240	6300880	with is that there's a psychological disposition towards construction right and a psychological
6300880	6305120	disposition more towards destruction obviously everybody has both and can toggle between both
6305840	6310480	and oftentimes one is willing to destroy certain things we have this idea of creative destruction
6310480	6315920	right willing to destroy certain things to create other things and utilitarianism and trolley
6315920	6321280	problems are all about exploring that space and the idea of war is all about that and i am trying
6321280	6325840	to create something for our people and it requires destroying some other people um
6328560	6333920	sociopathy is a funny topic because it's possible to have very high fealty to your in group and work
6333920	6339600	on perfecting the methods of torture to the out group um at the same time because you can dehumanize
6339600	6350480	and then remove empathy um and i would also say that there are types so the reason the thing that
6350480	6356080	gives hope about the orientation towards construction and destruction being a little different in
6356080	6362560	psychologies is what it takes to build really catastrophic tech even today where it doesn't
6362560	6368240	take what it took to make a new a small group people could do it takes still some real technical
6368240	6374000	knowledge that required having studied for a while and some then building capacity and
6374640	6379040	there's a question of is that psychologically inversely correlated with the desire to
6380160	6389440	damage civilization meaningfully uh a little bit a little bit i think um i think a lot i think
6389440	6394960	it's actually i mean this is the conversation i had like what i think offline with dan carlin
6395920	6402240	which is like it's pretty easy to come up with ways that any competent like i can come up with a
6402240	6408240	lot of ways to hurt a lot of people and it's pretty easy like i alone could do it and
6410640	6416960	like there's a lot of people as smarter smarter than me at least in the creation of explosives
6417920	6424400	why are we not seeing more insane mass murder i i think there's something
6425520	6432880	fascinating and beautiful about this yes and it does have to do with some deeply pro-social types
6432880	6440960	of characteristics in humans and um but when you're dealing with very large numbers you don't
6440960	6445760	need a whole lot of a phenomena and so then you start to say well what's the probability that x
6445760	6450720	won't happen this year then won't happen in the next two years three years four years and then how
6450720	6454960	many people are doing destructive things with lower tech and then how many of them can get
6454960	6462080	access to higher tech that they didn't have to figure out how to build so uh when i can get
6462080	6467840	commercial tech and maybe i don't understand tech very well but i understand it well enough to
6467840	6475200	utilize it not to create it and i can repurpose it when we saw that commercial drone with a homemade
6475280	6480320	thermite bomb hit the ukraine ukrainian munitions factory and do the equivalent of an incendiary
6480320	6489200	bomb level of damage that's just home tech that's just simple kind of thing and so the question is
6489200	6496000	not what is does it stay being a small percentage of the population the question is does can you
6496000	6505040	bind that phenomena nearly completely and especially now when you as you start to get into
6505040	6511440	bigger things crisper gene drive technologies and various things like that um can you bind it
6511440	6518160	completely long term over what period of time not perfectly though that's the thing i'm trying i'm
6518160	6526880	trying to say that there is some let's call it uh let's uh a random word love that's inherent in
6527920	6535760	that's core to human nature that's preventing destruction at scale and you're saying yeah
6535760	6541120	but there's a lot of humans there's going to be eight plus billion and then there's a lot of seconds
6541120	6546640	in the day to come up with stuff there's a lot of pain in the world that can lead to uh distorted
6546640	6551120	view of the world such that you want to channel that pain into the destruction all those kinds of
6551120	6556080	things and it's only a matter of time that anyone individual can do large damage especially as we
6556720	6563120	create uh more and more democratized decentralized ways to deliver that damage even if you don't
6563120	6570560	know how to build the initial weapon you can but the thing is it seems like it's a race between
6570560	6580960	the cheapening of destructive weapons and the capacity of humans to express their love
6581680	6589760	towards each other and it's a race that's so far i know on twitter you it's not popular to say but
6589760	6596800	love is winning okay so what is the argument that love is going to lose here against nuclear
6596800	6606080	weapons of biotech and and ai and uh and drones okay i'm gonna comment the end of this to a how
6606080	6611600	love wins so i just want you to know that that's where i'm oriented that's the end but i'm i'm
6611600	6620160	gonna argue against why that is a given because it because it's not a given i don't believe and
6620160	6625520	i think this is like a good romantic comedy so you're gonna create drama right now but it will
6625520	6629760	end with a happy ending well it's because it's only a happy ending if we actually understand
6629760	6634480	the issues well enough and take responsibility to shift it do i believe like there's a reason why
6634480	6640080	there's so much more dystopic sci-fi than protopic sci-fi and the in the summer protopic sci-fi
6640080	6648240	usually requires magic is because or at least magical tech right dilithium crystals and warp
6648240	6654720	drives and stuff because it's very hard to imagine people like the people we have been in the history
6654720	6664160	books with exponential type technology and power that don't eventually blow themselves up they
6664160	6668800	make good enough choices as stewards of their environment and their comments and and each
6668800	6673120	other and etc so like it's easier to think of scenarios where we blow ourselves up than it
6673120	6676640	is to think of scenarios where we avoid every single scenario where we blow ourselves up and
6676640	6681680	when i say blow ourselves up i also i mean the environmental versions the terrorist versions
6681680	6689920	the war versions the cumulative externalities versions um can i and i'm sorry if i'm interrupting
6689920	6696480	your flow of thought but why is it easier is it could it be a weird psychological thing where we
6696480	6702400	either i was just more capable to visualize explosions and destruction and then the sicker
6702400	6706960	thought which is like we kind of enjoy for some weird reason thinking about that kind of stuff
6706960	6712480	even though we wouldn't actually act on it it's almost like some weird uh like i love playing
6712480	6718560	shooter games you know uh first person shooters and like especially if it's like murdering zombie
6718560	6724800	and doom you're shooting demons i play one of my favorite games diabolus like slashing through
6724800	6730320	different monsters and the screaming and pain and the hellfire and then i go out into the real world
6730880	6733840	to eat my coconut ice cream and i'm all about love so like i
6735360	6741200	can we trust our ability to visualize how all it all goes to shit as an actual rational way of
6741200	6748720	thinking i think it's a fair question to say to what degree is there just kind of perverse fantasy
6748720	6754720	and um morbid exploration and whatever else that happens in our imagination uh
6755280	6762080	but i don't think that's the whole of it i think there is also a reality to the combinatorial
6762080	6767680	possibility space and the difference in the probabilities that there's a lot of ways i could
6767680	6773440	try to put the 70 trillion cells of your body together that don't make you there's not that
6773440	6776800	many ways i can put them together that make you there's a lot of ways i could try to connect the
6776800	6782480	organs together that make some weird kind of group of organs on a on a desk but that doesn't
6782560	6788560	actually make a functioning human and and you can kill an adult human in a second but you
6788560	6793040	can't get one in a second takes 20 years to grow one and a lot of things to happen right i could
6793040	6799360	destroy this building in a couple minutes with demolition but it took a year or a couple years
6799360	6806320	to build it there is uh calm down co this is just an example it's not he doesn't mean it
6806480	6814320	there's a there's a gradient where entropy is easier and that there's a lot more ways to
6814320	6818800	put a set of things together that don't work than the few that really do produce higher order
6818800	6830800	synergies and so when we look at a history of war and then we look at exponentially more powerful
6830800	6834480	warfare an arms race that drives that in all these directions and when we look at a history
6834480	6838320	of environmental destruction and exponentially more powerful tech that makes exponential
6838320	6842240	externalities multiplied by the total number of agents that are doing it in the cumulative
6842240	6847680	effects there's a lot of ways the whole thing can break like a lot of different ways and for
6847680	6854960	it to get ahead it has to have none of those happen and so there's just a probability space
6854960	6860000	where it's easier to imagine that thing so what so to say how do we have a pro-topic future we
6860000	6866080	have to say well one criteria must be that it avoids all of the catastrophic risks so can we
6866080	6870000	understand can we inventory all the catastrophic risks can we inventory the patterns of human
6870000	6876480	behavior that give rise to them and could we try to solve for that and could we have that be the
6876480	6881200	the essence of the social technology that we're thinking about to be able to guide bind and
6881200	6886240	direct a new physical technology because so far our physical technology like we were talking about
6886240	6891760	the Genghis Khan's and like that that obviously use certain kinds of physical technology and armaments
6892320	6898080	and also social technology and unconventional warfare for a particular set of purposes but
6898080	6905280	we have things that don't look like warfare like Rockefeller and Standard Oil and it looked like a
6905280	6914080	constructive mindset to be able to bring this new energy resource to the world and it did and the
6914160	6921840	second order effects of that are climate change and all of the oil spills that have happened and
6921840	6928800	will happen and all of the wars in the Middle East over the oil that have been there and the
6928800	6934480	massive political clusterfuck and human life issues that are associated with it and on and on
6934480	6944240	right um and so it's also not just the orientation to construct a thing can have a narrow focus on
6944240	6948080	what I'm trying to construct but be affecting a lot of other things through second and third order
6948080	6954880	effects I'm not taking responsibility for and you you often another tangent mentioned second
6954880	6962480	third and fourth order effects and order and cascading which is really fascinating like starting
6962480	6970160	with the third order plus it gets really interesting because we don't we don't even acknowledge
6970160	6976000	like the second order effects right but like thinking because those it could get bigger and
6976000	6981360	bigger and bigger in ways we're not anticipating so how do we make those so it sounds like part of the
6983280	6988480	part of the thing that you are thinking through in terms of a solution how to create
6988560	6994640	an anti fragile a resilient society is to make explicit
6996480	7002880	acknowledge understand the externalities the second order third order fourth order and the
7002880	7009360	order effects how do we start to think about those effects yeah the war application is harm
7009360	7014880	we're trying to cause or that we're aware we're causing right um the externality is harm that
7014880	7019920	at least supposedly we're not aware we're causing or at minimum it's not our intention right maybe
7019920	7023840	we're either totally unaware of it or we're aware of it but it is a side effect of what our
7023840	7029520	intention is it's not the intention itself there are catastrophic risks from both types the direct
7029520	7037200	application of increased technological power to a rival risk intent which is going to cause
7037200	7041440	harm for some out group for some in group to win but the out group is also working on growing the
7041440	7046080	tech and if they don't lose completely they reverse engineer the tech upregulated come back
7046080	7053360	with more capacity so there's the exponential tech arms race side of in group out group rivalry
7053360	7060480	using exponential tech that is one set of risks and the other set of risks is the application of
7061040	7067280	exponentially more powerful tech not intentionally to try and beat an out group but to try to achieve
7067280	7072880	some goal that we have but to produce a second and third order effects that do have harm to
7073600	7081040	the commons to other people to environment to other groups uh that might actually be bigger
7081040	7084160	problems than the problem we were originally trying to solve with the thing we were building
7085200	7091520	when facebook was building a dating app and then building a social app where people could tag pictures
7091680	7101360	they weren't trying to build a democracy destroying app uh that would maximize time on site
7102320	7108560	as part of its ad model through ai optimization of a news feed to the thing that made people spend
7108560	7113120	most time on site which is usually them being limbically hijacked more than something else
7113120	7118240	which ends up appealing to people's cognitive biases and group identities and creates no
7118240	7121920	sense of shared reality they weren't trying to do that but it was a second order effect
7122880	7130240	and it's a pretty fucking powerful second order effect um and a pretty fast one because the rate
7130240	7136400	of tech is obviously able to get distributed to much larger scale much faster and with a bigger jump
7136400	7140560	in terms of total vertical capacity then that's what it means to get to the verticalizing part
7140560	7148640	of an exponential curve so um just like we can see that oil had these second order environmental
7148640	7155840	effects and also social and political effects war and so much of the whole like the total
7155840	7161920	amount of oil used is has a proportionality to total global gdp and this way we have this you
7161920	7169840	know the petrodollar and um and so the the oil thing also had the externalities of a major
7169840	7175120	aspect of what happened with military industrial complex and things like that so but we can see
7175120	7180400	the same thing with with more current technologies with facebook and google um and and other things
7180960	7187520	so i don't think we can run and the more powerful the tech is we build it for
7188320	7193920	reason x whatever reason x is maybe x is three things maybe it's one thing right we
7194960	7199280	we're doing the oil thing because we want to make cars because it's a better method of individual
7199280	7202240	transportation we're building the facebook thing because we're going to connect people
7202240	7208960	socially in the personal sphere but it it interacts with it interacts with complex systems with
7208960	7214960	ecologies economies psychologies cultures and so it has effects on other than the thing we're
7214960	7221120	intending some of those effects can end up being negative effects but because this technology
7221680	7226560	if if we make it to solve a problem it has to overcome the problem the problem's been around
7226560	7230000	for a while it's going to overcome in a short period of time so it usually has greater scale
7230000	7235440	greater rate of magnitude in some way that also means that the externalities that it creates
7235440	7240400	might be bigger problems and you can say well but then that's the new problem and humanity will
7240400	7244480	innovate its way out of that well i don't think that's paying attention to the fact that we can't
7244480	7250960	keep up with exponential curves like that nor do finite spaces allow exponential externalities forever
7251920	7258000	and this is why a lot of the smartest people thinking about this are thinking well no i think
7258000	7262880	we're totally screwed and unless we can make a benevolent ai singleton that rules all of us
7264320	7268320	you know guys like boss drum and and others uh thinking in those directions because they're like
7268320	7276800	how do humans try to do multi polarity and make it work and i i have a different answer of what
7276880	7281600	i think it looks like that does have more to do with the love but some applied social
7281600	7287520	tech aligned aligned with love because i have a bunch of really dumb ideas i'd prefer to uh
7287520	7292880	i'd like to hear i'd like to hear some of them first i think the idea i would have is uh to be
7292880	7301760	a bit more rigorous in trying to measure the amount of love you add or subtract from the world
7302480	7309520	in second third fourth fifth order effects it's actually i think especially in the world of tech
7309520	7316880	quite doable you know you just might not like you know the the shareholders may not like that
7316880	7325360	kind of metric but it's pretty easy to measure like that's not even uh i'm perhaps half joking
7325360	7329600	about love but we could talk about just happiness and well-being long-term well-being
7329600	7335040	that's pretty easy from facebook for youtube for all these companies to measure that
7336640	7341120	they do a lot of kinds of surveys they could do i mean there's very simple solutions here
7341120	7347520	that you could just survey how i mean servers are in some sense use useless because they're um
7349440	7354320	a subset of the population you're just trying to get a sense it's very loose kind of understanding
7354320	7359520	but integrated deeply as part of the technology most of our tech is recommender systems most
7359520	7366080	of the sorry net tech uh online interaction is driven by recommender systems that learn
7366720	7372400	very little data about you and use that data based on mostly based on traces of your previous
7372400	7377200	behavior to suggest future things this is how twitter this has facebook works this is how
7378000	7383920	adsense for google adsense works is how netflix youtube work and so on and and for them to just
7383920	7390960	track as opposed to engagement how much you spend in a particular video particular site is also
7390960	7398000	track give you the technology to do self-report of what makes you feel good what makes you grow as
7398000	7408800	a person of what makes you uh you know the best version of yourself the the the the rogan uh idea
7408880	7415600	of the hero of your movie and just add that little bit of information if you you have people you
7415600	7421920	have this like happiness surveys of how you feel about the last five days how would you report
7421920	7426240	your experience you can lay out the set of videos this is kind of fascinating to me i don't know if
7426240	7431280	you ever look at youtube the history of videos you've looked at it's fascinating it's very embarrassing
7431280	7438000	for me like you'll be like a lecture and then like a set of videos that i don't want anyone to know
7438000	7444240	about which is which is which will be like uh i don't know maybe like five videos in a row where
7444240	7448320	it looks like i watched the whole thing which i probably did i bought like how to cook a steak
7448320	7454160	even though or just like the best chefs in the world cooking steaks and i'm just like sitting
7454160	7460240	there watching it for no purpose whatsoever wasting away my life or like funny cat videos are like
7460240	7466560	legit that that's that's an that's always a good one and i could look back and rate which videos
7466560	7473280	made me a better person and not and i mean on a more serious note there's a bunch of conversations
7473280	7478640	podcasts or lectures i've watched which made me a better person and some of them made me a worse
7478640	7485760	person uh quite honestly not for stupid reasons like i feel dumber but because i do have a sense
7485760	7489680	that that started me on a path of um
7489840	7492240	um
7492240	7497840	of not being kind to other people for example i'll give you uh for my own and i'm sorry for
7497840	7503760	rantic but maybe there's some usefulness to this kind of exploration of self when i focus on
7504560	7513520	creating i'm programming on science i become a much deeper thinker and a kinder person to others
7514400	7517760	when i listen to too many a little bit is good but too many
7518640	7527120	podcasts or videos about how how our world is melting down or criticizing ridiculous people
7527120	7533520	the worst of the quote unquote woke for example all there's all these groups that are misbehaving
7533520	7539840	in fascinating ways because they've been corrupted by power the more i watch the more i watch criticism
7540800	7548000	of them the worse i become and i'm aware of this but i'm also aware that for some reason
7548000	7554720	it's pleasant to watch those sometimes and so for for me to be able to self report that to the youtube
7554720	7560400	algorithm to the systems around me and they ultimately try to optimize to make me the best
7560400	7566000	person the best version of myself which i personally believe would make youtube a lot more money
7566000	7570960	because i'd be much more willing to spend time i need to have been given youtube a lot more a lot
7570960	7576880	more of my money that's a that's great for business and great for humanity because it'll make me a
7576880	7585040	kinder person it'll increase the the love quotient the love metric and uh it'll make them a lot of
7585040	7589920	money i feel like everything's aligned and so you you should do that not just for youtube algorithm
7589920	7595600	but also for military strategy and for the to go to war or not because one externality you can think
7595680	7601920	of about going to war which i think we talked about offline is we often go to war with kind of
7601920	7609600	governments with that with not with the people you have to think about the kids of countries
7611840	7619120	that see a soldier and because of what they experience the interaction with the soldier
7619680	7625840	hate is born when you're like eight years old six years old you lose your dad you lose your mom
7626880	7632240	you lose a friend somebody close to you that want to really powerful externality that could be
7632240	7639680	reduced to love positive and negative is uh the hate that's born when you make decisions and that's
7639680	7646160	going to take fruition that that little seed is going to become a tree that then leads to the kind
7646240	7653920	of destruction that we talk about so but in my sense it's possible to reduce everything to
7653920	7661920	measure of how much love does this add to the world all that to say do you have ideas of how we
7661920	7671120	practically build systems that that that create a resilient society there are a lot of good things
7671120	7676480	that you shared where there's like 15 different ways that we could enter this that are all
7676480	7681760	interesting so i'm trying to see which one will probably be most useful pick the the one or two
7681760	7689920	things that are least ridiculous when you're mentioning if we could see some of the second
7689920	7694240	order effects or externalities that we aren't used to seeing specifically the one of a kid
7694240	7698720	being radicalized somewhere else which engenders enmity and them towards us which decreases our
7698720	7702480	own future security even if you don't care about the kid if you care about the kids the whole other
7702480	7710480	thing um yeah i mean i think when we saw this when jane fonda and others went to vietnam and took
7711040	7715360	photos and videos of what was happening and you got to see the pictures of the kids with napalm on
7715360	7722960	them uh that like the anti-war effort was bolstered by that in a way it couldn't have been without
7722960	7729440	that there's there's a until we can see the images you can't have a mere neuron effect in the same
7729440	7735200	way and when you can that starts to have a powerful effect i think there's a deep principle that you're
7735200	7746160	sharing there which is that if we we can have a rival risk intent where our in group whatever it is
7746160	7751280	maybe it's our political party wanting to win within the u.s maybe it's our nation state wanting to
7751280	7758080	win in a a war or an economic war over resource or whatever it is that if we don't obliterate the
7758080	7764000	other people completely they don't go away they're they're not engendered to like us more
7765280	7769840	they're they didn't become less smart so they have more enmity towards us and whatever technologies
7769840	7775280	we employed to be successful they will now reverse engineer make iterations on and come back
7775280	7782160	and so you you drive in arms race which is why you can see that the wars were over history
7782160	7791200	employing more lethal weaponry and not just the kinetic war um the information war and the narrative
7791200	7798160	war and the economic war right like it's just increased capacity in all of those fronts um
7798160	7804400	and so what seems like a win to us on the short term might actually really produce losses in
7804400	7808560	the long term and what's even in our own best interest in the long term is probably more aligned
7808560	7813120	with everyone else because we inter-affect each other and I think the thing about globalism
7813680	7818080	globalization and exponential tech and the rate at which we affect each other and the rate at which
7818080	7825360	we affect the biosphere that we're all affected by is that this this kind of proverbial spiritual
7825360	7830800	idea that we're all interconnected and need to think about that in some way that was easy for
7830800	7836000	tribes to get because everyone in the tribe so clearly saw their interconnection independence
7836000	7843520	on each other but in terms of a global level the the speed at which we are actually interconnected
7843520	7849040	the speed at which the harm happening to something in Wuhan affects the rest of the world or a new
7849040	7852880	technology developed somewhere affects the entire world or an environmental issue or whatever
7853600	7859120	is making it to where we either actually all get not as a spiritual idea just even as physics
7859120	7864000	right we all get to the interconnectedness of everything and that we either all consider that
7864000	7869520	and see how to make it through more effectively together or failures anywhere in that becoming
7870080	7873760	decreased quality of life and failures and increased risk everywhere don't you think people
7873760	7878640	are beginning to experience that at the individual level so governments are resisting it they're
7878640	7882560	trying to make us not empathize with each other feel connected but don't you think people are
7882560	7887680	beginning to feel more and more connected like isn't that exactly what the technology is enabling
7887760	7893760	like social networks we tend to criticize them but isn't there a sense which we're
7894320	7899840	experiencing you know when you watch those videos that are criticizing whether it's
7900480	7908000	the woke antifa side or the QAnon Trump supporter side does it seem like they
7908000	7913200	have increased empathy for people that are outside of their ideology camp not at all so I may be
7914160	7919760	I may be conflating my own experience of the world and that of
7922320	7926080	that of the populace I I tend to see those videos
7928400	7933600	as feeding something that's a relic of the past they figured out that drama
7934240	7942400	fuels clicks but whether I'm right or wrong I don't know but I tend to sense that that is not
7943360	7948560	that hunger for drama is not fundamental to human beings that we want to actually
7950240	7957120	that we want to understand antifa and we want to like empathize we want to take radical ideas
7957120	7966960	and be able to empathize with them and synthesize it all okay let's look at cultural outliers
7967840	7973840	in terms of violence versus compassion we can see that a lot of cultures have
7974800	7979680	relatively lower in-group violence bigger out-group violence and there's some variants in
7979680	7983360	them and variants of different times based on the scarcity or abundance of resource and other things
7984320	7992000	but you can look at say janes whose whole religion is around non-violence so much
7992080	7995760	so that they don't even hurt plants they only take fruits that fall off them and stuff
7996480	8002000	or to go to a larger population you take buddhists where for the most part with a few exceptions
8002000	8007040	for the most part across three millennia and across lots of different countries and geographies and
8007040	8014240	whatever you have 10 million people plus or minus who don't hurt bugs the whole spectrum of genetic
8014240	8019920	variants that is happening within a culture of that many people and head traumas and whatever
8020000	8025440	and nobody hurts bugs and then you look at a group where the kids grew up as child soldiers
8025440	8030720	in libiria or darfur were to make it to adulthood pretty much everybody's killed people hand to hand
8031520	8038000	and killed people who were civilian or innocent type of people and you say okay so we were very
8038000	8044000	neoteness we can be conditioned by our environment and humans can be conditioned where almost all
8044000	8047680	the humans show up in these two different bell curves it doesn't mean that the buddhists had no
8047680	8051520	violence it doesn't mean that these people had no compassion but the they're very different
8051520	8059600	Gaussian distributions and so I think one of the important things that I like to do is look at
8059600	8064800	the examples of the populations what buddhism shows regarding compassion or what
8066960	8071440	Judaism shows around education the average level of education that everybody gets because of a
8071440	8076960	culture that is really working on conditioning it or various cultures what are the positive deviants
8077840	8084320	outside of this statistical deviants to see what is actually possible and then say what are the
8084320	8089040	conditioning factors and can we condition those across a few of them simultaneously and could
8089040	8094560	we build a civilization like that becomes a very interesting question so there's this kind of real
8094560	8101200	politic idea that humans are violent large groups of humans become violent they become
8101200	8106240	irrational specifically those two things rivalrous and violent and irrational and so in order to
8106240	8110720	minimize the total amount of violence and have some good decisions they need ruled somehow and
8110720	8115680	that not getting that is some kind of naive utopianism that doesn't understand human nature
8115680	8122000	yet this gets back to like mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing I think the idea of the masses
8122000	8127760	is actually a kind of propaganda that is useful for the classes that control
8128000	8138080	um to popularize the idea that most people are too violent lazy undisciplined and irrational
8138080	8143760	to make good choices and therefore their choices should be sublimated in some kind of way I think
8143760	8150000	that if we look back at these conditioning environments we can say okay so the kids
8150960	8158720	they go to a really fancy school and have a good developmental environment like Exeter Academy
8159440	8162720	there's still a Gaussian distribution of how well they do on any particular metric
8163280	8169040	but on average they become senators and the worst ones become high-end lawyers or whatever
8169040	8172720	and then I look at an inner city school with a totally different set of things and I see a very
8172720	8176240	very differently displaced Gaussian distribution but a very different set of conditioning factors
8176240	8180560	so then I say the masses well if all those kids who were one of the parts of the masses got to
8180560	8186000	go to Exeter and have that family and whatever would they still be the masses um could we actually
8186000	8193360	condition more social virtue more civic virtue more orientation towards dialectical synthesis
8193360	8203120	more empathy more rationality widely yes would that lead to better capacity for something like
8203200	8207840	participatory governance democracy or republic or some kind of participatory governance
8207840	8217920	yes yes is it necessary for it actually yes and is it good for class interests not not really
8219200	8222720	by the way when you say class interest this is the powerful leading over the
8223280	8228560	less powerful that kind of idea anyone that benefits from asymmetries of power
8228560	8235920	or doesn't necessarily benefit from decreasing those asymmetries of power and kind of increasing
8235920	8246800	the capacity of people more widely and so when we talk about power we're talking about asymmetries
8246800	8252560	in agency influence and control you think that hunger for power is fundamental to human nature
8253360	8256240	I think we should get that straight before we talk about other stuff so like
8257120	8264080	this this this pickup line that I use at a bar off which is power crops and absolute power crops
8264080	8270640	absolutely is that true or is that just a fancy thing to say in modern society there's something
8270640	8278560	to be said have we changed as societies over time in terms of how much we crave power that there is
8278640	8284320	an impulse towards power that is innate in people and can be conditioned one way or the other yes
8284320	8289360	but you can see that Buddhist society does a very different thing with it at scale that you don't
8289360	8297200	end up seeing the emergence of the same types of sociopathic behavior and particularly then
8297200	8307040	creating sociopathic institutions and so it's like is eating the foods that were rare in our
8307040	8310880	evolutionary environment to give us more dopamine hit because they were rare and they're not anymore
8310880	8316560	salt fat sugar is there something pleasurable about those where humans have an orientation
8316560	8321680	to overeat if they can well the fact that there is that possibility doesn't mean everyone will
8321680	8328480	obligately be obese and I have obesity right like it's possible to have a particular impulse and to
8328480	8336400	be able to understand it have other ones and be able to balance them and so to say that power
8336400	8342080	dynamics are are obligate in humans and we can't do anything about it is very similar to me to saying
8342080	8347920	like we could everyone is going to be obligately obese yeah so there's some degree to which those
8347920	8352880	the control those impulses has to do with the conditioning early in life yes and the culture
8353600	8358240	that creates the environment to be able to do that and then the recursion on that okay so what
8358880	8364480	if we were to uh bear with me just asking for a friend if we were to kill all humans on earth
8365440	8366480	and then start over
8369280	8374240	is their ideas about how to build up okay we don't have to kill let's leave the humans on earth
8374240	8381120	they're fine and go to mars and start a new society is there ways to construct systems of
8381120	8391760	conditioning education of how we live with each other that would that would incentivize us properly
8392720	8396560	to not seek power not to not construct systems that are
8397520	8403280	of asymmetry of power and to create systems that are resilient to all kinds of terrorist attacks
8403280	8410880	to the all kinds of destructions I believe so so is there some inklings we get of course you
8410880	8416240	probably don't have the ant all the answers but you have insights about what that looks like I mean
8416240	8423440	is it just rigorous practice of dialectic synthesis as essentially conversations with assholes of
8423440	8428480	various flavors until they're not assholes anymore because you've become a deeply empathetic with
8428480	8436560	their experience okay so there's a lot of things that we would need to construct to come back to
8436560	8443600	this like what is the basis of rivalry what how do you bind it how does it relate to tech if you
8443600	8448880	have a culture that is doing less rivalry does it always lose in war to those who do war better and
8448880	8454160	how do you make something on the enactment of how to get there from here great great so what's
8454160	8461280	rivalry why is is rivalry bad or good is so is another word for rivalry competition
8462640	8471040	yes I think roughly yes I think bad and good are kind of silly concepts here good for some
8471120	8478960	things bad for other things for some contexts and others even that okay let me give you an example
8478960	8484240	that relates back to the facebook measuring thing you were mentioning a moment ago first
8484240	8487920	I think what you're saying is actually aligned with the right direction and what I want to get
8487920	8495600	to in a moment but it's not the devil is in the details here so I enjoy praise feeds my ego I grow
8495680	8500880	stronger so I appreciate that I will make sure to include one piece every 15 minutes as we go thank you
8502240	8508160	so it's easier to measure
8511280	8515040	there are problems with this argument but there's also utility to it so let's take it
8515040	8521920	for the utility it has first it's harder to measure happiness than it is to measure comfort
8522480	8530800	uh we can measure with technology that the shocks in a car are making the car bounce less that the
8530800	8537680	bed is um softer and you know material science and those types of things and happiness is actually
8537680	8544240	hard for philosophers to define because some people find that there's certain kinds of overcoming
8544240	8547920	suffering that are necessary for happiness there's happiness it feels more like contentment and
8547920	8551680	happiness it feels more like passion does is passion the source of all suffering or the
8551680	8555920	source of all creativity like that there's deep stuff and it's mostly first person not
8555920	8560640	measurable third person stuff even if maybe it corresponds to third person stuff to some degree
8560640	8565200	but we also see examples of some of our favorite examples as people who are in the worst environments
8565200	8569440	who end up finding happiness right where the third person stuff looks to be less conducive and there's
8569440	8575840	some victor frankle nelson mendela whatever um but it's pretty easy to measure comfort and it's
8575840	8581600	pretty universal and i think we can see that the industrial revolution started to replace happiness
8581600	8586640	with comfort quite heavily as the thing it was optimizing for and we can see that when increased
8586640	8592880	comfort is given maybe because of the evolutionary disposition that expending extra calories when
8592880	8597680	for the majority of our history we didn't have extra calories was not a safe thing to do who knows
8597680	8604800	why um when extra comfort is given it's very easy to take that path even if it's not the
8605520	8613680	path that supports overall well-being long-term and um so we can see that you know when you when
8613680	8620320	you look at the techno-optimist idea that we have better lives than egyptian pharaohs and kings and
8620320	8626560	whatever what they're largely looking at is how comfortable our beds are and how comfortable
8626560	8630240	the transportation systems are and things like that in which case is massive improvement but
8630240	8634640	we also see that in some of the nations where people have access to the most comfort suicide
8634640	8640720	and mental illness are the highest and we also see that some of the happiest cultures are actually
8640720	8645520	some of the ones that are in materially lame environments and so there's a very interesting
8645520	8651600	question here and if i understand correctly you do cold showers and joe rogan was talking about how
8651600	8659040	he needs to do some fairly intensive kind of um struggle that is a non-comfort to actually induce
8659040	8666240	being better as a person this concept of hormesis that it's actually stressing an adaptive system
8666240	8672400	that increases its adaptive capacity and that there's something that the happiness of a system has
8672400	8676960	something to do with its adaptive capacity its overall resilience health well-being which requires
8676960	8684880	a decent bit of discomfort and yet in the in the presence of the comfort solution it's very hard to
8684880	8689280	not choose it and then as you're choosing it regularly to actually down regulate your overall
8689280	8700400	adaptive capacity and so when we start saying can we make tech where we're measuring for the things
8700400	8706640	that it produces beyond just the measure of gdp or whatever particular measures look like the
8706640	8713840	revenue generation or profit generation of my business are all the meaningful things measurable
8715680	8720400	and what are the right measures and what are the externalities of optimizing for that
8720400	8724080	measurement set what meaningful things aren't included in that measurement set that might
8724080	8728080	have their own externalities these are some of the questions we actually have to take seriously
8728080	8733520	yeah and we i think they're answerable questions right progressively better not perfect right so
8734000	8737520	so first of all let me throw out happiness and comfort out of the discussion those
8737520	8743440	seem like useless the distinction so i because i said they're useful well-being is useful but
8743440	8752800	i think i take it back i knew i proposed new metrics in this brainstorm session which is
8754080	8762800	so one is like personal growth which is intellectual growth i think we're able to
8762800	8770560	make that concrete for ourselves like you're a better person than you were a week ago or a
8770560	8776880	worse person than you were a week ago i think we can ourselves report that and and and understand
8776880	8781760	what that means it's this gray area and we try to define it but i think we humans are pretty
8781760	8786480	good at that because we have a sense an idealistic sense of the person we might be able to become
8786480	8791440	we we all dream of becoming a certain kind of person and i think we have a sense of getting
8791440	8797680	closer and not towards that person maybe this is not a great metric fine the other one is love
8797680	8805120	actually fuck if you're happy or not or you're comfortable or not how much love do you have
8805120	8810560	towards your fellow human beings i feel like if you try to optimize that and increasing that that's
8810560	8819280	going to have that's a good metric how many times a day sorry if i can make quantify how many times
8819280	8824000	a day have you thought positively of another human being just put that down as a number
8824640	8832720	and increase that number i think the process of saying okay so let's not take gdp or gdp per
8832720	8837360	capita is the metric we want to optimize for because gdp goes up during war and it goes up with
8837360	8841200	more healthcare spending from sicker people and various things that we wouldn't say correlate
8841200	8847520	to quality of life addiction drives gdp awesomely um by the way when i said growth i wasn't referring
8848080	8852720	i know i'm give i'm giving an example now of the primary metric we use and why it's not
8852720	8857200	an adequate metric and because we're exploring other ones so the idea of saying what would the
8857200	8864000	metrics for a good civilization be if i had to pick a set of metrics what would the best ones be
8864000	8870160	if i was going to optimize for those and then really try to run the thought experiment more deeply
8870160	8876240	and say okay so what happens if we optimize for that try to think through the first and second
8876480	8881840	third order effects of what happens it's positive and then also say what negative things can happen
8881840	8886640	from optimizing that what actually matters that is not included in that or in that way of defining
8886640	8891680	it because love versus number of positive thoughts per day i could just make a long list of names
8891680	8896720	and just think say positive thing about each one it's all very superficial not include animals
8896720	8901840	with the rest of life have a have a very shallow total amount of it but i'm optimizing the number
8901840	8906560	if i get some credit for the number so the and this is when i said the model of reality isn't
8906560	8913440	reality when you make a set of metrics they were going to optimize for this whatever reality is
8913440	8918560	that is not included in those metrics can be the areas where harm occurs which is why i would say
8918560	8931120	that wisdom is something like the discernment that leads to right choices beyond what metrics-based
8931120	8943040	optimization would offer yeah but another way to say that is wisdom is uh constantly expanding
8943040	8949200	an evolving set of metrics which means that there is something in you that is recognizing a new
8949200	8953760	metric that's important that isn't part of that metric set so there's a certain kind of connection
8953760	8960240	discernment awareness and this is an iterative game theory there's a girdles and completeness
8960240	8964240	theorem right which is if the system if the set of things is consistent it won't be complete so
8964240	8968880	we're going to keep adding to it which is why we were saying earlier i don't think it's not beautiful
8970000	8973200	and especially if you were just saying one of the metrics you want to optimize for at the individual
8973200	8977280	level is becoming right that we're becoming more well that's then becomes true for the civilization
8977280	8982480	and our metrics as well yeah and our definition of how to think about a meaningful life and a
8982480	8986960	meaningful civilization i can tell you what some of my favorite metrics are what's that
8990720	8995440	well love is obviously not a metric it's like you could bench yeah it's a good metric yeah i want
8995440	9004400	to optimize that across the entire population starting with infants um so in the same way that
9004400	9007840	love isn't a metric but you could make metrics that look at certain parts of it the thing i'm
9007840	9012240	about to say isn't a metric but it's a it's a consideration because i thought about this a lot
9012240	9018800	i don't think there is a metric a right one um i think that every metric by itself without this
9018880	9023520	thing we talked about of the continuous improvement becomes a paperclip maximizer i think that's why
9024400	9030080	what the idea of false idle means in terms of the model of reality not being reality then my
9030080	9035360	sacred relationship is to reality itself which also binds me to the unknown forever to the known
9035360	9040080	but also to the unknown and there's a sense of sacredness connected to the unknown that creates
9040080	9044400	an epistemic humility that is always seeking not just to optimize the thing i know but to learn new
9044400	9049680	stuff and to be open to perceive reality directly so my model never becomes sacred my model is useful
9050880	9057120	my so the model can't be the false idle correct yeah and this is why the first verse of the
9057120	9061760	Tao Te Ching is the Tao that is nameable is not the eternal Tao the naming then can become the
9061760	9065600	source of the ten thousand things that if you get too carried away with it can actually obscure you
9065600	9071280	from paying attention to reality beyond in the models it sounds a lot a lot like Stephen Wolf
9071280	9077680	from but in a different language much more poetic i can't imagine that no i'm referring i'm joking
9077680	9082800	but there's echoes of cellular automata which you can't name you can't construct a good model
9082800	9089520	cellular automata you can only watch in awe i apologize i'm distracting your train of thought
9089520	9093600	horribly and miserably making a difference by the way something robots aren't good at
9094320	9099520	and uh dealing with the uncertainty of uneven ground you've been okay so far you've been doing
9099520	9104160	wonderfully so what's your favorite metrics okay so i know you're not so i have a fascinating
9104160	9110640	so one metric and there are problems with this but one metric that i like to just as a thought
9110640	9117760	experiment to consider is because you're actually asking where i mean i know you ask your guests
9118320	9121520	about the meaning of life because ultimately when you're deciding when you're saying what is a
9121520	9127280	desirable civilization you can't answer that without answering what is a meaningful human life and
9127280	9133520	and to say what is a good civilization because it's going to be in relationship to that right um
9136880	9141040	and then you have whatever your answer is how do you know what is the what is the
9141040	9146800	epistemic basis for for postulating that um there's also a whole nother reason for asking
9146800	9152640	that question i don't i mean but that doesn't even apply to you whatsoever which is it's
9153440	9162080	interesting how few people have been asked questions like it we we we joke about these
9162080	9169760	questions is silly right it's it's funny to watch a person and if i was more of an asshole i would
9169760	9176560	really stick on that question right it's a silly question in some sense but like we haven't really
9176560	9181680	considered what it means just a more concrete version of that question is what is what is a
9181680	9186640	better world what is the kind of world we're trying to create really i think well have you
9186640	9191680	really thought okay i'll give you some kind of simple answers to that that are meaningful to me
9192800	9198400	but let me do the societal indices first because they're fun yes we should take a note of this
9198400	9202560	meaningful thing because it's important to come back to um are you reminding me to ask you about
9202560	9210960	the meaning of life noted i know let me jot that down yeah so um well because i think i stopped
9210960	9220240	tracking it like 25 open threads um okay let it all burn one index that i find very interesting is
9220240	9227360	the inverse correlation of addiction within the society the more a society produces addiction
9227360	9233920	within the people in it the less healthy i think the society is as a pretty fundamental metric
9234640	9239280	and so the more the individuals feel that there are less compulsive things
9240240	9244640	in compelling them to behave in ways that are destructive to their own values
9246640	9250720	and in so far as a civilization is conditioning and influencing the individuals within it
9252000	9259920	the inverse of addiction um oddly defined addiction what's yeah compulsive behavior that
9260000	9262400	is destructive towards things that we value
9266800	9270960	yeah i think that's a very interesting one to think about that's a really interesting one yeah
9270960	9274400	and this is then also where comfort and addiction start to get very close
9275360	9280320	and the ability to go in the other direction from addiction is the ability to be exposed
9280320	9286720	to hypernormal stimuli and not go down the path of desensitizing to other stimuli and needing
9286720	9293680	that hypernormal stimuli which does involve a kind of hormesis so i do think the civilization
9293680	9304960	of the future has to create something like ritualized discomfort and um ritualized discomfort
9304960	9311040	yeah i think that's what the sweat lodge and the vision quest and the solo journey and the
9311040	9315600	ayahuasca journey and the sundance were i think it's even a big part of what yoga asana was
9317360	9323680	is to make beings that are resilient and strong they have to overcome some things to make beings
9323680	9328960	that can control their own mind and fear they have to face some fears but we don't want to
9328960	9334160	put everybody in war or real trauma and yet we can see that the most fucked up people we know
9334720	9338800	had childhoods of a lot of trauma but some of the most incredible people we know had childhoods
9338800	9343120	of a lot of trauma whether or not they happen to make it through and overcome that or not
9343120	9349760	so how do we get the benefits of the stealing of character and the resilience and the whatever
9349760	9354640	that happened from the difficulty without traumatizing people a certain kind of ritualized
9355440	9362720	discomfort that not only has us overcome something by ourselves but overcome it together with
9362720	9366400	each other where nobody bails when it gets hard because the other people are there so it's both
9366400	9372240	a resilience of the individuals and a resilience of the bonding so i think we'll keep getting
9372320	9377120	more and more comfortable stuff but we have to also develop resilience in the presence of that
9379280	9384640	for the anti-addiction direction and the fullness of character and the trustworthiness to others
9385600	9390480	so you have to be consistently injecting discomfort into the system ritualize
9391040	9395680	i mean this sounds like uh you have to imagine sycophus happy you have to
9395840	9398720	uh imagine sycophus with this rock
9401040	9409440	optimally resilient from a metrics perspective in society so we want we want to constantly
9409440	9415360	be throwing rocks at ourselves not constantly uh you didn't have to frequently
9417040	9420880	periodically periodically and there's different levels of intensity different
9420880	9426880	period of disease now i do not think this should be imposed by states uh i think it should emerge
9426880	9432240	from cultures and i think the cultures are developing people that understand the value of
9432240	9438800	it so the people so there is both a cultural cohesion to it but there's also a voluntarism
9438800	9442720	because the people value the thing that is being developed they understand it and that's what
9442720	9448480	condition so it's conditioning it's conditioning some of these some of these values and conditioning
9448480	9453360	is a bad word because we like our idea of sovereignty but when we recognize the language
9453360	9458400	that we speak and the words that we think in and the and the patterns of thought built into
9458400	9462720	that language and the aesthetics that we like and so much is conditioned in us just based on
9462720	9467200	where we're born you can't not condition people so all you can do is take more responsibility
9467200	9470640	for what the conditioning factors are and then you have to think about this question of what is a
9470640	9475200	meaningful human life because we're unlike the other animals born into environment that they're
9475200	9479600	genetically adapted for we're building new environments that we were not adapted for and
9479600	9484320	then we're becoming affected by those so then we have to say well what kinds of environments
9484320	9490640	digital environments physical environments social environments would we want to create
9490640	9496880	that would develop the healthiest happiest most moral noble meaningful people and what are even
9496880	9501840	those sets of things that matter so you end up getting deep existential consideration at the
9501840	9506160	heart of civilization design when you start to rise how powerful we're becoming and how much
9506160	9512080	what we're building it in service towards matters before I pull it I think three threads you just
9512080	9516880	lay down is there another metric index a year and I'll tell you one more that I really like
9518720	9522480	there's a there's a number but the one the next one that comes to mind is
9526320	9527760	I have to make a very quick model
9527840	9538480	of healthy human bonding say we were in a tribal type setting my positive emotional states and your
9538480	9543840	positive emotional states would most of the time be correlated your negative emotional states in
9543840	9551840	mind and so you start laughing I start laughing you start crying my eyes might tear up and we would
9551840	9559440	call that the compassion compersion access I would this is a model I find useful so compassion is
9559440	9564240	when you're feeling something negative I feel some pain I feel some empathy something in relationship
9564240	9569200	compersion is when you do well I'm stoked for you right like I actually feel happiness right
9569200	9574640	down I like compersion yeah the fact that it's such an uncommon word in English is actually a
9574640	9579600	problem culturally um because I feel that often and I think that's a really good feeling to feel
9579600	9584480	and maximize for actually that's actually the metric I'm gonna say oh is the compassion
9584480	9590960	compersion at access is the thing I would optimize for now there is a state where my emotional
9590960	9597920	states and your emotional states are just totally decoupled and that is like sociopathy I don't want
9597920	9602240	to hurt you but I don't care if I do or for you to do well or whatever but there's a worse state
9602240	9608080	and it's extremely common which is where they're inversely coupled where my positive emotions
9608080	9614720	correspond to your negative ones and vice versa and that is the I would call it the jealousy
9614720	9621440	sadism access the jealousy access is when you're doing really well I feel something bad I feel
9621440	9632080	taken away from less than upset envious whatever and that's so common but I think of it as kind of
9632080	9638880	a low-grade psychopathology that we've just normalized the idea that I'm actually upset at
9638880	9642480	the happiness or fulfillment or success of another is like a profoundly fucked up thing
9643200	9646960	no we shouldn't shame it and repress it so it gets worse we should study it where does it come
9646960	9652000	from and it comes from our own insecurities and stuff and but then the next part that everybody
9652000	9658400	knows is really fucked up is just on the same axis it's the same inverted which is so the jealousy
9658400	9664240	or the envy is the I feel badly when you're doing well the sadism side is I actually feel good when
9664240	9668480	you lose or when you're in pain I feel some happiness that's associated and you can see when
9668480	9673920	someone feels jealous sometimes they feel jealous with a partner and then they feel they want that
9673920	9680480	partner to get it revenge comes up or something so sadism is really like jealousy is one step on
9680480	9686000	the path to sadism from the healthy compassion conversion access so I would like to see a
9686000	9693440	society that is inversely that is conditioning sadism and jealousy inversely right the lower
9693440	9697760	that amount and the more the compassion conversion and if I had to summarize that very simply I'd
9697760	9705520	say it would optimize for compersion which is because notice that's not just saying love
9705520	9711040	for you where I might be self-sacrificing and miserable and I love people but I kill myself
9711040	9714560	which I don't think anybody thinks a great idea or happiness where I might be sociopathically
9714640	9719600	happy where I'm causing problems all over the place or even sadistically happy but it's a coupling
9720160	9724640	right that I'm actually feeling happiness in relationship to yours and even in causal relationship
9724640	9730720	where I my own agentic desire to get happier wants to support you too that's actually speaking of
9730720	9738400	another pickup line that's quite honestly what I this is a guy who's single this is going to come
9738480	9742800	out very ridiculous because it's like oh yeah where's your girlfriend bro but
9745280	9752800	that's what I look for in a relationship because it's like it's so much it's so it's such an amazing
9752800	9759920	life where you actually get joy from another person's success and they get joy from your success
9759920	9765280	and then it becomes like you don't actually need to succeed much for that to have a like a
9766160	9773040	a loop like a cycle of just like happiness that just increases like exponentially it's weird
9773040	9778720	so like just be just enjoying the the happiness of others this success of others so this this is
9778720	9784800	like the let's call this because the first person that drilled this into my head is Rogan Joe Rogan
9784800	9792720	he was the embodiment of that because I saw somebody who is successful rich and non-stop
9793680	9799360	true I mean you could tell when somebody's full of shit and somebody's not really genuinely
9799360	9804960	enjoying the success of his friends that that was weird to me that was interesting and I mean the way
9804960	9811920	you're kind of speaking to it the reason Joe stood out to me is I guess I haven't witnessed
9811920	9819040	genuine expression of that often in this culture I've just real joy for others I mean part of
9819040	9824720	that has to do with there hasn't been many channels where you can watch or listen to people
9824720	9829440	being their authentic selves so I'm sure there's a bunch of people who live life with compersion
9829440	9836640	they probably don't seek public attention also but the that that was yeah if there was any word
9836640	9841680	that could express what what I've learned from Joe why he's been a really inspiring figure is that
9841680	9852480	compersion and I wish our world was had a lot more of that because then it I mean my own
9852480	9859920	sorry to go in a small tangent but like you're speaking how society should function but I feel
9859920	9866880	like if you optimize for that metric in your own personal life you're going to live a truly
9866880	9871520	fulfilling life I don't know what the right word to use but that's a really good way to live life
9872080	9877840	you will also learn what gets in the way of it right and how to work with it that if you wanted
9877840	9882720	to help try to build systems at scale or apply Facebook or exponential technologies to do that
9882720	9890000	you would have more actual depth of real knowledge of what that takes and this is you know as you
9890000	9893760	mentioned that there's this virtuous cycle between when you get stoked on other people doing well and
9893760	9897360	then they have a similar relationship to you and everyone is in the process of building each other
9897360	9904160	up and this is what I would say the healthy version of competition is versus the unhealthy
9904160	9910640	version the healthy version right the the root I believe it's a Latin word that means to strive
9910640	9916480	together and it's that impulse of becoming where I want to become more but I recognize that there's
9916480	9921760	actually a hormesis there's a challenge that is needed for me to be able to do that but that
9921760	9925920	means that yes there's an impulse where I'm trying to get ahead maybe I'm even trying to win but I
9925920	9930720	actually want a good opponent and I want them to get ahead too because that is where my ongoing
9930720	9935840	becoming happens and the win itself will get boring very quickly the ongoing becoming is
9935840	9940000	where there's a liveness and for the ongoing becoming they need to have it too and that's
9940000	9943600	the strive together the so in the healthy competition I'm stoked when they're doing really
9943600	9949120	well because my becoming is supported by it now this is actually a very nice segue into
9949840	9957360	a model I like about what a meaningful human life is if you want to go there
9959840	9967360	let's go there what I have I have three things I'm going elsewhere with but if we were first
9967360	9974640	let us take a short stroll through the park of the meaning of life Daniel what is a meaningful life
9975040	9983120	I think the semantics end up mattering because a lot of people will take the word meaning and the
9983120	9989760	word purpose almost interchangeably and they'll think kind of what is the meaning of my life what
9989760	9994000	is the meaning of human life what is the meaning of life what's the meaning of the universe and
9994960	9999120	what is the meaning of existence rather than non-existence so there's a lot of kind of existential
9999200	10004240	a lot of kind of existential considerations there and I think there's some cognitive mistakes
10004240	10011440	that are very easy like taking the idea of purpose which is like a goal which is a utilitarian
10011440	10015760	concept the purpose of one thing is defined in relationship to other things that have assumed
10015760	10023280	value and to say what is the purpose of everything well it's a purpose is too small of a question
10023280	10026800	it's fundamentally a relative question within everything what is the purpose of one thing
10026800	10029920	relative to another what is the purpose of everything and there's nothing outside of it
10029920	10036000	with which to say it you actually just got to the limits of the utility of the concept of purpose
10036000	10039440	it doesn't mean it's purposeless in the sense of something inside of it being purposeless it
10039440	10045920	means the concept is too small which is why you end up getting to you know like in Taoism talking
10045920	10052480	about the nature of it rather the there's a fundamental what where the why can't go deeper
10052480	10059920	is the nature of it but I'm gonna try to speak to a much simpler part which is when people
10059920	10064800	think about what is a meaningful human life and kind of if we were to optimize for something at
10064800	10070240	the level of individual life but also how does optimizing for this at the level of the individual
10070240	10078000	life lead to the best society for insofar as people living that way affects others and long
10078000	10083520	term the world as a whole and how would we then make a civilization that was trying to think about
10083520	10091520	these things because you can see that there are a lot of dialectics where there's value on two
10091520	10100640	sides individualism and collectivism or the ability to accept things and the ability to push harder
10100640	10107680	and whatever and there's failure modes on both sides and so when you were starting to say okay
10107760	10111200	individual happiness you're like wait fuck say this can be happy while hurting people it's not
10111200	10115680	individual happiness it's love but wait some people can self-sacrifice out of love in a way
10115680	10121840	that actually ends up just creating codependency for everybody or okay so so how do we think about
10121840	10132000	all those things together one like this kind of came to me as a simple way that I kind of relate
10132000	10138800	to it is that a meaningful life involves the mode of being the mode of doing and the mode of
10138800	10147600	becoming and it involves a virtuous relationship between those three and that any of those modes
10147600	10153920	on their own also have failure modes that are not a meaningful life the mode of being the way I
10153920	10163680	would describe it if if we're talking about the essence of it is about taking in and appreciating
10163680	10170320	the beauty of life that is now it's a mode that is in the moment and that is largely about being
10170320	10176080	with what is it's fundamentally grounded in the nature of experience and the meaningfulness of
10176080	10182720	experience the prima facia meaningfulness of when I'm having this experience I'm not actually asking
10182720	10187600	what the meaning of life is I'm actually full of it I'm full of experiencing it the momentary
10187600	10196560	experience yes so taking in the beauty of life doing is adding to the beauty of life I'm going
10196560	10200000	to produce some art I'm going to produce some technology that will make life easier more
10200000	10206800	beautiful for somebody else I'm going to do some science that will end up leading to better
10206800	10210800	insights or others people's ability to appreciate the beauty of life more because they understand
10210800	10214880	more about it or whatever it is or protect it right I'm going to protect it in some way but
10214880	10220800	that's adding to or being in service of the beauty of life through our doing and becoming
10220800	10225760	is getting better at both of those being able to deepen our being which is to be able to take in
10225760	10232160	the beauty of life more profoundly be more moved by it touched by it and increasing our capacity
10232160	10241040	with doing to add to the beauty of life more and so I hold that a meaningful life has to be all
10241040	10248480	three of those and where they're not in conflict with each other ultimately it grounds in being
10248480	10253920	it grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness of experience and then my doing is ultimately
10253920	10258720	something that will be able to increase the possibility of the quality of experience for others
10259680	10265440	and my becoming is a deepening on those so it grounds an experience and also the evolutionary
10265440	10275120	possibility of experience and the point is to oscillate between these never getting stuck on
10275120	10282640	anyone yeah or I suppose in parallel well you can't really attention is a thing you can only allocate
10283040	10292000	attention I want moments where I am absorbed in the sunset and I'm not thinking about what to do
10292000	10299520	next yeah and then the fullness of that can make it to where my doing doesn't come from what's in
10299520	10307600	it for me because I actually feel overwhelmingly full already and then it's like how can I how can
10308160	10312480	make life better for other people that don't have as much opportunities I had how can I add
10312480	10319440	something wonderful how can I just be in the creative process and so I think where the doing
10319440	10324080	comes from matters and if the doing comes from a fullness of being it's inherently going to be
10324080	10329760	paying attention to externalities or it's more oriented to do that than if it comes from some
10329760	10334000	emptiness that is trying to get full in some way that is willing to cause sacrifices other places
10334080	10340640	and where a chunk of its attention is internally focused and so when Buddha said desires the cause
10340640	10346240	of all suffering then later the vow of the bodhisattva which was to show up for all sentient
10346240	10354000	beings in universe forever is a pretty intense thing like desire I would say there's a kind of
10354000	10357760	desire if we think of desire as a basis for movement like a flow or a gradient there's a
10357760	10362880	kind of desire that comes from something missing inside seeking fulfillment of that in the world
10362880	10368320	that ends up being the cause of actions that perpetuate suffering but there's also not just
10368320	10373520	non-desire there's a kind of desire that comes from feeling full at the beauty of life and wanting
10373520	10380000	to add to it that is a flow this direction and I don't think that is the cause of suffering I think
10380000	10385120	that is you know and the western traditions right the eastern traditions focused on that
10385120	10389440	and kind of unconditional happiness outside of them in the moment outside of time western
10389440	10394000	traditions said no actually desires the source of creativity and we're here to be made in the
10394000	10399840	image and likeness of the creator we're here to be fundamentally creative but creating from where
10399840	10404080	and in service of what creating from a sense of connection to everything and wholeness and service
10404080	10410880	of the well-being of all of it is very different which is back to that compassion compersion axis
10411600	10415200	being doing becoming it's pretty powerful
10417600	10421760	also could potentially be algorithmatized into a robot just saying
10424800	10425680	where does um
10429360	10431440	where does death come into that
10434240	10439920	being is forgetting I mean the the the concept of time completely there's a there's a sense to
10440000	10447920	doing and becoming that has a deadline and built in the urgency built in do you think
10447920	10453360	death is fundamental to this to a meaningful life uh
10455760	10458160	acknowledging or um
10460400	10466800	feeling the terror of death like Ernest Becker or just acknowledging the uncertainty the mystery the
10467760	10472480	the melancholy nature of the fact that the ride ends is that part of this equation
10473280	10478880	or not necessary okay look at how it could be related I've experienced fear of death
10480240	10481520	I've also experienced
10484160	10489760	times where I thought I was gonna die it felt extremely peaceful and beautiful and
10490320	10491520	um
10493920	10499920	it's funny because if we we can be afraid of death because we're afraid of hell or battery
10499920	10503520	incarnation or the bardo or some kind of idea of the afterlife we have or we're projecting
10503520	10507440	some kind of sentient suffering but if we're afraid of just non-experience
10509840	10513600	I noticed that every time I stay up late enough that I'm really tired
10514480	10519760	I'm longing for deep deep sleep and non-experience right like I'm actually longing for experience
10519760	10528240	to stop and it's not morbid it's not a bummer it's and and I don't mind falling asleep and I
10528240	10533920	sometimes when I wake up want to go back into it and then when it's done I'm happy to come out of it
10533920	10535200	so um
10535200	10544960	when we think about death and having finite time here and we could talk about if we live for
10544960	10548240	a thousand years instead of a hundred or something like that it'll still be finite time
10549600	10553600	the one bummer with the age we die is that I generally find that people mostly start to
10553600	10562560	emotionally mature just shortly before they die but there's
10565840	10570720	if I get to live forever I I can just stay focused on what's in it for me forever
10574640	10580400	and if life continues and consciousness and sentience and people appreciating beauty and
10580400	10586080	adding to it and becoming continues my life doesn't but my life can have effects that continue
10586080	10592640	well beyond it then life with a capital L starts mattering more to me than my life my life gets
10592640	10598240	to be a part of it and in service to and the whole thing about when old men plant trees the
10598240	10605040	shade of which they'll never get to be in um I remember the first time I read this poem by
10605120	10612640	Hafez the the Sufi poet written in like 13th century or something like that and he talked about
10613680	10620080	that if you're lonely to think about him and he was kind of leaning his spirit um into years
10620080	10625520	across the distance of a millennium and would come for you with these poems and he's thinking
10625520	10629680	about people millennium from now and caring about their experience and what they'd be suffering if
10629680	10634800	they'd be lonely and could he offer something that could touch them and it's just fucking beautiful
10634880	10640560	and so like the most beautiful parts of humans have to do with something that transcends what's
10640560	10648080	in it for me and death forces you to that so not not only does death create the urgency it uh
10649680	10656960	urgency of doing it you're very right it does have a sense in which it uh incentivizes the
10657040	10665440	compersion and the compassion and the widening you remember Einstein had that quote something to
10665440	10669040	the effect of it's an optical delusion of consciousness to believe there are separate
10669040	10676160	things there's this one thing we call universe and uh something about us being inside of a
10676160	10682160	prison of perception that can only you know see a very narrow little bit of it but
10683040	10690320	but this this might be just some weird disposition of mine but when I think about the future after
10690320	10698640	I'm dead and I think about consciousness I think about young people falling in love for the first
10698640	10702720	time in their their experience and I think about people being awed by sunsets and I think about
10702720	10712480	and I think about all of it right I can't not feel connected to that do you feel some sadness
10713280	10719040	to the very high likelihood that you will be forgotten completely by all of human history
10719040	10727840	you Daniel the name that that which cannot be named systems like to self-perpetuate
10727840	10736480	egos do that the idea that I might do something meaningful that future people appreciate of
10736480	10742480	course there's like a certain sweetness to that idea but I know how many people did something
10743360	10747200	did things that I wouldn't be here without and that my life would be less without whose names
10747200	10754160	I will never know and I feel a gratitude to them I feel a closeness I feel touched by that and I
10754160	10761520	think to the degree that the future people are conscious enough there is a you know a lot of
10761520	10765840	traditions had this kind of are we being good ancestors and respect for the ancestors beyond
10765840	10772720	the names I think that's a very healthy idea but let me return to a much less beautiful
10772720	10778480	and much less pleasant conversation you mentioned prison back to x-risk okay
10778560	10785200	and conditioning you mentioned something about the state
10788080	10796400	so what role let's talk about companies governments parents all the mechanisms that
10796400	10802720	can be a source of conditioning which flavor of ice cream do you like do you think the state
10803440	10808480	is the right thing for the future so governments that are elected democratic systems that are
10808480	10816000	representing representative democracy is there some kind of political system of governance
10816000	10824240	that you find appealing is it parents meaning a very close knit tribes of conditioning that's
10824240	10832400	the most essential and then you and michael malice would happily agree that it's anarchy
10833040	10839440	where the state should be dissolved or destroyed or burned to the ground if you're michael malice
10839440	10849360	giggling holding the torch as the fire burns so which which is it is the state can the state be good
10849600	10858800	or is the state bad for the condition of a beautiful world a or b this is like an sd test
10858800	10865760	you like to give these simplified good or bad things um would i like the state that we live in
10865760	10870560	currently the united states federal government to stop existing today no i would really not like
10870560	10877840	that um i think that would be not quite bad for the world in a lot of ways uh do i think that it's a
10879520	10884160	optimal social system and maximally just and humane and all those things and i wanted to
10884160	10889920	continue as is no also not that um but i am much more interested in it being able to evolve to a
10889920	10897280	better thing without going through um the catastrophe phase that i think it's just non-existence would
10897280	10905760	give so what size of state is good in a sense like do we should be as a human society as this
10905760	10912080	world becomes more globalized should we be constantly striving to reduce the we can we can
10912080	10920160	put on a map like right now literally like the the the centers of power in the world some of them
10920160	10925760	are tech companies some of them are governments should we be trying to as much as possible
10925760	10932880	decentralize the power to where it's very difficult to point on the map the centers of power and that
10932880	10939760	means making the state however there's a bunch of different ways to make the government much smaller
10939760	10948480	that could be reducing in the united states reducing the the funding for the government
10948480	10953840	all those kinds of things there's a set of responsibilities the the set of powers it could be
10954640	10961920	i mean this is far out but making more nations or maybe nations not in a space that are
10961920	10967200	defined by geographic location but rather in the space of ideas which is what anarchy is about
10967200	10973040	so anarchy is about forming collectives based on their set of ideas and doing so dynamically not
10973040	10980720	based on where you were born and so on i think we can say that the natural state of humans if we
10980720	10987600	want to describe such a thing was to live in tribes that were below the dunbar number
10988160	10994720	meaning that for a few hundred thousand years of human history all of the groups of humans mostly
10994720	10999520	stayed under that size and whenever we'd get up to that size it would end up cleaving and so it seems
10999520	11003840	like there's a pretty strong but there weren't individual humans out in the wild doing really
11003840	11008560	well right so we were a group animal but with groups that had a specific size so we could say
11009280	11013040	in a way humans were being domesticated by those groups they were learning how to have
11013680	11017200	certain rules to participate with the group without which you'd get kicked out but that
11017920	11023520	that's still the wild state of people and and maybe it's useful to do as a side statement
11023520	11028720	which i've recently looked at a bunch of papers around Dunbar's number where the mean is actually
11028720	11034000	150 if you actually look at the original paper it's a range it's really a range so it's actually
11034000	11038880	some somewhere under a thousand so it's a range of like two to five hundred or whatever it is
11038960	11045760	but like you could argue that the i think it actually is exactly to two the range is two to
11045760	11052320	five hundred and twenty something like that and this is the mean that's taken crudely it's not a
11052320	11059680	very good paper the in terms of the actual numerical numerically speaking but it'd be
11059680	11065600	interesting if there's a bunch of Dunbar numbers that could be computed for particular environments
11065600	11070720	particular conditions so on it is very true that they're likely to be something small you know
11070720	11076400	under a million but it'd be interesting if we can expand that number in interesting ways that will
11076400	11080080	change the fabric of this conversation i just want to kind of throw that in there i don't know
11080080	11084720	the if the 150 is baked in somehow in the heart into the hardware we can talk about some of the
11084720	11090640	things that it probably has to do with up to a certain number of people and this is going to
11090640	11095280	be variable based on the social technologies that mediate it to some degree we can talk about that
11095600	11103600	in a minute up to a certain number of people everybody can know everybody else pretty intimately
11104160	11107760	so let's go ahead and just take 150 as a as an average number
11111920	11118720	everybody can know everyone intimately enough that if your actions made anyone else do poorly
11118720	11123040	it's your extended family and you're stuck living with them and you know who they are and there's
11123040	11130800	no anonymous people there's no just them and over there and that's one part of what leads to a
11130800	11134080	kind of tribal process where it's good for the individual and good for the whole has a coupling
11134960	11141280	also below that scale everyone is somewhat aware of what everybody else is doing there's not
11141920	11147760	groups that are very siloed and as a result it's actually very hard to get away with bad behavior
11147760	11152560	there's a forced kind of transparency and so you don't need kind of like the state
11153680	11158960	in in that way but lying to people doesn't actually get you ahead sociopathic behavior
11158960	11165680	doesn't get you ahead because it gets seen and so there's a conditioning environment where the
11165680	11170320	individuals behaving in a way that is aligned with the interest of the tribe is what gets conditioned
11171200	11177200	when it gets to be a much larger system it becomes easier to hide certain things from the
11177200	11181360	group as a whole as well as to be less emotionally bound to a bunch of anonymous people
11182640	11188400	I would say there's also a communication protocol where up to about that number of people
11189200	11194000	we could all sit around a tribal council and be part of a conversation around a really big decision
11194000	11198880	do we migrate do we not migrate do we you know some something like that do we get rid of this person
11198880	11207600	and why why would I want to agree to be a part of a larger group where everyone can't be part of
11207600	11214320	that council and so I am going to now be subject to law that I have no say in if I could be part
11214320	11218160	of a smaller group that could still survive and I get a say in the law that I'm subject to so I
11218160	11223440	think the cleaving and in a way we can look at it beyond the Dunbar number two is we can look at
11223440	11228800	that a civilization has binding energy that is holding them together and has cleaving energy and
11228800	11233600	if the binding energy exceeds the cleaving energy that civilization will last and so there are things
11233600	11237280	that we can do to decrease the cleaving energy within the society things we can do to increase
11237280	11241840	the binding energy I think naturally we saw that had certain characteristics up to a certain size
11241840	11248240	kind of tribalism that ended with a few things it ended with people having migrated enough that
11248240	11254080	when you started to get resource wars you couldn't just migrate away easily and so tribal warfare
11254080	11259360	became more obligated it involved the plow in the beginning of real economic surplus there were
11259360	11267280	so there were a few different kind of um forcing functions but we're talking about what size should
11267280	11273520	it be right what size should a society be and I think the idea like if we think about your body
11273520	11279120	for a moment as a self-organizing complex system that is multi-scaled we think about body is a
11279120	11287440	wonderland our body is a wonderland yeah uh you have you that's a john mayer song I apologize
11287440	11292880	but yes so if we think about our our body and the billions of cells that are in it well you don't
11292880	11298320	have like think about how ridiculous it would be to try to have all the tens of trillions of cells
11298320	11304480	in it with no internal organization structure right just like a sea of protoplasm it would work your
11304480	11311760	democracy and so you have cells and tissues and then you have tissues and organs and organs and
11311760	11316320	organ systems and so you have these layers of organization and then obviously the individual
11316320	11323440	in a tribe in a ecosystem and each of the higher layers are both based on the lower layers but
11323440	11328800	also influencing them I think the future of civilization will be similar which is there's
11328800	11333680	a level of governance that happens at the level of the individual my own governance of my own choice
11334480	11339040	I think there's a level that happens at the level of a family we're making decisions together
11339040	11344080	we're inter influencing each other and affecting each other taking responsibility for the idea of
11344080	11347920	an extended family and you can see that like for a lot of human history we had an extended family
11347920	11352640	we had a local community a local church or whatever it was we had these intermediate structures
11353280	11359040	whereas right now there's kind of like the individual producer consumer taxpayer voter
11359760	11364240	and the massive nation state global complex and not that much in the way of intermediate
11364240	11368240	structures that we relate with and not that much in the way of real personal dynamics all
11368240	11378080	impersonalized made fungible and so I think that we have to have global governance meaning
11378080	11382480	I think we have to have governance at the scale we affect stuff and if if anybody is messing up
11382480	11386880	the oceans that matters for everybody so that that can't only be national or only local
11387840	11391200	everyone is scared of the idea of global governance because we think about some top
11391200	11395840	down system of imposition that now has no checks and balances on power I'm scared of that same
11395840	11400880	version so I'm not talking about that kind of global governance it's why I'm even using the
11400880	11408320	word governance as a process rather than government as an imposed phenomena and so I think we have to
11408320	11412000	have global governance but I think we also have to have local governance and there has to be
11412000	11417760	relationships between them that each where there are both checks and balances and power flows of
11417760	11424320	information so I think governance at the level of cities will be a bigger deal in the future than
11424320	11430160	governance at the level of nation states because I think nation states are largely fictitious things
11430160	11436000	that are defined by wars and agreements to stop wars and like that I think cities are based on
11436000	11440800	real things will keep being real where the proximity of certain things together the physical
11440880	11446160	proximity of things together gives increased value of those things so you look at like Jeffrey West's
11446160	11451760	work on scale and finding that companies and nation states and things that have a kind of
11451760	11457200	complicated agreement structure get diminishing return of production per capita as the total
11457200	11461200	number of people increases beyond about the tribal scale but the city actually gets increasing
11461200	11466800	productivity per capita but it's not designed it's kind of this organic thing right so there
11466800	11470560	should be governance at the level of cities because people can sense and actually have some
11470560	11475440	agency there probably neighborhoods and smaller scales within it and also verticals and some of
11475440	11479520	it won't be geographic it'll be network based right networks of affinities so I don't think the
11479520	11485840	future is one type of governance now what we can say more broadly is say when we're talking about
11485840	11490240	groups of people that inter-effect each other the idea of a civilization is that we can figure out
11490240	11495920	how to coordinate our choice making to not be at war with each other and hopefully increase total
11497120	11501040	productive capacity in a way that's good for everybody division of labor and specialties
11501040	11507280	so we all get more better stuff and whatever but it's a it's a coordination of our choice making
11509680	11515280	I think we can look at civilizations failing on the side of not having enough coordination of
11515280	11519120	choice making so they fail on the side of chaos and then they cleave and an internal war comes
11519120	11525760	about or whatever or they can't make smart decisions and they overuse their resources or whatever
11527520	11534640	it can fail on the side of trying to get order via imposition via force and so it fails on the
11534640	11541440	side of oppression which ends up being for a while functional ish for the thing as a whole but
11541440	11546000	miserable for most people in it until it fails either because of revolt or because it can't
11546000	11551840	innovate enough or something like that and so there's this like toggling between order via
11551840	11558640	oppression and chaos and I think the idea of democracy not the way we've implemented it but
11558640	11562960	the idea of it whether we're talking about a representative democracy or a direct digital
11562960	11569520	democracy liquid democracy republic or whatever the idea of an open society participatory governance
11570320	11576880	is can we have order that is emergent rather than imposed so that we aren't stuck with chaos
11577680	11582240	and infighting and inability to coordinate and we're also not stuck with oppression
11583360	11590640	and what would it take to have emergent order this is the most kind of central question for me
11590640	11598400	these days because if we look at what different nation states are doing around the world and
11598400	11604560	we see nation states that are more authoritarian that in some ways are actually coordinating
11604560	11612320	much more effectively so for instance we can see that China has built high-speed rail not just
11612320	11616640	through its country but around the world and the US hasn't built any high-speed rail yet
11616640	11621360	you can see that it brought 300 million people out of poverty in a time where we've had increasing
11621360	11628400	economic inequality happening you can see like that if there was a single country that could make
11628400	11633040	all of its own stuff if the global supply chains failed China would be the closest one to being able
11633040	11641520	to start to go closed loop on fundamental things uh belt and road initiative supply chain on rare
11641520	11646640	earth metals transistor manufacturing that is like oh they're actually coordinating more effectively
11646640	11654960	in some important ways in the last call at 30 years and that's imposed order imposed order
11655520	11662400	and we can see that if in the US if let's look at why real quick
11664480	11669360	we know why we created term limits so that we wouldn't have forever monarchs that's the thing
11669360	11673280	we were trying to get away from and that there would be checks and balances on power and that
11673280	11678000	kind of thing but that also has created a negative second order effect which is nobody
11678000	11682960	does long-term planning because somebody comes in who's got four years they want re-elected
11682960	11686640	they don't do anything that doesn't create a return within four years that will end up getting
11686640	11692480	them elected re-elected and so the 30-year industrial development to build high-speed trains or
11693120	11698320	the new kind of fusion energy or whatever it is just doesn't get invested in and then if you have
11698320	11703600	left versus right where whatever someone does for four years then the other guy gets in and
11703600	11708560	undoes it for four years and most of the energy goes into campaigning against each other this
11708560	11713280	system is just dissipating as heat right like it's just burning up as heat and the system that
11713280	11717360	has no term limits and no internal friction in fighting because they got rid of those people
11718000	11726720	can actually coordinate better but I would argue it has its own fail states eventually and dystopic
11726720	11732080	properties that are not the thing we want so the goal is to accomplish to create a system that does
11732080	11738800	long-term planning without the negative effects of a monarch or dictator that stays there for the
11738800	11752640	long term and accomplish that through not through the imposition of a single leader but through
11753360	11760960	emergent so doesn't that perhaps first of all the technology in itself seems to maybe
11760960	11768240	maybe disagree a lot for different possibilities here which is make primary the system not the humans
11768240	11778320	so the the the basic the medium on which the democracy happens like like a platform
11779040	11786640	or where people can make decisions do the choice making the coordination of the choice making
11788800	11793760	where emerges some kind of order to where like something that applies at the scale of the family
11793760	11801680	the extended family the city the the country the the continent the whole world and then
11801680	11806480	does that so dynamically constantly changing based on the needs of the people sort of always
11806480	11815680	evolving and it would all be owned by google like doesn't the doesn't this is there a way to
11817120	11822320	so first of all you optimistic that you could basically create the technology can save us
11822320	11827840	technology at creating platforms by technology I mean like software and network platforms
11827840	11835600	that allows humans to deliberate like make government together dynamically without the need
11835680	11842640	for a leader that's on a podium screaming stuff that's one and two if you're optimistic about that
11843200	11851600	are you also optimistic about the CEOs of such platforms the idea that technology is values
11851600	11858160	neutral values agnostic it and people can use it for constructive or destructive purposes but it
11858160	11866240	doesn't predispose anything it's just it's just silly naive technology elicits patterns of human
11866240	11870800	behavior because those who utilize it and get ahead end up behaving differently because of their
11870800	11875760	utilization of it and then other people then they end up shaping the world or other people race to
11875760	11881280	also get the power of the technology and so there's whole schools of anthropology that look at the
11881280	11884720	effect on social systems and the minds of people of the change in our tooling
11885680	11890240	Marvin Harris's work called cultural materialism looked at this deeply obviously Marshall McLuhan
11890240	11894320	looked specifically at the way that information technologies change the nature of our beliefs
11894320	11902800	minds values social systems I will not try to do this rigorously because there are academics will
11902800	11908240	disagree on the subtle details but I'll do it kind of like illustratively you think about the
11908240	11912320	emergence of the plow the ox drawn plow in the beginning of agriculture that came with it or
11912400	11917840	before that you had hunter gather and then you had horticulture kind of a digging stick but not
11918720	11923440	the plow well that the world changed a lot with that right and and
11926640	11934800	a few of the changes that at least some theorists believe in is when the ox drawn plow started
11934800	11938880	to proliferate any culture that utilized it was able to start to actually cultivate grain because
11938880	11942000	just with a digging stick you couldn't get enough grain for it to matter grain was a
11942000	11944880	storable caloric surplus they could make it through the famines they could grow their
11944880	11949120	population so the ones that used it got so much ahead that it became obligate and everybody
11949120	11956080	used it that corresponding with the use of a plow animism went away everywhere that it existed
11956080	11960320	because you can't talk about the spirit of the buffalo while beating the cow all day long to
11960320	11965280	pull a plow so the moment that we do animal husbandry of that kind we have to beat the cow
11965280	11969520	all day you have to say it's just a dumb animal man has dominion over earth and the nature of even
11969520	11974960	our religious and spiritual ideas change you went from women primarily using the digging stick to
11974960	11979840	do the horticulture or gathering before that men doing the hunting stuff to now men had to use the
11979840	11983600	plow because the upper body strength actually really mattered women would have miscarriages when
11983600	11987920	they would do it when they were pregnant so all the caloric supply started to come from men where
11987920	11992880	it had been from both before and the ratio of male female gods changed to being mostly male gods
11992880	12001200	following that obviously we went from very that particular line of thought then also says that
12001200	12009840	feminism followed the tractor and that the rise of feminism in the west started to follow women
12009840	12015440	being able to say we can do what men can because the male upper body strength wasn't differential
12015440	12021920	once the internal combustion engine was much stronger and we can drive a tractor so I don't
12021920	12026880	think to try to trace complex things to one cause is a good idea so I think this is a reductionist
12026880	12035040	view but it has truth in it and so the idea that technology is values agnostic is silly technology
12035040	12040160	codes patterns of behavior that code rationalizing those patterns of behavior and believing in them
12040160	12044240	that the plow also is the beginning of the Anthropocene right it was the beginning of us
12044240	12049360	changing the environment radically to to clear cut areas to just make them useful for people which
12049360	12054560	also meant the change of the view of where the the web of life were just a part of it etc so
12054560	12062480	all those types of things um so that's brilliantly put but by the way that was just brilliant but
12062480	12068720	the question is so it's not agnostic but so we have to look at what the psychological effects of
12068720	12075360	specific tech applied certain ways are and be able to say it's not just doing the first order thing
12075360	12082400	you intended it's doing like the effect on patriarchy and animism and the end of tribal
12082400	12086400	culture in the beginning of empire and the class systems that came with that not like we can go on
12086400	12091360	and on about what the plow did the beginning of surplus was inheritance which then became the
12091360	12098000	capital model and like lots of things so we have to say when we're looking at the tech how is what
12098000	12103120	are the values built into the way the tech is being built that are not obvious right so you
12103120	12106480	always have to consider externalities yes this is no matter what and the externalities are not
12106480	12109760	just physical to the environment they're also to how the people are being conditioned and
12109760	12113920	how the relationality between them is being conditioned question i'm asking you so i personally
12113920	12120160	would rather be led by a plow and a tractor than stalling okay that's the question i'm asking you
12120160	12129200	is uh in creating an emergent government where people where there's a democracy that's dynamic
12129200	12139200	that makes choices that does governance at at like a very kind of liquid like uh there's a
12139200	12146480	bunch of fine resolution layers of abstraction of governance happening at all scales right and
12146480	12153760	doing so dynamically where no one person has power at any one time that can dominate and impose rule
12153760	12161360	okay that's the stalling version i'm saying isn't there the uh the isn't the alternative
12161360	12170080	that's emergent empowered or made possible by the plow and the tractor which is the modern
12170080	12176640	version of that is like the internet the the digital space where we can the monetary system
12176640	12181760	where you have the current currency and so on but you have much more importantly to me at least
12181760	12186080	is just basic social interaction the mechanisms of human transacting with each other in this
12186080	12193200	base of ideas isn't so yes it's not agnostic definitely not agnostic you've had a brilliant
12193200	12198480	rant there the tractor has effects but isn't that the way we achieve an emergent system
12199360	12202560	of governance yes but i wouldn't say we're on track
12206560	12210400	you haven't seen anything promising but it's not that i haven't seen anything promising
12210400	12214240	is that to be on track requires understanding and guiding some of the things differently than
12214240	12218800	is currently happening and it's possible that's actually what i really care about so
12221920	12227040	you couldn't have had a stall in without having certain technologies emerge he couldn't have ruled
12227040	12232880	such a big area without transportation technologies without the train without the uh
12232880	12238720	communication tech that made it possible so when you say you'd rather have a tractor or a plow than
12238720	12246000	a stall and there's a relationship between them that is more recursive which is new physical
12246000	12253840	technologies allow rulers to rule with more power over larger distances historically and
12256480	12261040	but some things are more responsible for that than others like stalling also eats
12261040	12265760	stuff for breakfast but the thing he ate for breakfast is less responsible for the starvation
12265840	12270720	of millions than than the train the train is more responsible for that and then the
12270720	12276240	weapons of war are more responsible so some technology like let's not throw it all in the
12276240	12282400	you're saying like technology has a responsibility here but some is better than others i'm saying
12282400	12288240	that people's use of technology will change their behavior so it has behavioral dispositions built
12288240	12293360	in the change of the behavior will also change the values in the society it's very complicated
12293360	12298640	it will also as a result both make people who have different kinds of predispositions with
12298640	12304880	regard to rulership and different kinds of new capacities and so we have to think about these
12304880	12311760	things it's kind of well understood that the printing press and then in early industrialism
12311760	12318320	ended feudalism and created kind of nation states so one thing i would say as a long trend
12319120	12325280	that we can look at is that whenever there is a step function a major leap in technology physical
12325280	12331920	technology the the underlying techno industrial base with which we do stuff it ends up coding for
12331920	12337040	it ends up predisposing a whole bunch of human behavioral patterns that the previous social
12337040	12342800	system what had not emerged to try to solve and so it usually ends up breaking the previous social
12342800	12346720	systems the way the plow broke the tribal system the way that the industrial revolution broke the
12346720	12352960	feudal system and then new social systems have to emerge that can deal with that the new powers the
12352960	12358160	new dispositions whatever with that tech obviously the nuke broke nation state governance being
12358160	12363840	adequate and said we can't ever have that again so then it created this in international governance
12363840	12380960	apparatus world so i guess what i'm saying is that the solution is not exponential tech following
12380960	12386000	the current path of what the market incentivizes exponential tech to do market being a previous
12386080	12398720	social tech i would say that exponential tech if we look at different types of social tech so let's
12398720	12407120	just briefly look at that democracy tried to do the emergent order thing right at least that's
12407120	12417360	the story and which is and this is why if you look at this important part to build first it's
12417360	12422880	kind of doing it it's just doing it poorly you're saying i mean that's it is emergent order in some
12422880	12427920	sense i mean that's the hope of democracy versus other forms of government correct i mean i i said
12427920	12432320	at least the story because obviously it didn't do it for women and slaves early on it doesn't do it
12432320	12439680	for all classes equally etc but the the idea of democracy is that is participatory governance
12440400	12446320	and so you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the european enlightenment and
12446320	12451680	specifically because the idea that a lot of people some huge number not a tribal number a huge number
12451680	12456480	of anonymous people who don't know each other are not bonded to each other who believe different
12456480	12460480	things who grew up in different ways can all work together to make collective decisions well
12460480	12464320	that affect everybody and where some of them will make compromises and the thing that matters to
12464320	12469040	them for what matters to other strangers that's actually wild like it's a wild idea that that
12469040	12475840	would even be possible and it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we
12475840	12483360	could all do the philosophy of science and we could all do the hegelian dialectic those ideas
12483360	12491120	had emerged right and it was that we we could all so our choice making because we said a society is
12491120	12494880	trying to coordinate choice making the emergent order is the order of our of the choices that
12494880	12498160	we're making not just at the level of the individuals but what groups of individuals
12498160	12504080	corporations nation states whatever do um our choices are based on our choice making is based
12504080	12508320	on our sense making and our meaning making our sense making is what do we believe is happening
12508320	12511840	in the world and what do we believe the effects of a particular thing would be our meaning
12511840	12514880	making is what do we care about right our values generation what do we care about that
12514880	12519120	we're trying to move the world in the direction of if you ultimately are trying to move the world
12519120	12523200	in a direction that is really really different than the direction i'm trying to we have very
12523200	12528080	different values we're gonna have a hard time and if you think the world is a very different world
12528080	12534080	right if you think that systemic racism is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems
12534080	12539040	and i think it's not even a thing if you think climate change is almost existential and i think
12539040	12543920	it's not even a thing we're gonna have a really hard time coordinating and so we have to be able
12543920	12549680	to have shared sense making of can we come to understand just what is happening together
12550480	12554480	and then can we do shared values generation okay maybe i'm emphasizing a particular value
12554480	12558400	more than you but i can see how i can take your perspective and i can see how the thing that you
12558400	12563280	value is worth valuing and i can see how it's affected by this thing so can we take all the
12563280	12567920	values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all of them better than the proposition
12567920	12572320	i created just to benefit these ones that harms the ones that you care about which is why you're
12572320	12577440	opposing my proposition yeah we don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently
12578000	12582800	to see and this is the reason that the proposition when we vote on it gets half the vote almost all
12582800	12587760	the time it almost never gets 90% of the votes is because it benefits some things and harms other
12587760	12593040	things we can say all theory of trade-offs but we didn't even try to say could we see what everybody
12593040	12599360	cares about and see if there is a better solution so how do we fix that try i i wonder is it is it
12599360	12605920	as simple as the social technology education well no it's that the proposition crafting and
12605920	12611760	refinement process has to be key to a democracy or part of the government and it's not currently
12611760	12619040	but it's the isn't that the humans creating that situation so one way there's two ways to fix that
12619920	12623600	one is to fix the individual humans which is the education early in life
12623600	12630240	and the second is to create somehow systems that yeah it's both so i understand the education part
12630240	12634800	but creating systems that's why that's why i mentioned the technologies is creating
12634800	12639040	yes social networks essentially yes that's actually necessary okay so let's go to the first part and
12639040	12645840	then we'll come to the second part so democracy emerged as an enlightenment era idea that we
12645840	12652480	could all do a dialectic and come to understand what other people valued and so that we could
12652480	12658800	actually come up with a cooperative solution rather than just fuck you we're gonna get our
12658800	12662640	thing in war right and that we could sense make together we could all apply the philosophy of
12662640	12666720	science and you weren't gonna stick to your guns on what the speed of sound is if we measured it
12666720	12670800	and we found out what it was and there's a unifying element to the objectivity in that way
12671760	12677200	and so this is why i believe jefferson said if you could give me a perfect newspaper and a
12677200	12681360	broken government or in paraphrasing or broken government perfect newspaper i wouldn't hesitate
12681360	12684800	to take the perfect newspaper because if the people understand what's going on they can make
12684800	12688320	build a new government if they don't understand what's going on they can't possibly make good
12688320	12695840	choices and um washington i'm paraphrasing again first president said the number one aim of the
12695840	12700160	federal government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of
12700240	12704080	government science of government was the term of art think about what that means right science of
12704080	12710400	government would be game theory coordination theory history it wouldn't call game theory yet
12711120	12716480	history sociology economics right all the things that lead to how we understand human coordination
12717200	12722320	i think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government is rule
12722320	12728400	of law and he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies because if the number one
12728400	12732640	aim was to protect the border from enemies it could do that as military dictatorship
12733280	12738640	quite effectively and if the goal was rule of law it could do it as a dictatorship as a police
12738640	12744960	state and so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of all
12744960	12749600	the citizens in the science of government it won't stay democracy long you can see so both
12749600	12754480	education and the fourth estate the fourth estate being the so education can i make sense of the
12754480	12758160	world am i trained to make sense of the world the fourth estate is what's actually going on currently
12758160	12763200	the news do i have good unbiased information about it those are both considered prerequisite
12763200	12768800	institutions for democracy to even be a possibility and then at the scale it was initially suggested
12768800	12774800	here the town hall was the key phenomena where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a
12774800	12778800	proposition and the first thing i ever saw was the proposition to know anything about it and i
12778800	12782880	got a vote yes or no it was in the town hall we all got to talk about it and the proposition could
12782880	12787920	get crafted in real time through the conversation which is why there was that founding father's
12787920	12792560	statement that that voting is the death of democracy voting fundamentally is polarizing the
12792560	12797680	population in some kind of sublimated war but the and we'll do that as the last step but what we
12797680	12801920	want to do first is to say how does the thing that you care about that seems damaged by this
12801920	12807120	proposition how could that turn into a solution to make this proposition better where this proposition
12807120	12810960	still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to that better can we work on this together
12810960	12815840	and that in a town hall we could have that as the scale increased we lost the ability to do that
12815840	12820240	now as you mentioned the internet could change that the fact that we had representatives that
12820240	12825200	had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do that we
12825200	12831520	stopped having this kind of developmental um propositional development process when the town
12831520	12837760	hall ended the fact that we have not used the internet to recreate this is somewhere between
12837760	12847520	insane and aligned with class interests i would push back to say that the internet has those things
12847520	12852880	it just has a lot of other things i feel like the internet has places where that encouraged
12852880	12860640	synthesis of competing ideas and sense making which is what we're talking about is just that it's
12860640	12866400	also flooded with a bunch of other systems that perhaps are out competing it under current incentives
12866400	12873280	perhaps has to do with capitalism in the market is the linux is awesome right and wikipedia and
12873280	12878400	places where you have and they have problems but places where you have open source sharing of
12878400	12883280	information vetting of information towards collective building is that building something like
12884080	12890240	like how much has that affected our court systems or our policing systems or our military systems
12890400	12896160	first of all i think a lot but not not enough i i think that's something i told you offline yesterday
12896160	12903200	is uh perhaps there's a whole nother discussion but i i don't think we're quite quantifying the
12903200	12910720	impact on the world the positive impact of wikipedia you said the policing that i mean i just i just
12910720	12921920	think the amount of empathy that what could like knowledge i think can't help but lead to empathy
12922800	12928560	just knowing okay just knowing okay i'll i'll give you some pieces of information
12928560	12933200	knowing how many people died in various awards that already that delta when you have millions
12933200	12938800	of people have that knowledge it's like it's a little like slap in the face like oh like
12939600	12945040	my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking up with me is not such a big deal when millions of people
12945040	12950400	were tortured you know like just a little bit and when a lot of people know that because of wikipedia
12951840	12957120	or the effect their second order effect of wikipedia which is it's not that necessarily
12957120	12966160	people read wikipedia it's like youtubers who don't really know stuff that well will thoroughly
12966160	12971200	read a wikipedia article and create a compelling video describing that wikipedia article that then
12971200	12976720	millions of people watch and they understand that holy shit a lot of there was such first of all
12976720	12982240	there was such a thing as world war two and world war one okay like they can at least like learn about
12982240	12987600	it they can learn about this was like recent they can learn about slavery they can learn about all
12987600	12994560	kinds of injustices in the world and that i think has a lot of effects to our to the way
12994560	13001200	whether you're a police officer a lawyer a judge in the jury or just a regular
13002320	13010000	civilian citizen the way you approach the every other communication you engage in
13010000	13014080	even if the system of that communication is very much flawed so i think there's a huge
13014080	13018720	positive effect on wikipedia that's my case for wikipedia so you should donate to wikipedia
13019520	13027040	i'm a huge fan but there's very few systems like it which is sad to me so i think it's it would be a
13027040	13036800	useful exercise for any listener of the show to really try to run the dialectical synthesis process
13036800	13047280	with regard to a topic like this and take the techno concern perspective with regard to
13048240	13053920	information tech that folks like tristan harris take and say what are all of the things that
13053920	13059040	are getting worse and what and are any of them following an exponential curve and how much
13059040	13067200	worse how quickly could that be and then and do that fully without mitigating it then take
13067200	13072400	the techno optimist perspective and see what things are getting better in a way that curse well
13072400	13078160	or diamondus or someone might do and try to take that perspective fully and say are some of those
13078160	13082000	things exponential what what could that portend and then try to hold all that at the same time
13083040	13091520	and i think there are ways in which depending upon the metrics we're looking at things are getting
13091520	13095680	worse on exponential curves and better on exponential curves for different metrics at the
13095680	13101920	same time which which i hold is the destabilization of previous system and either an emergence to a
13101920	13110320	better system or collapse to a lower order are both possible and so i want my optimism not to be
13110320	13115680	about my assessment i want my assessment to be just as fucking clear as it can be i want my
13115680	13123040	optimism to be what inspires the solution process on that clear assessment so i never i never want
13123040	13128800	to apply optimism in the sense making right i want to just try to be clear if anything i want to make
13128800	13134720	sure that the challenges are really well understood but that's in service of an optimism that
13136240	13140640	there are good potentials even if i don't know what they are that are worth seeking right there's
13140640	13145600	kind of a there is a some sense of optimism that's required to even try to innovate really hard
13145600	13152320	problems but then i want to take my pessimism and red team my own optimism to see is that solution
13152320	13156800	not going to work does it have second order effects and then not get not get upset by that
13156800	13161680	because i then come back to how to make it better so that just a relationship between optimism and
13161680	13168720	pessimism and the dialectic of how they how they can work so when i of course we can say that wikipedia
13168720	13176400	is a pretty awesome example of a thing we can look at the places where it has limits or has failed
13176400	13183920	where um on a celebrity topic or corporate interest topic you can pay wikipedia editors to
13183920	13188240	edit more frequently and various things like that but you can also see where there's a lot of
13188240	13192960	information that was kind of decentralized created that is good information that is more easily
13192960	13196800	accessible to people than everybody buying their own encyclopedia britannica or walking down to the
13196800	13204640	library and that can be updated in real time faster and i think you're very right that the
13204640	13212080	business model is a big difference because wikipedia is not a for-profit corporation it is a
13212640	13217600	it's tending to the information commons and it doesn't have an agenda other than tending to
13217600	13224800	the information commons and i think the two master's issue is a tricky one when i'm trying to optimize
13224800	13231680	for very different kinds of things um where i have to sacrifice one for the other and i can't
13231680	13236960	find synergistic satisfies which one and if i have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholder
13237680	13241520	uh profit maximization and you know what what does that end up creating
13243280	13250160	i think the ad model that silicon valley took um i think jaren laney or i don't know if you've
13250160	13256640	had him on the show but he has interesting assessment of the nature of the ad model um silicon
13256640	13263440	valley wanting to support capitalism and entrepreneurs to make things but uh also the
13263440	13268080	belief that information should be free and also the network dynamics where the more people you
13268080	13272880	got on you got increased value per user per capita as more people got on so you didn't want to do
13272880	13278160	anything to slow the rate of adoption um some places actually you know pay pal paying people
13278160	13283280	money to join the network because the uh value of the network would be there'd be a metcalflike
13283280	13289360	dynamic proportional to the square of the total number of users so um the ad model made sense of
13289440	13295760	how do we make it free but also be a business get everybody on but not really thinking about
13295760	13300320	what it would mean to and this is now the whole idea that if you aren't paying for the product
13300320	13306800	you are the product um if the if they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholder
13306800	13314000	maximize profit their customer is the advertiser the user who it's being built for is to do behavioral
13314000	13319920	mod for them for advertisers that's a whole different thing than that same type of tech
13319920	13324480	could have been if applied with a different business model or a different purpose um
13325680	13334480	i think there's because facebook and google and other information and communication platforms
13334480	13339360	end up harvesting data about user behavior that allows them to model who the people are
13339360	13345440	in a way that gives them more sometimes specific information and behavioral information than
13347600	13351840	even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer or a priest might have in a different setting they
13351840	13357120	basically are accessing privileged information there should be a fiduciary responsibility
13358000	13362800	and in normal fiduciary law if there's this principal agent thing if you are a
13364080	13368960	uh principal and i'm an agent on your behalf i don't have a game-theoretic relationship with
13368960	13372960	you right if you're sharing something with me and i'm the priest or i'm the therapist i'm never
13372960	13378960	going to use that information to try to sell you a used car or whatever the thing is but facebook is
13378960	13384240	gathering massive amounts of privileged information and using it to modify people's behavior for a
13384240	13388960	behavior that they didn't sign up for wanting the behavior but what the corporation did so i think
13390000	13395760	this is an example of the physical tech evolving in the context of the previous social tech
13395840	13400560	where it's being shaped in particular ways and here unlike Wikipedia that evolved for the
13401520	13407200	information commons this evolved for fulfilling particular agentic purpose most people when
13407200	13411200	they're on facebook think it's just a tool that they're using they don't realize it's an agent
13411200	13416960	right it is a corporation with a profit motive and and as i'm interacting with it it has a
13416960	13421600	goal for me different than my goal for myself and i might want to be on for a short period of time
13421600	13428000	its goal is maximize time on site and so there's a rivalry that is take but where there should be
13428000	13434880	a fiduciary contract i think that's actually a huge deal and i think if we said could we apply
13434880	13447840	facebook like technology to develop people's citizenry capacity right to develop their personal
13447840	13453840	health and well-being and habits as well as their cognitive understanding the complexity
13453840	13461360	with which they can process the health of their relationships that would be amazing to start
13461360	13468400	to explore and this is now the thesis that we started to discuss before is every time there is
13468400	13474080	a major step function in the physical tech it absolutes the previous social tech and the new
13474080	13479520	social tech has to emerge what i would say is that when we look at the nation state level of the
13479520	13486640	world today the more top-down authoritarian nation states are as the exponential tech started to
13486640	13492400	emerge the digital technology started to emerge they were in a position for better long-term
13492400	13498160	planning and better coordination and so the authoritarian state started applying the exponential
13498160	13502480	tech intentionally to make more effective authoritarian states and that's everything
13502480	13508160	from like an internet of things surveillance system going into machine learning systems to
13508160	13513680	the sesame credit system to all those types of things and so they're upgrading their social
13513680	13520880	tech using the exponential tech otherwise within a nation state like the us but democratic open
13520880	13526960	societies the countries the states are not directing the technology in a way that makes
13526960	13531680	a better open society meaning better emergent order they're saying well the corporations are
13531680	13536160	doing that and the state is doing the relatively little thing it would do aligned with the previous
13536160	13540000	corporate law that no longer is relevant because there wasn't fiduciary responsibility for things
13540000	13545120	like that there wasn't antitrust because this creates functional monopolies because of network
13545120	13550960	dynamics right where youtube has more users than bimio and every other video player together amazon
13550960	13555520	has a bigger percentage of market share than all of the other markets together you get one
13555520	13561120	big dog per vertical because of network effect which is a kind of organic monopoly that the previous
13561200	13566400	antitrust law didn't even have a place that wasn't a thing anti monopoly was only something that
13566400	13573120	emerged in the space of government contracts so um so what we see is the new exponential
13573120	13577520	technology is being directed by authoritarian nation states to make better authoritarian
13577520	13582880	nation states and by corporations to make more powerful corporations the powerful corporations
13582880	13586960	when we think about the scottish enlightenment when the idea of markets was being advanced the
13586960	13594080	modern kind of ideas of markets the biggest corporation was tiny compared to what the biggest
13594080	13600240	corporation today is so the asymmetry of it relative to people was tiny and the asymmetry now in
13600240	13604880	terms of the total technology it employs total amount of money total amount of information
13604880	13612320	processing is so many orders of magnitude and rather than there be demand for an authentic thing
13613280	13618640	that creates a basis for supply as supply started to get way more coordinated and powerful and the
13618640	13622640	demand wasn't coordinated because you don't have a labor union of all the customers working together
13622640	13626480	but you do have a coordination on the supply side supply started to recognize that it could
13626480	13630400	manufacture demand it could make people want shit that they didn't want before that maybe wouldn't
13630400	13634960	increase their happiness in a meaningful way might increase addiction addiction is a very good way
13634960	13643360	to manufacture demand and so as soon as manufactured demand started through this is the cool thing and
13643360	13648720	you have to have it for status or whatever it is the intelligence of the market was breaking
13648720	13652960	now it's no longer a collective intelligence system that is up regulating real desire for
13652960	13657280	things that are really meaningful you're able to hijack the lower angels of our nature rather
13657280	13661680	than the higher ones the addictive patterns drive those and have people want shit that doesn't
13661680	13667920	actually make them happier make the world better and so we really also have to we have to update
13667920	13673200	our theory of markets because a behavioral econ showed that homo economicus the rational actor
13673200	13677920	is not really a thing but particularly at greater and greater scale can't really be a thing
13677920	13682320	voluntarism isn't a thing where if my corporate if my company doesn't want to advertise on facebook
13682320	13686720	i just will lose to the companies that do because that's where all the fucking attention is and so
13686720	13690320	then i can say it's voluntary but it's not really if there's a functional monopoly
13691760	13697680	same if i'm going to sell on amazon or things like that so um what i would say is that these
13697680	13703840	corporations are becoming more powerful than nation states in some ways and
13707360	13714800	they are also debasing the integrity of the nation states the open societies so the democracies
13714800	13720720	are getting weaker as a result of exponential tech and the kind of new tech companies that are kind
13720720	13725360	of a new feudalism tech feudalism because it's not a democracy inside of a tech company or the
13725360	13731280	supply and demand relationship when you have manufactured demand and kind of monopoly type
13731280	13736720	functions and so we have basically a new feudalism controlling exponential tech and authoritarian
13736720	13742480	nation states controlling it and those attractors are both shitty and so i'm interested in the
13742480	13748880	application of exponential tech to making better social tech that makes emergent order possible
13749920	13755760	and where then that emergent order can bind and direct the exponential tech in fundamentally
13755760	13761920	healthy not x-risk oriented directions i think the relationship of social tech and physical tech
13761920	13766240	can make it i think we can actually use the physical tech to make better social tech but it's not
13766240	13771760	given that we do if we don't make better social tech then i think the physical tech empowers
13771760	13777280	really shitty social tech that is not a world that we want i don't know if it's a road we want to go
13777280	13782080	down but i tend to believe that the market will create exactly the thing you're talking about
13782080	13789600	which i feel like there's a lot of money to be made in creating a social tech
13791520	13796080	that creates a better citizen that creates a better human being
13796080	13805520	this this uh the your description of facebook and so on which is a system that creates addiction
13805520	13814640	which manufactures demand is not obviously inherently the consequence of the market like i
13814640	13819920	feel like that's the first stage of us like baby deer trying to figure out how to use the internet
13820480	13825600	i i feel like there's much more money to be made with something that creates
13827520	13834800	compersion and love honestly i mean i i really from we can have this i can make the business
13834800	13839680	case for it i don't know i don't think we want to really have that discussion but don't do you
13839680	13845120	have some hope that that's the case and i guess if not then how do we fix the system of markets
13845120	13851040	that work so well for the united states for so long like i said every social tech worked for a
13851040	13856800	while like tribalism worked well for two or three hundred thousand years i think social tech has to
13856800	13862720	keep evolving the social technologies with which we organize and coordinate our behavior have to
13862720	13868880	keep evolving as our physical tech does um so i think the thing that we call markets
13868880	13877280	of course we can try to say oh even biology runs on markets and but the thing that we call
13877280	13883920	markets the underlying theory homo economicist demand driving supply that thing broke it broke
13883920	13890480	with scale in particular um and a few other things so it needs updated in a really fundamental way
13891840	13895440	um i think there's something even deeper than making money happening
13896400	13898880	that in some ways will obsolete money making
13901600	13904240	i think capitalism is not about business
13906400	13910880	so if you think about business i'm going to produce a good or a service that people want
13910880	13915760	and bring it to the market so that people get access to that good or service that's the world
13915760	13922000	of business but that's not capitalism capitalism is the management and allocation of capital
13922960	13928320	which financial services was a tiny percentage of the total market has become a huge percentage of
13928320	13933280	the total market it's a different creature so if i was in business and i was producing a good
13933280	13937600	or service and i was saving up enough money that i started to be able to invest that money and gain
13937600	13943440	interest or do things like that i could start realizing i'm making more money on my money
13943440	13947360	than i'm making on producing the goods and services so i stop even paying attention to
13947360	13952000	goods and services and start paying attention to making money on money and how do i utilize
13952000	13957200	capital to create more capital and capital gives me more optionality because i can buy anything with
13957200	13962880	it than a particular good or service that only some people want um capitalism
13966160	13972160	more capital ended up meaning more control i could put more people under my employment i could buy
13972160	13978000	larger pieces of land novel access to resource mines and put more technology under my employment
13978000	13984960	so it meant increased agency and also increased control i think attentionalism is even more powerful
13987520	13994720	so rather than enslave people where the people kind of always want to get away and put in the
13994720	14000240	least work they can there's a way in which economic servitude was just more profitable than slavery
14000320	14004880	right have the people work even harder voluntarily because they want to get ahead
14005520	14008960	and nobody has to be there to whip them or control them or whatever
14010560	14017360	this is a cynical take but a meaningful take um so people
14019280	14026400	so capital is a being a way to influence human behavior right and yet where people still feel
14026480	14031760	free in some meaningful way they they're not feeling like uh they're going to be punished by
14031760	14035760	the state if they don't do something it's like punished by the market be a homelessness or
14035760	14040080	something but the market is this invisible thing i can't put an agent on so it feels like free
14041040	14050240	and so if if you want to affect people's behavior and still have them feel free
14050240	14054960	capital ends up being a way to do that but i think affecting their attention is even deeper
14055680	14061760	because if i can affect their attention i can both affect what they want and what they believe
14061760	14065760	and what they feel and we statistically know this very clearly facebook has done studies that
14065760	14072720	based on changing the feed it can change beliefs emotional dispositions etc and so i think there's
14072720	14079040	a way that the the harvest and directing of attention is even a more powerful system than
14079040	14083920	capitalism it is effective in capitalism to generate capital but i think it also generates
14083920	14095440	influence beyond what capital can do and so do we want to have some groups utilizing that type
14095440	14104720	of tech to direct other people's attention if so um towards what towards what metrics of what a good
14104720	14109200	civilization and good human life would be what's the oversight process what is the
14109920	14116480	transparency i can i can i can answer all the things you're mentioning uh i i can build i guarantee
14116480	14123040	you if i am not such a lazy ass i'll be part of the many people doing this as transparency and
14123040	14133360	control i'll get to giving control to individual people okay so maybe the corporation has coordination
14133360	14138800	on its goals that all of its customers or users together don't have so there's some asymmetry
14138800	14145920	where it's uh asymmetry of its goals but maybe i could actually help all of the customers to
14145920	14152480	coordinate almost like a labor union or whatever by informing and educating them adequately about
14152480	14157360	the effects the externalities on them if this is not toxic waste going into the ocean of the
14157360	14162800	atmosphere it's their their minds their beings their families their relationships um such that
14162800	14172000	they will in group change their behavior and um i think the i one way of saying what you're
14172000	14180640	saying i think is that you think that you can rescue homo economicus from uh the the rational
14180640	14184800	actor that will pursue all the goods and services and choose the best one at the best price the kind
14184800	14189680	of rand von mises hayek that you can rescue that from dan arielli and behavioral econ that says
14189680	14193600	that's actually not how people make choices they make it based on status hacking largely
14193600	14199600	whether it's good for them or not in the long term and the large asymmetric corporation can run
14199600	14204160	propaganda and narrative warfare that hits people's status buttons and their limbic hijacks and
14204160	14210320	their lots of other things in ways that they can't even perceive that are happening um they're not
14210320	14214560	paying attention to that the site is employing psychologists and split testing and whatever
14214560	14221040	else so you're saying i think we can recover homo economicus and not just through a single
14221040	14227120	like mechanism technology there's there's the uh not to keep mentioning the guy but platforms like
14227120	14236800	georogan and so on that that make help make viral the ways that the education of negative
14236800	14246480	externalities can become viral in this world so interestingly i actually agree with you that
14248000	14254800	got him that we four and a half hours in that we can tech can do some good all right well see
14254800	14259440	what you're talking about is the application of tech here broadcast tech where you can speak to a
14259440	14263440	lot of people and that's not going to be strong enough because the different people need spoken
14263440	14267120	too differently which means it has to be different voices that get amplified to those audiences more
14267120	14271680	like facebook's tech but nonetheless we'll start with broadcast tech plants the first seed and then
14271680	14277600	the word of mouth is a powerful thing you need to do the first broadcast shotgun and then it like
14277600	14282960	lands a catapult of whatever i don't know what the right weapon is but then it just spreads the word
14282960	14287760	of mouth through all kinds of tech including facebook so let's come back to the fundamental
14287760	14294640	thing the fundamental thing is we want to kind of order at various scales from the conflicting
14294640	14302720	parts of ourselves actually having more harmony than they might have to family extended family
14302720	14308240	local all the way up to global we want emergent order where our choices
14310480	14317040	have more alignment right we want that to be emergent rather than imposed or rather than
14317120	14320320	we want fundamentally different things or make totally different sense of the world where
14321280	14327360	warfare of some kind becomes the only solution emergent order requires us in our choice making
14327360	14333120	requires us being able to have related sense making and related meaning making processes
14334880	14342560	can we apply digital technologies and exponential tech in general to try to increase the capacity
14342560	14346320	to do that where the technology called a town hall the social tech that we'd all get together and
14346320	14351760	talk obviously is very scale limited and it's also oriented to geography rather than networks of
14351760	14357920	aligned interest can we build new better versions of those types of things and going back to the
14358800	14364000	idea that a democracy or participatory governance depends upon comprehensive education in the
14364000	14368160	science of government which include being able to understand things like asymmetric information
14368160	14374080	warfare on the side of governments and how the people can organize adequately can you utilize
14374080	14380640	some of the technologies now to be able to support increased comprehensive education of the people
14381200	14386240	and maybe comprehensive informativeness so both fixing the decay in both education and the fourth
14386240	14392640	estate that have happened so the people can start self-organizing to then influence the corporations
14392640	14398000	the nation states to do different things and or build new ones themselves yeah fundamentally
14398000	14402720	that's the thing that has to happen we the exponential tech gives us a novel problem
14402720	14408160	landscape that the world never had the nuke gave us a novel problem landscape and so that required
14408160	14413600	this whole breton woods world the exponential tech gives us a novel problem landscape our
14413600	14418640	existing problem solving processes aren't doing a good job we have had more countries get nukes we
14418640	14423440	haven't a nuclear deproliferation we haven't achieved any of the un sustainable development goals
14424400	14428800	we haven't kept any of the new categories of tech for making arms races so our global coordination
14428880	14435120	is not adequate to the problem landscape so we need fundamentally better problem solving processes a
14435120	14439520	market or a state is a problem solving process we need better ones that can do the speed and
14439520	14444800	scale of the current issues right now speed is one of the other big things is that by the time we
14444800	14450320	regulated ddt out of existence or cigarettes not for people under 18 they'd already killed so many
14450320	14456320	people and we let the market do the thing but as elon has made the point that won't work for ai by
14456320	14461840	the time we recognize afterwards that we have an autopoietic ai that's a problem you won't be able
14461840	14466080	to reverse it that there's a number of things that when you're dealing with tech that is either
14466080	14471440	self replicating and disintermediate humans to keep going doesn't need humans to keep going
14471440	14478000	or you have tech that just has exponentially fast effects your regulation has to come early it can't
14478000	14483440	come after the effects have happened the negative effects have happened if because the negative
14483440	14488000	effects could be too big too quickly so we basically need new problem solving processes that do
14489120	14494960	better at being able to internalize externality solve the problems on the right timescale and the
14494960	14502160	right geographic scale and those new processes to not be imposed have to emerge from people wanting
14502160	14507760	them and being able to participate in their development which is what i would call kind of a
14507760	14512480	new cultural enlightenment or renaissance that has to happen where people start understanding
14512480	14518960	the new power that exponential tech offers the way that it is actually damaging
14519680	14525520	current governance structures that we care about and creating an extra-risk landscape but could also
14525520	14532320	be redirected towards more protopic purposes and then saying how do we rebuild new social
14532320	14537280	institutions what are adequate social institutions where we can do participatory governance at scale
14537280	14545040	in time and how can the people actually participate to build those things i the the solution that i
14545040	14554160	see working requires a process like that and the result maximizes love so again elan would be right
14554160	14561600	that love is the answer let me take it back from the scale of societies to the scale that's far far
14561600	14569040	more important which is the scale of family you've written a blog post about your dad
14569920	14578800	we have various flavors of relationships with our fathers what have you learned about life when
14578800	14586640	your dad well people can read the blog post and see a lot of individual things that i learned that
14586640	14595280	i really appreciated um if i was to kind of summarize at a high level um i had a really
14595280	14603920	incredible dad like very very unusually uh positive set of experiences he was committed
14603920	14608880	we were homeschooled and he was committed to work from home to be available and like prioritize
14608880	14620080	fathering in a really deep way um and you know as a super gifted super loving very unique man
14620080	14624000	he also had his unique issues that were part of what crafted the unique brilliance and those
14624000	14630560	things often go together and i say that because i think i had i had some unusual gifts and also
14630560	14636400	some unusual difficulties and i think it's useful for everybody to know their path probably has
14636400	14645280	both of those um but uh if i was to say kind of at the the essence of one of the things my dad
14645280	14652800	taught me across a lot of lessons was like a the intersection of self-empowerment ideas and practices
14652800	14659920	that self-empower towards collective good uh towards some virtuous purpose beyond the self
14660720	14665840	and he both said that a million different ways taught it in a million different ways when we
14665840	14672240	were doing construction and he was teaching me how to uh build a house we were putting the wires
14672240	14676480	to the walls before the drywall went on he made sure that the way that we put the wires through
14676480	14683600	is beautiful like the the that the height of the holes was similar that we twisted the wires in a
14683600	14688320	particular way that and it's like no one's ever going to see it and he's like if a job's worth
14688320	14692240	doing it's worth doing well and excellence is its own reward and those types of ideas and if there
14692240	14696000	was a really shitty job to do he'd say see the job do the job stay out of the misery just don't
14696000	14701920	indulge any negativity do the things that need done and so there's like a there's an empowerment
14701920	14711840	and a nobility together um and yeah extraordinarily fortunate is there ways you think you could have
14711840	14720480	been a better song is there things you regret it's an interesting question let me get first say
14721360	14729680	just as a bit of a criticism that uh what kind of man do you think you are not wearing a suit and
14729680	14738320	tie a real man should exactly uh i grew with your dad on that point you mentioned offline that uh he
14738320	14746240	suggested a real man should wear a suit and tie but outside of that is there ways you could have
14746240	14753600	been a better son maybe next time on your show i'll wear a suit and tie my dad would be happy about
14753600	14766960	that um please
14772400	14778960	i can answer the question later in life not early um i had just a huge amount of respect
14778960	14784320	and reverence for my dad when i was young so i was asking myself that question a lot so i
14784320	14793600	learned a lot of things i knew that i wasn't seeking to apply um there was a phase when i went
14793600	14801120	through my kind of individuation differentiation where i had to make him excessively wrong about
14801200	14809680	too many things um i don't think i had to but i did and he had a lot of kind of non-standard
14809680	14818320	model beliefs about things whether early kind of ancient civilizations or ideas on evolutionary
14818320	14827280	theory or alternate models of physics and and they weren't irrational but they didn't all have the
14827360	14836400	standard of epistemic proof that i would need and i went through and some of them were kind of
14836400	14848240	spiritual ideas as well i went through a phase in my early 20s where i kind of had that the
14848240	14857680	attitude that Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens has that can kind of be um like excessively
14857680	14864240	certain and sanctimonious uh applying their reductionist philosophy of science to everything and
14864240	14870160	um i'm kind of brutally dismissive uh i'm embarrassed by that phase um
14870400	14878160	i'm not to say anything about those men in their path but for myself and so during that time
14879120	14885760	i was more dismissive of my dad's epistemology than i would have liked to have been
14886560	14890320	i gotta correct that later apologize for it but that's the first thought that came to mind
14891840	14899440	you've written the following i've had the experience countless times making love watching
14899440	14908160	a sunset listening to music feeling the breeze that i would sign up for this whole life and all
14908160	14915280	of its pains just to experience this exact moment this is a kind of worldless knowing
14917120	14923040	it's the most important and real truth i know that experience itself is infinitely meaningful
14923840	14929760	and pain is temporary and seen clearly even the suffering is filled with beauty
14930560	14938160	i have experienced countless lives worth of moments worthy of life such an unreasonable fortune
14940320	14946080	a few words of gratitude from you beautifully written is there some beautiful moments now you
14946080	14951920	have uh experienced countless lives worth of those moments but there's some things that uh
14954000	14960960	if you could uh in your darker moments you can go to to relive to remind yourself that the whole
14960960	14968720	ride is worthwhile maybe skip the making love part we don't know about that i mean i i feel
14968720	14983440	i feel unreasonably fortunate that it is a such a humongous list because i mean i feel fortunate
14983440	14988880	to have like had exposure to practices and philosophies in a way of seeing things it makes
14988880	14994320	me see things that way so i can take responsibility for seeing things in that way and not taking for
14994320	14998480	granted really wonderful things but i can't take credit for being exposed to the philosophies that
14998560	15009440	even gave me that possibility um you know it's not just with my wife it's with every person who
15009440	15014320	i really love when we're talking i look at their face i in the context of a conversation feel
15014320	15019840	overwhelmed by how lucky i am to get to know them and like that there's never been someone like them
15019840	15023280	in all of history and there never will be again and then they might be gone tomorrow i might be
15023280	15027760	gone tomorrow and like i get this moment with them and when you take in the uniqueness of that
15027760	15030320	fully and the beauty of it it's overwhelmingly beautiful
15033440	15041600	and you know i remember the first time i did a big dose of mushrooms and i was looking at a tree
15042160	15047040	for a long time and i was just crying with overwhelming how beautiful the tree was and
15047040	15050800	it was a tree outside the front of my house that i'd walked by a million times and never looked at
15050800	15057840	like this and it wasn't the dose of mushrooms where i was hallucinating like where the tree was
15057840	15062320	purple like the tree still looked like if i had to describe it it's green and it has leaves looks
15062320	15068560	like this but it was way fucking more beautiful like like capturing than it normally was and i'm
15068560	15073200	like why is it so beautiful if i would describe it the same way and i realized i had no thoughts
15073200	15078400	taking me anywhere else yeah like what it seemed like the mushrooms were doing was just actually
15078400	15081760	shutting the narrative off that would have me be distracted so i could really see the tree
15082640	15085520	and then i'm like fuck when i get off these mushrooms i'm gonna practice seeing the tree
15086160	15090640	because it's always that beautiful and i just miss it and so i practice being with it and
15090640	15095680	quieting the rest of the mind and then being like wow and if it's not mushrooms like people have
15095680	15102240	peak experiences where they'll see life and how incredible it is it's always there it's funny
15102240	15109120	that i had this exact same experience and the un quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting alone
15109120	15115120	and looking at a tree and exactly as you described it appreciating the beauty undistorted beauty of
15115120	15122320	it and it's funny to me that here's two humans very different with very different journeys
15122320	15126000	where at some moment in time both looking at a tree like idiots for hours
15126640	15133920	and just in awe and and happy to be alive and yeah and uh even just that moment alone is
15133920	15140080	is worth living for but you did say humans and we have a moment together as two humans
15140960	15147840	and you mentioned shots well i have to ask what uh what are we looking at when i went to go
15148720	15152480	get a smoothie before coming here i got you a keto smoothie that you didn't want because
15152560	15157520	you're not just keto but fasting but i saw the thing with you and your dad where you did
15158080	15163440	shots together yeah and this place happened to have shots of um ginger turmeric cayenne
15164800	15169040	juice of some kind and so i with some Himalayan salt i didn't necessarily plan it for being on the
15169040	15174320	show but i just brought it wow but we can we can do it that way i think we should we shall uh
15174400	15181600	we shall toast like heroes daniel it's a huge honor what do we toast to what do we toast to
15181600	15187280	we toast to this moment this this this unique moment that we get to share together i'm very
15187280	15191840	grateful to be here in this moment with you and uh yeah i'm grateful that you invited me here
15192560	15198240	we met for the first time and i will never be the same for the good and the bad
15199120	15201120	i am
15202720	15207440	that is really interesting that feels way healthier than the vodka my dad and i were drinking
15209200	15214000	so i feel like a better man already daniel this is one of the best conversations i've ever had
15214000	15219360	i can't wait to have many more likewise this has uh it's been an amazing experience thank you for
15219360	15225280	wasting all your time today i want to say in terms of what you're mentioning about like the
15226240	15232960	that you work in machine learning and the optimism that wants to look at the issues but
15232960	15238160	wants to look at how this increased technological power could be applied to solving them and that
15239040	15244080	even thinking about the broadcast of like can i help people understand the issues better and
15244080	15250720	help organize them like fundamentally you're you're oriented like wikipedia what i see to
15250720	15256480	really try to tend to the information commons without another agentic interest distorting it
15257760	15259520	and for you to be able to get guys like
15261280	15267040	lee smolen and roger pennrose and like the the the greatest thinkers of that are alive and you
15267040	15271440	know have them on the show and most people would never be exposed to them and talk about it in a
15271440	15276320	way that people can understand uh i think it's an incredible service i think you're doing great
15276320	15282080	work so i was really happy to hear from you thank you daniel thanks for listening to this
15282080	15287600	conversation with daniel schmockdenberger and thank you to ground news net suite for
15287600	15294480	sigmatic magic spoon and better help check them out in the description to support this podcast
15295440	15301280	and now let me leave you with some words from albert einstein i know not with what weapons
15301280	15306720	world war three will be fought but world war four will be fought with sticks and stones
15307920	15317200	thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
