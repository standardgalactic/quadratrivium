00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
The following is a conversation with Richard Rangham,

00:03.240 --> 00:05.720
a biological anthropologist at Harvard,

00:05.720 --> 00:08.240
specializing in the study of primates

00:08.240 --> 00:12.200
and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,

00:12.200 --> 00:15.160
and other aspects of ape and human behavior

00:15.160 --> 00:18.360
at the individual and societal level.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.960
He began his career over four decades ago

00:20.960 --> 00:22.320
working with Jane Goodall

00:22.320 --> 00:24.560
and studying the behavior of chimps.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.320
And since then, has done a lot of seminal work

00:27.320 --> 00:28.640
on human evolution

00:28.800 --> 00:30.840
and has proposed several theories

00:30.840 --> 00:33.480
for the roles of fire and violence

00:33.480 --> 00:36.680
in the evolution of us, hairless apes,

00:36.680 --> 00:39.560
otherwise known as homo sapiens.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.760
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.960
in the description.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.040
And now, here's my conversation with Richard Rangham.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.160
You've said that we are much less violent

00:53.160 --> 00:57.080
than our close living relatives, the chimps.

00:57.080 --> 01:01.040
Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are

01:01.040 --> 01:04.560
and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?

01:04.560 --> 01:06.040
Well, I haven't said exactly

01:06.040 --> 01:08.000
that we're less violent than chimps.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.320
What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.320
One stems from proactive aggression

01:13.320 --> 01:15.640
and the other stems from reactive aggression.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.880
Proactive aggression is planned aggression.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.800
Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.

01:20.800 --> 01:24.600
It's reactive because it takes place

01:24.600 --> 01:26.880
in seconds after the threat.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.920
And the thing that is really striking about humans

01:30.920 --> 01:33.840
compared to our close relatives

01:33.840 --> 01:38.840
is the great reduction in the degree of reactive aggression.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.240
So we are far less violent than chimps

01:43.240 --> 01:46.760
when prompted by some relatively minor threat

01:46.760 --> 01:48.680
within our own society.

01:48.680 --> 01:53.680
And the way I judge that is with not super satisfactory data,

01:54.520 --> 01:59.520
but the study which is particularly striking

01:59.520 --> 02:04.520
is one of people living as hunter-gatherers

02:05.240 --> 02:09.760
in a really upsetting kind of environment,

02:09.760 --> 02:14.760
namely people in Australia living in a place

02:15.360 --> 02:19.200
where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.560
There's a lot of domestic violence.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.800
It's all a sort of a society that is as bad

02:29.240 --> 02:30.560
from the point of view of violence

02:30.560 --> 02:33.160
as an ordinary society can get.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.960
There's excellent data on the frequency

02:36.960 --> 02:39.240
with which people actually have physical violence

02:39.240 --> 02:40.440
and hit each other.

02:40.440 --> 02:45.080
And we can compare that to data from several different sites

02:45.080 --> 02:50.080
comparing, we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence

02:50.440 --> 02:54.040
and the difference is between two and three orders

02:54.040 --> 02:57.560
of magnitude, the frequency with which chimps and bonobos

02:57.560 --> 03:00.760
hit each other, chase each other, charge each other,

03:00.760 --> 03:05.760
physically engage is some day between 500 and 1,000 times

03:06.400 --> 03:08.440
higher than in humans.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.960
So there's something just amazing about us

03:09.960 --> 03:13.680
and this has been recognized for centuries.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.040
Aristotle drew attention to the fact

03:16.040 --> 03:19.080
that we behave in many ways like domesticated animals

03:19.080 --> 03:21.360
because we're so unviolent.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.360
But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements

03:26.840 --> 03:31.000
of this 20th century, the First and Second World War

03:31.000 --> 03:33.680
and much else besides.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.160
And that is all proactive violence.

03:37.160 --> 03:42.160
All of that is gangs of people making deliberate decisions

03:43.480 --> 03:46.080
to go off and attack in circumstances

03:46.080 --> 03:49.640
which ideally the attackers are going to be able

03:49.640 --> 03:52.440
to make their kills and then get out of there.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.960
In other words, not face confrontation.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.800
That's the ordinary way that arm is trying to work.

03:58.800 --> 04:03.800
And there it turns out that humans and chimpanzees

04:04.920 --> 04:07.160
are in a very similar kind of state.

04:07.160 --> 04:11.000
That is to say, if you look at the rate of death

04:11.000 --> 04:13.800
from chimpanzees conducting proactive

04:13.840 --> 04:17.200
co-editionary violence, it's very similar

04:17.200 --> 04:20.320
in many ways to what you see in humans.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.600
So when not downregulated with proactive violence,

04:23.600 --> 04:25.760
it's just this reactive violence

04:25.760 --> 04:29.200
that is strikingly reduced in humans.

04:29.200 --> 04:33.240
So chimpanzees also practice kind of tribal warfare.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.080
Indeed they do, yeah.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.960
So this was discovered first in 1974.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.000
It was observed first in 1974,

04:41.960 --> 04:43.640
which was about the time

04:43.640 --> 04:48.640
that the first major study of chimpanzees in the wild

04:49.480 --> 04:54.480
by Jane Goodall had been going for something like five years

04:55.480 --> 05:00.480
during, of the chimpanzees being observed wherever they went.

05:02.760 --> 05:07.000
Until then they'd been observed at a feeding station

05:07.000 --> 05:11.040
where Jane was luring them in to be observed

05:11.040 --> 05:12.920
by seeing bananas, which is great.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.320
She learned a lot, but she didn't learn

05:15.320 --> 05:17.920
what was happening at the edges of their ranges.

05:17.920 --> 05:22.480
So five years later, it became very obvious

05:22.480 --> 05:25.640
that there was hostile relationships between groups.

05:25.640 --> 05:30.560
And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form

05:30.560 --> 05:32.600
of the kind of hostile relationships

05:32.600 --> 05:33.720
that you see in many animals,

05:33.720 --> 05:38.720
which is a bunch of chimps in this case shouting

05:40.360 --> 05:43.920
at a bunch of other chimps on their borders.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.560
But dramatically, in addition to that,

05:47.560 --> 05:49.320
there is a second kind of interaction.

05:49.320 --> 05:54.320
And that is when a party of chimpanzees

05:55.960 --> 05:59.600
makes a deliberate venture

05:59.600 --> 06:02.240
to the edge of their territory,

06:02.240 --> 06:07.240
silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.760
And what they're searching for is a lone individual.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.160
So I've been with chimps

06:13.160 --> 06:17.960
when they've heard a lone individual under these circumstances

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
or what they think is a lone one

06:19.960 --> 06:23.040
and they touch each other and look at each other

06:23.040 --> 06:26.120
and then charge forward, very excited.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.880
And then while they're charging,

06:30.920 --> 06:35.560
all of a sudden, the place where they heard a lone call

06:35.560 --> 06:37.560
erupts with a volley of calls.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.880
It was just one calling out of a larger party.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.520
And our chimps put on the brakes

06:43.520 --> 06:46.720
and scoot back for safety into their own territory.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.720
But if in fact they do find a lone individual

06:49.720 --> 06:52.480
and they can sneak up to them,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.040
then they make a deliberate attack.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.560
They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting

06:57.560 --> 07:00.680
and then they impose terrible damage,

07:00.680 --> 07:03.080
which typically ends in a kill straight away,

07:03.080 --> 07:08.080
but it might end up with the victim so damaged

07:08.360 --> 07:13.360
that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.400
So that was a very dramatic discovery

07:15.400 --> 07:20.400
because it really made people realize for the first time

07:20.520 --> 07:22.800
that Conrad Lorenz had been wrong

07:22.800 --> 07:26.920
when in the 1960s, in his famous book On Aggression,

07:26.920 --> 07:30.800
he said warfare is restricted to humans.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.080
Animals do not deliberately kill each other.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.160
Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals

07:35.160 --> 07:36.400
that deliberately kill each other

07:36.400 --> 07:39.680
and they always do so under essentially the same circumstances

07:39.680 --> 07:44.200
which is when they feel safe doing it.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.880
So humans feel safe doing it when they got a weapon.

07:48.280 --> 07:52.400
Animals feel safe when they have a coalition,

07:52.400 --> 07:54.840
a coalition that has overwhelming power

07:54.840 --> 07:56.720
compared to the victim.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.440
And so wolves will do that and lions will do that

07:59.440 --> 08:00.880
and hyenas will do that

08:00.880 --> 08:04.320
and chimpanzees will do it and humans do it too.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.480
Can they pull themselves into something

08:08.480 --> 08:10.600
that looks more like a symmetric war

08:10.600 --> 08:12.680
as opposed to an asymmetric one?

08:12.680 --> 08:15.320
So accidentally engaging on the lone individual

08:15.320 --> 08:17.240
and getting the cells into trouble?

08:17.240 --> 08:21.400
Are they more aggressive in avoiding these kinds of battles?

08:21.400 --> 08:24.080
No, they're very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,

08:24.120 --> 08:27.720
but occasionally they can make a mistake.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.360
But so far there have been no observations

08:32.360 --> 08:34.760
of anything like a battle in which

08:34.760 --> 08:37.320
both sides maintain themselves.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.320
And I think you can very confidently say

08:40.320 --> 08:42.800
that overwhelmingly what happens is that

08:42.800 --> 08:45.120
if they discover that there's several individuals

08:45.120 --> 08:48.320
on the other side, then both sides retreat.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.360
Nobody wants to get hurt.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.080
What they want to do is to hurt others.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.680
So you mentioned Jane Goodall, you've worked with her.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.160
What was it like working with her?

08:58.160 --> 08:59.760
What have you learned from her?

09:01.120 --> 09:04.960
Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person

09:04.960 --> 09:09.720
who she famously began her studies

09:09.720 --> 09:14.720
not as a qualified person in terms of education,

09:16.320 --> 09:19.640
but qualified only by enthusiasm

09:19.640 --> 09:24.320
and considerable experience even in her early 20s with nature.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.720
So she's courageous in the sense of being able

09:28.720 --> 09:32.080
to take on challenges.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.400
The thing that is very impressive about her

09:34.400 --> 09:39.880
is her total fidelity to the observations,

09:40.920 --> 09:45.920
very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,

09:46.800 --> 09:48.520
waiting until they mount up

09:48.520 --> 09:50.600
and you've really got a confident picture,

09:52.160 --> 09:56.920
and tremendous attention to individuals.

09:56.920 --> 10:00.480
So that was an interesting problem from her point of view

10:00.480 --> 10:05.480
because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,

10:05.680 --> 10:09.480
this particular community of Casa Calo, about 60 individuals,

10:10.960 --> 10:14.760
so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.600
She was there initially with her mother

10:16.600 --> 10:20.520
and then alone for two or three years

10:20.520 --> 10:22.760
of really intense observation

10:22.760 --> 10:24.920
and then slowly joined by other people.

10:26.360 --> 10:31.360
What she discovered was that there were obvious differences

10:31.760 --> 10:34.680
in individual personality.

10:34.680 --> 10:39.160
And the difficulty about that was that when she reported this

10:39.160 --> 10:43.160
to the larger scientific world,

10:43.160 --> 10:46.000
initially her advisors at Cambridge,

10:47.560 --> 10:49.960
they said, well, we don't know how to handle that

10:49.960 --> 10:53.200
because you've got to treat all these animals

10:53.200 --> 10:55.040
as the same basically because

10:57.560 --> 11:00.560
there is no research tradition

11:00.560 --> 11:03.320
of thinking about personalities.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.800
Well, now, whatever it is, 60 years later,

11:07.920 --> 11:11.600
the study of personalities is a very rich part

11:11.600 --> 11:13.320
of the study of animal behavior.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.040
At any rate, the important point in terms of what was she like

11:18.040 --> 11:20.360
is that she stuck to her guns and she absolutely insisted

11:20.360 --> 11:25.360
that we have to show, describe in great detail,

11:25.360 --> 11:28.440
the differences in personality among these individuals

11:28.440 --> 11:30.480
and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologist

11:30.480 --> 11:32.720
to think about what it means.

11:32.720 --> 11:37.720
So what is the process of observation like this like?

11:37.960 --> 11:39.280
Observing the personality,

11:39.280 --> 11:43.920
but also observing in a way that's not projecting your beliefs

11:43.920 --> 11:48.840
about human nature or animal nature onto chimps,

11:48.840 --> 11:52.600
which is probably really tempting to project.

11:52.600 --> 11:55.960
So your understanding of the way the human world works,

11:55.960 --> 11:59.440
projecting that onto the chimp world.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.640
Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps

12:01.640 --> 12:05.240
because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior

12:05.240 --> 12:09.000
that it's very easy to make those projections.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.240
As you say, the process involves

12:13.440 --> 12:17.000
making very clear definitions of what a behavior is.

12:18.520 --> 12:23.520
Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,

12:24.320 --> 12:25.680
a bite and so on.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.360
And writing down every time these things happen

12:30.360 --> 12:32.720
and then slowly totting up the numbers of times

12:32.720 --> 12:36.680
that they happen from individual A towards individuals,

12:36.680 --> 12:41.640
B, C, D and E, so that you build up a very concrete picture

12:41.640 --> 12:43.800
rather than interpreting at any point

12:43.800 --> 12:45.640
and stopping and saying, well,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.400
they seem to be rather aggressive.

12:48.440 --> 12:53.360
So the formal system is that you build up a pattern

12:53.360 --> 12:57.440
of the relationships based on a description

12:57.440 --> 12:59.520
of the different types of interactions,

12:59.520 --> 13:02.040
the aggressive and the friendly interactions.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.040
And all of these are defined in concrete.

13:07.600 --> 13:12.280
And so from that, you extract a pattern of relationships.

13:12.280 --> 13:16.280
And the relationships can be defined as

13:18.600 --> 13:23.760
relatively friendly, relatively aggressive, competitive,

13:23.760 --> 13:27.440
based on the frequency of these types of interactions.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.000
And so one can talk in terms of individuals

13:31.040 --> 13:35.040
having a relationship which on the scores of friendliness

13:35.040 --> 13:38.160
is two standard deviations outside the mean.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.040
I mean, you know, it's-

13:41.040 --> 13:44.680
In which direction, sorry, both directions?

13:45.720 --> 13:48.920
Well, I mean, there will be obviously the friendly ones

13:48.920 --> 13:52.040
would be the ones who have exceptionally high rates

13:52.040 --> 13:54.480
of spending time close to each other,

13:54.480 --> 13:56.600
of touching each other in a gentle way,

13:56.600 --> 13:59.120
of grooming each other.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.120
And by the way, finding that those things

14:01.120 --> 14:03.440
are correlated with each other.

14:03.440 --> 14:08.360
So it's possible to define a friendship with a capital F

14:08.360 --> 14:10.160
in a very systematic way.

14:10.160 --> 14:14.800
And to compare that between individuals,

14:14.800 --> 14:18.800
but also between communities of chimpanzees

14:18.800 --> 14:21.120
and between different species.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.480
So that, you know, we can say that in some species,

14:23.480 --> 14:26.880
individuals have friends and others, they don't at all.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.720
What about just because there's different personalities

14:29.720 --> 14:31.920
and because they're so fascinating,

14:31.920 --> 14:33.640
what about sort of falling in love

14:33.640 --> 14:37.240
or forming friendships with chimps, you know?

14:37.240 --> 14:42.240
Like really, you know, connecting with them as an observer.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.360
What role does that play?

14:46.360 --> 14:48.000
Is you're tracking these individuals

14:48.000 --> 14:50.800
that are full of life and intelligence

14:50.800 --> 14:55.640
for long periods of time, plus as a human,

14:55.680 --> 14:58.160
especially in those days for Jane,

14:58.160 --> 15:00.320
she's alone observing it.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.120
It gets lonely as a human.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.800
I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human

15:04.800 --> 15:07.760
being observed these other intelligent species.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.920
It's a very reasonable question.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.640
And of course, Jane in those early years,

15:11.640 --> 15:15.320
I think she's willing now to talk about the fact

15:15.320 --> 15:19.880
that she regrets to some extent how close she became.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.680
And the problem is not just from the humans,

15:23.680 --> 15:25.480
the problem is from the chimpanzees as well,

15:25.480 --> 15:30.320
because they do things that are extremely affectionate,

15:31.640 --> 15:35.040
if you like, you know, at one point,

15:35.040 --> 15:40.040
Jane offered a ripe fruit to a chimpanzee

15:40.720 --> 15:42.280
called David Greybeard.

15:42.280 --> 15:46.400
David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand

15:47.720 --> 15:48.840
as if to say thank you.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.200
And then I think he gave it back if I remember rightly.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.040
Yeah.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.080
No, thank you.

15:55.080 --> 15:55.920
All right.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.440
Oh, it's almost like thank you

15:59.440 --> 16:02.920
and returning the affection by giving the fruit

16:02.920 --> 16:04.240
if they did something like that.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.080
You know, it was a gentle squeeze.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.200
I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard

16:08.200 --> 16:10.280
as that occasionally has happened.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.520
Some chimps are aggressive to people

16:14.720 --> 16:16.480
and others are friendly.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.000
And the ones that are friendly tend to be

16:19.000 --> 16:20.320
rather sympathetic characters

16:20.320 --> 16:24.240
because they might be ones who are having problems

16:24.280 --> 16:26.440
in their own society.

16:26.440 --> 16:30.160
So Joe Mio in Gombe used to come and sit next to me

16:30.160 --> 16:33.840
quite often and he was having a hard time

16:33.840 --> 16:35.840
making it in that society,

16:35.840 --> 16:36.880
which I can describe to you

16:36.880 --> 16:39.760
in terms of the number of aggressive interactions if you want,

16:39.760 --> 16:43.360
but just to be informed about it.

16:43.360 --> 16:48.360
So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.720
And in the community that I've been working with

16:51.720 --> 16:53.360
in Uganda for the last 30 years,

16:53.400 --> 16:56.120
we try extremely hard to impress

16:56.120 --> 16:58.440
on all of the research students who come with us

16:58.440 --> 17:00.160
that it is absolutely vital

17:00.160 --> 17:02.800
that you do not fall into that temptation.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.920
Now, you know, we heard a story of one person

17:05.920 --> 17:09.360
who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.240
It's a very, very bad idea.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.400
Not because the chimp is going to do anything violent

17:16.400 --> 17:21.200
at the time, but because if they learn

17:21.200 --> 17:24.440
that humans are as weak physically

17:24.440 --> 17:26.080
as we are compared to them,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.800
then they can take advantage of it, us.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.800
And that's what happened in Gombe.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.400
So after Jane had done the very obvious thing

17:35.400 --> 17:38.840
when you're first engaged in this game

17:38.840 --> 17:41.600
of allowing the infants to approach her

17:41.600 --> 17:43.840
and then tickling them and playing with them,

17:45.560 --> 17:49.200
some of those infants had the personality

17:49.200 --> 17:53.360
of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.120
And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,

17:56.120 --> 17:59.280
who was violent on a regular basis

17:59.280 --> 18:00.760
towards humans when he was an adult

18:00.760 --> 18:01.720
and he was quite dangerous.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.960
I mean, he could easily have killed someone.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.120
In fact, he did kill one person.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.760
He killed a baby that he took from a mother,

18:09.760 --> 18:12.040
a human baby that he took off her hip

18:12.040 --> 18:13.880
when he met her on the path.

18:14.840 --> 18:18.720
So, you know, it's a reminder that we're dealing with

18:18.720 --> 18:22.080
a species that are rather human-like

18:22.080 --> 18:24.040
in the range of emotions they have,

18:24.040 --> 18:25.960
in the capacities they have,

18:25.960 --> 18:28.560
and even in the strength they have,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.720
they are, you know, in many ways stronger than humans.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.840
So it's a...

18:34.840 --> 18:36.800
You've got to be careful.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.600
So in the full range of friendliness and violence,

18:39.600 --> 18:43.480
the capacity for these very human things.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.360
Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.280
as we talked about, you know, that they will kill,

18:50.280 --> 18:52.120
they will kill not just strangers.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.680
They can kill other adults within their own group.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.720
They can kill babies that are strangers.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.280
They can kill babies in their own group.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.480
So, you know, this is a long-lived individual.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.720
Obviously, these killings can't have very often

19:06.720 --> 19:09.400
because otherwise they'd all be dead.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.440
And we're now finding that they can live to 50 or 60 years

19:13.440 --> 19:16.240
in the wild at relatively low population density

19:16.240 --> 19:17.360
because they're big animals,

19:17.360 --> 19:20.520
eating a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.960
So it doesn't happen all the time.

19:23.960 --> 19:28.840
With friendliness, they are very strong to support each other.

19:28.840 --> 19:33.840
They very much depend on their close friendships,

19:34.680 --> 19:38.960
which they express through physical contact.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.680
And particularly through grooming.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.760
So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another

19:45.760 --> 19:48.320
and might present for grooming,

19:48.320 --> 19:52.120
a very common way of starting, turning their back

19:52.120 --> 19:53.880
or presenting an arm or something like that.

19:53.880 --> 19:57.880
And the other just riffles their fingers through the hair.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.520
And that's partly just soothing.

20:00.520 --> 20:04.400
And it's partly looking for parasites,

20:04.400 --> 20:05.800
but mostly it's just soothing.

20:05.800 --> 20:06.640
Yes.

20:07.280 --> 20:12.080
The point about this is it can go on for half an hour.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.480
It can go on for sometimes even an hour.

20:15.480 --> 20:20.080
So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.760
When did your interest in this one particular aspect

20:25.760 --> 20:29.000
of chimp come to be, which is violence?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.320
When did the study of violence in chimps

20:32.320 --> 20:34.520
become something you're deeply interested in?

20:35.520 --> 20:40.520
Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,

20:41.520 --> 20:43.040
I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall

20:43.040 --> 20:46.200
and was studying feeding behavior.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.080
But during that time, we were seeing,

20:49.080 --> 20:52.440
and I say we because there were half a dozen

20:52.440 --> 20:55.840
research students all in her camp,

20:58.440 --> 21:02.360
we were discovering that chimps had this capacity

21:02.400 --> 21:05.080
for violence.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.520
The first kill happened during that time,

21:07.520 --> 21:10.040
which was of an infant and a neighboring group.

21:11.720 --> 21:15.280
And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.880
And this was the start of my interest

21:18.880 --> 21:21.840
because it was such chilling evidence

21:21.840 --> 21:26.840
of an extraordinary similarity between chimps and humans.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.800
Now, at that time, we didn't know very much

21:31.800 --> 21:35.560
about how chimpanzees and humans were related.

21:35.560 --> 21:41.040
Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three big black hairy things

21:41.040 --> 21:45.040
that live in the African forests and eat fruits

21:45.040 --> 21:49.760
and leaves when they can't find fruits and walk on their knuckles.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.320
And they all look rather similar to each other.

21:51.320 --> 21:54.320
So they seem as though those three species,

21:54.840 --> 21:56.720
chimps and gorillas and bonobos,

21:56.720 --> 21:59.400
should all be each other's closest relatives.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.520
And humans are something rather separate.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.640
And so any of them would be of interest to us.

22:04.640 --> 22:08.520
Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true

22:08.520 --> 22:10.440
and that there's a special relationship

22:10.440 --> 22:13.400
between humans and chimpanzees.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.920
But at the time, even without knowing that,

22:15.920 --> 22:18.440
it was obvious that there was something very odd

22:18.440 --> 22:22.760
about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered

22:22.840 --> 22:25.440
they were making tools.

22:25.440 --> 22:29.080
She had seen that they were hunting meat.

22:29.080 --> 22:33.200
She had seen that they were sharing the meat among each other.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.200
She had seen that the societies

22:35.200 --> 22:37.320
were dominated politically by males,

22:37.320 --> 22:38.680
coalitions of males.

22:38.680 --> 22:40.480
All of these things, of course, resonate

22:40.480 --> 22:43.200
so closely with humans.

22:43.200 --> 22:47.440
And then it turns out that in contrast

22:47.440 --> 22:50.120
to conventional wisdom at the time,

22:50.120 --> 22:53.240
the chimpanzees were capable of hunting

22:53.240 --> 22:55.320
and killing members of neighboring groups.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.440
Well, at that point, the similarities

23:00.440 --> 23:04.640
between chimps and humans become less a matter

23:04.640 --> 23:09.200
of sort of sheer intellectual fascination

23:09.200 --> 23:11.560
than something that has a really deep meaning

23:11.560 --> 23:14.600
about our understanding of ourselves.

23:15.640 --> 23:19.760
I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans

23:19.760 --> 23:22.960
as a species apart from the rest of nature

23:22.960 --> 23:24.800
because we are so peculiar.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.480
But when it turns out that, as it turns out,

23:28.480 --> 23:30.000
one of our two closest relatives

23:31.800 --> 23:34.840
has got these features that we share

23:34.840 --> 23:37.720
and that one of the features is something

23:37.720 --> 23:42.640
that is the most horrendous, as well as fascinating,

23:42.640 --> 23:46.440
aspect of human behavior, then how can you resist

23:46.440 --> 23:49.320
just trying to find out what's going on?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.640
So I have to say this.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.480
I'm not sure if you're familiar with the man,

23:54.480 --> 23:56.360
but fans of this podcast are.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.960
So we're talking about chimps, we're talking about violence.

23:59.960 --> 24:04.320
My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan, is a big fan of those things.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.160
I'm a big fan of these topics.

24:06.160 --> 24:10.160
I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.

24:10.160 --> 24:15.160
So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration

24:16.640 --> 24:19.600
of violence and the relations between chimps

24:19.600 --> 24:20.920
so interesting?

24:20.920 --> 24:24.000
What can they teach us about ourselves?

24:26.200 --> 24:29.800
Until we had this information about chimpanzees,

24:29.800 --> 24:34.800
it was possible to believe that the psychology

24:37.560 --> 24:42.560
behind warfare was totally the result

24:43.640 --> 24:48.640
of some kind of cultural, recent cultural innovation.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.600
It had nothing to do with our biology.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.240
Or if you like, that it's got something to do with sin

24:56.240 --> 24:59.480
and God and the devil and that sort of thing.

25:01.000 --> 25:06.000
But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully about it

25:08.200 --> 25:11.720
is that it seems undoubtedly the case

25:11.720 --> 25:16.720
that our evolutionary psychology has given us

25:17.720 --> 25:22.720
the same kind of attitude towards violence

25:22.720 --> 25:25.440
as occurred in chimpanzees.

25:26.480 --> 25:29.400
And in both species, it has evolved

25:29.400 --> 25:32.120
because of its evolutionary significance.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.640
In other words, because it's been helpful

25:34.640 --> 25:37.920
to the individuals who have practiced it.

25:37.920 --> 25:41.920
And now we know that, as I mentioned,

25:41.920 --> 25:44.160
other species do this as well.

25:44.160 --> 25:49.160
In fact, wolves, which this is a really

25:49.240 --> 25:54.240
kind of ironical observation, Conrad Lorenz,

25:54.240 --> 25:56.440
who I mentioned had been the person who thought

25:56.440 --> 26:00.720
that human aggression in the form of killing

26:00.720 --> 26:04.120
members of our own species was unique to our species.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.640
He was a great fan of wolves.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.040
He studied wolves.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.040
And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely

26:11.040 --> 26:15.840
to harm each other in spats among members

26:15.840 --> 26:17.480
of the same group.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.200
What happens is that one of them will roll over

26:19.200 --> 26:20.680
and present their neck, much as you see

26:20.680 --> 26:22.440
in a dog park nowadays.

26:22.440 --> 26:25.720
And the other might put their jaws on the neck

26:25.720 --> 26:26.640
but will not bite.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.320
Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves

26:30.320 --> 26:34.080
in the wild, then neighboring packs

26:34.080 --> 26:36.800
often go hunting for each other.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.360
They are in fierce competition.

26:39.360 --> 26:43.760
And as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves

26:43.760 --> 26:47.600
is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.440
Wow.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.280
So it's a really serious business.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.540
The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern

26:55.540 --> 26:57.920
of understanding animals in which

26:59.800 --> 27:02.080
you don't have an instinct for violence.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.160
What you have is an instinct, if you like,

27:05.160 --> 27:07.840
to use violence adaptively.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.760
And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.800
If the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.440
So some chimpanzee communities are much more violent

27:18.440 --> 27:22.240
than others because of things like the frequency

27:22.240 --> 27:25.880
with which a large party of males is likely

27:25.880 --> 27:28.120
to meet a lone victim.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.560
And that's going to depend on the local ecology.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.760
But so the overall answer to the question

27:35.840 --> 27:39.360
what a chimps teach us is that we have to take

27:39.360 --> 27:43.360
very seriously the notion that in humans,

27:44.280 --> 27:49.040
the tendency to make war is a consequence

27:49.040 --> 27:52.440
of a long-term evolutionary adaptation

27:52.440 --> 27:55.120
and not just a military ideology

27:55.120 --> 27:59.360
or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.

28:00.440 --> 28:03.080
And of course, a reading of history,

28:03.080 --> 28:07.200
a judicious reading of history fits that very easily

28:07.200 --> 28:09.920
because war is so commonplace.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.800
It's not an accident.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.640
So it's not a construction of human civilization.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.600
It's deeply within us, violence.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.480
So what's the difference between violence

28:20.480 --> 28:23.000
on the individual level versus group?

28:24.720 --> 28:26.960
It seems like with chimps and with wolves,

28:26.960 --> 28:30.840
there's something about the dynamic of multiple

28:31.840 --> 28:36.320
chimps together that increase the chance of violence.

28:36.320 --> 28:41.040
Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?

28:41.040 --> 28:45.040
Like would an individual be as violent

28:45.040 --> 28:48.000
as they might be as part of a group?

28:48.000 --> 28:51.240
If we're talking about killing,

28:51.240 --> 28:54.240
then violence in the sense of killing

28:54.240 --> 28:59.000
is very much associated with a group.

28:59.040 --> 29:03.960
And the reason is that individuals don't benefit

29:03.960 --> 29:05.600
by getting into a fight

29:05.600 --> 29:08.680
in which they risk being hurt themselves.

29:08.680 --> 29:12.680
So it's only when you have overwhelming power

29:12.680 --> 29:16.800
that the temptation to try and kill another victim

29:16.800 --> 29:20.640
rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.

29:23.400 --> 29:27.880
The average number of chimpanzee males

29:27.920 --> 29:30.520
that attack a single male

29:30.520 --> 29:33.200
in something like 50 observations

29:33.200 --> 29:36.040
that have accumulated in the last 50 years

29:36.040 --> 29:41.040
from various different study sites is eight, eight to one.

29:41.960 --> 29:46.840
Now sometimes it can go as low as three to one,

29:46.840 --> 29:49.520
but that's getting risky.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.680
But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.

29:51.680 --> 29:55.960
I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,

29:55.960 --> 29:57.120
another male on another foot,

29:57.120 --> 29:59.680
another male on an arm, another male on another arm.

29:59.680 --> 30:02.520
Now you have an immobilized victim

30:02.520 --> 30:06.360
with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.720
And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax

30:08.720 --> 30:10.200
and tear off his testicles

30:10.200 --> 30:12.560
and twist an arm until it breaks

30:12.560 --> 30:16.760
and do this, you know, appalling damage with no weapons.

30:18.480 --> 30:23.480
What is the way in which they prefer to commit the violence?

30:23.680 --> 30:24.880
Is there something to be said

30:24.880 --> 30:27.840
about like the actual process of it?

30:27.840 --> 30:29.400
Is there an artistry to it?

30:29.400 --> 30:32.400
So if you look at human warfare,

30:32.400 --> 30:34.240
there's different parts in history,

30:34.240 --> 30:37.840
preferred different kind of approaches to violence.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.280
It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.880
But just the nature of violence itself,

30:44.880 --> 30:47.560
sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,

30:47.560 --> 30:49.120
is it basically the same?

30:49.120 --> 30:53.440
You improvise, you immobilize the victim

30:53.440 --> 30:55.000
and they just rip off different parts

30:55.000 --> 30:56.800
of their body kind of thing.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.880
Yeah, you have to understand that these things

30:59.880 --> 31:04.880
are happening at high speed in thick vegetation, mostly.

31:06.160 --> 31:09.800
So they have not been filmed carefully.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.720
You know, we have a few little glimpses of them

31:13.720 --> 31:16.440
from one or two people like David Watts,

31:16.440 --> 31:17.960
who's got some great video,

31:17.960 --> 31:21.360
but we don't know enough to be able to say that.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.920
It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles

31:23.920 --> 31:28.480
that vary between communities, you know, cultural styles,

31:28.480 --> 31:32.880
but it is possible and one thing that is striking

31:32.880 --> 31:35.920
is that the number of times

31:35.920 --> 31:39.280
that an individual victim has been killed immediately

31:40.240 --> 31:45.240
has been higher in Kibali Forest in Uganda

31:45.240 --> 31:48.640
than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.200
It's conceivable, that's just chance.

31:50.200 --> 31:54.360
We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?

31:54.360 --> 31:55.440
I can't remember exact numbers,

31:55.440 --> 31:58.240
but you know, 10 versus 15 or something.

32:00.160 --> 32:05.160
So maybe they damage to the point of expecting a death

32:06.480 --> 32:09.160
in one place and they just finish it off in the other,

32:09.160 --> 32:12.120
but most likely that sort of difference

32:12.120 --> 32:17.120
will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.920
You know, human beings are able to conceive

32:19.920 --> 32:23.400
of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.

32:23.400 --> 32:27.520
Is there any of that for chimps

32:28.560 --> 32:30.520
when they're thinking about violence?

32:30.520 --> 32:33.560
Is violence, like what is the nature

32:33.560 --> 32:36.560
of their conception of violence, do you think?

32:36.560 --> 32:41.640
Do they realize they're taking another conscious being's life,

32:41.640 --> 32:45.960
or is it some kind of like optimization

32:45.960 --> 32:48.560
over the use of resources or something like that?

32:50.440 --> 32:53.840
I don't think it's, I can't think of any way to get it

32:53.840 --> 32:56.760
in answer to the question of what they know about that.

32:58.120 --> 33:03.120
I think that the way to think about the motivation

33:03.320 --> 33:08.320
is rather like the motivation in sex.

33:09.880 --> 33:14.640
So when males are interested in having sex with a female,

33:14.640 --> 33:17.080
whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,

33:18.880 --> 33:22.040
they don't think about the fact that what this is going to do

33:22.040 --> 33:23.320
is to lead to a baby.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.280
Mostly.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.120
You're right.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.600
Mostly what they're thinking about is,

33:27.600 --> 33:28.960
I want to get my end away.

33:29.920 --> 33:34.520
And I think that it's a similar kind of process

33:34.520 --> 33:35.800
with the chimps.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.720
What they are thinking about is,

33:38.720 --> 33:41.720
I want to kill this individual.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.560
And it's hard to imagine that

33:45.200 --> 33:47.640
taking the other individual's perspective

33:47.640 --> 33:50.240
and thinking about what it means for them to die

33:50.240 --> 33:51.800
is going to be an important part of that.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.800
In fact, there's reasons to think

33:53.800 --> 33:55.160
it should not be an important part of it

33:55.160 --> 33:56.120
because it might inhibit them.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.000
And they don't want to be inhibited.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.720
They're more efficient they are in doing this the better.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.640
But I think it's interesting to think about this

34:03.640 --> 34:04.760
whole motivational question

34:04.760 --> 34:09.760
because it does produce the sort of rather haunting thought

34:09.840 --> 34:11.800
that there has been selection

34:11.800 --> 34:15.640
in favor of enthusiasm about killing.

34:17.080 --> 34:22.080
And in our relatively gentle

34:22.080 --> 34:26.640
and deliberately moral society that we have today,

34:26.640 --> 34:29.080
it's very difficult for us to face the thought

34:29.080 --> 34:32.560
that in all of us,

34:32.560 --> 34:37.320
there might have been a residue

34:37.320 --> 34:38.800
and more than that,

34:38.800 --> 34:43.640
sort of an active potential for that thought

34:43.640 --> 34:46.640
of really enjoying killing someone else.

34:47.680 --> 34:52.680
But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously

34:52.680 --> 34:56.960
by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
that the ordinary human male would be delighted

35:03.640 --> 35:06.680
to be part of a group that was killing someone.

35:06.680 --> 35:10.440
What you've got to do is to be in a position

35:10.440 --> 35:14.320
where you're regarding the victim as dangerous

35:14.320 --> 35:16.440
and thoroughly hostile.

35:17.640 --> 35:21.080
But the pure enjoyment of violence.

35:21.080 --> 35:23.960
There's, I don't know if you know this historian,

35:23.960 --> 35:26.040
Dan Carlin, he has a podcast.

35:26.040 --> 35:31.040
He has an episode three, four hour episode

35:32.120 --> 35:34.960
that I recommend to others, it's quite haunting.

35:34.960 --> 35:38.400
But he takes us through an entire history.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.800
It's called painful tainment.

35:40.800 --> 35:45.800
The history of humans enjoying the murder of others

35:47.720 --> 35:48.920
in a large group.

35:48.920 --> 35:51.840
So like public executions were part of,

35:51.840 --> 35:53.640
long part of human history.

35:53.640 --> 35:58.280
And there's something that for some reason,

35:58.280 --> 36:03.400
humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.840
And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.

36:06.840 --> 36:11.440
For example, he said if it was possible to televise,

36:11.440 --> 36:14.480
to stream online, for example, the execution

36:14.480 --> 36:18.040
and the murder of somebody or even the torture of somebody

36:18.040 --> 36:23.040
that a very large fraction of the population on earth

36:23.280 --> 36:25.040
would not be able to look away.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.800
They'd be drawn to that somehow.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.800
As a very dark thought that we were drawn to that.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.080
So you think that's part of us in there somewhere,

36:34.080 --> 36:39.080
that selection that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing

36:39.400 --> 36:44.400
and the enjoyment of observing those in our tribe

36:46.440 --> 36:47.520
doing the killing.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.240
Yes, I mean, and that word you produced at the end

36:51.240 --> 36:56.240
is critical, I think, because it would be a little bit weird,

36:56.360 --> 37:00.840
I think, to imagine a lot of enjoyment

37:00.840 --> 37:03.760
about people in your own tribe being killed.

37:03.760 --> 37:04.600
Right.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.320
I don't think we're interested in violence

37:06.320 --> 37:08.440
for violence's sake that much.

37:09.920 --> 37:14.920
It's when you get these social boundaries set up.

37:15.440 --> 37:19.480
And in today's world, happily,

37:20.880 --> 37:24.080
we kind of are already one world.

37:25.720 --> 37:29.240
You have to dehumanise someone to get to the point

37:29.240 --> 37:34.240
where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe

37:34.240 --> 37:37.400
at some level, which is the whole human species.

37:37.400 --> 37:41.160
But in ancient times, that would not have been true,

37:41.160 --> 37:42.680
because in ancient times,

37:43.920 --> 37:47.320
there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers

37:47.320 --> 37:50.440
in which the appearance of a stranger

37:51.960 --> 37:56.960
would lead to an immediate response of shooting on site.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.640
Because what was human was the people

38:00.640 --> 38:03.280
that were in your society.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.160
And the other things that actually looked like us,

38:06.160 --> 38:09.760
and were human in that sense, were not regarded as human.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.680
So there was a kind of automatic dehumanisation

38:13.680 --> 38:16.200
of everybody that didn't speak our language

38:16.200 --> 38:20.680
or hadn't already somehow become recognised

38:20.680 --> 38:25.680
as sufficiently like us to escape the dehumanisation

38:27.040 --> 38:27.880
of the human population.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.000
And so hopefully the story of human history

38:30.000 --> 38:35.000
is that we are, that tribalism fades away,

38:35.280 --> 38:39.160
that our dehumanisation, the natural desire to dehumanise,

38:39.160 --> 38:42.320
or tendency to dehumanise groups

38:42.320 --> 38:45.840
that are not within this tribe decreases over time.

38:45.840 --> 38:49.800
And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.560
Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.

38:52.560 --> 38:56.280
And the great sort of concern, of course,

38:56.280 --> 39:00.440
is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts

39:00.440 --> 39:02.160
and then dehumanisation happens

39:02.160 --> 39:03.720
and then violence is released.

39:04.840 --> 39:09.600
As Hannah Arendt says, there currently is no known alternative

39:09.600 --> 39:14.400
to war as a means of settling really important conflicts.

39:16.560 --> 39:18.800
So if we look at the big picture,

39:18.800 --> 39:22.040
what role has violence or do you think violence

39:22.040 --> 39:25.040
has played in the evolution of homo sapiens?

39:25.040 --> 39:29.680
So we are quite an intelligent, got a beautiful,

39:29.680 --> 39:32.960
particular little branch on the evolutionary tree.

39:34.080 --> 39:39.080
What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?

39:41.840 --> 39:43.960
Well, I think that violence was responsible

39:43.960 --> 39:46.240
for creating your homo sapiens.

39:49.360 --> 39:54.360
And that raises the question of what homo sapiens is.

39:55.040 --> 39:55.880
Yes.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.720
Yeah, exactly.

39:58.720 --> 40:03.720
So nowadays people begin the sort of concept

40:06.640 --> 40:10.800
of what homo sapiens is by thinking about features

40:10.800 --> 40:12.360
that are very obviously different

40:12.360 --> 40:14.800
from all of the other species of homo.

40:15.680 --> 40:20.680
And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,

40:21.160 --> 40:24.240
our relatively small face, these are characteristics

40:24.240 --> 40:27.720
which are developed in a relatively modern way

40:27.720 --> 40:31.160
by about 170,000 years ago.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.960
Say, it's one of the earliest skulls in Africa

40:33.960 --> 40:36.560
that really captures that.

40:36.560 --> 40:41.560
But it has been argued that that is an episode

40:44.280 --> 40:49.280
in a process that has been started substantially earlier.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.240
And there's no doubt that that's true.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.200
Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing

40:55.200 --> 41:00.200
pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.480
And it goes back to 300,000 years ago.

41:03.480 --> 41:08.480
315, naturally, is the time, the best estimate of a date

41:08.680 --> 41:13.680
for a series of bones from Morocco that have been dated

41:14.880 --> 41:16.960
three or four years ago at that time

41:16.960 --> 41:21.480
and have been characterized as earliest homo sapiens.

41:21.480 --> 41:25.680
Now, at that point, they are only beginning

41:25.680 --> 41:27.840
the trend of sapienization.

41:27.840 --> 41:31.840
And that trend consists basically of grassinization,

41:31.840 --> 41:36.840
of making our ancestors less robust, shorter faces,

41:37.920 --> 41:40.720
smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,

41:40.720 --> 41:45.520
narrower face, thinner cranium,

41:45.520 --> 41:48.440
all these things that are associated

41:48.440 --> 41:50.960
with reduced violence.

41:51.880 --> 41:56.200
Okay, so that's saying, well, that's homo sapiens beginning.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.640
So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago

41:59.640 --> 42:01.640
because by 315,000 years ago,

42:01.640 --> 42:03.400
you've already got something recognizable.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.200
So you're more on that side of things

42:05.200 --> 42:06.760
that those are this gradual process.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.240
It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.

42:09.240 --> 42:13.600
It started like 400,000 years ago.

42:13.600 --> 42:14.440
And it's just-

42:14.440 --> 42:16.400
It started three to 400,000 years ago.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.960
And if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.

42:19.960 --> 42:23.600
And then if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.440
And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.

42:25.440 --> 42:26.360
It's all the way.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.160
It's just getting more and more like the moderns.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.800
So the question is, what happened

42:30.800 --> 42:32.600
between three and 400,000 years ago

42:32.600 --> 42:34.720
to produce homo sapiens?

42:34.720 --> 42:38.120
And I think we have a pretty good answer now.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.160
And the answer comes from violence.

42:40.160 --> 42:44.120
And the story begins by focusing on this question.

42:44.120 --> 42:49.120
Why is it that in the human species,

42:49.120 --> 42:51.560
we are unique among all primates

42:51.560 --> 42:55.560
in not having an alpha male in any group

42:56.960 --> 42:59.640
in the sense that what we don't have

42:59.640 --> 43:03.840
is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male?

43:05.280 --> 43:10.280
And the answer that has been portrayed

43:11.560 --> 43:15.960
most richly by Christopher Boehm

43:15.960 --> 43:18.760
and whose work I've elaborated on

43:18.800 --> 43:23.800
is that only in humans do you have a system

43:24.680 --> 43:28.640
by which any male who tries to bully others

43:29.840 --> 43:33.280
and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla

43:33.280 --> 43:35.280
or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo

43:35.280 --> 43:37.600
or an alpha baboon or anything like that,

43:37.600 --> 43:39.640
any male who tries to do that in humans

43:40.640 --> 43:44.520
gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.

43:46.800 --> 43:47.960
That coalition?

43:48.160 --> 43:51.560
I guess it's a really good picture of human society.

43:51.560 --> 43:52.880
Yes, I like it.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.680
Okay, so and that's the way all our societies work now.

43:55.680 --> 43:56.520
Yes.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.720
Because individuals try and be alpha

43:58.720 --> 44:00.080
and then they get taken out.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.040
Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves

44:02.040 --> 44:06.520
as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.

44:06.520 --> 44:08.440
Exactly, yes, exactly.

44:09.880 --> 44:14.600
Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.840
Well, what alpha males are are males

44:16.840 --> 44:20.640
who respond with high reactive violence

44:20.640 --> 44:22.760
to any challenge to their status.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.120
You see it all the time in primates.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.080
Some beta male thinks he's getting strong

44:28.080 --> 44:31.720
and maturing in wisdom and so on

44:31.720 --> 44:35.920
and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male

44:35.920 --> 44:39.400
and the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.680
Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes

44:41.680 --> 44:44.360
or over and then take an opportunity to attack him.

44:45.200 --> 44:50.200
All of these primates have got a high tendency

44:51.320 --> 44:53.200
for reactive aggression

44:53.200 --> 44:56.400
and that enables the possibility of alpha males.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.600
We don't, we have this great reduction

44:58.600 --> 45:00.400
as I talked about earlier.

45:00.400 --> 45:04.000
And the question is when did that reduction happen?

45:04.000 --> 45:08.520
Well, cut to the famous experiments

45:08.520 --> 45:12.280
by the Russian biologist Dmitry Believ

45:12.320 --> 45:16.320
who tried domesticating wild animals.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.920
When you domesticate wild animals,

45:19.920 --> 45:23.760
what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.

45:24.680 --> 45:28.240
You are selecting those individuals to breed

45:28.240 --> 45:31.960
who are most willing to be approached by a human

45:31.960 --> 45:34.360
or by another member of their own species

45:34.360 --> 45:39.360
and are least likely to erupt in a reactive aggression.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.960
And you only have to do that for a few generations

45:42.960 --> 45:47.120
to discover that there are changes in the skull

45:47.120 --> 45:50.720
and those changes consist of

45:53.280 --> 45:56.400
shorter face, smaller teeth,

45:56.400 --> 45:59.360
a reduced maleness,

45:59.360 --> 46:01.840
the males become increasingly female-like

46:03.160 --> 46:04.920
and reduced brain size.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.440
Well, the changes that are characteristic

46:08.480 --> 46:10.440
of domesticated animals in general,

46:10.440 --> 46:11.920
compared to wild animals,

46:11.920 --> 46:13.920
are all found in homo sapiens

46:13.920 --> 46:16.680
compared to our early ancestors.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.440
So it's a very strong signal

46:18.440 --> 46:21.080
that when we first see homo sapiens,

46:21.080 --> 46:22.960
what we're seeing is evidence

46:22.960 --> 46:26.280
of a reduction in reactive aggression.

46:26.280 --> 46:29.400
And that suggests that what's happening with homo sapiens

46:29.400 --> 46:32.080
is that that is the point

46:32.080 --> 46:35.520
at which there is selection against the alpha males.

46:35.520 --> 46:39.320
And therefore, the way in which the selection happened

46:39.320 --> 46:41.480
would have been the way it happens today.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.920
The beta males take them out.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.520
So I think that homo sapiens is a species

46:47.520 --> 46:52.520
characterized by the suppression of reactive aggression

46:53.320 --> 46:55.400
as a kind of incidental consequence

46:55.400 --> 46:58.520
of the suppression of the alpha male.

46:58.520 --> 47:00.800
And the story of our species

47:00.800 --> 47:04.160
is the story of how the beta males took charge.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.920
And have been responsible

47:07.920 --> 47:12.000
for the generation of a new kind of human.

47:13.400 --> 47:15.040
And incidentally,

47:16.400 --> 47:21.160
for imposing on the society

47:21.160 --> 47:24.240
a new set of values.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.720
Because when those beta males discovered

47:26.720 --> 47:29.920
that they could take out the previous alpha male

47:29.920 --> 47:31.040
and continue to do so,

47:31.040 --> 47:32.200
because in every generation,

47:32.200 --> 47:33.440
there'll always be some male who says,

47:34.080 --> 47:36.200
maybe I'll become the alpha male.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.280
So they just keep chopping them down.

47:39.600 --> 47:40.600
In discovering that,

47:40.600 --> 47:42.400
they also obviously discovered

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
that they could kill anybody in the group.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.480
Females, young males,

47:48.440 --> 47:52.000
anybody who didn't follow their values.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.280
And so this story is one of,

47:56.160 --> 47:59.560
one in which the males of our species,

47:59.560 --> 48:01.480
and these would be the breeding males,

48:02.480 --> 48:06.800
have been able to impose their values on everybody else.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.120
And there was two kind of values.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.040
There's one kind of value is things that are good

48:10.040 --> 48:12.400
for the group, like thou shalt not murder.

48:13.920 --> 48:16.120
And the other kind of value is things

48:16.120 --> 48:18.120
that are good for the males.

48:19.480 --> 48:21.240
Such as, hey, guess what?

48:21.240 --> 48:23.440
When good food comes in, males get it first.

48:23.440 --> 48:24.280
Yes.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.520
So I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals

48:28.520 --> 48:31.960
could outcompete the others.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.400
Do you have a sense of why,

48:35.400 --> 48:37.480
or maybe you can comment on Neanderthals

48:37.480 --> 48:39.240
and all the other early humans.

48:39.240 --> 48:44.240
Why did homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish

48:44.360 --> 48:45.680
and all the other ones,

48:45.680 --> 48:49.120
all the other branches of evolution died out?

48:50.600 --> 48:51.720
Or got murdered out?

48:51.720 --> 48:56.040
Nowadays when homo sapiens, meets homo sapiens,

48:56.040 --> 48:59.200
and we don't know each other initially,

48:59.200 --> 49:00.640
then conflict breaks out

49:00.640 --> 49:05.640
and the more militarily able group wins.

49:06.760 --> 49:09.120
You know, we've seen that everywhere

49:09.120 --> 49:13.280
throughout the age of exploration and throughout history.

49:14.320 --> 49:16.160
So I'm rather surprised, you know,

49:16.160 --> 49:20.480
the conventional wisdom that you see nowadays

49:20.480 --> 49:24.400
in contemporary anthropology is very reluctant

49:24.400 --> 49:28.120
to point to success in warfare

49:28.120 --> 49:32.480
as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals

49:32.480 --> 49:35.560
within about 3,000 years of the sapiens

49:35.560 --> 49:38.720
coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.

49:39.760 --> 49:42.280
And people are much more inclined to say,

49:42.280 --> 49:45.240
well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,

49:45.240 --> 49:50.240
so they just couldn't survive the demographic sweep

49:51.240 --> 49:54.040
or the disease came in.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.600
You know, maybe those things might have been important,

49:56.600 --> 50:00.040
but far and away, the most obvious possibility

50:00.040 --> 50:05.040
is that sapiens were just powerful.

50:06.760 --> 50:09.360
They had, everyone agrees they had larger groups.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.640
They had better weapons.

50:12.600 --> 50:15.880
They had projectile weapons, bows and arrows

50:15.880 --> 50:20.240
to judge from the little microlyth, bits of flake,

50:22.040 --> 50:23.560
which the Neanderthals didn't.

50:24.840 --> 50:29.040
You know, nowadays there's evidence of interbreeding,

50:29.040 --> 50:30.440
quite extensive interbreeding

50:30.440 --> 50:33.160
between sapiens and Neanderthals,

50:33.160 --> 50:35.200
as well as with some other groups.

50:35.200 --> 50:37.280
And sometimes people say, well, you know,

50:37.280 --> 50:38.560
so they loved each other.

50:38.560 --> 50:40.480
They made love, not war.

50:40.480 --> 50:42.480
I think they made love and war.

50:42.760 --> 50:46.520
And, you know, it wouldn't necessarily mean too loving.

50:46.520 --> 50:49.240
I mean, if you just follow through

50:49.240 --> 50:51.680
from typical ethnographies nowadays

50:51.680 --> 50:55.400
of when dominant groups meet subordinate groups,

50:55.400 --> 50:56.840
they didn't know each other,

50:56.840 --> 51:00.520
then you can imagine that Neanderthal females

51:00.520 --> 51:02.400
would essentially be captured

51:02.400 --> 51:05.360
and taken into sapiens groups.

51:07.120 --> 51:11.200
Maybe you can comment on this cautiously

51:12.200 --> 51:16.200
and eloquently, what's the role of sexual violence

51:16.200 --> 51:18.000
in human evolution?

51:18.000 --> 51:21.320
Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.760
You've also mentioned that some of these rules

51:23.760 --> 51:28.640
are defined by the male side of the society.

51:28.640 --> 51:31.440
What's the role of sexual violence in this story?

51:32.960 --> 51:34.680
I think you've got to distinguish between groups

51:34.680 --> 51:35.680
and within groups.

51:36.680 --> 51:41.680
And, you know, I think the world has been slowly waking up

51:43.280 --> 51:46.040
over the last several decades

51:46.040 --> 51:51.040
to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.

51:52.680 --> 51:57.680
And that to me says that it's just another example

51:58.760 --> 52:01.400
of power corrupts because, you know,

52:01.400 --> 52:06.400
when frustrated, scared, elated soldiers

52:09.320 --> 52:12.840
come upon females in a group

52:12.840 --> 52:16.400
that there's been essential dehumanization of,

52:17.440 --> 52:20.600
then they get carried away by opportunity.

52:21.760 --> 52:25.160
It is not always possible to argue

52:25.160 --> 52:28.600
that this is adaptive nowadays

52:28.600 --> 52:31.200
because, you know, you get lots and lots of stories

52:31.200 --> 52:36.200
of women being abused to the point of being killed.

52:38.760 --> 52:41.200
She'll be gang raped and then killed.

52:41.200 --> 52:46.200
There's lots of terrible cases of that reported

52:46.200 --> 52:47.800
from all sorts of different wars.

52:49.600 --> 52:54.600
But you can see that that could build on a pattern

52:54.920 --> 52:58.160
that would have been adaptive if happening

52:58.160 --> 53:01.560
in under sort of much less extreme circumstances.

53:02.360 --> 53:05.240
You know, the war is very extreme nowadays

53:05.240 --> 53:07.520
in the sense that you get battles

53:07.520 --> 53:11.320
in which people are sent by a military hierarchy

53:11.320 --> 53:14.200
into a war situation in which they do not feel

53:14.200 --> 53:16.520
what hunters and gatherers would typically have felt

53:16.520 --> 53:18.680
which would have been that if we attack,

53:18.680 --> 53:22.000
we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.280
Nowadays, you know, you're sent in across the Somme

53:25.280 --> 53:27.840
or whatever it is and there's a very high chance

53:27.840 --> 53:30.360
you will be killed and that's totally unnatural

53:30.360 --> 53:33.160
and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.

53:34.880 --> 53:37.600
Then there's sexual coercion within groups

53:37.600 --> 53:42.600
and so that takes various kinds of forms, you know,

53:43.360 --> 53:44.800
but nowadays, of course,

53:44.800 --> 53:47.040
I think people recognize increasingly

53:47.040 --> 53:52.040
that the principal form of sexual intimidation

53:53.040 --> 53:57.120
and rape occurs within relationships.

53:58.440 --> 54:03.440
It's not stranger rape that is really statistically important.

54:03.440 --> 54:04.680
There's much more.

54:05.720 --> 54:10.720
What happens behind the walls of a bedroom

54:12.080 --> 54:14.960
where people have been living for some time

54:14.960 --> 54:19.960
and just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.

54:20.960 --> 54:25.960
One is that it may seem odd that males should be,

54:32.160 --> 54:34.920
should think it a good idea, as it were,

54:34.920 --> 54:37.840
to impose themselves sexually

54:37.840 --> 54:40.200
on someone with whom they have a relationship.

54:41.560 --> 54:46.040
But what they're doing is intimidating someone

54:46.040 --> 54:49.400
in a relationship in which the relative power

54:49.400 --> 54:52.880
in the relationship has continuing significance

54:52.880 --> 54:54.400
for a long time.

54:54.400 --> 54:58.880
And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.960
You know, it's to do with domestic relationships,

55:01.960 --> 55:06.240
it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.

55:06.240 --> 55:09.880
It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression

55:09.880 --> 55:13.240
is one of the tools to regain power or gain power

55:13.240 --> 55:14.920
or gain more power and that kind of thing.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.720
Yeah, exactly.

55:16.720 --> 55:21.720
And in that respect, it's worth noting that

55:22.360 --> 55:25.720
although this wasn't appreciated for some time,

55:25.720 --> 55:28.360
it's emerging that in a bunch of primates

55:28.360 --> 55:33.360
you have somewhat parallel kinds of sexual intimidation

55:35.040 --> 55:37.840
where males will target particular females

55:37.840 --> 55:41.320
even in a group in which the norm is for females

55:41.320 --> 55:43.520
to mate with multiple males.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.960
But each male will target a particular female

55:46.000 --> 55:49.640
and the more he is aggressive towards her

55:49.640 --> 55:53.240
then the more she conforms to his wishes

55:53.240 --> 55:55.320
when he wants to mate.

55:55.320 --> 55:58.000
So a long-term pattern of sexual intimidation.

55:58.920 --> 56:00.400
So there's that aspect.

56:00.400 --> 56:04.800
The other aspect I would just note is that males

56:06.720 --> 56:10.240
get away with a lot compared to females

56:10.240 --> 56:13.720
in any kind of intersexual conflict.

56:14.560 --> 56:19.560
So the punishment, here's one example of this,

56:19.960 --> 56:23.480
the punishment for a husband killing a wife

56:23.480 --> 56:25.640
has always been much less than the punishment

56:25.640 --> 56:27.160
for a wife killing a husband.

56:29.960 --> 56:32.200
And you see similar sorts of things

56:32.200 --> 56:37.200
in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.

56:38.760 --> 56:43.000
I bring this up in the context of males

56:43.000 --> 56:46.840
sexually intimidating their partners,

56:46.840 --> 56:49.240
be it wives or whoever,

56:50.720 --> 56:54.400
because it's a reminder that it's basically

56:54.400 --> 56:57.840
a patriarchal world that we have come from,

56:57.840 --> 57:02.120
a patriarchal world in which male alliances

57:02.120 --> 57:06.280
tend to support males and take advantage of the fact

57:06.280 --> 57:09.800
that they have political power at the expense of females.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.040
And I would say that that all goes back

57:12.080 --> 57:14.880
to what happened three to 400,000 years ago

57:14.880 --> 57:16.760
when the beta males took charge

57:16.760 --> 57:19.240
and they started imposing their own norms

57:19.240 --> 57:22.600
on society as a whole and they've continued to do so.

57:22.600 --> 57:26.200
And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,

57:26.200 --> 57:28.840
we are not a patriarchal society.

57:28.840 --> 57:33.080
Well, it's true that the laws try and make it even-handed

57:33.080 --> 57:35.480
nowadays between males and females.

57:35.480 --> 57:38.920
But obviously we are patriarchal de facto

57:38.920 --> 57:43.920
because society still in many ways supports men

57:45.360 --> 57:48.120
better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.

57:48.120 --> 57:50.600
So beta male patriarchal.

57:51.960 --> 57:52.800
Yeah.

57:52.800 --> 57:55.400
If we're looking at the evolutionary history.

57:55.400 --> 57:58.960
Okay, is there maybe sticking on Jordan for a second.

57:58.960 --> 58:03.960
Is there, so he's a psychologist, right?

58:04.440 --> 58:09.440
And what part of the picture do you think he's missing

58:09.960 --> 58:14.800
in analyzing the human relations?

58:16.160 --> 58:20.160
Like what does he need to understand

58:20.160 --> 58:22.400
about our origins and violence

58:22.400 --> 58:24.960
and the way the society has been constructed?

58:24.960 --> 58:29.960
Oh, I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives.

58:30.400 --> 58:34.600
But I just think that what he's doing

58:34.600 --> 58:37.880
in that particular example is focusing

58:37.880 --> 58:40.280
on the legalistic position.

58:41.120 --> 58:45.240
And that's great that you do not find

58:46.160 --> 58:48.240
formal patriarchy in the law,

58:48.240 --> 58:49.800
anything like to the extent

58:49.800 --> 58:53.840
that you could find it a hundred years ago and so on.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.120
Women have got the vote now, hooray,

58:56.120 --> 58:58.720
but it took a long time for women to get the vote.

58:58.720 --> 59:02.840
And it remains the case that

59:04.920 --> 59:08.840
the women suffer in various kinds of ways.

59:08.840 --> 59:13.840
I mean, a woman who has lots of sexual partners

59:15.520 --> 59:17.960
is treated much more rudely

59:17.960 --> 59:21.320
than a male who has lots of sexual partners.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.160
There are all sorts of informal ways

59:23.160 --> 59:27.240
in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.

59:27.240 --> 59:32.240
And if we look at the surface layer of the law,

59:32.600 --> 59:36.320
we may miss the deeper human nature,

59:38.040 --> 59:41.240
like the origins of our human nature that still operates

59:41.240 --> 59:42.640
no matter what the law says.

59:42.640 --> 59:47.160
Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward

59:47.160 --> 59:51.000
because it includes some unpleasant features

59:51.000 --> 59:54.240
that when we sit back and reflect about them,

59:54.240 --> 59:57.960
we would like them to go away.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.960
But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:10.040
to try and have sex with at least one woman

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.080
and often lots of women.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.320
And so women, men are constantly putting pressure on women

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.920
in ways that women find unpleasant.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.720
And if men sit back and reflect about it,

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.920
they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this,

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:26.280
but actually it just goes on because of human nature.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.920
So maybe looking at particular humans in history,

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.880
let's talk about Genghis Khan.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.720
So is this particular human

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.240
who was one of the most famous examples

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.280
of large-scale violence,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.800
is he a deep representative of human nature

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.960
or is he a rare exception?

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.960
Well, I think that it's easy to imagine

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.480
that most men could have become Genghis Khan.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.320
It's possible that he had a particular streak of psychopathy.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:11.440
You know, it's striking that by the time you become

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.440
immensely powerful, then you're a willingness

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.080
to do terrible things for the interest

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:27.080
of yourself and your group becomes very high.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:35.880
Stalin, Mao Tse-tung, these sorts of people have histories

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.760
in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.600
But by the time they are big leaders,

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.280
they are really psychopathic in the sense that

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.080
they do not follow the ordinary morality

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.080
of considering the harm that they are doing to their victims.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.520
What kind of experiment would we need

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.720
whether or not anybody could fall into this position?

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:11.720
I don't know, but Lord Acton's famous dictum

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.840
was power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.160
And then the point that people often forget

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.640
is the next sentence that he said,

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.880
which is great men are almost always bad men.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.480
And that is right.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.960
It is very difficult to find a great man in history

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.080
who was not responsible for terrible things.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.920
I think there's some aspect of it that it's not just power.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.360
I think men who have been the most destructive

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:47.360
in human history are not psychopathic completely.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.000
They have convinced themselves of an idea.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.600
It's like the idea of psychopathic.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.280
Stalin, for example, Hitler's a complicated one.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.520
I think he was legitimately insane,

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.080
but I think Stalin has convinced himself

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.040
that he's doing good.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.320
So the idea of communism is the thing that's psychopathic

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.560
in his mind, like a bread.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.720
You construct a worldview in which the violence is justified,

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.560
the cruelty is justified.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.440
So in that sense, first of all,

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:23.280
you can construct experiments,

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.200
unethical experiments that could test this,

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.600
but in that sense, anybody else

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.880
could have been in Stalin's position.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:35.880
It's the idea that could overtake the mind of a human being

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.360
and in so doing justify cruel acts.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.160
And that seems to be at least in part unique to humans

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.600
is the ability to hold ideas in our minds

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.440
and share those ideas and use those ideas

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:53.800
to convince ourselves that proactive violence

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.160
on a large scale is a good idea.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:59.080
So that, I don't know if you have a comment.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.000
I suppose so, I mean, but it seems to me

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.600
what really motivated Stalin

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.600
was not so much communism as the retention of power.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.560
So once he became leader

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.120
and in the process of becoming leader,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.720
he was absolutely desperate to get rid

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.200
of anybody who was a challenger.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.120
He was deeply suspicious,

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.800
suspicious of anybody, even on his side,

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.280
who might possibly be showing a glimmerings

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.080
of willingness to challenge him.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:41.080
So when he apparently had Kirov murdered,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.440
Kirov was a great communist,

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.600
Trotsky was a great communist, all his rivals.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.360
And I mean, when he went into the towns

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.240
and murdered people by the tens of thousands.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.240
They were all communists.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.680
A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:03.360
But what he was worried about was that they were rivals to him.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.120
I suppose the thought is,

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.440
I am the best person to bring about

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.000
a global sort of embrace of communism

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.640
and others are not.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.760
And so we have to get rid of those others.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.720
Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:26.720
but I mean, maybe you know enough about Stalin to really...

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.000
Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.440
is from my understanding and sense,

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.240
of course we can't know for sure,

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.720
is he believed in communism.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.840
This wasn't purely a game of power.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.320
Now he got drunk with power pretty quickly,

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.360
but he really believed for,

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.120
I believe his whole life that communism is good for the world.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.960
And that I don't know what role

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.160
that belief plays with the more natural human desire for power.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.200
I don't know, but it just seems like...

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.440
As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.520
on his journey.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.840
But it's not that doesn't,

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.600
that calculus doesn't work that way.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.440
There's humans who are communists,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.920
and then there's the idea of communism.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.760
So for him, in his delusional worldview,

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.320
killing a few people is worth the final result

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.760
of bringing communism to the whole world.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760
But it was more than that again,

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.640
because I mean, he really wanted power for the Soviet Union.

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:42.640
And so surely the reason that he orchestrated

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.600
the export of wheat from Ukraine,

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.600
and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation,

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.720
was because he wanted to sell it on the market

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.720
in order to be able to build up the power of the Soviet Union.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.320
You know, alternative view of communism might have been,

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:06.920
well, let's just make sure everybody survives

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.320
and make sure everybody has enough to eat.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.000
And we'll all be musically supportive

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.680
in a communal network.

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.200
But no, but he wanted the power for the country.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.360
Well, I guess exactly.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.360
So that it's not even communism,

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.840
the set of ideas are like Marxism or something like that.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.120
It's the country.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.520
I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.840
for the individual.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.440
It's power for a vision for this great nation,

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.840
the Soviet Union.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:37.200
And similar with Hitler,

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:42.320
the guy believed that this is a great nation, Germany.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.560
And like they, it's a nation that's been wronged

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.960
throughout history and needs to be righted.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.440
And there's some dance between the individual human

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.560
and the tribe.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.800
Yes, and so just like chimpanzees,

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.200
you know, we are fiercely tribal.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.200
And the tribalism resides particularly in male psychology.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.200
And it's very scary because once you assemble

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:17.200
a set of males who share tribal identity,

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:20.520
then they have power that they can exert

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.840
with very little concern

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.080
about what they're doing to damage other people.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.000
Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.200
we talked about the corrupting nature of power.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.720
Do you think that's a manifestation

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.880
of those early origins of violence?

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.080
What's the connection of this desire for power

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.040
and our proclivity for violence?

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.520
You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.960
Power on behalf of a group.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:57.800
Yes.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.080
And yeah, that seems to me to go right back

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.560
to a deep evolutionary origin

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.240
because you see essentially the same thing

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.880
in a whole bunch of animals.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:16.040
That most of the sort of cognitively complex animals

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.240
live in social groups in which they have tribal boundaries.

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.560
And so what you see in chimpanzees

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.840
is echoed in almost all of the primates.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.400
The difference between us and chimpanzees

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.560
and humans on the one hand and other primates on the other

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.320
is that we kill and they don't.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:42.920
And the reason they don't is because they never meet

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.920
in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.840
So two groups of baboons, you know, there's 30 on this side

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.600
and 50 on this side, fine.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.680
Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.600
because there's serious risks involved.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.200
But nevertheless, they are tribal.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.160
So, you know, they will have fairly intense

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.680
intergroup interactions in which everybody knows

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.600
whose side is on, who is on whose side.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:17.600
And the long-term consequences of winning those battles,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.360
non-lethal battles is that the dominance

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.320
get access to larger areas of land,

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.560
more safety and so on with chances are.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.560
Better record of reproductive success, subsequently.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.800
Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.320
is a feature or a bug,

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:49.320
our natural sort of tendency to form tribes?

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.080
So what's a bug?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.640
Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy,

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:02.640
meaning like it would be more beneficial.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.720
Is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.160
from an evolutionary perspective?

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.920
Yeah, yeah, but...

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.040
What does it mean?

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.160
What does a bug mean?

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.200
Yes, right, I mean...

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.400
Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.080
It's beneficial from, you know,

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.800
it's beneficial in the sense that it evolved

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.360
by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.840
But if by bug you mean something that,

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.280
from the point of view of the species,

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.600
it'd be great if you could just wipe this out,

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.080
because the species would somehow do better as a result.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.480
Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.200
Come on now, there's some nice things to males,

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.120
speaking as a male.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.200
The fact that there are some nice things to males

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.000
doesn't mean that they're not bugs.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.920
You know, maybe they're quite nice bugs,

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.400
but it would be much better for the species as a whole

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.480
not to have to have males

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.840
who impose this violence on the species as a whole.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.080
Yeah.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.160
As somebody who practiced controlled violence

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.000
and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.040
It does seem kind of fun

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.280
to have this kind of controlled violence, also sports.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.440
Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.560
I guess that's the deeper question.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.240
Don't you think there's some value to conflict

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.760
for the improvement of society for progress,

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.120
that this tension between tribes,

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.280
isn't this like experiment,

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.680
a continued experiment we conduct with each other

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.240
and to figure out what is a better world to build?

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.000
Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.520
to go to war with each other.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.680
It's like the United States with the 50 states

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.720
and it's the laboratory of ideas.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.240
Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug?

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.040
This kind of conflict when it doesn't get out of hand

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.040
is actually ultimately progressive,

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.760
productive for a better world.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.160
Well, what do you mean by conflict?

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.960
I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.040
people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:19.000
So their ideas are in conflict,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.560
they can sit down on a log and chat about it

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.760
and then decide, okay, you're right,

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.200
or I'm wrong or whatever.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.160
But if my conflict, you mean a great idea

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.600
to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:39.720
then no, I don't see why it's a good idea

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.080
to have all this violence.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.480
Yeah, there's...

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:48.680
I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.960
but I wonder if human history would evolve

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.520
the way it did without the violence.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.160
Oh, I'm sure you're right.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.160
Probably humans were not evolved in the sense that we have,

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:04.160
but I would hope that the course of violence

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.640
in evolution will continue in the way it has.

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.040
So, there's all sorts of indications

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:20.240
that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.400
And this is made famous in Stephen Pinker's book,

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.080
but others have written about it too,

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:33.160
that the frequency of death from violence

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.080
in every country you look at has been declining.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:38.880
That's just great.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.480
And so, the amazing thing about this is that

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.600
even when you take the death due to the First World War

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.080
and the Second World War,

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.320
the 20th century appears to have been statistically,

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.960
meaning rates of death per individual,

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.400
the least violent in history.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.280
So, we haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence,

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.760
but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.760
I think it's ridiculous, frankly.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:13.200
Excuse my frankness, to say that violence is a good thing.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.840
I think that it would be a wonderful concept

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.720
if we could evolve somehow to a world

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.080
3,000 years from now,

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:26.800
where violence is really regarded as simply appalling

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.920
and that they look back on our time

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.560
and can't believe what we were doing.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:35.760
Yeah, but of course violence takes a lot of different shapes

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.360
as we start to think deeper and deeper

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.280
about living beings on Earth.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.920
For example, the violence we commit

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.960
and the torture we commit to animals.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.240
And then perhaps down the line,

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.560
as we talked offline about, is with robots

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.360
and that kind of thing.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.640
So, there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.040
And some people now talk about violence in the space of ideas,

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.000
which of course, to me at least,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.280
is a bit of a silly notion relative

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.040
to use that same V word for the space of ideas

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.440
versus actual physical violence.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.000
But it may be that long time from now,

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
we see that even violence in the space of ideas

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.760
is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.520
And so, it is interesting where this is headed.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.080
And I think you're absolutely right.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.640
A world, a nonviolent world does seem like a better world.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.680
I wonder if the constraints on resources

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.440
somehow make that world more and more difficult,

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.200
especially as we run out of resources.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.480
It's got to be very, very different

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.120
from what we're doing nowadays.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.920
And it's unimaginably different.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.840
If we could imagine it,

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.680
then maybe we could work towards it at the moment.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.520
Nobody knows how to work towards it.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.000
Well, that's kind of the stories of humans

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.680
as we don't really know the future.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:53.240
We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.080
and sometimes get into trouble as to violence.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:02.080
But George Orwell's vision in 1984 was of two or three

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.680
world powers, each so powerful

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:09.680
that nobody could diminish the, could destroy the other.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:16.000
But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
among heavily armed world powers just does not seem,

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.280
as though it's reasonable at all.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:32.400
There's to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations in the world,

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.560
dominated by a few big ones, all with arms

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.240
pointing at each other.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:45.360
And the notion that we could just carry on

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.280
having peace talks and making sure that these arms

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:54.120
don't get involved in some kind of massive conflagration

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.000
seems incredibly optimistic.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.240
Some kind of major change has to happen,

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:03.200
whereby, and some people wouldn't like to see

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:05.160
all the weapons go, that'd be great.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.920
I'm a member of that sort of group

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.680
that tries to see that happen.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.160
It's gonna be very difficult to see it happen.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:16.120
Another kind of concept is the nations themselves

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.120
will dissolve and will become one government.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.760
That itself is a terrifying vision

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:28.120
because the capacity for abuse by a single world power

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.800
would be so problematic.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.520
And in addition, how do you get there

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.200
without a war in the first place?

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.120
So at the moment, we have no reasonable kind

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.080
of future in mind, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.640
It's just that we haven't yet to find it.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.080
And a lot of people like in the cryptocurrency space

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.680
argue that you can create decentralized societies

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.360
if you take away the power from states

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.120
to define the monetary system.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:58.720
So they argue like, if you make the monetary system

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:01.280
such that it's disjoint from the control

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.960
of any one individual, any one government,

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.680
then that might be a way to form sort of ad hoc,

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:08.000
decentralized societies.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.840
They just pop up all over the place.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.920
That's a really interesting technological solution

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:17.240
to how to remove the overreach of power

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.080
from governments.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.040
Yes, right, absolutely.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:24.520
And it may well be that the future will emerge

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.680
out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.200
Is it nevertheless surprising to you

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.320
that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.520
So the mutually assured destruction

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.480
that we've had for many decades

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.800
from somebody who studies violence,

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.280
how does that make sense to you?

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:45.480
Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.000
that accidental, the fact that we have not had

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.520
an accident yet has been quite remarkable.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.080
Because all the accounts are

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.320
that we've come very close to having very serious accidents

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:03.160
where people are either side of misread intentions

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.320
or apparent launches and so on.

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.680
So yes, I think it is remarkable.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:13.680
There is a nasty generalization that can be made

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:19.160
that the longer that powerful states go

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.500
without having wars, then the worse the war is afterwards.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.520
And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:32.120
because basically what's happening with these tribal groups

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:37.120
that the nations are at the moment is that after a big war

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.120
like the Second World War,

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.200
they established new kinds of dominance relationships.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.800
And then during the periods of peace,

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:50.800
what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.560
change because some nations become poorer,

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.000
some become richer,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.600
some become more militarily powerful and so on.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:02.320
Generally economy and military goes hand in hand.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.560
So right now China emerged from the war

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.560
as a relatively low status state and is now high status.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.040
So if this was chimpanzees,

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.160
what would happen is that you would predict a conflict

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.200
because you need to have a readjustment

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.320
of the formal dominance relationships

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.360
to recognize the new in-practice dominance relationships

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.800
recognized by the economy and the military.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.280
So the longer that you have of a period of peace

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.520
following a war,

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:33.880
then the more these tensions of unresolved,

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:37.200
changed dominance relationships build up.

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.600
And the longer they take to occur,

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.600
then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.480
That's a terrifying view

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:50.520
because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.360
That's right.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.680
Maybe it's building up.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.560
So it's a scary view.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.080
But on the other hand,

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:59.800
things have changed hugely with the advent of nuclear weapons

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:04.800
because at least that conforms to this psychology

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.800
that is very clear in other animals,

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:08.880
which is you don't want to get into a fight

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.160
if you are going to get hurt.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.760
So that's the whole principle of MAD, Mutual Assured Destruction.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.680
And it's doubtless being why powerful nations

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.960
like America and Russia

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.600
have not used their nuclear weapons since 1945.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:32.240
So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.360
then maybe the fact of MAD does fit into human psychology

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.480
in a way that means that we really will resolve our tensions

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.600
without using them.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:47.520
But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.760
I mean, the Soviet Union collapsed

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.240
because of the poor economy,

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:57.240
but with China desperate to take back Taiwan

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:03.560
and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.920
the potential for something going wrong

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.200
is clearly very high.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.440
So what's the hopeful case that you can make

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.840
for a long-term surviving and thriving human civilization

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.120
given all the dangers that we face?

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.200
Well, I can't really exactly make one.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.200
I would just say that we're talking about the dangers.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.920
Obviously the dangers are there.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:34.560
But what I would sort of think about is the notion

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.560
that surprises come from all sorts of different directions.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.920
And I mean, you work in robotics

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.760
and I can well imagine that there will be advances

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.920
in robotics that in some way I can't even conceive

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:57.920
will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.760
Something about, by the time chips have been planted

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.600
in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.600
in a way that we never did before,

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:12.040
will this change the nature of human existence

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.120
in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?

01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:17.760
So remove the conflicts but keep some of the magic,

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.640
the beauty of what it means to be human.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.560
So like still be able to enjoy life,

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.720
the richness of life, the full complexity of life.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:28.360
Cause you can remove conflict by giving everybody a pill

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.480
and then they go to sleep, right?

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.480
You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.960
And so that's where you have to find the balance.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.000
Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.760
and so how it's gonna work out totally unclear.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.080
I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.920
I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.080
I think you really need to get rid of males

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.080
cause males are the source of a major problem,

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.680
which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.400
But you don't think the males are also source of beauty

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.240
and creation?

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.160
No, no, I mean, I don't have anything against males

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:20.880
as individuals and that sort of thing.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.840
And males have clearly done a lot.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.080
I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.960
and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.160
and that sort of thing.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.320
On the other hand, I'm not sure there's anything

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.880
particularly special and I think that probably females

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.840
could do the same thing just as well

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.960
when given the chance.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.320
Yes, including the dark stuff.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.000
I mean, a part of me is not understanding the,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.640
so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.760
but I tend to believe both men and women,

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.680
if you look out into the future, it can be destructive,

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.120
it can be evil, it can be greedy,

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.040
it can be corrupted by power.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.680
So if you move males from the picture,

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.520
which are historically connected to this evolution

01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.720
of that we've been talking about,

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.960
that women are gonna fill that role quite nicely

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.120
and then it'll be just the same kind of process,

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:20.120
not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.440
There's a sense that the will to power, craving power,

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.280
committing violence is somehow coupled

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.640
with all the things that are beautiful about life,

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:35.160
that if you remove conflict completely,

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.800
if you remove all the evil in the world,

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.800
it seems like you're not going to have a stable place

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.520
for the beauty for the goodness.

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.520
Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight for the way,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.200
if you look at human history,

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.880
now you can say the reason I'm nervous

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.400
about a sort of utopia where everything is great

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.680
is every time you look through human history

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.760
when the utopia has been chased,

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.880
you run into a lot of trouble where again,

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.720
sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.680
Now you can say that's a male problem,

01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:18.960
but I just think it's a human problem

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:22.160
and it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:24.600
It's life on earth problem, intelligent life

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600
on earth problem.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.600
So like it's better to not necessarily get rid

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.640
of the sources of the darkest sides of human nature,

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.160
but more create mechanisms that the kindness,

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:41.840
the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.840
that that is incentivized and encouraged, empowered.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.760
Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia

01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.480
if you got rid of the males.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.320
Right.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.560
And certainly females capable of conflict.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.280
I just think it's a gamble worth taking

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.880
if you could actually do it.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.120
You can certainly find females in history

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.280
who've done unpleasant things, but nevertheless,

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.480
we have a very strong evolutionary theory

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.000
which explains why males benefit more

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.560
by having conflict and winning conflicts than females do.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.520
And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.040
yes.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.960
Then it would reduce it to get rid of males.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.120
Now I understand this is a fantasy.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.160
And I think it's a fantasy that people would be able

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:40.560
to talk about fairly soon because reproductive technology

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:44.320
is getting to the point where it's quite likely

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:49.320
that human females could breed without the use of males.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.560
And so there would be a sort of potential dynamic

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.680
if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.760
It's a really interesting thought experiment.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.440
I will agree with you that if given two buttons,

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.640
one is get rid of all women

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.800
and the other buttons get rid of all men.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.680
Realizing that I have a stake in this choice,

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.800
you're probably getting rid of all men.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.680
If I wanted to preserve earth

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.440
and the richness of life on earth,

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.280
I would probably get rid of all men.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.120
I don't know.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.680
I don't think you have a stake in it.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.960
I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.560
But I don't see why being a man

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.400
should make you any more interested

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.880
in having a male future for the world than a female future.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.640
You've got just as many ancestors who were male

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.440
as were female.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.520
Well, my problem is I'll have to die.

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:53.800
Well, that's gonna happen anyway.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.120
I know, but I prefer to die tomorrow and not today.

01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.560
I prefer to hit the snooze button

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.840
on the whole mortality thing.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:03.800
But it's interesting.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.640
But this is not suggesting that males have to die

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.880
in order to make room for females.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:11.480
All you have to do is just say,

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.920
don't let's have any more males born.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.760
Interesting.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.240
Of course, the difficulty is that because we're tribal,

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.080
some country, somewhere would say,

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.680
well, we're not gonna do that.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.640
And then guess what?

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.760
They'd take over because they're males.

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.640
So that's why it's impossible to imagine actually happening.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.560
You know what?

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:32.200
I'm gonna take that and actually think about it.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.040
I don't know.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.880
I'm uncomfortable.

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:39.320
There's a certain kind of woke culture

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.640
that I've been kind of uncomfortable with

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:44.560
because it's not women necessarily.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.920
It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.920
There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.480
towards others that's created by that culture.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.240
So, but you're speaking about something else.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:00.240
You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:04.480
and looking at the basics of our human nature

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:09.480
and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens

01:31:10.120 --> 01:31:14.520
and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:18.240
if we get rid of them, we'll make for a better world.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240
It's an interesting thought experiment.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.720
But it is only a thought experiment.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:25.040
I mean, you know, it's got no practical meaning right now.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.360
And I take your point that, you know,

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:32.520
males get a hard rap nowadays in some ways

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.560
because the balance of social power

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:43.680
is moving against, I mean, quite rightly

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.160
in a strong sense, of course,

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:50.080
against all the nasty things that males do.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.760
But what people sometimes fail to remember

01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.680
is that life is very hard for males

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:05.720
who don't have the power, who don't have money,

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.960
who don't have access to women.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.760
You know, I'm sympathetic to in cells.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.480
I'm not sympathetic to them using violence

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.280
to solve their problems.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:25.280
But I am very sympathetic to the fact that it's not easy,

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:30.360
simply to be told by well-off women

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.520
and feminist middle-class people

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.160
that you shouldn't behave like this

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.400
or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.440
Yes, that's who you are.

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:46.000
I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
male or female, I believe will be the thing

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.440
that builds a better world.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:57.400
And that's practiced in different ways

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.720
from different backgrounds.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.600
But ultimately, you should listen to others

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.160
and empathize with the experience of others

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.520
and put more love out there in the world.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.400
Now, that hopefully is the way to reduce conflict,

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:15.320
reduce violence and reduce that whole psychological

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.880
experience of being powerless in this world,

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:22.560
powerless to become the best version of yourself.

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.400
And that, you know-

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:24.480
Well, no one's gonna disagree

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.200
with all those fine sentiments, right?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:32.040
But that, yes, but that's an actionable thing,

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.160
is actually practice empathy, right?

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:40.120
Like saying that somebody should be silenced

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.840
or just like, this group is bad and this group is good.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.400
I just feel like that's not empathy.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.400
Empathy is understanding the experience of others

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
and respecting it.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:57.280
I mean, that's what a better world looks like.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.760
That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.720
It's like, as opposed to saying, my tribe is right,

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:07.160
your tribe is wrong, forget the violence

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:08.760
or non-violence part.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.200
That just that act of saying, my tribe is right,

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.640
that tribe is wrong, removing that from the picture,

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.760
that's the way to make a better world.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.360
Like that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.800
Not necessarily removing the people

01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:24.200
who are causing the violence.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.000
You have to get to the source of the problem.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.280
I don't mean the evolutionary source,

01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:32.280
but just the mindset that creates the violence

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.000
is usually just a lack of empathy for others.

01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:40.520
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, you can't just teach that

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:43.600
because our evolutionary psychology

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.600
puts us in particular directions.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:48.680
So you don't think, do you think it's possible

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:52.080
to learn through practice

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:55.760
to resist the basics of our evolutionary psychology,

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.960
the basic forces?

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.840
Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training,

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:04.960
you know, lots and lots of education can do it.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.240
The famously most peaceful society

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.880
that anthropologists have recorded

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.880
involves a tremendous amount of teaching,

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.960
including some punishment.

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.000
You know, it's a society in Thailand.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.840
So it's carrot and steak.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.360
You know, the point is that you do not find societies

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:36.360
in which people are spontaneously showing the kinds of behaviors

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:42.080
that we would all love them to show.

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:43.360
It requires work.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.160
It requires work.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.000
What is your book titled, Goodness Paradox?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.360
What are the main ideas in this book?

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.360
Well, the paradox is the fact that humans show extremes

01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.480
in both in relationship to both violence and non-violence.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.240
And the violence is that we are one of these few animals

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.920
in which we use coalitionary proactive violence

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.720
to kill members of our own species.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.240
And we do it in large numbers,

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.760
just like a few other species.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.960
And the non-violence is we're particularly extreme

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.920
in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.760
And I told you the story of how we get there.

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.680
You know, so what's so extraordinary about us

01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:33.000
is that most animals are either high on both

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.480
or relatively low on both.

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.400
So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.080
and reactive violence.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.280
Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.440
but still hundreds of times more

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.960
reactively aggressive than humans are.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
What we've done is retain proactive violence being high

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.280
and got reactive violence really being low.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.240
And so we have these wonderful societies

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.840
in which we're also incredibly nice to each other

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.120
and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.120
and have no problem about leading to any kind of conflict

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:18.320
at the same time as we are one of the worst

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.920
killing machine species that's ever existed.

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:24.320
So what's so extraordinary about this is that

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.960
if you look at the political philosophers

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:29.000
of the last few hundred years,

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:33.960
you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.320
and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.280
or literally you got the fight between their followers.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.840
You know, so the followers of Hobbes say,

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.920
well, Hobbes was right because he says

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:46.440
that we are naturally violent and you need a Leviathan

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.360
or sort of central government or a king

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.760
to be able to suppress the violence.

01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.920
So we're naturally horrid and we can learn to be good.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.280
Whereas Jean-Jacques Rousseau is interpreted

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.400
as saying the opposite, that we are naturally good

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.480
and it's only when culture intervenes

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:08.400
and horrid ideologies come in that we become uncivilized.

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:10.960
And so people have had this endless fight

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.760
between are we naturally corrupt

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.560
or are we naturally kind?

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.760
And that has gone on for years

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.080
and it's only in the last two or three decades

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:25.280
that anthropologists like Christopher Bohm

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.400
and Bruce Naft have said, look, you know,

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:28.720
it's obvious what the answer is,

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.440
we are both of these things.

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:33.440
And what is so exciting now is I think we can understand

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.920
why we are both.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.280
And the answer is we come from ancestors

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.760
that were elevated on proactive aggression,

01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:43.760
that were hunters and killers,

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:46.560
both of animals and of each other.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.120
And you've got to include that

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.920
as almost certain from the past.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.920
And then now we've taken our reactive aggression

01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:02.560
and we've down-regulated it and that's given us power.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:05.840
It's given us power because once you get rid

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:08.600
of the alpha male, once the beta males take over

01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.400
and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.120
less reactively aggressive individual,

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.040
the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.000
of focusing on things other than conflict.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.920
And so we have social groups in which individuals,

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.000
instead of constantly being on edge

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.400
in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:37.560
are able to interact in ways

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:41.800
that enable them to share looking at a tool together

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.080
or share their food together

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.280
or pass ideas from one to the other

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:49.600
or support each other when they're ill

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.720
or whatever the issue is,

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:56.160
cooperate in ways that make the group far more effective.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.440
So you asked earlier, what did I think about

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.720
why sapiens were able to expand

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:04.280
at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.720
around 40,000 years ago?

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.280
And the answer is that whatever it was,

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:14.480
it had something to do with the sapiens' ability

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.120
to cooperate.

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.280
That was what gave them bigger groups.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.280
That's what enabled them to have a far more effective way

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.240
of living and I suspect it was to do with the weapons

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:29.960
and military aspects, but even if it wasn't that,

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:35.040
that the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.920
would have been hugely important.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.480
So sapiens then had groups of,

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.120
who knows exactly how big they were,

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.120
but scores of people to judge from their remains,

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:52.880
whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.880
small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.840
where they saw others so rarely

01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:03.960
that they were in breeding at high levels.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.240
Fathers having babies with their daughters.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:09.800
Very different world.

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:10.640
Very different world.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:12.320
And that's probably what our world was like

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.680
before we got sapiens.

01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:15.040
Before we got sapiens.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.360
And it's fascinating that there was that kind of violence

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:23.360
against, once you get rid of the alpha males,

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.440
you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta,

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:32.320
the beta males, not kindness,

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.520
but collaboration as the better word.

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.560
Yes, much more cooperation,

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:38.960
not just among the males, among the beta males,

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.800
but also among the gamma males and the females.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.640
Yeah.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:44.920
I don't know what a gamma male is,

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.560
but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.800
Well, I don't know about hell alphabet,

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.440
but I think the big layers of the married men

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:55.040
and the unmarried men,

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.000
because the married men had a problem with the unmarried men.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.240
I mean, you see it in ethnographies

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.320
of hunters and gatherers recently,

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:07.160
where the unmarried men would be given rules, such as,

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.840
I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia was,

01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:13.760
you cannot come to the camp for months.

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.320
You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush,

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.040
because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.000
And then another kind of rule is,

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:25.080
if you are in the camp,

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.760
you must be in the firelight all the time.

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.840
Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.960
So you really have us to control them,

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.960
because the men who had lots of wives

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:40.360
did not want those horrid bachelors sneaking around the place.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.200
I love this.

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.960
You also wrote the book titled,

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.600
Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:50.720
What's the central idea in this book?

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:52.560
There's some title, How Cooking Made Us Human,

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.360
refers not to homo sapiens, but to homo erectus.

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.000
So human there means the genus Homo.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
And homo erectus is the first full member of the genus Homo

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.760
in the sense that it looked like us,

01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:12.200
just with a sort of slightly more robust build

01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.160
and a smaller brain.

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:17.400
And the central idea of catching fire

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.120
is that it was the control of fire

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.240
that was responsible for the emergence of Homo erectus

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:30.800
and therefore the genus Homo,

01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.040
which happened two million years ago.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:38.040
And it was an evolution from a line of Australopithecines.

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:46.400
And Australopithecines are the creatures

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.360
from whom we evolved.

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:52.880
They were present in Africa

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.080
from something like six or seven million years ago

01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.560
up to, actually up to one million years ago.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.400
And then a branch led off to Homo around two million years ago.

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:10.120
And the way to think of Australopithecines

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.080
is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.080
So they were erect bipedal walkers.

01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.320
They were like chimpanzees in the sense that

01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.840
they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.840
They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.840
a little bit smaller actually.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:36.840
And they had big jaws because they were still eating raw food.

01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:39.320
They had big teeth and big jaws.

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.320
And then around two million years ago,

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320
the line of Australopithecines,

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:47.160
which ended with an intermediate species,

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.440
a kind of missing link area,

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:53.080
because it is not missing, called habilis,

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.600
sometimes called Homo habilis,

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.160
but more properly, in my view,

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.160
called Australopithecus habilis.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.520
That gave rise to Homo erectus.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:06.080
And Homo erectus, here's how different it was.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:11.080
It had a smaller mouth, a smaller jaw,

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:16.600
smaller teeth, and to judge from its ribs and pelvis,

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.080
smaller gut.

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:23.080
In addition, it had lost what Australopithecines all had,

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:27.080
which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.080
And that meant that Homo erectus must have slept on the ground.

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:34.080
And since it slept on the ground,

01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:36.080
it should have been able to defend itself somehow

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.080
against predators.

01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.080
And I can't think of any way they could have done that,

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.080
unless they had fire.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:50.080
So there are two major clues to why it was with Homo erectus

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:54.080
that our ancestors first acquired the control of fire.

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.080
One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.080
in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:04.080
and all the other primates do.

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:11.080
And the other is that there was this striking reduction

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:15.080
throughout the gut, reduction in size of the mouth

01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:19.080
and the chewing apparatus and in the gut itself.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.080
And that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.080
which is that our guts are about two-thirds of the size

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:31.080
of what they would be if we ate raw food

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:35.080
to judge by the great apes.

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.080
So at some point in our evolution,

01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:45.080
we acquired the skill of cooking and skill of controlling fire.

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:50.080
At no time between two million years ago and the present

01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.080
do we see any changes in our anatomy

01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:59.080
that can, as it were, justify the enormous change

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.080
that happens when you are an animal that learns to control fire.

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:07.080
But at two million years ago, we have exactly what you'd expect.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.080
Namely, the gut's becoming smaller because the food is becoming softer

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:13.080
and much more easy to digest,

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:17.080
so you don't have to work so hard in your body to digest it.

01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:21.080
And, as I say, commitment to sleeping on the ground,

01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:25.080
which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.080
on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.080
unless you had fire.

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:35.080
I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa in the bush

01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:40.080
and you will not catch me just lying on the ground

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.080
in an area with lots of predators unless I got a fire with me.

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:46.080
You're going to get eaten.

01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:49.080
You're going to get terrified and you're going to get eaten.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:52.080
Okay, so there's a million questions I want to ask.

01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:56.080
The one, is it very naturally coupled,

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:59.080
the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.080
Is that an obvious leap?

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.080
Well, here's what we know.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.080
We know that all the animals that we've tested

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.080
like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:13.080
So this is true for all the great apes.

01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:15.080
We've tested them.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.080
That's fascinating, by the way.

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.080
Why is that?

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.080
That's just like a property of food, I suppose.

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.080
Yes, I think what it is is that

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.080
animals are always looking for any kind of way

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.080
to get food that is easier to digest.

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:34.080
And there are various signals in the food,

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.080
such as the amount of sugar there,

01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:38.080
the amount of free amino acids,

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:42.080
because the amino acids can be tasted.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.080
And the physical qualities of the food be particularly important,

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:48.080
how tough their food is.

01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:54.080
They prefer softer food, provided it feels safe, tastes safe.

01:48:54.080 --> 01:49:01.080
And these kinds of sensory cues are all there in cooked food.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:05.080
It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins,

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:09.080
it's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.080
So everyone loves it spontaneously.

01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:15.080
Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or raw food.

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:17.080
Well, maybe you can say that's a consequence of domestication.

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.080
But even, as I say, all of the great apes,

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:25.080
you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked, if they can.

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:28.080
So then, obviously, once you have fire,

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.080
you're going to accidentally discover that food changes

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.080
when you apply fire to it,

01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.080
and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad.

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.080
You took the words out of my mouth.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.080
If they have fire at all and their food rolls into it,

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.080
five minutes later, it tastes better than before.

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:50.080
How big of an invention, from an engineering perspective,

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:53.080
do you think is the discovery of fire?

01:49:53.080 --> 01:50:00.080
Do you think for the, for Homo erectus, Homo sapiens,

01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:03.080
do you think it's the greatest invention ever?

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.080
Yeah.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:12.080
I think that the control of fire has been ultimately responsible

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:17.080
for essentially how grandiose do I want to be here?

01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:21.080
You know, the entire human story going back to Homo

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:26.080
is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:31.080
And perhaps the biggest way in which it is likely to have changed us

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:37.080
is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain.

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:47.080
So, you know, the story here is that the constraints on brain size are energetic.

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:57.080
You and I have brains that are something like 2.5% of our body weight.

01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:03.080
It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:05.080
So it's disproportionate.

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:11.080
There are other expensive organs in our body as well, such as the heart.

01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:18.080
And what's different about the brain is that in addition to us being able to fuel it

01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:24.080
in a way that other animals can't, we also have reasons for wanting to have an even bigger brain,

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.080
whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:31.080
So what those reasons are is unclear.

01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.080
But with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,

01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:42.080
cooking makes it possible because it's supplying more calories

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:48.080
and it is enormously reducing the amount of time that it takes to chew your food.

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:53.080
So if you were a gorilla and you wanted to have a bigger brain,

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:56.080
you might say, OK, well, let's just eat some more.

01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:02.080
But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:09.080
in the sense that they're eating for maybe seven or eight hours a day in some seasons.

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.080
That's just chewing.

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.080
And then they've got to sit around and digest their food

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:15.080
because they can't just eat all the time.

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:21.080
They've got to take a break while the food is digested in the stomach

01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:23.080
and then passed into the gut.

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.080
So the stomach is already full.

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:30.080
So basically gorillas are eating about the maximum rate already.

01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.080
So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.080
It doesn't.

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:38.080
It's actually got a smaller brain relative to its body size than chimpanzee does.

01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:44.080
And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:46.080
Then you come along and cook.

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:51.080
And all of a sudden you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:56.080
You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:03.080
There are 25 bodily processes or more that are involved in digesting your food,

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:07.080
making the acid that takes the proteins apart,

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:14.080
maintaining the brush border where the molecules are taken across the gut wall and so on.

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:16.080
That all costs.

01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:18.080
It costs you to digest your food.

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:20.080
It costs less if you cook your food.

01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:23.080
That's the net gain in the amount of energy.

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:29.080
And you are reducing the amount of time from, in our case of our ancestors,

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:36.080
probably around 50% of the day chewing to nowadays one hour a day chewing.

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:40.080
So all of a sudden you've got hours a day in which to do other things,

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:44.080
to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow.

01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:48.080
So with Homo erectus, you start the process of getting a bigger brain

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:52.080
and famously throughout the whole period of the evolution of the genus Homo,

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:57.080
you have a steadily increasing size of brain.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:02.080
Until right at the end when it actually gets smaller, but that's a different story.

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:04.080
Which end is this?

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.080
Are we talking about Homo sapiens?

01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:11.080
Yeah, with Homo sapiens you've got a smaller brain from,

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:17.080
people haven't got it exactly down, but at least 30,000 years ago it starts declining.

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:22.080
And so the fascinating thing about that is that all domesticated animals

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:25.080
have smaller brains than their wild ancestors.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:34.080
The domestication is intricately connected to this brain size, you think.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.080
Exactly.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:40.080
So I think what we're seeing in humans is that same manifestation.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.080
And then the fascinating question is why.

01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:48.080
And the only point I would want to make about this is that there's no evidence

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:55.080
that in the small brain domesticates, they're losing say an average of about 15% of brain size,

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:58.080
in the small brain domesticates compared to their wild ancestors,

01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.080
there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability.

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:08.080
So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain,

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:13.080
it's a more pedomorphic brain looking like the juveniles of the ancestor,

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:19.080
but just as our kids are very smart and can learn amazing things compared to adults,

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:25.080
all they lack is wisdom and maturity, but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.

01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.080
And I think that's the same with domesticated animals compared to their wild ancestors,

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:36.080
and probably therefore with Homo sapiens say 30,000 years ago compared to their ancestors.

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:39.080
So we have smaller brains than the underdogs.

01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:43.080
Size, Richard, isn't everything.

01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.080
Exactly.

01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:49.080
What's the connection between fire, cooking, and the eating of meat?

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:56.080
Which came first, do you think, humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat

01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.080
or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.080
I think that fire increased the use of meat.

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:13.080
But the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt and kill meat, as do bonobos,

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.080
certainly puts us in...

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:20.080
So those two species have a common ancestor with us going six, seven million years ago,

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.080
and it was from that common ancestor that you get the Australopithecine line.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:28.080
It's very likely therefore Australopithecines were eating meat when they could get it,

01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:32.080
which wouldn't be very often because they wouldn't be very good sprinters,

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.080
but nevertheless they would occasionally be able to get some meat,

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.080
and I bet they loved it all the time.

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.080
And basically all primates like meat if they can get it, almost all of them.

01:56:41.080 --> 01:56:48.080
But I think fire would have been very important for a couple of reasons.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:55.080
One is that once you eat your food cooked, then you're saving yourself time.

01:56:55.080 --> 01:57:03.080
By saving yourself time, you can free up the opportunity to go and hunt more

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.080
because hunting is a high risk, high gain activity.

01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:13.080
There's every risk that you will get nothing on one particular afternoon that you go off

01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:16.080
looking for opportunities to kill.

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:22.080
But it's high gain because when you do get something, you bring down a kudu,

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.080
and you've got a serious amount of meat.

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:32.080
What did males and females do with the time they were saving from not having to chew their food?

01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:36.080
I think that in the case of males, it's very reasonable to think,

01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.080
they spent a greatly increased amount of time hunting.

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.080
So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,

01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.080
and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.

01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:53.080
With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,

01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:55.080
and the average hunt length is six hours.

01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:57.080
So it's a huge difference.

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:01.080
And that's possible because the time was available because they were cooking.

01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:03.080
Less chewing, more hunting.

01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.080
You got it.

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:11.080
The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:14.080
So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:17.080
and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:20.080
They are so excited about going into the hunt,

01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:24.080
and when they make the kill, then there's screams everywhere,

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:29.080
and some try to seize it and capture it and take it away from the others,

01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:32.080
and eventually the strongest one has it,

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:36.080
and the others sit around begging and trying to get some and tear it off,

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.080
and so they all love it.

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.080
There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree

01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.080
in order to be able to get away from all of these beggars and scavengers,

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:50.080
and while he's there, he drops of blood or little scraps full time to the bottom,

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:55.080
and the junior members of society, you know, the females and young and that sort of thing,

01:58:55.080 --> 01:59:00.080
they are racing through to find a particular leaf that's got to drop a blood on it

01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:01.080
so they can lick it.

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.080
I mean, they love it.

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:08.080
But it takes them a lot of time to chew it.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:11.080
I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general.

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:16.080
So they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.080
and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,

01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:22.080
I've had enough of this, I need real food,

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:26.080
and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again,

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:32.080
because they can get fruit into their bodies so much faster than they can get meat.

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.080
So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:37.080
and they can eat the meat so just much more readily.

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:42.080
So I think that mediating would become important for two reasons with cooking.

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:48.080
So the key, not to oversimplify, but the key moments in human history

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:55.080
are with the Homo erectus, the discovery of fire and the use of fire for cooking,

01:59:55.080 --> 02:00:02.080
and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males killing off the alpha males

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:07.080
so that the cooperation can exist and cooperation leads to communication

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:11.080
and language and ideas, the sharing of ideas, that kind of thing.

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:16.080
Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that is that you have to ask,

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:21.080
how is it that the beta males were able to kill the alpha male?

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:28.080
And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males within their own group sometimes,

02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:31.080
it's not a process of killing the alpha male.

02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:36.080
It's taking advantage of opportunity when some male gets into a bad position,

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.080
but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.

02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:42.080
And you can see why, because they don't have language.

02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:48.080
And without language, it's very difficult to know how confident you can be

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:53.080
of the support of others against a particular individual within your own group.

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:57.080
When you're attacking someone from another group, that problem is solved.

02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:01.080
We all hate those guys.

02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:06.080
But the alpha male has got alliances within his group.

02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:11.080
Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:15.080
Some of them might be harboring deep feelings of resentment.

02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:18.080
But how does anyone else know that?

02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:23.080
So in other words, I think that you have to have some kind of language that is pretty good

02:01:23.080 --> 02:01:31.080
to solve the problems of gaining confidence that five of you say,

02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:38.080
or some number, can trust each other in this final attack.

02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.080
And even nowadays, it's difficult.

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:44.080
You mentioned Stalin.

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:48.080
It's like, why was everybody terrified?

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.080
Any dictator that takes control?

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.080
Why is all of us as individuals terrified when you know there's millions of us?

02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:57.080
That's right.

02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:04.080
And so like that, we lack the language because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.

02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:06.080
Like, who can we talk to?

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:08.080
Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?

02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:09.080
Exactly.

02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:10.080
That's right.

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:16.080
But do you have this intuition that some kind of language was developing

02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.080
along with this process of beta males taking over?

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:21.080
Yes.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:27.080
Once you have sufficient language to be able to have the beta males conspiring to kill the alpha male,

02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:34.080
then you have selection in favor of cooperation and tolerance, as we spoke about.

02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:39.080
And at that point, there will be increased ability to communicate

02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:42.080
and the language will get richer and better and better.

02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:43.080
So yes, absolutely.

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:48.080
Positive feedback loop once you get the situation started.

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:56.080
Can you maybe comment on the full complexity and richness of the human mind through this process?

02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:06.080
Casually saying cooking fire and beta males leading to cooperation.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.080
But how does the beauty of the human mind emerge from all of this?

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:13.080
Is there other further steps we need to understand?

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:21.080
Or is it as simple as this language emerging from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:25.080
Or am I also over romanticizing how amazing the human mind is?

02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:33.080
Is it just like one small step in a long journey of evolution?

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:48.080
Well, if the beauty of the human mind is the ability of us all to be creative, to explore,

02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:50.080
that's one kind of beauty.

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:56.080
Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.

02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:03.080
And we think of that as beautiful because it is a kind of rare and special ability

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:14.080
compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness that can commonly predominate.

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:22.080
I suppose we have to think of different sources for those two types.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:29.080
I suppose a general answer is that there has been selection in favor of bigger brains

02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:34.080
which probably in general has been associated with increasing cognitive ability.

02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:41.080
And as that has happened, the complexity of life has increased

02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:48.080
because people have more and more complex, highly differentiated strategies

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:53.080
in response to each other's more complex, highly differentiated strategies.

02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:57.080
We get to a point where there is deception and self-deception.

02:04:57.080 --> 02:05:07.080
There is a manipulation of ideas through stories that we invent and stories that we pass on.

02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:22.080
I guess all I'm wanting to say is that there is a world of the mind that evolves in response

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:28.080
to these platforms that are put there, the platform of increasing brain size

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:33.080
and therefore cognitive ability made possible by increased energy supply.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:42.080
The platform of cooperation and tolerance in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict

02:05:42.080 --> 02:05:49.080
and therefore a need to respond to the conflict and manipulate your eyes appropriately.

02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:55.080
I don't see either kind of beauty as coming totally independently of these things.

02:05:55.080 --> 02:06:02.080
I don't think there is a selection for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.

02:06:03.080 --> 02:06:10.080
But I guess sexual selection, males wanting to impress females in different ways

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:18.080
will lead to them wanting to show off in all the different ways.

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:23.080
All of these are natural consequences of just coming up with strategies

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:27.080
of how to cooperate and how to achieve certain ends.

02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:35.080
We haven't spoken about sexual selection, but that is a really important part of it.

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:43.080
They are trying to out-compete each other normally without any physical conflict

02:06:43.080 --> 02:06:47.080
just in order to be able to be chosen by mates of the opposite sex.

02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:53.080
That is certainly a major source of creativity.

02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:59.080
You've studied chimps, you also all the other relatives, gorillas.

02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:03.080
What do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps, about gorillas, about humans?

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:10.080
Maybe you can paint the whole picture of that evolutionary, that little local pocket of the evolutionary tree.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:15.080
How are we related? What is the common ancestor? What are the interesting differences?

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:22.080
I know I'm asking a million questions, but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas,

02:07:22.080 --> 02:07:29.080
and humans like how we're related and what you find fascinating about each?

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:40.080
In Africa, straddling the equator, there is a strip of rainforest that relies on the combination

02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:46.080
of high temperatures and rainfall that you get around the equator.

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:55.080
That rainforest goes into about 22 countries, and throughout those countries you have chimpanzees,

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.080
although they've gone extinct in two of them.

02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:10.080
In just a fraction of them, five countries, you've got gorillas, where there are mountains,

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:17.080
and in one country, on the left bank of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.

02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:23.080
In the African forest, you've got these three African apes, the only African apes,

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:30.080
all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.

02:08:30.080 --> 02:08:39.080
They walk on their knuckles through the forest looking for fruit trees and eating herbs when they can't find fruits.

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:51.080
Gorillas represent the oldest chain, so about 10 million years ago, maybe as recently as 8 million years ago,

02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:57.080
the ancestor of gorillas broke off from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.

02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:04.080
They've probably remained very similar now to what they were then.

02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:18.080
They were probably the largest apes living in montane areas and spending more time eating just herbs, stems,

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:22.080
not so vitally dependent on fruit.

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:36.080
And living in, if it was like the present, groups up to about 50 stable groups with one alpha male who was in charge.

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:47.080
Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive compared to chimps and bonobos.

02:09:47.080 --> 02:10:00.080
I had the privilege of spending a week or two with gorillas at Diane Fossey's camp before she was murdered.

02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:09.080
And I went out with two women, Kelly and Barb, to a particular group.

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:18.080
And there was a young female in the group called Simba, and Simba approached us and stared at the two women.

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:30.080
And then she came towards me and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles and touched me on the forehead.

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:38.080
She was watched in doing this by a young male who was quite keen on her and he was called Digit.

02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:44.080
And about five minutes later Digit stood in front of us on the path.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:50.080
And Kelly was in front of me and then there was Barb and then there was me.

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:56.080
And he came charging down the path and he sidestepped around Kelly and he sidestepped around Barb.

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:05.080
And me, he just knocked with his arm and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.080
And I loved the way that that was a very deliberate response.

02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:14.080
And I loved the way that Simba had been so interested in me and held my eye.

02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:17.080
Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye.

02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:24.080
But gorillas really look as though they're trying to sort of figure out, what are you thinking about?

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:30.080
That was a species that goes back for something like 10 million years.

02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:35.080
In that situation, was there a game being played?

02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:40.080
Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me, I don't want you messing with Simba.

02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.080
But was Simba using you?

02:11:43.080 --> 02:11:46.080
Oh, I see. Well, that's a fun idea.

02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:53.080
I don't see why she should be using me, but you mean testing how strongly Digit was prepared to interview?

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:54.080
Yeah, exactly.

02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.080
Oh, that's come straight out of a sort of adolescent to high school playbook.

02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:00.080
All right. Well, that's all.

02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:02.080
No, there's nothing wrong with it for that.

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:07.080
I never thought of that and you never know.

02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:09.080
It's possible.

02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:17.080
So, yeah, okay, so this is an ancient branch of the evolutionary tree, this gorilla that led to gorillas.

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.080
Gorillas.

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:27.080
So then the next thing that happened on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago when you have the line

02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:34.080
between chimps and bonobos on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:41.080
And basically what happened is that at that point, a chimplike ancestor leaves the forest,

02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:47.080
gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts and that becomes the Australopithecines.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:53.080
And meanwhile, the chimpanzees and bonobo ancestor continues in the forest.

02:12:53.080 --> 02:13:01.080
And later what happens is that one branch of that crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.080
That was only about two million years ago, maybe one million years ago.

02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:13.080
Now, the chimps that remained in the forest for this time and occupied all the countries across from West to East Africa now.

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:21.080
Again, we assume that they're pretty similar to the ones that live nowadays where there's some variation from West to East.

02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:29.080
And these are animals that live in social communities of between say 20 and 200.

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:35.080
They have a lot of them in one group, but they never come together in a single unit.

02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:45.080
These are, they share an area, a community territory and that area is defended by males and within it females wander and bring up their young independently.

02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:55.080
And the females are very scared about the possibility that males will be mean to their infants.

02:13:55.080 --> 02:14:04.080
And in order to avoid them doing that, they do their best to mate with every single male in the group multiple times.

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:10.080
As if to give a memory in that male of, yeah, yeah, I reminded you, so I'm not going to be mean to your baby.

02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:12.080
So what's wonderful about chimps?

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:19.080
Well, you know, as we've spoken about them, you know, they are creative and sort of amazingly human like.

02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:25.080
But I love the sort of, you know, the quiet moments and here's one.

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:33.080
I've got two chimps who are grooming each other on a day when they are utterly exhausted.

02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:39.080
They've walked 11 kilometers the day before up and down hills.

02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:45.080
And on this particular day, all they do is they get to one tree and they eat from that tree.

02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:52.080
And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:54.080
So they're utterly exhausted.

02:14:54.080 --> 02:14:59.080
And they're just eating nonstop because they're trying to recover their energy.

02:14:59.080 --> 02:15:02.080
And this is Hugh and Charlie.

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:08.080
And we think they were probably brothers that we never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.

02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:22.080
Well, I never remember now who it is, but let's say that they both come down from the tree and they're both carrying branches of the food.

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.080
Everything actually seeds from these branches.

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:33.080
They're both engaged even in the midday sun when they want to come down and shade themselves for a bit on the ground.

02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:35.080
They're still eating.

02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:42.080
Then Charlie finishes his branch and he starts grooming Hugh.

02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:49.080
And Hugh continues eating from his branch.

02:15:49.080 --> 02:16:01.080
Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes and he reaches out and he lifts the branch from which Hugh is still taking seeds

02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:08.080
and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back as far as possible away from Hugh.

02:16:08.080 --> 02:16:10.080
Hugh doesn't do anything.

02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:15.080
He just finishes his mouthful and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.

02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:19.080
So this very polite way of saying, will you groom me please has worked.

02:16:20.080 --> 02:16:33.080
Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back and around to the right side and then down his arm to what point where he can reach the branch again.

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:36.080
And then he picks up the branch and continues.

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:37.080
Not sure, aren't they?

02:16:37.080 --> 02:16:38.080
Right.

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:39.080
Yeah.

02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:47.080
So in other words, they have a very sort of simple little strategy, but it just shows the courtesy with which they can treat each other.

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:58.080
And the days I love with chimps are when you see that sort of thing or when you see mothers just lying in a sunlit patch in the forest with their babies bouncing on top of them,

02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:01.080
just having a wonderful, peaceful time.

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:06.080
And that's what most of their lives are like.

02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:16.080
So chimpanzees are the species that kind of unites the rest of the apes because a gorilla is in many ways just a big version of a chimpanzee.

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:22.080
If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger, it basically turns into a gorilla.

02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:35.080
And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee, but obviously humans didn't domesticate them, so they're self-domesticated.

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:44.080
They are less aggressive and they show all the marks of domestication that domesticated animals do compared to wild animals in their bones.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:49.080
So they have reduced differences between males and females in which the males are more like females.

02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:50.080
They have smaller brains.

02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:55.080
They have shorter faces, smaller teeth and smaller bodies.

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:57.080
All the things that domesticated animals show.

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:05.080
And bonobos live in this environment in a strikingly peaceful way compared to the chimpanzees.

02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:16.080
There's no indication that they will have these aggressive kills and enough data now to show that there's a statistical difference in the frequency in which it would happen.

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:21.080
And bonobos are famously erotic.

02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:33.080
The females have enlarged sexual parts which swell to a particularly large size compared to the female chimpanzees.

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:45.080
And the females have a lot of interactions with each other in which they excitedly rubbed their clitorises together and appeared to have orgasms.

02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:52.080
These occur in the context of some kind of social tension.

02:18:52.080 --> 02:19:05.080
And they sometimes happen before, sometimes after the social tension, and they seem to be devices, these interactions, for ensuring that everyone's friends and reducing the chances that they're actually going to get into a fight.

02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:13.080
There's a kind of conflict resolution through sex or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:16.080
Well, it's often characterized as make love not war.

02:19:16.080 --> 02:19:18.080
Make love not war.

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:21.080
Okay.

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:26.080
You mentioned to me offline that you have a deep love for nature.

02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:38.080
If we look at the world today, how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature remain a big part of our lives?

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:51.080
Assuming beings, in the way we think about it, in the way we also keep it around, preserve it, you know, we keep it part of our minds and part of our world.

02:19:51.080 --> 02:20:13.080
It's a very difficult question because every time there is a conflict between conservation of a natural habitat and allowing people to get a little bit of extra food for their babies, then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:22.080
And so we have this steady erosion in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:31.080
We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats and all the species, and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.

02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:40.080
Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples of something being saved, but the overall trend is clear.

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:46.080
And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that because it's not human.

02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:57.080
Now that we are essentially a single tribe to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.

02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:14.080
So I think the only way in which we can really conserve is if we put tremendous effort into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:29.080
Often this will be the national parks that already exist, and what we have to do is to make them so valuable that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival to be able to keep those sorts of places.

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:43.080
And that's the attitude that my colleagues and I have taken in Uganda where we want to keep the Kibali National Park alive, which has got the largest population in chimpanzees in Uganda,

02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:52.080
and it's got elephants and wonderful birds and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so on, and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors.

02:21:52.080 --> 02:22:03.080
It may be that we're going to have to have huge increases in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism, and you need to make sure ecotourism is done right.

02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:15.080
In other places you will keep nature there because it's useful for maintaining the climate, bringing rain.

02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:41.080
Maybe you can in some places convince people of the sheer sort of aesthetics of keeping nature that even over the long term, presidents whose job it is to look for the future of the country will be persuaded that you can do it for purely aesthetic reasons.

02:22:41.080 --> 02:23:02.080
But overall, what is required is for people in the rich countries to do much more investment than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places in their own countries and in the tropics.

02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:16.080
And if you look at Africa, the population trends are that Nigeria may become the most populous country in the world, I think, within a century.

02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:23.080
The future of African habitats, it's clear what's going to happen in general.

02:23:23.080 --> 02:23:27.080
There's going to be a huge conversion towards agricultural land.

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:42.080
I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago about the prospect of the entire globe being turned into a single human feedlot.

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:45.080
It's going to take a lot to avoid that.

02:23:45.080 --> 02:23:53.080
He is out there calling for half the earth to be devoted to nature.

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:57.080
It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic.

02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:03.080
But unless you have really exciting goals, probably nothing will be achieved.

02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:17.080
Yeah, I mean, there's something to me like when I visit New York and I see Central Park and somehow constructed a situation where you preserve this park in the middle, probably some of the most expensive land in the world.

02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:35.080
The fact that that's possible gives me hope that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale, perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons of just valuing the beauty and disrespecting our origins of having come from the earth.

02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:44.080
We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees, bonobos and gorillas as our close relatives still living on the earth.

02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:54.080
We're unlucky that we don't have Australopithecines and other species of homo, but we're still lucky to have those because they are incredibly closely related to us compared to what most animals have.

02:24:54.080 --> 02:25:04.080
There are many animals that don't have any close relatives to them on the earth, but not only are they relatively close, but they teach us so much about ourselves.

02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:19.080
The similarities between them and ourselves raise questions that we can then test about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities are derived from the same evolutionary stock as in those great apes.

02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:21.080
Well, how much is that worth?

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:30.080
I mean, we could spend billions going to the Mars to find evidence of bacteria there, and that's fascinating too.

02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:45.080
But we should be spending billions on this earth in order to make sure that we have, I don't know how to say it, substantial representative populations of these close relatives.

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:53.080
Yeah, that we can meet. There's something like space tourism when you go out into space and you look back down on earth.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:58.080
That's to a lot of people, including myself is worth a lot.

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:13.080
But why is that worth a lot is because it's humbling and beautiful in the same way that meeting our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful.

02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:19.080
Just to know that this is what we come from. This is who we are.

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:25.080
Not just for the understanding or the science of it, but just like something about just the beauty of witnessing this.

02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:35.080
And again, it's both humbling and empowering that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.

02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:42.080
Yes, unfortunately, the problems are incredibly difficult to solve and there is no one solver.

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:47.080
It has to happen from a network of potentially cooperating people.

02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:52.080
But I mean, you're so right about it being daunting to think about what it looks like from space.

02:26:52.080 --> 02:27:04.080
And I love the view that Herman Muller expressed of being able to go out from space and he said the whole of life would look like a kind of rust on the planet.

02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:10.080
Yeah, so the aliens were to visit. I'm not sure they would notice the life.

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:17.080
They would probably notice the trees or ocean. It's a kind of rust.

02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:23.080
But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical question. What is the meaning of this rust?

02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:29.080
What do you think is the meaning of life on earth? What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:40.080
Well, I think it's very clear that we have an evolutionary story that is only getting challenged around the edges.

02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:44.080
We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.

02:27:44.080 --> 02:28:02.080
And the meaning is we are here as a consequence of materialistic processes that began in our sense with the establishment of the Earth

02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:09.080
four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was, and then water and oxygen and so on.

02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:22.080
And we are the astonishing consequence of the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.

02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:29.080
The word random is the wrong word to use unless you understand what it means.

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:37.080
It didn't happen by chance, but a lot of random events had to happen to make this possible.

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:42.080
And those random events, of course, are the production of appropriate mutations.

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:54.080
But the meaning of life is there is no meaning. The really big mystery of life is why is there a universe?

02:28:54.080 --> 02:29:01.080
And that's saying why propagates itself through the whole process of it.

02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:14.080
For the emergence of planets, the virgins, first of all, galaxies of star systems, of planets, of the proteins required to construct the single cell organisms

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:23.080
and the single cell organism becoming complex organisms and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land and the whole of it.

02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:28.080
And then there's fire, some clever guy or lady invented fire.

02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:37.080
And then now here we are. It just does seem, speaking as a human, kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole thing.

02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:42.080
Wonderful story. So much more interesting than the stories produced by religion.

02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:53.080
It is beautiful, but it just seems special that us humans are able to write religions and construct stories and also do science.

02:29:53.080 --> 02:30:11.080
That seems kind of amazing. It seems like the universe is such that it creates beings like us that are able to investigate it.

02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:23.080
And that's why there's this longing for why. It's just such a beautiful little pocket of complexity created by the universe.

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:35.080
It seems like there should be a why, but maybe there's just an infinite number of universes and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:39.080
Even without an infinite number of universes, I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.

02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:47.080
Now that we know how many planets have the right sort of conditions, which is what, I can't remember, a lot.

02:30:47.080 --> 02:31:00.080
It's some significant percentage of all planets. Then there are apparently billions of planets and things happen so quickly on Earth.

02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:09.080
Once you've got water, then you've got life and it did not take long for life to evolve in the big scheme of things.

02:31:09.080 --> 02:31:21.080
And if you think you look out there, say there's a nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations, one dimension you can look at is the proclivity to violence they have.

02:31:21.080 --> 02:31:30.080
And it's interesting to think what level of violence is useful for extending the life of a civilization.

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:37.080
So we have a particular set of violence in our history, maybe being too peaceful is a problem in the early days.

02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:41.080
Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem.

02:31:41.080 --> 02:31:46.080
So you look at viruses. What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed?

02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:52.080
If you're too deadly, that's a big problem. If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem.

02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:55.080
So that is a fascinating exploration of...

02:31:55.080 --> 02:32:01.080
I don't see any evidence. There's no way you're coming from when you say that being too peaceful is a problem.

02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:12.080
Well, because, I'll say it this way, death is a way to get rid of suboptimal solutions.

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:16.080
But there's lots of ways to die without violence.

02:32:16.080 --> 02:32:19.080
Right. To me, death in itself is violence.

02:32:19.080 --> 02:32:31.080
And a lot of people that talk about, for example, longevity and disease and all that kind of stuff, they see death is the way they talk about it.

02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:37.080
And it's interesting to think of it that way. Death is like mass murder that's happening.

02:32:38.080 --> 02:32:47.080
People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life, they see that you're helping...

02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:58.080
The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization, from their perspective, is not allocating all our resources to solving death.

02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:06.080
Right. Because death is a kind of violence. It is a kind of murder that we're allowing to be committed on us by nature.

02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:14.080
So the flip side of that is death makes way for new life, for new ideas.

02:33:14.080 --> 02:33:24.080
Yes, but that's got nothing to do with peace versus war. You have animals that are very, very peaceful, but they evolve just in the same way as other animals do.

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:28.080
They just don't do it with death caused by violence.

02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:34.080
And violent death is premature death, surely. I mean, I don't mind about people dying.

02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:40.080
What I mind about is people dying in their youth.

02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:46.080
Prematurely, but some people would say all death is premature. It certainly feels that way.

02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:52.080
It's died too soon. Anyone who's ever died died too soon.

02:33:52.080 --> 02:34:00.080
Yeah. Well, I mean, if we can become like sequoias and live for hundreds of years or thousands of years, that would be great.

02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:04.080
Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?

02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:10.080
I don't think I'm afraid of it. You know, I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.

02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:19.080
I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life, you know, and I don't want to, to leave the party.

02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:25.080
Yeah, it's kind of a fun party. I don't want to leave the party either.

02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:30.080
So however we got here, we made one heck of an awesome party and you're right.

02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:35.080
Having a party with a little bit less violence than it is an even more fun party.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:40.080
Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time with me today. Your work is amazing.

02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:48.080
It includes some of the deepest thinking about our human history and the nature of human civilization.

02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:51.080
So again, thank you so much for talking today. It's an honor.

02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:54.080
Thanks for your great questions. It's a really fun conversation.

02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.080
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Rangham.

02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:05.080
And now let me leave you some words from Jane Goodall.

02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:09.080
The greatest danger to our future is apathy.

02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:13.080
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
