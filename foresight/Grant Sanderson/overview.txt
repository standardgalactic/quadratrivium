1. **Connect with Pre-existing Interests**: Find a way to relate the topic to something that already interests your students, which can make them more willing to learn.
   
2. **Leverage Hype and Trends**: Use current trends or popular topics (like Wordle) as a gateway to introduce the concepts you want to teach, making the content more engaging.

3. **Clarity and Visual Aids**: Ensure clarity in your explanations and use compelling diagrams or visual aids to help students understand complex ideas, which can also pique their interest.

4. **Motivation**: Understand that motivation to learn is crucial. If students are motivated by intrinsic interests or by seeing the relevance of the content, they are more likely to engage with the material.

5. **Engagement Outside of Class**: Encourage students to continue learning outside of class through various means such as YouTube videos, which can provide alternative perspectives and reinforce learning.

6. **Post-Class Interaction**: Be available for further questions or discussions after class to help clarify any doubts and deepen understanding.

Remember, the key is to make learning compelling and relevant to the students' interests and experiences. This checklist can serve as a guide to enhance engagement in educational settings.
