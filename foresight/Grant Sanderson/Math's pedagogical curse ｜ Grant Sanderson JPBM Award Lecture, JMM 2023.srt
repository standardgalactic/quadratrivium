00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's JPBM Communications Award lecture.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,880
I'm Michael Pearson with the Mathematical Association of America.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,320
We're part of JPBM and I'm really delighted to be able to recognize Grant Sanderson today

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
with one of this year's communications awards.

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,760
That is the creator and founder of Three Blue, One Brown, which is an effort to provide

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,360
visualization of mathematics and it's a YouTube channel easily found.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
I hope you'll take a look at it.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
I had done my homework as I'm supposed to do when I was warned to do this and written

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,760
out a nice introduction, which of course I can now not find on my electronic device,

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,520
which is supposed to give me that.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:01,600
But I'll say, as I went on the site and as a harmonic analyst, I've spent a good bit

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,240
of time thinking about convolutions, convolution kernels and so forth.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,840
I was really immediately attracted to see what Grant would do with convolution.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
He has a nice video presentation.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,040
What's the introduction to convolution?

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,920
Some of you may know that the German word for convolution is Faltung, folding.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,320
And I think the video that Grant does with that really sort of makes that dynamic and

18
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,280
shows you why folding is such a great word for convolution.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
So I encourage you to look at that one and any others that catch your eye.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,440
In any case, Grant graduated from Stanford University from Math and Computer Science in

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,800
2015.

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,560
He spent some time working on videos and instructional materials for the Khan Academy.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,040
And then by now, he's turned his full-time attention to three blue, one brown.

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,440
And there's some really great stuff there.

25
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,640
And without further ado, I'll let him tell us about it.

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Thank you.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,760
Thank you very much for that very warm introduction.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,360
I want to start just by saying a very heartfelt thanks to the members of the Joint Policy

29
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,520
Board for the award.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,600
I will admit it is a little bit intimidating to receive an award for communication and then

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,680
to be asked to immediately communicate to a roomful of people I have high respect for.

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,040
I'll do my best, but I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the names on the list

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,640
for this particular award in past years were just personal heroes of mine who served to

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,360
inspire me a lot in getting started.

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,760
Things like Steve Strogatz or James Glick or Matt Parker all come to mind, but those

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,120
are just a few of very, very many.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,080
So I want to say thanks there.

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
Broadly speaking, I want to talk about math communication itself and some of my thoughts

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,520
around math communication.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,680
But this breaks into a number of different categories, and it's kind of a hard thing

41
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,680
to think about as a unified whole because one component of that is education.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,400
And even that, it feels wrong to loop into a single group because education before university

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,880
and math and education undergrad and on have a very qualitatively different flavor to them

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,880
and how you might think about what approaches are best or what's the typical engagement

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,040
a student has.

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,680
And even that is very different from other forms of communication that happen, you know,

47
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,120
presenting one's research or popularization, which is probably the bucket that I fit most

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,760
closely into if I had to choose just one that's where I actually sit.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,640
But I do think it's very helpful, whichever one of these slices you find yourself in to

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,000
think about them as intersecting each other and a lot of the value coming from that intersection.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,480
Some directions here are obvious, like if you're in education, it doesn't hurt to think

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,840
about it as a popularization effort.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,680
If you want to popularize something, you try to make it more engaging.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,360
You try to connect to things that people are already interested in.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,160
It doesn't hurt to do the same if it's in a classroom.

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,000
But I also think on the flip side, as someone who popularizes things or at least tries to,

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,840
it's often not the right approach to do that head on and think, how can I make something

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,960
that's going to reach the most people, you know, has the most click-baity title and the

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
like.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,400
But what I've noticed is people just want to learn.

61
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,360
The thing that makes something more popular, the thing that gets more reach, as often if

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,840
I do something that's meant more as a classroom supplement, because people don't want to feel

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,360
like they're just being watered down or talked down to, instead having a sense that what

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
they're staring at is the authentic material, as if they were studying it and becoming an

65
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
expert in it.

66
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,440
I think that's a very inspiring feeling.

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,000
So I titled this, Raising the Ceiling and Lowering the Floor of Math Exposition, referencing

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,800
the fact that I think some of the efforts that we can make in trying to popularize it

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,080
to reach more people can also make it more interesting to those who are already experts

70
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
in it.

71
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,600
But if I wanted to be a little bit more provocative in how I went about this talk, I could just

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,360
as easily give what I have in mind the name of Math's Pedagogical Curse, because I really

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,640
do think there's something strange going on with math, in particular, in contrast to

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,400
some other fields, if we think about the perception that it has in the broader public.

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,520
I think everybody in this room has probably had the experience of chatting with someone,

76
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,400
cocktail party type environment.

77
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,800
You mention you do something related to math, and the person says, as if there's no social

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,600
taboo in saying it at all, which I guess there's not, oh, I'm not really a math person.

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,880
Just fair, not everybody necessarily loves the subject that we do, but it's a funny phrase

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,600
because you don't say that with respect to other things.

81
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,720
But there's another turn of phrase that I've heard multiple different times, that in some

82
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,400
sense is even more worrying than that one, which is the, I thought I liked math until.

83
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,200
I have a very vivid memory, actually, of being a high school student touring different universities.

84
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,680
And I was one of those students who always knew that I wanted to study math.

85
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
I'd already fallen in love with it.

86
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
So if I'd meet some students at the university, they asked their natural questions, oh, what

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
do you think you might want to major in?

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,800
I was like, I know, I want to major in math.

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,920
And I remember this one student saying, oh, yeah, yeah, I thought I liked math.

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,080
I even wanted to be a math major.

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,280
And then I took a set theory class, and I discovered that I don't really like math, which is very

92
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
sad.

93
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,920
And I've heard variants of this through the years in various different contexts.

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,960
Oh, I thought I liked math, and then I took a linear algebra class, right?

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,120
I thought I liked math until, and then there's some point in which someone became disillusioned

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,240
with it for whatever reason.

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,640
Now that one feels like it's especially worth addressing, because it's very hard, I think,

98
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,800
to ignite the light of interest in the first place.

99
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,440
And even if maybe the more important one to address is the broad scope of people who don't

100
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,160
self-identify as math people, we could just as easily ask, what are we doing wrong such

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,920
that we get some people that thought they liked math and tell?

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,800
Maybe the answer is math is just harder than other fields.

103
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,400
It's just something you got to roll up your sleeves and work hard in order to attain, and

104
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
not all people are willing to do that.

105
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
I don't think that would be fair, though, because that kind of pushes the bump under

106
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,960
the rug where you have to instead ask, does it have to be that hard?

107
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
Is there anything that we're doing that makes it harder than it needs to be?

108
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,120
And I have a little theory for at least one component of what might be going on with math

109
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,000
in what makes it distinct from other fields.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And it has to do, bear with me here, with the legend of King Midas.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,560
So for those of you who don't know, in Greek mythology, or it's one of those kind of intertwined

112
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
with fake Greek history that Aristotle and the like would tell the people, you have this

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,400
king supposedly who lived around the second millennium BC named Midas.

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,480
And he does some good deeds that catch the attention of certain gods, and the god Dionysus

115
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,920
says, I'm willing to give you a gift, name your gift, and I will give it to you.

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,520
And Midas says, oh, well, what gift should I want?

117
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,600
I think it would be great if anything that I touched could turn to gold.

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,920
And Dionysus says, it is done.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,480
And Midas touches a twig, and it turns into gold.

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
He's delighted.

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,000
He goes back to his estate, and he starts touching all of the roses in his garden, and

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,600
they turn into a beautiful metallic sheening gold.

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,080
And he's just dreaming of all the wealth that he's going to have, and the wealth that his

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,440
entire regime is going to have.

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,040
And then when he gets to the banquet for dinner that night, he touches the chicken leg sitting

126
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,440
in front of him, and it turns to gold, and it's completely inedible.

127
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,040
Or in other tellings of the story, the moment that he realizes something might be a little

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,400
bit wrong with this gift is when his daughter comes up to him, and he touches her, and she

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,640
completely turns into gold, and he doesn't have her anymore.

130
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,160
And of course, it precedes where it's a story of redemption and the like.

131
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,760
But the gift that is analogous to this that I think math has, and it really is a gift,

132
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,080
is a very special kind of exactness where we have the pleasure of knowing with 100 percent

133
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,720
uncertainty if a conclusion follows from the premises.

134
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,520
Maybe not 100 percent, it's subject to our ability to fall for certain logical fallacies

135
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,560
or to miss holes in an argument.

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,640
But with as much precision as you could possibly hope for, math has this kind of exactness.

137
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,320
And a lot of other fields would just dream of anything like this.

138
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,760
Hard sciences get kind of close if we think of physics or computer science.

139
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,040
But even then, they're subject to a little bit of controversy with different ways you

140
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,160
might interpret something, or even the best experiments aren't 100 percent precise.

141
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,520
The softer sciences get even further away from this.

142
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,600
Most forms of writing and discourse out there are more unabashedly subjective.

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,440
You might think of art criticism, it's not unworthy, but it lacks this exactness.

144
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,200
And the gift that comes from this exactness is that it helps you move forward a field.

145
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,080
You don't fall into the same disputes that you might otherwise when there's room for

146
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
ambiguity and misinterpretations.

147
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,920
But I think what it might even mean for something to be mathematical is that it has this level

148
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
of exactness.

149
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,200
There's a friend of mine who's a biologist, and anytime we talk she always bemoans the

150
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,120
fact that biology needs to become more of a mathematical science.

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,200
Just how far could humanity progress if we could turn biology into a mathematical science.

152
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,560
And presumably what she means by that is that you get a situation where you can draw conclusions

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,000
from your premises with the same airtight rock solid rigor that a field like physics

154
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
might have.

155
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,080
The other really nice thing that this gets us, I think, is when you're writing something,

156
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,520
like you're writing a textbook or a paper or a video or you're preparing a lecture,

157
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,200
it gives a test for completion that no one else gets to have.

158
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,320
We can have this clear notion of it's not done yet and then at some point there's a

159
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,040
sense in which it's done.

160
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,120
We can go through and you can make sure all of the definitions are completely unambiguous.

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,240
We get to have unambiguous definitions.

162
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,480
Nothing else doesn't get to have those.

163
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,520
You can ask whether every object in the theorems that you reference have been previously defined.

164
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,000
It's like a compiler checking code.

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,720
You get to go through and the answer is either clearly delineated yes or clearly delineated

166
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
no.

167
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,400
And then most importantly for every claim that you make, you can ask was it completely

168
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,640
justified.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,760
And then that constitutes a notion of explanation in some sense.

170
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
It gives you a clear point where before you got to that point the paper wasn't finished

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,920
or the lecture wasn't finished but after that point you can put a little bow around

172
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
it and say it was finished.

173
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,480
And like I said, I really do think it's a gift because it helps us move forward in a

174
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,240
way that other fields can't.

175
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,880
But there's a catch to this gift where in the same way that the things that King Minus

176
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,520
might touch and turn to gold but this had a problem where he wouldn't be able to eat

177
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:22,040
his food, the mathematician can touch anything, give it this notion of completely unambiguous

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
rigor.

179
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,880
But sometimes it runs the risk of leaving it, how shall we put it, slightly unpalatable

180
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,880
to the average casual reader or maybe a little bit harder to consume than it needs to be

181
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
for a typical student.

182
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,360
And I do want to emphasize I don't think that it's a necessary thing that follows.

183
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,080
I don't want to come across as implying that if something is rigorous that means that it's

184
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,840
not clear.

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,720
It's a little bit of an exaggeration to make the comparison with Midas quite like this.

186
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,240
But what I do think is possibly the case is that this allure of such a notion of exactness

187
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,040
where we can actually say that it is done in a certain sense means that rigor serves

188
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,280
kind of as a distraction, right?

189
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,120
I have to tell you, there will be no year that I grow tired of this meme.

190
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
I know it's a little bit old, but the staying power with this is just unparalleled.

191
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,760
No, but I think it's the case that a lot of really good authors manage to achieve both

192
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,960
rigor and clarity.

193
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,520
And in fact, the point of rigor is often to add more clarity.

194
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,320
But the thing that I suspect might happen every now and then is that because the rigor

195
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,120
gives you this very clean, nice thing to think about and because thinking about pedagogical

196
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,760
clarity is a lot messier, you know, it's harder to define, you can't put a bow around it.

197
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,440
There's not one point when you've gone from not done to completely done that after scratching

198
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,920
the itch of knowing that something's been written completely rigorously, it's easy to

199
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,240
call a work done when maybe we shouldn't call it done yet.

200
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,520
And there's context where this is maybe okay, research papers come to mind, but in things

201
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,840
that are more explicitly pedagogical, textbooks come to mind, I would propose that maybe it

202
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,640
makes sense to invite into the culture a similar focus that we already have on the rigor of

203
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,360
it, but instead onto something for the pedagogical clarity.

204
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,200
And I'll give an example here, which is essentially just from the book that was sitting on my

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
desk while I was putting together these slides.

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,240
I actually love the textbook, it's really great and one of the only reasons I feel comfortable

207
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
highlighting it and poking a little bit of fun at one of the sections is because it otherwise

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,120
holds up very well and it's one I would unabashedly recommend.

209
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,640
But I was thinking, okay, you know, how well does the author tend to think about points

210
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,760
of pedagogical clarity in addition to points of rigorous clarity?

211
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
And one particular section that I was looking at was about something called the Poisson

212
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,400
summation formula, many of you might be familiar with it, it essentially says for a function

213
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:52,560
which is sufficiently nice, if you add up the value of that function across all of the

214
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,960
integers, it gets the same thing as if you add up the Fourier transform of that function

215
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
across all the integers.

216
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,120
It's kind of a wild formula, very useful in many different contexts.

217
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,720
And the proof that the book gives is actually really beautiful, I liked it a lot.

218
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,600
It starts off by describing a certain function a little bit out of the blue, but if you look

219
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:20,400
at it, you notice that it has poles at all of the integers and the residue at those poles

220
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,960
are exactly the values that you might want to sum on the left hand side of your formula.

221
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,000
And essentially what the book does is it kind of after handing down this construct and after

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,200
describing a certain contour that you might integrate along, and the context here was,

223
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,320
you know, it's in a setting of assuming people are familiar with the complex analysis up

224
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,160
to the point in the book and know about contour, integrals, and the like, it goes through and

225
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,400
shows how you can have a very elegant derivation of the formula basically by unpacking what

226
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,920
this integral is saying and step by step, it eventually turns it into the sum on the

227
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,440
right hand side.

228
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,200
So it's very beautiful, it involves a lot of clever ideas, things fit together nicely

229
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,440
at the end, you can look back on it and I think as a writer, think what more could you

230
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,880
possibly want?

231
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,160
It's as clean a proof as I could imagine.

232
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,520
And I think there's a culture in math textbooks that sort of says once something is proven,

233
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,480
that means it is complete.

234
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,800
But if you try to add a secondary checklist that says what are the pedagogical considerations,

235
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,000
even though I think this is a great book, and even though I think the proof has a lot

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,640
of staying power, there are dozens of other questions that I could think one might want

237
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,440
to lead up to this particular fact with or follow it with.

238
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,800
You know, to start off with, you could just say, what is this formula, how do you think

239
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,600
about it, why should you expect that something like this would be true, what are the circumstances

240
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,080
that you might run into in the mathematical wild, where you would think that this is something

241
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,280
that you need to bring to bear.

242
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,240
For example, it doesn't hurt to illustrate just a little bit, like how do we parse what

243
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,560
each side is saying.

244
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,160
The left hand side, which is adding up the value of the function for all of the positive

245
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,080
integers, you could kind of think of as a extremely coarse Riemann sum for the whole

246
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,240
function.

247
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,560
And one of the terms on the right hand side, if you take the Fourier transform just at

248
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,880
zero, those of you who are comfortable with the matter know that that's just the same

249
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,440
thing as integrating the function.

250
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,320
And so what that tells you is that much of the left hand side is already encapsulated

251
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,840
just with the zero term on the right hand side, and you know, the student might then

252
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,080
be invited to think about how all of the other Fourier coefficients give you a sort of correction

253
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,640
factor between the difference of this coarse Riemann sum in the area, and that instills

254
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,000
a little bit of intuition around if you have an especially smooth function, one that stays

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,960
very flat, that that would suggest that less correction is needed in comparison to if it

256
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,800
has high variation.

257
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,160
When it comes to the proof itself, while the author gave a delightful proof, there were

258
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,800
many steps where, like I said, it felt like it was handed down from on high, and what

259
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,280
I would love to see or would love to feel is a sense of how I might have discovered

260
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
that myself.

261
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,520
I think it's hard to understand just how delightful it can be if you as the reader feel like the

262
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,320
thing that was coming in is something that you kind of anticipated and that it's validating

263
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,080
rather than feeling like you're the one who has to kind of validate that the monument

264
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,120
that you were handed does the thing that's being claimed.

265
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,480
And in this case, you know, I think there's a longer description, but length isn't necessarily

266
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,920
the enemy, that could provide a sort of path of rediscovery for the very elegant proof

267
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,440
that potentially could give it even more staying power.

268
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,240
Now, what I mainly want to ask through the remainder of this talk is, in light of the

269
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,280
fact that we have such a satisfying checklist for rigor that really distinguishes math in

270
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,320
which I think draws the attention of the mathematician and the writer so alluringly because of how

271
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,360
satisfying it is to go through that checklist and know that something's complete, is it

272
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,480
possible to have something that's analogous for those of us who want to popularize or

273
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,840
educate or otherwise communicate as clearly as is possible?

274
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,040
Is there something that has the same sort of itched scratching satisfaction of, you

275
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,120
know, unambiguously knowing that you're there or you're not?

276
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
It's not a fuzzy realm where someone just qualitatively says this writing vaguely seems better,

277
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,200
but is there an actual set of things that we could assign a binary value to?

278
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,440
And the reason I think that might be valuable is that, you know, a mathematician instinct

279
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,480
is one that sort of likes this notion of definiteness.

280
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,040
And so if we can put something a little bit more definite wrapped around the indefinite

281
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,520
realm of pedagogy, that might be helpful.

282
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,400
So you could probably brainstorm a lot of things that might come to mind if you're doing

283
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
this.

284
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,960
A couple that I happened to write down here is, you know, does each definition that

285
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,440
is written down have a motivating example?

286
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,800
You know, a reason you would want to define something like that rather than seeing the

287
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,040
examples come after the proof, after the theorem and the like, do the proofs feel rediscoverable?

288
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,240
Like I said, it can be incredibly satisfying if a student feels like they knew what was

289
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,240
coming.

290
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,240
In our together videos, I really try to focus on a path of rediscovery, which makes it longer,

291
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,680
but again, I don't think length is necessarily the enemy, as long as you're not being verbose

292
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,800
about it.

293
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,720
Another very simple consideration, maybe a little bit vague, a little bit hard to assign

294
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,920
that binary check to, is does it feel personal?

295
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,960
Does it feel like an actual person is talking to you with a little bit of emotion and personality?

296
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,720
I think that matters when it comes to how engaged someone is with something, and when

297
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,040
you're more engaged, you remember things better.

298
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,440
Another simple one, just are there diagrams?

299
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,960
If something should be illustrated, is it illustrated?

300
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,000
This is one that's very near and dear to my heart, as I'll get to in a moment.

301
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,560
But there's all sorts of other things you might do, and I would actually be curious

302
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,240
what anyone else in the audience thinks could be added to this checklist.

303
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,600
What I wanted to do for the remainder is talk through a couple points that I try to think

304
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,320
about as I'm putting together a piece of exposition, or putting together a video.

305
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,840
It's not a complete checklist.

306
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,080
I don't think there exists such a thing as a checklist for pedagogy in quite the same

307
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
way that there's a checklist for rigor.

308
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,440
But I do think if we try to invite that into the culture of math exposition, the attempt

309
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,760
to write down such a checklist could go a long way.

310
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,240
So the channel that I run, for those of you unfamiliar, it's called Three Blue and Brown.

311
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,760
And in a nutshell, the premise is to give lessons that are as visualized as I possibly

312
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:11,040
can make them, not in a way that's superfluous, not in a way that has flashiness for the sake

313
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,400
of production quality flashiness.

314
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,600
But instead, for a given topic, just make sure that each statement that's made, if it

315
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,200
makes sense to, has some kind of diagram that went along with it, or some kind of animation.

316
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,680
Now part of this is because, as a hobby, one of the things I delight in is programming

317
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,000
math animations.

318
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,040
So this was sort of a love child between two different interests of mine, which is teaching

319
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,840
math and then programming animations.

320
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,920
But just to give a little bit of an illustration of what I have in mind, and then to also try

321
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,480
to argue why sometimes making visuals like this isn't just a chore for the sake of adding

322
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,240
more pizzazz to a lesson, but it can make it more interesting for the person putting

323
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,120
together the lesson.

324
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,240
I wanted to look at a video where the reason I made it was because of the visualizations

325
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,640
I was playing around with.

326
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,720
It wasn't that I wrote a script and then I started putting some kind of cartoon to the

327
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
script.

328
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,120
It's instead that I was playing around with trying to visualize something, and then by

329
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,600
seeing it in a certain way, it gave me the framing for how I wanted to describe it to

330
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,840
others.

331
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,280
So the topic was the Riemann's data function, and in particular analytic continuation.

332
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,360
And I opened the video with the usual motivations you might give for the Riemann's data function,

333
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,560
the status that the Riemann hypothesis has, that it contains information relevant to the

334
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
primes, all of that.

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,240
But the meet was to simply answer the question for a casual viewer who's kind of interested

336
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,400
in math, but don't necessarily want to assume they know too much already.

337
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
What is it?

338
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,040
What is this function?

339
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,600
Which is, of course, a surprisingly intricate question to answer.

340
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,200
And half of the answer is not that hard, which is to look at a certain sum that defines

341
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,520
it where you take zeta of s defined to be 1 over 1 to the s, plus 1 over 2 to the s,

342
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,760
plus 1 over 3 to the s, on and on.

343
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,720
So for example, an especially fun value to plug in here is something like 2, where you're

344
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,800
adding up 1, plus 1 fourth, plus 1 ninth, plus 1 sixteenth, on and on and on.

345
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
The sum actually converges.

346
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,120
It was, you know, for one period in history, a problem that nobody in Europe could seem

347
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,680
to figure out how to solve until one day Euler said, ah, I think I know the answer.

348
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,840
It's pi squared over 6, which is delightful and surprising, and there's a lot of very

349
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,440
fun reasons why that comes about.

350
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,320
But for our purposes, we don't really care about the connection to the circle or the

351
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,680
interesting discussions that you could have around the sum.

352
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,320
It's just that this is an example of a value of this sum.

353
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,400
It converges in this particular case.

354
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,200
And if you plug in some other exponents into that instead of 2, you can get things that

355
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,160
converge faster or things that converge slower.

356
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,640
It's a fun exercise just in calculus to ask what's the condition for whether it converges

357
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,920
or not.

358
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,040
And all around it, it makes sense when you have s bigger than 1 that this thing would

359
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,840
mean something because you have a bunch of terms that are getting smaller.

360
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,880
But if the casual reader were to be very inspired by something like the lore surrounding the

361
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,640
Riemann hypothesis and they find themselves on the Wikipedia page or they're poking around,

362
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,640
one of the things they might find is that sometimes into this function, negative values

363
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
are plugged in.

364
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,480
And if they go back and they reference the definition, they're like, hang on, okay, what

365
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
would that mean?

366
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,680
I see that zeta of negative 1 is negative 112, but that doesn't make sense because it's

367
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,520
got 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 and something that gets bigger and bigger.

368
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,600
And then they go and they make videos about the sum of the natural numbers equaling negative

369
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
112.

370
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,960
Then everyone gets mad at them and there's a whole kerfuffle.

371
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,800
You want to sit back and say, okay, okay, what is the actual statement being made here?

372
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,960
And for that, you can't have the discussion unless before you get to negative values, you

373
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,120
talk a little bit about positive value, sorry, complex values.

374
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,760
I suppose you can, but the usual path is going through complex analysis.

375
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,040
So we'll think of it as a mapping, you know, for every input, I'm going to draw the inputs

376
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,320
with a little yellow dot here and then the output of the function I'm drawing with a

377
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,640
little green dot here.

378
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,080
So the input 2 goes to the output pi squared over 6.

379
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,680
And the question is, if we extend our notion of, hey, what are all the possible inputs?

380
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,560
And instead we ask, what would happen if I plugged in complex values?

381
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,880
So maybe I plug in something like 2 plus i, then what does that mean?

382
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Now, this is the kind of thing that, assuming you have a high school level of algebra, it

383
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,040
looks a little intimidating at first, but it's not too much to parse and go through step

384
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,240
by step and say, we can, again, with the aid of visuals, really understand what's being

385
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
said here.

386
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,800
Because if you take 1 half to the power 2 plus i, that's something that, assuming power

387
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,720
rules work the same way with complex numbers, as you've learned they do with real numbers,

388
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,000
you understand half of it, you understand the 1 half to the power 2 part, and the only

389
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,320
other thing to really explain is what it means to raise something to an imaginary power.

390
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,560
And this is something that, at this point on the channel, I had freshly made a video

391
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,920
on, so it had a nice lead-in for any people who are regular viewers, where the upshot,

392
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,080
of course, is if you parameterize that exponent and you say, okay, maybe instead of plugging

393
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,880
in i, I imagine plugging in all other possible imaginary numbers, the output that I get,

394
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
it's somewhere on a unit circle.

395
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,720
And as I kind of move around that input, up and down on the imaginary line, the output

396
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,600
kind of wanders around that circle, rotating.

397
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,000
And it does so with a constant rate, if you're moving the yellow dotted constant rate.

398
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,080
And the only thing to think about, for the sake of the sum that we're going to do, is

399
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,960
the fact that if it wasn't 1 half that sits at the base there, but instead you had something

400
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,080
like 1 ninth, you're playing the same game, you're mapping the real, the imaginary line

401
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,960
onto the circle, but it moves a little bit faster.

402
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
So for a particular imaginary number that you plug in, it will have rotated a little

403
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,680
bit more.

404
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,840
And this gives such a satisfying way to think about the sum that we started with, where

405
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,960
let's say initially you picture a nice real number input, like our friend 1 half, or 1

406
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,600
plus a fourth, plus a ninth on and on, and you think of each of those terms as a little

407
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,080
vector or just a little line with a relevant length, then when you add some kind of imaginary

408
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,680
part to that input, the lengths don't change, those all stay the same, so they're kind of

409
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,080
like rigid lines, but each one of them rotates a little bit differently.

410
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,360
And for each successive term, they rotate a little bit more, so what you end up with

411
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,880
is a spiral.

412
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,440
And because the first one that you started with, where all those lines were kind of stretched

413
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,160
out as far as they could be, if that converged, then certainly as you're spiraling it like

414
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,560
this, you would expect it to also converge.

415
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,840
So there's going to be some value, some complex number on the plane that is this output.

416
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,080
And here I got to just have a little bit too much fun after I properly written the program

417
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,040
and say, okay, if we just grab that yellow dot corresponding to our input, and we move

418
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,680
it around the plane and say, for various other inputs, what does this spiral sum look like?

419
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,200
You can just see what the corresponding output would be.

420
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,800
And most importantly, you can be reassured that it'll have some kind of meaningful output

421
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,960
as long as the original sum converged, which in our case basically means as long as the

422
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,120
real part of what you're starting with was bigger than one.

423
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,400
And so if we're thinking about what is this function, unambiguous, very happy, there's

424
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,080
nice convergence and it makes sense when the real part is bigger than one.

425
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,880
For the other part, it doesn't make as much sense yet.

426
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,400
But on the way to getting there, visualization can help just a little bit to nudge our minds

427
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,520
into something we might want to think about, where what I'm going to do is say, what if

428
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,840
we take not just one of the values that I could input in the right half of the plane,

429
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
what if we take all of them?

430
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,240
I'm going to take every single one of them, and then I'm going to pump them through a

431
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,380
program that's going to spit out the corresponding output, and I'm going to animate the movement

432
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
between input and output.

433
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,700
And I won't do it for literally everyone, because that'll be dense in filling the plane.

434
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,500
But I'll put these grid lines up and then animate each point on those grid lines to

435
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,340
kind of represent what's going to happen to everything.

436
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,900
And this is one of the things where I had studied this, I had learned about the zeta

437
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,500
function, I had thought about it.

438
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,380
I didn't really know what was going to happen.

439
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,100
I didn't really know what this would look like afterwards.

440
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,500
One of the things that, sorry, go forward, is helpful to do is add a little bit more

441
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,300
density around the input one.

442
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,060
Those of you in the know might think about why you have to add some density around that

443
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,580
particular point.

444
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,980
And what comes out is basically the whole reason that I decided to make the video.

445
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,060
I hadn't necessarily been thinking of covering the Riemann zeta function or talking about

446
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,540
analytic continuation or anything like that.

447
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,060
But once you see this and you actually map all of the inputs, the whole diagram is just

448
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,700
sort of screaming at you how strange it is that there's an abrupt stop, right?

449
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,260
You can look at this and say, okay, there seems to be this line where everything stops.

450
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,220
And one of the very fun things about this is there's all sorts of questions that I think

451
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,860
someone could ask if they're watching this that go way beyond anything that the video

452
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,460
talks about that can keep the interest even if it's an expert who feels very well familiar

453
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,740
with this concept.

454
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,220
For example, you could ask, where is that line?

455
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,900
Eyeballing it, you might guess that it's around 0.5.

456
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,060
The actual answer is it's around Euler's constant, so it's a little above 0.5.

457
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,940
You can ask, why is that the case?

458
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,780
Why does it look like a straight line at all?

459
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,260
Is it actually a straight line?

460
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,620
Now, I don't need to ask those questions, but the point I want to make is just that in

461
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,660
trying to visualize it, motivated by making it clearer for the broader public or clearer

462
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,420
for a new student, I think the act of doing that also raises the ceiling.

463
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,260
Done right, it actually makes it more interesting to someone who feels already familiar with

464
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,020
the concept.

465
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,660
So the way that the lesson proceeds from here is to essentially point out that because there's

466
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,940
this abrupt stop, this whole function seems like it's asking to be continued in some way,

467
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:49,460
that maybe it's defined well using this sum for some of the complex numbers, but we might

468
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,020
have a conditional definition that says beyond those, it equals something else.

469
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,500
And the question is, what should that something else be?

470
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,980
And so if we imagined kind of filling in the rest of the grid, I can preview what that

471
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:07,460
something else ends up looking like, and it does have a kind of local symmetry, I should

472
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,300
say, one thing that's potentially misleading about the image is that it insinuates a kind

473
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,180
of symmetry entirely left and right on this, but later on in the video, I draw out more

474
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,820
extensions of the lines to show that's not quite the case.

475
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,820
And this lends itself to just talking about something which is very peculiar to complex

476
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,860
functions that if a student hadn't been studying, it would be a fun novel fact, which is that

477
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,780
in a certain sense, even though it feels like you should have a lot of degrees of freedom

478
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,380
for what that continuation would be, you just kind of draw the function to do whatever you

479
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,940
want it to do for all of those other inputs.

480
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,860
While that is true, if all you care about is defining some kind of function, or if all

481
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:52,980
you do care about is constraining it by being continuous, say, what's surprising, and the

482
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,540
fun fact to talk about, and can be kind of an upshot of the video that hopefully has

483
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,540
a little bit of staying power, is that if you want to constrain that your function has

484
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:05,860
a derivative everywhere, that that actually, if there's an extension at all, locks you

485
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,900
into only one choice, which is, of course, one of the fundamental intuitions under complex

486
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,180
analysis is how rigid the functions feel in contrast to real functions.

487
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:22,380
And from there, again, it's like if the constraint placed on describing math is to try to visualize

488
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,900
everything that's being said, this sentence kind of doesn't cut it, you know, if I really

489
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,460
want it to go far, you don't just say derivative, we have to visualize what a derivative means

490
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,820
in this context.

491
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,260
And so the remainder of the video essentially does that, talks about notions of conformal

492
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,140
mappings and what the intuition is for how you would think about whether something is

493
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,660
derivative or not, and the fact that completing this diagram is a sort of infinite continuous

494
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,100
jigsaw puzzle where every pair of lines that started off at a certain angle, you want them

495
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,140
to continue to have that angle and the like.

496
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,100
And all of this is just to mention one of the things that I like to keep in mind in

497
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,420
the checklist, which is maybe a little peculiar to my case because I've kind of gone hard

498
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,860
on this end of try to visualize every single thing, but which I think, taken a little bit

499
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,540
more softly, can be mapped to math exposition a little bit more broadly, which is to just

500
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:15,460
ask are the core ideas given diagrams, you know, another, it sounds simple, but I think

501
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
it can go so far.

502
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,300
There's another example that comes to mind where a friend of mine named Michael Nielsen,

503
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,940
when he was a grad student, wrote what then became like one of the Bibles of quantum computing

504
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,540
as far as textbooks are concerned, and he wrote it with a collaborator, Isaiah Chuang,

505
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,660
and I was asking him what the collaboration process was like with that.

506
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,580
And Nielsen is a very like a textual learner and thinker, and he would say he would just

507
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,620
kind of go and just write out a whole bunch of text and descriptions essentially procrastinating

508
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,260
from his thesis is the way that he wrote this textbook, which is absurd if you know the textbook

509
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,060
at all.

510
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,380
And then he would send them along to his collaborator, Chuang, who would then point out, oh, this

511
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,180
needs a diagram, this needs a diagram, and basically point out and then often fill out

512
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,500
the points that needed some kind of illustration.

513
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,180
And the medley was something very beautiful.

514
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,700
And I think that having a two person team like that enabled them to have this forcing

515
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,460
function where maybe Michael would have been a little bit less willing to write certain

516
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,660
sections if he had also been thinking about the effort that was going to be required to

517
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,780
illustrate every single one of them.

518
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,860
But with the mind free from having to think about that for himself and someone else taking

519
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:24,020
care of that, it felt like less of a chore maybe.

520
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,100
But again, I do kind of want to emphasize that even though it takes time to put together

521
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,780
visuals, you know, it doesn't have to.

522
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,140
I think just a pencil sketch or something simple in like whatever illustration software

523
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,340
is your favorite that doesn't have to be precise, it can be a simple sketch can go a long way.

524
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,740
These don't have to be something that's purely for the student.

525
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,260
I think that selfishly on the part of whoever's writing, say writing the textbook or putting

526
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:52,340
together a lecture or putting together a video, sometimes the visuals that you make actually

527
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,700
elicit new intuitions.

528
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,260
And the act of doing so, at least in my case, many, many times has deepened my own understanding

529
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
of something.

530
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:05,340
I feel fairly comfortable projecting that for others it stands to do the same.

531
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,380
This might be particular to programmatic animations more so than a lot of other things.

532
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,460
But I think almost everyone's familiar with the fact that when you're just trying to think

533
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,100
of something while lying on the couch, somehow it's dramatically less clear than when you

534
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,300
go to a whiteboard or you actually pull out your notes and then try to sketch something

535
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,540
related to it.

536
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,620
And letting it be something that's not just a nice to have, but instead sits inside a checklist

537
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,340
of what does it mean for my piece to even be done, I think can help force that to come

538
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,500
about a little bit more.

539
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,020
Now the next thing that I like to think about, and this is one where, by the way, every single

540
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,500
time I do a first draft of something, I violate the principle that I'm about to describe and

541
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,300
I have to go and realize, oh, wait, no, I should apply this principle.

542
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,940
There's something bizarrely unnatural about it, but I really do think it helps to make

543
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,940
things clearer.

544
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,580
To illustrate it, I'm going to talk about a much simpler piece of math, and instead of

545
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,180
doing zeta function type stuff, we're going to go to simple algebra, and I mean like normal

546
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,780
high school, middle school algebra, not abstract.

547
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,340
And I want you to kind of put yourself back in the state of mind whenever it is the case

548
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,740
that you were first learning, just basic algebra, whatever age you were, whatever class you

549
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,580
might have been in, and I'm going to paint two potential classes, and I want you to just

550
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:22,140
think about how much does each of those classes resonate with this imagined past version of

551
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,540
yourself that's sitting there learning it for the first time.

552
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,620
So the way that class A proceeds is like this.

553
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,620
The teacher starts by asking all of the students, can anyone factor the number 35 for me?

554
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,980
And actually, I'll do this, why not, anyone in the audience, you want to shout out the

555
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,020
factors of 35?

556
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,820
Five and seven, excellent.

557
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Now, the teacher then asks the students, can anyone please factor the number 143 for me?

558
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,820
So, because this is a room full of mathematicians, everyone immediately shouts 11 times 13, which

559
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,380
is fun, but the students, you know, maybe they think about it a little bit more, they

560
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,340
check whether various numbers go into it, and the one that does their little long division

561
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,660
with the 11, they raise their hand with a little bit more time than this crowd would

562
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,500
and says 11 times 13.

563
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,820
So then the teacher asks, can anyone factor 3599?

564
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:18,740
Now this is a fun room to do it in, so 59 times 61, great.

565
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,380
This does not happen in middle schools.

566
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:29,980
Although I was recently doing something where I brought up this example in a room full of

567
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,380
high schoolers and there was one student who said it, he said the answer, he said it's

568
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,500
59 times 61, and there was an audible gasp from the whole room, because it's absurd if

569
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,820
you think about it factoring the normal way.

570
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,780
But the teacher says, you know, there's a reason that I led into it the way that I did,

571
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:51,220
and the teacher invites the students to think about how 35 is very close to a square number,

572
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,900
it's so close to something round, it's close to six times six, and it maybe doesn't feel

573
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,700
like a coincidence that the two factors are also close to six.

574
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,740
It looks kind of like six times six, but you just nudged one up, you nudged one down.

575
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:08,540
Similarly, 143, it's very close, it's just one less than a square number, namely 12 times 12,

576
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,580
and it's not a coincidence that the factors, if you kind of squint your eyes, also look

577
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,780
like 12 times 12.

578
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,660
So if you're just pattern matching, then you might guess that the factor should look something

579
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,380
like 60 times something like 60, and if it followed the same exact pattern, it would be

580
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,220
one more and one less.

581
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,140
And, you know, the teacher wants, they can go through a couple other examples like this,

582
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,260
start to convince the class that maybe, just maybe, this kind of wild fact is true,

583
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,660
and it lets you look like that person who can receive an audible gas from all

584
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,620
of your classmates for being able to factor a number, which is very fun.

585
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,980
And then the teacher can draw out a diagram to help explain what's going on,

586
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,660
where if you imagine, you know, what does a square number mean, like six squared in this case,

587
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,660
you might imagine six by six boxes, and if we subtract one, you're kind of kicking one

588
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,620
off of the corner, and if you rearrange this a little bit, what it means to try

589
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,900
to factor the number is to try to arrange all of your boxes into some kind of rectangle.

590
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,100
And in this case, we can do that where one of the rectangles has a width that's just

591
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,100
one bigger and, or the rectangle has a width that's one bigger and then a height that's

592
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,980
one smaller.

593
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,580
And you can actually generalize this, if instead of kicking off a corner that was just a little

594
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,300
one by one square, if you kicked off a y by y square, you can basically play the same

595
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,620
game to factor it to look like x plus y times x minus y.

596
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,460
And it's very fun, again, this gives you a lot of fun mental math tricks, where you

597
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,740
can say things that make you seem like a genius, where someone can say factor the number

598
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,700
at 9,991, and you can do it without a calculator, or on the flip side, it's a nice trick for

599
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,420
multiplying certain numbers, assuming that you know the square of what sits halfway in

600
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,180
between them.

601
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,180
So that's class A. Class B starts off by saying, hello class, today we're going to be studying

602
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,660
the difference of squares formula.

603
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,620
The difference of squares formula states that if we take x squared minus y squared, this

604
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:57,140
can be factored into x plus y multiplied by x minus y.

605
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,820
The formula is very easy, it's not too hard to show, because if we expand out the right

606
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,900
hand side, you see that you have x squared, we subtract off yx, we add y times x, so those

607
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,980
two cancel out, and we get y squared.

608
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,500
The instruction really doesn't take long.

609
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,380
You can give an example, like if you plug in 1, it gives a nice fact that you can factor

610
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,500
something into x plus 1 and x minus 1.

611
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,380
And then there's a worksheet that you can kind of work through, which is, this is just

612
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,460
a worksheet that I found when I was looking for classes on difference of squares formula.

613
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,500
Now, okay, maybe I'm being a little bit unfair, not giving enough personality to the second

614
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,220
lesson as I could have.

615
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,140
But broadly speaking, if we try to compare what's going on with these two, class B does

616
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,580
something which is so tempting to do in so many other contexts in math, which is that

617
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,940
you start with the most powerful thing.

618
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,820
You state what the powerful thing is that you're going to do.

619
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,980
Usually that takes the form of an abstraction.

620
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,700
It's the most true thing.

621
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,540
It's kind of easier to show in that case.

622
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,300
This is part of what we love about abstraction, is that it's just a lot quicker to verify

623
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,620
that that's true than it is to try to come up with some reason why a numerical case where

624
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,620
you're gathering around a bunch of squares or stones or whatever you're using to concretize

625
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,620
it.

626
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,980
And even then, the reasoning doesn't cover all the general cases necessarily, because

627
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,820
you'd say, well, does it have to be an integer?

628
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,180
Would this work with negative numbers?

629
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,420
And would it work with complex numbers, all of that?

630
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:26,180
So that's the temptation of class B. Class A teaches using data and examples.

631
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,740
And it's not that the abstraction isn't a goal, it is the goal.

632
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,500
That's the function of the lesson at the end.

633
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,140
And it's not that you want to encourage students every single time that they come across the

634
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,380
difference of squares formula to picture in their head a little grid of x by x and y, because

635
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,660
sometimes you're just in the middle of doing a bunch of other algebra, and the whole point

636
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,500
of abstraction is that you don't have to think about that and you can do it more quickly.

637
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,420
But I think for the first time that you're seeing it, if you really want it to land inside

638
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,980
yourself, it's more helpful to kind of think in terms of layers of abstraction where before

639
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,380
getting to the lesson you have in mind, shift yourself one abstraction layer lower.

640
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,300
Instead of, in this case, thinking about variables and letters, think about numbers.

641
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,600
And then if you show lots of different examples with those numbers, it's kind of like light

642
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,060
bulbs in the mind of the student that are thinking of all those examples.

643
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,540
And if there's a certain ineffable character that connects them, the student can kind of

644
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,620
think about the things that connect them, the fact that things feel close to squares,

645
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:26,420
or that the two factors that you got are suspiciously close to the square root of the relevant number.

646
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,380
And when we did the diagram, in a sense that's an abstraction layer even lower, where instead

647
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,260
of thinking of numbers and numerals representing amounts, you're just looking at the amounts

648
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,860
and you can see the connection between the numerical facts that got you to feel like

649
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,780
a wizard and something more direct with those amounts.

650
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,220
And by the time you get to the abstraction, it feels so cool and so powerful because you

651
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,620
have a sense for all of the different things underneath that it's touching, all of the

652
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:55,340
different mental math tricks that are encapsulated in such a beautiful and concise formula.

653
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:59,700
It seems a little banal to those of us once you're comfortable with algebra because it's

654
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,940
just one identity out of many.

655
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,780
But I think reminding students that every identity that you see in algebra kind of encapsulates

656
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,020
this whole body of potential mental math tricks or potential statements about a wide variety

657
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,940
of little diagrams you could draw out.

658
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,060
There's something about that that feels very inspiring, to me at least.

659
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,820
Now class B in contrast, it teaches the same topic.

660
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:28,540
It gives you the same ultimate fact and assuming the students remember the fact, I can't imagine

661
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,700
that they would test much more poorly, at least if you do the test with this kind of

662
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,060
worksheet that they got their practice on shortly after the lesson.

663
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,380
I might question whether they remember the formula as well if you ask them five years

664
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,020
later or something like that, but if I'm trying to picture what's going on in the kind of

665
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,020
depiction of, this isn't literally what's happening in the brain, but you know my schematic

666
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,260
for layers of abstraction in the brain, you're just sort of lighting up the one bulb you

667
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,220
care about and it's not sitting on something else to support it, it hasn't been brought

668
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,220
about.

669
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,300
There wasn't a sense that it was answering a question or articulating a pattern that

670
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,580
already existed in someone's mind.

671
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:09,260
So this is a thing I like to think about as much as I can where if there's a given topic,

672
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,140
I try to draw out what are the relevant layers of abstraction at play here.

673
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:17,380
Now there's not like a universal hierarchy or something like that, but just as an example

674
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,460
for what that might look like, at the bottom most layer we have things like quantities.

675
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,180
One of the very first things we do when we're teaching students math is to get them to go

676
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,620
from feeling comfortable with quantities to thinking comfortably with numerals and eventually

677
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,500
everyone gains a certain fluency with this.

678
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Maybe there's a couple bumps in the road while they're learning about fractions and doing

679
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,940
that, but by and large everyone kind of gets that layer of abstraction.

680
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,380
And then similarly at some point instead of talking about numerals, we realize that there's

681
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,980
just a lot of facts that are nicer and encapsulated with algebra and symbols and can you just

682
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,660
communicate more, you can think more quickly with respect to certain things and it's such

683
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,420
a powerful tool.

684
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,260
The next layer, it's not exactly the case that functions abstract the notion of algebra,

685
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,220
but kind of it's the case that certain, let's say, facts and calculus that you're learning,

686
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,180
you draw out with respect to functions where every instantiation of that function that might

687
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:12,780
come along looks like either algebra or some bit of trigonometry or something there.

688
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,740
And so you write out your facts about derivatives and integrals and chain rule and the like,

689
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,940
not with respect to specific functions, but instead just in a more abstract setting.

690
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,740
And again the next layer is maybe a little bit silly to think of as like a definitive

691
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,940
canonical one, but there's a sense in which functions are a single instance of function

692
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,740
spaces at least, like a collection of functions, an instance of vector spaces.

693
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,100
And a lot of the facts that you might have around functions can fit into a more general

694
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,500
framework where things like the derivative and the integral you can think of in terms

695
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,700
of linear mappings and the like.

696
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,420
And of course you keep going on and on and on until people get talking to you about higher

697
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,620
categories and it's just a snake that eats its own tail up there.

698
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,540
But the point is that whatever layer you're sitting on here, you know, I give an example

699
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:03,780
in a low set of those layers between numerals and algebra, but I think even at higher layers,

700
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,900
I just personally think that it's very helpful for the first time that a student sees something

701
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,820
to populate their mind with data of a lower layer before you articulate the higher layer,

702
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,900
even if the goal is the higher layer.

703
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,180
So if you're teaching linear algebra, for example, even though the whole beauty of linear

704
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,700
algebra is the generality, the fact that it's not just describing R2 and R3 and the like,

705
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,420
but that there's a whole body of things that you can model with vector spaces and then use

706
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,380
facts that you've derived very rigorously just from the axioms to come to conclusions about

707
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,540
all the different things that could be vector spaces.

708
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:43,300
Nevertheless, the intuition building phase is probably best done if you populate it with

709
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,300
a bunch of examples.

710
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,700
Maybe it's good to spread out not just from R2 and R3, but certain other examples of more

711
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,420
playful, you know, vector spaces that one might come up with.

712
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,420
I think one example that comes to mind is just an excellent example to get someone starting

713
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,300
to think about more abstract vector spaces is magic squares.

714
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,820
And if you teach them the notion of a three-by-three magic square, where all of the columns and

715
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:12,060
rows and such have to add up to a certain amount, you then ask someone how many dimensions

716
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,820
is the space of all magic squares and what's the basis for the magic squares.

717
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,940
And that kind of question can get them thinking, again, it's very concrete.

718
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:25,460
It's a specific instance, a very specific kind of vector space, but that starts to invite

719
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:31,300
them to think about what's common across the arrows drawn in 2D space examples that they

720
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,800
might have cut their teeth on earlier.

721
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,660
So with my checklist, I think what this means is I try to ask, are abstractions preceded

722
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,660
with concrete examples?

723
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,100
And like I said, for whatever reason, this is one that the first draft, if I write something,

724
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,380
just doesn't do it.

725
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,740
And I think it's because once you understand something, the way you think about it, at

726
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,460
least the way I think about it, tends to be from the abstraction down, it's frankly

727
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,500
a lot easier to think about the difference of squares formula algebraically than it is

728
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,100
to try to think about a bunch of mental math tricks or a grid of squares or anything like

729
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
that.

730
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,420
It's just so quick to verify.

731
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,940
And then this goes for a lot of other things where the reason we do the abstractions is

732
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,540
because it allows for more mental fluency, but then that often can give us a mistake

733
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,700
that it means as you're divulging the topic, the thing that is easiest for you, the expert,

734
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,940
is necessarily the thing that is most conducive to a new learner coming in.

735
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,740
And so by specifically writing it out and letting it be one of the checks, I think it

736
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,900
can shift my lessons, hopefully, to be the better.

737
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,700
Now the last one I'd like to talk about is actually something I've only more recently

738
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,820
started thinking about.

739
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:41,940
And it's hard to do in videos, and I'm curious about if there's ways to kind of do it better.

740
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,940
It's definitely applicable in classrooms.

741
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,260
I think done with good writing, it's applicable in textbooks.

742
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:52,180
But one nice thing to illustrate it is a certain study by Manu Kapoor.

743
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,100
He even gave a certain TED talk about studies like this.

744
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,860
But the one that caught my eye is this paper called Productive Failure in Learning Math.

745
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,740
And he focuses on the nature of failure, but to my mind, that's not even the most interesting

746
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
part.

747
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:11,420
The neat thing here is he has two different classes that he teaches or that in the experiment

748
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:16,060
are taught to a group of middle school students, and the middle school students are segregated

749
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,300
into two different groups in class A. They experience two hours.

750
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,620
One is an instruction phase and following that is a problem-solving phase, and the only

751
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,300
difference with the second class, the only difference is that they flip the order.

752
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:32,500
They did a one-hour problem-solving phase followed by the instruction phase.

753
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,980
And the example matters here because I don't think you can do this for any kind of problem

754
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,820
solving, but it was a well-chosen problem-solving prompt in the case of this class because they

755
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,780
were teaching the idea of standard deviation.

756
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,820
And the question that they asked was to present the students with two different basketball

757
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,020
players and they give a whole bunch of data over the course of a season of basketball

758
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,340
for how many points each one of those players scored.

759
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,020
And they were told, Mike and Dave are two basketball players, and an award has to be

760
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:05,820
given to the most consistent player of the two, and the decision has to be made mathematically.

761
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,380
And so the students were invited to design as many measures of consistency as they could

762
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,500
to determine which of those players is more consistent.

763
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,980
It's a very fun exercise, actually, and so the middle schoolers were given 60 minutes

764
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,620
to think about this, to look over the data, try to add some things up, use their calculators

765
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,100
that they could, come up with some measure of consistency.

766
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,220
And a couple things came out of it.

767
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,420
One of them is that the students in that second one that did the problem-solving phase before

768
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,780
they did the instruction, they reported that the instruction phase was harder, that they

769
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,860
were spending more mental energy on it.

770
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:44,180
Now another relevant thing is the number of tactics they came up with, it was a lot higher.

771
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:48,460
There was a lot more variation in the measures of consistency they came up with when they

772
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,380
hadn't been taught the proper lesson yet.

773
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,820
But the most interesting thing, to me at least, is when they did a post-test on all

774
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,900
of this, and they had just questions trying to measure how well the students understood

775
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,100
the topic of standard deviation.

776
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,860
The questions broke into various different categories, so the ones that were categorized

777
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:09,140
as procedural knowledge, just, are you able to carry out the computation and all that,

778
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,660
there wasn't really much of a difference between the two camps.

779
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,300
But the ones that the researchers marked as measuring conceptual understanding, it was

780
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,860
like two standard deviations higher in conceptual understanding that the second group had compared

781
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,620
to the first.

782
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,980
And then questions that were marked as measuring how transferrable the knowledge was, were they

783
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,420
able to transfer it to a different context, it was like one standard deviation higher.

784
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,740
And on the one hand, kind of always have to take a little bit of grain of salt with

785
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:39,980
education studies, and especially if they're small sample sizes and things like that.

786
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:45,900
But to me at least, this one rings very true, the idea that if you seriously engage with

787
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,860
a problem before you're told the answer, that that actually makes you engage more meaningfully

788
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,060
with the answer once it's told to you in the instruction.

789
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,540
So I think probably a lot of people in this room have had the experience of toying over

790
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,860
some problem, not because it was assigned for homework after a given class was given,

791
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,860
but because for whatever reason, you just were interested in that problem.

792
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,420
And then maybe a little bit later, maybe a couple years later, you come across someone

793
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,020
who's answering that problem, they happen to articulate exactly the thing you were looking

794
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,020
for.

795
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,340
In my experience, that answer sticks so much better than the answers that are given for

796
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,460
questions that I hadn't yet been thinking about or toiling over.

797
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:27,660
So the third thing that I put on this checklist is, does the lesson start with some kind of

798
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,460
motivating question?

799
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,820
Like I said, I think that's kind of hard to do with video because you have to invite

800
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,420
the audience to pause and think about it, which some people will do, and that's great.

801
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,340
But realistically, a lot of people are a little bit more passive in that moment.

802
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:46,700
So it seems like something that's much better done in conjunction with instruction, whether

803
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,540
that instruction comes in the form of a video or a textbook or something like that.

804
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,820
I think a good author with a textbook can kind of do a lot too, at the very least, proceed

805
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:02,780
the relevant sections with the right questions, maybe even give some stern suggestions to

806
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,340
the reader that, no, really, stop.

807
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,340
Think about this.

808
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,420
If you really want to engage with it, if you really want to remember it, take five minutes

809
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,700
to close the book and think about this question.

810
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,260
But whatever form it takes, I think when the student has actually engaged with something

811
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,420
like this, it stands to make the instruction itself land a lot more.

812
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,100
And it's not something I've always done, so that's a thing I've been thinking about

813
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,060
more and how I can bring that into the future.

814
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,380
So I'm curious, actually, what other people would add to this list and what principles

815
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,940
they have for a checklist of pedagogy.

816
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,740
And just to reiterate the point, I do think that the reason that it's important to have

817
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:42,940
something like this, rather than just letting it be subjective and fuzzy, is because those

818
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:47,660
of us who are mathematically interested, we have a kind of attraction to the definite

819
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,940
and the allure of something that's like exact in the sense that rigor is exact, is so tempting

820
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,660
that it can sometimes mean we lose sight of the other forms of completion that are just

821
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,900
as worthy.

822
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,260
And I also want to reiterate, it's not a statement that rigor and clarity necessarily

823
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,700
sit in contrast with each other.

824
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,980
The best author is definitely achieved both at the same time.

825
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:14,180
It's just when we care about something like clarity with the same verb that we care about

826
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,660
something like rigor, with the same sense of satisfaction that comes from looking over

827
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,340
a piece and saying, yes, I can officially check this off.

828
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,860
That's something that feels like it's achievable when you're looking for a slight cultural

829
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:30,900
shift, whereas fuzzier descriptions like we need to do better just aren't going to apply.

830
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,420
So with that, I'd like to thank you all for coming.

831
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,420
And thank you.

832
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:50,420
Well, thank you, Grant.

833
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,460
That was a lot of fun.

834
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:59,540
For those of us like myself who grew up in a time when colored chalk was considered innovative,

835
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:06,820
this was a very refreshing and eye-opening look at the ways that new ideas and technologies

836
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,580
can help inform our work.

837
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:15,980
And I think the age of digital textbooks and other kinds of interactive things that combine

838
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:21,780
some of the elements you're talking about are going to offer some very exciting opportunities.

839
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:23,900
We do have a little time for questions.

840
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,820
We have a couple of microphones in the aisles, and I would invite you to line up.

841
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,420
There are come to those microphones.

842
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,100
If you'd like to ask a question, I think, Grant, you're up for that, right?

843
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Absolutely.

844
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,580
I'd love to answer any questions, and I'll stick around outside of the ballroom afterwards

845
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,020
if people want to come say hello.

846
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:46,700
I'm not sure what the protocol here is, but let's say whoever is standing there at the

847
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
mic first.

848
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,700
Hi.

849
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:56,060
I just wanted to ask you about in sort of exploring this idea of presenting data first

850
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,500
and like this concrete information before getting to abstraction, do you have any thoughts

851
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:06,460
on sort of in that process teaching students that you're not always going to see it, you're

852
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,420
not always going to see it the first time, and like getting students comfortable with

853
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,940
the idea that math can be hard, and this is an exploratory process that isn't necessarily

854
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,140
targeted at getting to the abstraction first thing?

855
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:24,700
Yeah, I think that's such a good point that even if the back of the mind goal of the exposer

856
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:30,060
is that you've set up this stage so very carefully that surely anyone will follow up to the conclusion

857
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:34,860
setting the expectations with everyone that like epiphany is very rare and discovery is

858
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,180
something to be cherished, and if it was something that could happen all the time, it wouldn't

859
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,580
be as lovely as it is.

860
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,140
I'm not sure of the best ways to do that other than saying it in words and just kind of reassuring

861
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:50,700
now and then like, hey, it's okay if you don't see this yet, or maybe holding off from a

862
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:57,220
temptation to use phrases like obviously or like clearly and things like, but it's an

863
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,540
important point to bring up, I appreciate that.

864
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,100
On the right side here.

865
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,740
Yeah, so there's a phrase that I've heard a couple of times, which is when teaching

866
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,860
Matthews to teach the truth, nothing but the truth, but never the whole truth.

867
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:20,300
How do you decide at what point, especially if you're teaching younger students, whatever

868
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:26,980
that means, where it's good to give intuition rather than full rigor, how do you decide at

869
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,420
which point to no longer be rigorous?

870
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,580
That's a great question.

871
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:36,100
I think I think you can always be honest about when you're being hand wavy.

872
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,740
You know, Feynman was especially good at this with the Feynman lectures.

873
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,540
I know because like physics is an exercise of constantly lying to people less and less over

874
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,740
the course of their education.

875
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,140
And he did a good job of like calling out the lies as they took place saying this is a

876
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,300
simplifying assumption.

877
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,060
And I don't think it takes that long.

878
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:57,860
And so you can maybe tip your hat to the fact that there might be certain exceptions in

879
00:56:57,860 --> 00:56:58,700
certain cases.

880
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:05,860
Or to the extent that's possible, you know, you you try to limit the scope of what you're

881
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,060
saying such that if there is more complexity outside of it, you're just crystal clear about

882
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,340
the setup as you go in.

883
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:15,660
One other brief thought you said, you know, teach the truth and nothing but the truth.

884
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:20,860
One direction I thought you were going with that was like, when is it fruitful to have

885
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,820
little falsehoods through the lesson with it?

886
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:30,460
I think one one form of exposition that is potentially really nice.

887
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:38,340
And the friend of mine gave a name to it of discovery fiction is to try to map out a sequence

888
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,740
of events that could lead to the discovery of a certain topic doesn't have to match the

889
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,540
actual history of how something was discovered.

890
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,860
But often the shape of it is that you come up with an idea that's just flawed.

891
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,140
And then you try to fix it a little bit and fix that flaw.

892
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,260
And then that has another flaw and then you fix it a little bit.

893
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,340
And then that has a flaw.

894
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,380
And as you proceed like this, sometimes it does a good job motivating why very seemingly

895
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,340
arbitrary constructs are put in place to solve a certain problem.

896
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:06,340
And the funny thing about that process is that through most of the lesson, you're like,

897
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:11,700
you're describing something that is wrong or something that's not actually useful in the

898
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,340
sense that the construct that's sitting in state in that moment isn't ever going to be

899
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:16,740
used.

900
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,660
It's just an intermediate step along the way.

901
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,060
So I think trying to adhere too much to making sure that at every single step along the way,

902
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,900
the objects that you're dealing with really work or the statements are fully true.

903
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,900
You know, it's not always helpful to be constrained like that, assuming that you're very honest

904
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:40,140
with the reader or the audience about where those falsehoods are and why and how they need

905
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,900
to be corrected.

906
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,060
All right.

907
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,460
Other question on the left.

908
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,140
Yeah.

909
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,580
So suppose you have somebody you want to convey some kind of cool fact.

910
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,260
Do you want to talk about?

911
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,820
So I'm sure this is part of your process, but I didn't see it as one of your checks or one

912
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,300
of your items.

913
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,420
So I'm wondering like where this comes in the process.

914
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,780
I mean, presumably has to be early on.

915
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,220
But the idea of what is the right way to think about this?

916
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:04,580
I mean, this has to be before planning the whole video because you have to decide like, I want

917
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,140
to get to here.

918
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,020
What is the route?

919
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:10,300
How much time do you spend thinking about what is the right way to think about the final

920
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:10,700
thing?

921
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,300
And do you actually have that as one of your checks items that you didn't list?

922
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,540
Yeah, I guess I exist in such a fortuitous situation where I choose

923
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:22,100
the things that I teach, which is not always the case.

924
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:25,940
And so I get to do this really luxurious thing where I just ambitiously learn about a lot

925
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,500
of stuff and it's only it only ever bubbles to the point of wanting to make a video about

926
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:34,220
it when it feels like there's that cool thing to show, which is often a slightly different

927
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,420
perspective or something that was at least different to me.

928
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,980
And so in a lot of ways, it's like, it's the zeroth law on that list, right?

929
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,540
It's the thing that makes it get there.

930
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:47,660
Now, the challenge mode question is suppose you don't live such a luxurious existence and

931
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,140
instead you have an explicit set of things that you're supposed to teach.

932
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:56,700
You know, I don't think there is like the right way to view it necessarily.

933
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,780
But what I have found is, like I said, I really like to play around with visualizations of

934
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:06,700
stuff, sometimes just doing a sort of brain dead thing to take the important formula and

935
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,740
just slowly unpack what each part looks like has been like more fruitful than I would have

936
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:12,340
expected.

937
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:16,820
So one topic that in a certain sense, I didn't choose to make it.

938
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,980
Just a lot of people were requesting it was 48 transforms.

939
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,500
I'm like, I don't have anything to say about 48 transforms.

940
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,860
But there was a lot of requests and I'm like, OK, what can we say here?

941
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,140
And honestly, the video I made, it was just, I like look at the definition of it.

942
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,300
And I started the innermost part.

943
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,380
I'm like, how would you draw this?

944
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,820
OK, how would you draw how these relate?

945
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:34,740
OK, how would you draw these?

946
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,700
Now that we have this drawing, how would you interpret it?

947
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:39,100
How does that drawing change as you tweak this parameter?

948
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,420
And kind of literally coding it up along the way.

949
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,340
But I don't think you have to.

950
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,980
I think it could have just been a whiteboard sketch.

951
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,860
And the video ended up really resonating with people.

952
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:53,860
And I think it was just a nice lesson for me that there didn't have to be a priori,

953
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:58,020
some great aha that it was had, that sometimes just the seemingly brain-dead

954
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:02,860
thing where you go step by step with this strong requirement of having an image

955
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:08,020
in the head for what each part means goes farther than a lot of people might appreciate.

956
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:12,500
Now, it can only be done on the important formulas because it's such a time-consuming

957
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,340
process that you wouldn't want for every single thing that comes up in a given

958
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,300
lecture to be like, oh, and how do we visualize this?

959
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,140
How do we visualize this?

960
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,140
You would just never get anywhere, not just in that lecture, but in the whole course.

961
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,900
But if you're judicious about which parts deserve that level of deep dive,

962
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,900
I actually think it's kind of a fruitful exercise.

963
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:33,340
And whatever topic is maybe sitting in the back of your mind when you ask the question,

964
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,420
it's like maybe a fun exercise to sit down and go from the inside out saying,

965
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,820
just what would you draw if you had to communicate non-linguistically with someone

966
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,060
to convey the idea over here?

967
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:46,540
Hi, Grant.

968
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,580
Thanks so much for the talk.

969
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,620
It's very enjoyable and enlightening.

970
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:56,900
My question is how you think that this sort of pedagogy checklist is influenced

971
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:02,180
by students' desire to learn, because fortunately, you know, speaking of luxury,

972
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,900
I think it's fair to say that you're in a position where most of the people

973
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,460
that you get to teach nowadays are people who are there on purpose and they want to be.

974
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,180
But we've all had the experience of having to teach students

975
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,420
who really don't want to learn what you're trying to teach them.

976
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:23,420
So how do you think the checklist can maybe be modified in consideration of the fact

977
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:28,020
that a lot of the time in a university setting or especially in a primary

978
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,260
or secondary school setting, there's going to be quite a few students

979
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:33,900
who really are not interested in learning what you want to teach them?

980
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,020
Such a good question.

981
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:42,100
I mean, do any of you listen to the podcast An Opinionated History of Math, by chance?

982
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,100
No, oh, you'll love it.

983
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,340
It's one of my favorites.

984
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,860
It's so obscure and like niche, but it's so delightful.

985
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,780
But the author of it has on his website this little manifesto about teaching

986
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,900
and he lists out like the axioms of learning.

987
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,740
And one of his axioms of learning is essentially your point.

988
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,540
Like people are not, how does he phrase it?

989
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,980
He's so much more articulate than I am.

990
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,380
But it's essentially, in order for someone to actually learn,

991
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,980
they have to want to learn ahead of time.

992
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,980
And so you're right, I'm in a luxurious position.

993
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,580
Although, you know, it is the case that like every YouTuber thinks about,

994
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,620
how do you bring someone into the topic if they might not have been thinking about it?

995
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,300
And a couple of the standard things for this, like you try to appeal to a thing

996
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:25,780
that interested them before they even walked in the room

997
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,140
or before they clicked on the video.

998
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:29,620
A loose example here.

999
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,100
I'm not going to claim that things like this will always apply in the classroom,

1000
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,980
but I think maybe some examples do and it's worth inviting.

1001
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,460
I guess last year now, I made this video about Wordle,

1002
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:43,900
which was really on one hand, is jumping on a hype train

1003
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,340
because nothing was more popular on the internet than Wordle.

1004
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,940
But it was an excuse to teach information theory.

1005
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:54,980
And I can definitively say it reached more people than it would have

1006
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:57,860
if I had said I want to do a lesson about information theory.

1007
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,380
And I also think to good effect.

1008
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:02,660
There was one person who told me that it helped him get a job

1009
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,340
because there was an interview that he did where a question about Shannon

1010
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,860
entropy came up and like he had freshly watched the video.

1011
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,660
He probably would have gotten the job anyway,

1012
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,180
but I'll take all the credit I can get here.

1013
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,300
But something like that was, I think, you know,

1014
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,540
maybe a very special example,

1015
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,380
but there's probably a lot of different cases where you can find some connection

1016
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,300
to a thing that maybe isn't in the zeitgeist,

1017
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,220
but is of a pre-existing interest to the students.

1018
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,860
And just letting yourself take a little bit of time at the start of a class

1019
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,700
to let that be a motivating example might go a long way.

1020
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,980
The other thing I really do think clarity motivates.

1021
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,980
Like on the one hand, yes, it is very helpful to have someone

1022
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:41,580
who's already interested in learning and they sit there and they're

1023
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:45,420
they're willing to absorb whatever whatever you're going to give them,

1024
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,740
regardless of the clarity.

1025
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:50,740
But I also think if you if you take the time to have something

1026
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,340
like a compelling diagram to really illustrate what's going on,

1027
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:57,340
that is something that doesn't just feed pre-existing interest,

1028
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,460
but it can generate interest in the first place.

1029
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,260
And there's a lot of people who've told me that that was the thing

1030
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,180
about the channel that got them sucked in,

1031
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,260
that they hadn't cared about the channel at all before,

1032
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,860
but they started watching it because it elucidated something

1033
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,100
that was a class they were taking or something like that.

1034
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,340
And so they do feed into each other.

1035
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,180
But broadly speaking, I think what you bring up is another excellent example

1036
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,500
of something to sit on the checklist,

1037
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,500
which is essentially, do you have a compelling reason to believe

1038
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,620
that the audience sitting in front of you cares to listen to what you're saying?

1039
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:33,140
Maybe we do one more?

1040
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:33,820
We better call it.

1041
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,380
All right, I will happily stand outside the bar room after to say hello to folks.

1042
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:40,580
But thank you, everyone, for coming and have a great rest of your day.

1043
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:47,460
And as Grant said, he is willing to hang out a little bit.

1044
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,380
So maybe you can catch some he can catch some of your other questions.

1045
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,660
Thank you so much for being here.
