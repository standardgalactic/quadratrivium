00:00.000 --> 00:10.160
Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's JPBM Communications Award lecture.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.880
I'm Michael Pearson with the Mathematical Association of America.

00:13.880 --> 00:20.320
We're part of JPBM and I'm really delighted to be able to recognize Grant Sanderson today

00:20.320 --> 00:23.920
with one of this year's communications awards.

00:23.920 --> 00:31.760
That is the creator and founder of Three Blue, One Brown, which is an effort to provide

00:31.760 --> 00:37.360
visualization of mathematics and it's a YouTube channel easily found.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.280
I hope you'll take a look at it.

00:39.280 --> 00:45.120
I had done my homework as I'm supposed to do when I was warned to do this and written

00:45.120 --> 00:50.760
out a nice introduction, which of course I can now not find on my electronic device,

00:50.760 --> 00:52.520
which is supposed to give me that.

00:52.520 --> 01:01.600
But I'll say, as I went on the site and as a harmonic analyst, I've spent a good bit

01:01.600 --> 01:07.240
of time thinking about convolutions, convolution kernels and so forth.

01:07.240 --> 01:12.840
I was really immediately attracted to see what Grant would do with convolution.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.000
He has a nice video presentation.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.040
What's the introduction to convolution?

01:19.040 --> 01:23.920
Some of you may know that the German word for convolution is Faltung, folding.

01:23.920 --> 01:29.320
And I think the video that Grant does with that really sort of makes that dynamic and

01:29.320 --> 01:33.280
shows you why folding is such a great word for convolution.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.200
So I encourage you to look at that one and any others that catch your eye.

01:37.200 --> 01:43.440
In any case, Grant graduated from Stanford University from Math and Computer Science in

01:43.440 --> 01:45.800
2015.

01:45.800 --> 01:52.560
He spent some time working on videos and instructional materials for the Khan Academy.

01:52.560 --> 01:58.040
And then by now, he's turned his full-time attention to three blue, one brown.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.440
And there's some really great stuff there.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.640
And without further ado, I'll let him tell us about it.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.640
Thank you.

02:05.640 --> 02:12.760
Thank you very much for that very warm introduction.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.360
I want to start just by saying a very heartfelt thanks to the members of the Joint Policy

02:16.360 --> 02:18.520
Board for the award.

02:18.520 --> 02:23.600
I will admit it is a little bit intimidating to receive an award for communication and then

02:23.600 --> 02:28.680
to be asked to immediately communicate to a roomful of people I have high respect for.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.040
I'll do my best, but I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the names on the list

02:33.040 --> 02:37.640
for this particular award in past years were just personal heroes of mine who served to

02:37.640 --> 02:40.360
inspire me a lot in getting started.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.760
Things like Steve Strogatz or James Glick or Matt Parker all come to mind, but those

02:43.760 --> 02:45.120
are just a few of very, very many.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.080
So I want to say thanks there.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.920
Broadly speaking, I want to talk about math communication itself and some of my thoughts

02:51.920 --> 02:53.520
around math communication.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.680
But this breaks into a number of different categories, and it's kind of a hard thing

02:56.680 --> 03:01.680
to think about as a unified whole because one component of that is education.

03:01.680 --> 03:06.400
And even that, it feels wrong to loop into a single group because education before university

03:06.400 --> 03:10.880
and math and education undergrad and on have a very qualitatively different flavor to them

03:10.880 --> 03:14.880
and how you might think about what approaches are best or what's the typical engagement

03:14.880 --> 03:17.040
a student has.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.680
And even that is very different from other forms of communication that happen, you know,

03:20.680 --> 03:25.120
presenting one's research or popularization, which is probably the bucket that I fit most

03:25.120 --> 03:30.760
closely into if I had to choose just one that's where I actually sit.

03:30.760 --> 03:34.640
But I do think it's very helpful, whichever one of these slices you find yourself in to

03:34.640 --> 03:40.000
think about them as intersecting each other and a lot of the value coming from that intersection.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.480
Some directions here are obvious, like if you're in education, it doesn't hurt to think

03:43.480 --> 03:45.840
about it as a popularization effort.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.680
If you want to popularize something, you try to make it more engaging.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.360
You try to connect to things that people are already interested in.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.160
It doesn't hurt to do the same if it's in a classroom.

03:54.160 --> 03:59.000
But I also think on the flip side, as someone who popularizes things or at least tries to,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.840
it's often not the right approach to do that head on and think, how can I make something

04:02.880 --> 04:06.960
that's going to reach the most people, you know, has the most click-baity title and the

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
like.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.400
But what I've noticed is people just want to learn.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.360
The thing that makes something more popular, the thing that gets more reach, as often if

04:14.360 --> 04:18.840
I do something that's meant more as a classroom supplement, because people don't want to feel

04:18.840 --> 04:23.360
like they're just being watered down or talked down to, instead having a sense that what

04:23.360 --> 04:27.040
they're staring at is the authentic material, as if they were studying it and becoming an

04:27.040 --> 04:28.040
expert in it.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.440
I think that's a very inspiring feeling.

04:30.440 --> 04:35.000
So I titled this, Raising the Ceiling and Lowering the Floor of Math Exposition, referencing

04:35.000 --> 04:39.800
the fact that I think some of the efforts that we can make in trying to popularize it

04:39.800 --> 04:44.080
to reach more people can also make it more interesting to those who are already experts

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
in it.

04:45.080 --> 04:50.600
But if I wanted to be a little bit more provocative in how I went about this talk, I could just

04:50.600 --> 04:56.360
as easily give what I have in mind the name of Math's Pedagogical Curse, because I really

04:56.360 --> 05:01.640
do think there's something strange going on with math, in particular, in contrast to

05:01.640 --> 05:07.400
some other fields, if we think about the perception that it has in the broader public.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.520
I think everybody in this room has probably had the experience of chatting with someone,

05:11.520 --> 05:13.400
cocktail party type environment.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.800
You mention you do something related to math, and the person says, as if there's no social

05:17.800 --> 05:21.600
taboo in saying it at all, which I guess there's not, oh, I'm not really a math person.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.880
Just fair, not everybody necessarily loves the subject that we do, but it's a funny phrase

05:26.880 --> 05:30.600
because you don't say that with respect to other things.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.720
But there's another turn of phrase that I've heard multiple different times, that in some

05:33.720 --> 05:40.400
sense is even more worrying than that one, which is the, I thought I liked math until.

05:40.400 --> 05:46.200
I have a very vivid memory, actually, of being a high school student touring different universities.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.680
And I was one of those students who always knew that I wanted to study math.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.520
I'd already fallen in love with it.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.840
So if I'd meet some students at the university, they asked their natural questions, oh, what

05:53.840 --> 05:55.040
do you think you might want to major in?

05:55.040 --> 05:57.800
I was like, I know, I want to major in math.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.920
And I remember this one student saying, oh, yeah, yeah, I thought I liked math.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.080
I even wanted to be a math major.

06:03.080 --> 06:07.280
And then I took a set theory class, and I discovered that I don't really like math, which is very

06:07.280 --> 06:08.280
sad.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.920
And I've heard variants of this through the years in various different contexts.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.960
Oh, I thought I liked math, and then I took a linear algebra class, right?

06:14.960 --> 06:19.120
I thought I liked math until, and then there's some point in which someone became disillusioned

06:19.120 --> 06:21.240
with it for whatever reason.

06:21.240 --> 06:25.640
Now that one feels like it's especially worth addressing, because it's very hard, I think,

06:25.640 --> 06:27.800
to ignite the light of interest in the first place.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.440
And even if maybe the more important one to address is the broad scope of people who don't

06:31.440 --> 06:36.160
self-identify as math people, we could just as easily ask, what are we doing wrong such

06:36.160 --> 06:39.920
that we get some people that thought they liked math and tell?

06:39.920 --> 06:42.800
Maybe the answer is math is just harder than other fields.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.400
It's just something you got to roll up your sleeves and work hard in order to attain, and

06:48.400 --> 06:50.560
not all people are willing to do that.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.440
I don't think that would be fair, though, because that kind of pushes the bump under

06:53.440 --> 06:56.960
the rug where you have to instead ask, does it have to be that hard?

06:56.960 --> 07:00.080
Is there anything that we're doing that makes it harder than it needs to be?

07:00.080 --> 07:05.120
And I have a little theory for at least one component of what might be going on with math

07:05.120 --> 07:08.000
in what makes it distinct from other fields.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
And it has to do, bear with me here, with the legend of King Midas.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.560
So for those of you who don't know, in Greek mythology, or it's one of those kind of intertwined

07:18.560 --> 07:22.880
with fake Greek history that Aristotle and the like would tell the people, you have this

07:22.880 --> 07:28.400
king supposedly who lived around the second millennium BC named Midas.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.480
And he does some good deeds that catch the attention of certain gods, and the god Dionysus

07:33.480 --> 07:36.920
says, I'm willing to give you a gift, name your gift, and I will give it to you.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.520
And Midas says, oh, well, what gift should I want?

07:39.520 --> 07:42.600
I think it would be great if anything that I touched could turn to gold.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.920
And Dionysus says, it is done.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.480
And Midas touches a twig, and it turns into gold.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.480
He's delighted.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.000
He goes back to his estate, and he starts touching all of the roses in his garden, and

07:52.000 --> 07:54.600
they turn into a beautiful metallic sheening gold.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.080
And he's just dreaming of all the wealth that he's going to have, and the wealth that his

07:57.080 --> 08:00.440
entire regime is going to have.

08:00.440 --> 08:05.040
And then when he gets to the banquet for dinner that night, he touches the chicken leg sitting

08:05.040 --> 08:08.440
in front of him, and it turns to gold, and it's completely inedible.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.040
Or in other tellings of the story, the moment that he realizes something might be a little

08:12.040 --> 08:17.400
bit wrong with this gift is when his daughter comes up to him, and he touches her, and she

08:17.400 --> 08:20.640
completely turns into gold, and he doesn't have her anymore.

08:20.640 --> 08:25.160
And of course, it precedes where it's a story of redemption and the like.

08:25.160 --> 08:31.760
But the gift that is analogous to this that I think math has, and it really is a gift,

08:31.760 --> 08:37.080
is a very special kind of exactness where we have the pleasure of knowing with 100 percent

08:37.440 --> 08:40.720
uncertainty if a conclusion follows from the premises.

08:40.720 --> 08:45.520
Maybe not 100 percent, it's subject to our ability to fall for certain logical fallacies

08:45.520 --> 08:47.560
or to miss holes in an argument.

08:47.560 --> 08:52.640
But with as much precision as you could possibly hope for, math has this kind of exactness.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.320
And a lot of other fields would just dream of anything like this.

08:56.320 --> 09:00.760
Hard sciences get kind of close if we think of physics or computer science.

09:00.760 --> 09:05.040
But even then, they're subject to a little bit of controversy with different ways you

09:05.040 --> 09:10.160
might interpret something, or even the best experiments aren't 100 percent precise.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.520
The softer sciences get even further away from this.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.600
Most forms of writing and discourse out there are more unabashedly subjective.

09:17.600 --> 09:22.440
You might think of art criticism, it's not unworthy, but it lacks this exactness.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.200
And the gift that comes from this exactness is that it helps you move forward a field.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.080
You don't fall into the same disputes that you might otherwise when there's room for

09:30.080 --> 09:33.920
ambiguity and misinterpretations.

09:33.920 --> 09:39.920
But I think what it might even mean for something to be mathematical is that it has this level

09:39.920 --> 09:40.920
of exactness.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.200
There's a friend of mine who's a biologist, and anytime we talk she always bemoans the

09:45.200 --> 09:49.120
fact that biology needs to become more of a mathematical science.

09:49.120 --> 09:54.200
Just how far could humanity progress if we could turn biology into a mathematical science.

09:54.200 --> 09:59.560
And presumably what she means by that is that you get a situation where you can draw conclusions

09:59.560 --> 10:04.000
from your premises with the same airtight rock solid rigor that a field like physics

10:04.000 --> 10:06.160
might have.

10:06.160 --> 10:10.080
The other really nice thing that this gets us, I think, is when you're writing something,

10:10.080 --> 10:14.520
like you're writing a textbook or a paper or a video or you're preparing a lecture,

10:14.520 --> 10:18.200
it gives a test for completion that no one else gets to have.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.320
We can have this clear notion of it's not done yet and then at some point there's a

10:21.320 --> 10:23.040
sense in which it's done.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.120
We can go through and you can make sure all of the definitions are completely unambiguous.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.240
We get to have unambiguous definitions.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.480
Nothing else doesn't get to have those.

10:31.480 --> 10:36.520
You can ask whether every object in the theorems that you reference have been previously defined.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.000
It's like a compiler checking code.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.720
You get to go through and the answer is either clearly delineated yes or clearly delineated

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
no.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.400
And then most importantly for every claim that you make, you can ask was it completely

10:46.400 --> 10:47.640
justified.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.760
And then that constitutes a notion of explanation in some sense.

10:51.760 --> 10:56.640
It gives you a clear point where before you got to that point the paper wasn't finished

10:56.640 --> 10:59.920
or the lecture wasn't finished but after that point you can put a little bow around

10:59.920 --> 11:01.360
it and say it was finished.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.480
And like I said, I really do think it's a gift because it helps us move forward in a

11:05.480 --> 11:07.240
way that other fields can't.

11:07.240 --> 11:11.880
But there's a catch to this gift where in the same way that the things that King Minus

11:11.880 --> 11:15.520
might touch and turn to gold but this had a problem where he wouldn't be able to eat

11:15.520 --> 11:22.040
his food, the mathematician can touch anything, give it this notion of completely unambiguous

11:22.040 --> 11:23.040
rigor.

11:23.040 --> 11:28.880
But sometimes it runs the risk of leaving it, how shall we put it, slightly unpalatable

11:28.880 --> 11:33.880
to the average casual reader or maybe a little bit harder to consume than it needs to be

11:33.880 --> 11:35.880
for a typical student.

11:35.880 --> 11:41.360
And I do want to emphasize I don't think that it's a necessary thing that follows.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.080
I don't want to come across as implying that if something is rigorous that means that it's

11:45.080 --> 11:46.840
not clear.

11:46.840 --> 11:51.720
It's a little bit of an exaggeration to make the comparison with Midas quite like this.

11:51.720 --> 11:57.240
But what I do think is possibly the case is that this allure of such a notion of exactness

11:57.240 --> 12:01.040
where we can actually say that it is done in a certain sense means that rigor serves

12:01.040 --> 12:05.280
kind of as a distraction, right?

12:05.280 --> 12:09.120
I have to tell you, there will be no year that I grow tired of this meme.

12:09.120 --> 12:14.560
I know it's a little bit old, but the staying power with this is just unparalleled.

12:14.560 --> 12:20.760
No, but I think it's the case that a lot of really good authors manage to achieve both

12:20.800 --> 12:21.960
rigor and clarity.

12:21.960 --> 12:25.520
And in fact, the point of rigor is often to add more clarity.

12:25.520 --> 12:30.320
But the thing that I suspect might happen every now and then is that because the rigor

12:30.320 --> 12:35.120
gives you this very clean, nice thing to think about and because thinking about pedagogical

12:35.120 --> 12:39.760
clarity is a lot messier, you know, it's harder to define, you can't put a bow around it.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.440
There's not one point when you've gone from not done to completely done that after scratching

12:44.440 --> 12:47.920
the itch of knowing that something's been written completely rigorously, it's easy to

12:47.920 --> 12:51.240
call a work done when maybe we shouldn't call it done yet.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.520
And there's context where this is maybe okay, research papers come to mind, but in things

12:55.520 --> 13:00.840
that are more explicitly pedagogical, textbooks come to mind, I would propose that maybe it

13:00.840 --> 13:06.640
makes sense to invite into the culture a similar focus that we already have on the rigor of

13:06.640 --> 13:10.360
it, but instead onto something for the pedagogical clarity.

13:10.360 --> 13:15.200
And I'll give an example here, which is essentially just from the book that was sitting on my

13:15.200 --> 13:17.600
desk while I was putting together these slides.

13:17.600 --> 13:22.240
I actually love the textbook, it's really great and one of the only reasons I feel comfortable

13:22.240 --> 13:26.000
highlighting it and poking a little bit of fun at one of the sections is because it otherwise

13:26.000 --> 13:30.120
holds up very well and it's one I would unabashedly recommend.

13:30.120 --> 13:35.640
But I was thinking, okay, you know, how well does the author tend to think about points

13:35.640 --> 13:39.760
of pedagogical clarity in addition to points of rigorous clarity?

13:39.760 --> 13:43.120
And one particular section that I was looking at was about something called the Poisson

13:43.120 --> 13:47.400
summation formula, many of you might be familiar with it, it essentially says for a function

13:47.400 --> 13:52.560
which is sufficiently nice, if you add up the value of that function across all of the

13:52.560 --> 13:57.960
integers, it gets the same thing as if you add up the Fourier transform of that function

13:57.960 --> 13:58.960
across all the integers.

13:58.960 --> 14:03.120
It's kind of a wild formula, very useful in many different contexts.

14:03.120 --> 14:07.720
And the proof that the book gives is actually really beautiful, I liked it a lot.

14:07.720 --> 14:13.600
It starts off by describing a certain function a little bit out of the blue, but if you look

14:13.640 --> 14:20.400
at it, you notice that it has poles at all of the integers and the residue at those poles

14:20.400 --> 14:24.960
are exactly the values that you might want to sum on the left hand side of your formula.

14:24.960 --> 14:30.000
And essentially what the book does is it kind of after handing down this construct and after

14:30.000 --> 14:34.200
describing a certain contour that you might integrate along, and the context here was,

14:34.200 --> 14:38.320
you know, it's in a setting of assuming people are familiar with the complex analysis up

14:38.320 --> 14:42.160
to the point in the book and know about contour, integrals, and the like, it goes through and

14:42.200 --> 14:46.400
shows how you can have a very elegant derivation of the formula basically by unpacking what

14:46.400 --> 14:50.920
this integral is saying and step by step, it eventually turns it into the sum on the

14:50.920 --> 14:52.440
right hand side.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.200
So it's very beautiful, it involves a lot of clever ideas, things fit together nicely

14:56.200 --> 15:01.440
at the end, you can look back on it and I think as a writer, think what more could you

15:01.440 --> 15:03.880
possibly want?

15:03.880 --> 15:06.160
It's as clean a proof as I could imagine.

15:06.160 --> 15:10.520
And I think there's a culture in math textbooks that sort of says once something is proven,

15:10.520 --> 15:12.480
that means it is complete.

15:12.480 --> 15:18.800
But if you try to add a secondary checklist that says what are the pedagogical considerations,

15:18.800 --> 15:22.000
even though I think this is a great book, and even though I think the proof has a lot

15:22.000 --> 15:25.640
of staying power, there are dozens of other questions that I could think one might want

15:25.640 --> 15:30.440
to lead up to this particular fact with or follow it with.

15:30.440 --> 15:33.800
You know, to start off with, you could just say, what is this formula, how do you think

15:33.800 --> 15:37.600
about it, why should you expect that something like this would be true, what are the circumstances

15:37.600 --> 15:41.080
that you might run into in the mathematical wild, where you would think that this is something

15:41.080 --> 15:43.280
that you need to bring to bear.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.240
For example, it doesn't hurt to illustrate just a little bit, like how do we parse what

15:48.240 --> 15:49.560
each side is saying.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.160
The left hand side, which is adding up the value of the function for all of the positive

15:53.160 --> 15:59.080
integers, you could kind of think of as a extremely coarse Riemann sum for the whole

15:59.080 --> 16:00.240
function.

16:00.240 --> 16:05.560
And one of the terms on the right hand side, if you take the Fourier transform just at

16:05.560 --> 16:09.880
zero, those of you who are comfortable with the matter know that that's just the same

16:09.880 --> 16:12.440
thing as integrating the function.

16:12.440 --> 16:17.320
And so what that tells you is that much of the left hand side is already encapsulated

16:17.320 --> 16:20.840
just with the zero term on the right hand side, and you know, the student might then

16:20.840 --> 16:25.080
be invited to think about how all of the other Fourier coefficients give you a sort of correction

16:25.080 --> 16:30.640
factor between the difference of this coarse Riemann sum in the area, and that instills

16:30.640 --> 16:35.000
a little bit of intuition around if you have an especially smooth function, one that stays

16:35.000 --> 16:38.960
very flat, that that would suggest that less correction is needed in comparison to if it

16:38.960 --> 16:40.800
has high variation.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.160
When it comes to the proof itself, while the author gave a delightful proof, there were

16:44.160 --> 16:47.800
many steps where, like I said, it felt like it was handed down from on high, and what

16:47.800 --> 16:51.280
I would love to see or would love to feel is a sense of how I might have discovered

16:51.280 --> 16:52.280
that myself.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.520
I think it's hard to understand just how delightful it can be if you as the reader feel like the

16:56.520 --> 17:01.320
thing that was coming in is something that you kind of anticipated and that it's validating

17:01.320 --> 17:06.080
rather than feeling like you're the one who has to kind of validate that the monument

17:06.080 --> 17:09.120
that you were handed does the thing that's being claimed.

17:09.120 --> 17:13.480
And in this case, you know, I think there's a longer description, but length isn't necessarily

17:13.480 --> 17:17.920
the enemy, that could provide a sort of path of rediscovery for the very elegant proof

17:17.920 --> 17:21.440
that potentially could give it even more staying power.

17:21.440 --> 17:27.240
Now, what I mainly want to ask through the remainder of this talk is, in light of the

17:27.240 --> 17:32.280
fact that we have such a satisfying checklist for rigor that really distinguishes math in

17:32.280 --> 17:37.320
which I think draws the attention of the mathematician and the writer so alluringly because of how

17:37.320 --> 17:41.360
satisfying it is to go through that checklist and know that something's complete, is it

17:41.360 --> 17:46.480
possible to have something that's analogous for those of us who want to popularize or

17:46.480 --> 17:50.840
educate or otherwise communicate as clearly as is possible?

17:50.840 --> 17:56.040
Is there something that has the same sort of itched scratching satisfaction of, you

17:56.040 --> 17:59.120
know, unambiguously knowing that you're there or you're not?

17:59.120 --> 18:03.280
It's not a fuzzy realm where someone just qualitatively says this writing vaguely seems better,

18:03.280 --> 18:09.200
but is there an actual set of things that we could assign a binary value to?

18:09.200 --> 18:13.440
And the reason I think that might be valuable is that, you know, a mathematician instinct

18:13.440 --> 18:16.480
is one that sort of likes this notion of definiteness.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.040
And so if we can put something a little bit more definite wrapped around the indefinite

18:20.040 --> 18:22.520
realm of pedagogy, that might be helpful.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.400
So you could probably brainstorm a lot of things that might come to mind if you're doing

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
this.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.960
A couple that I happened to write down here is, you know, does each definition that

18:29.960 --> 18:32.440
is written down have a motivating example?

18:32.440 --> 18:35.800
You know, a reason you would want to define something like that rather than seeing the

18:35.800 --> 18:42.040
examples come after the proof, after the theorem and the like, do the proofs feel rediscoverable?

18:42.040 --> 18:46.240
Like I said, it can be incredibly satisfying if a student feels like they knew what was

18:46.240 --> 18:47.240
coming.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.240
In our together videos, I really try to focus on a path of rediscovery, which makes it longer,

18:52.240 --> 18:55.680
but again, I don't think length is necessarily the enemy, as long as you're not being verbose

18:55.680 --> 18:57.800
about it.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.720
Another very simple consideration, maybe a little bit vague, a little bit hard to assign

19:01.720 --> 19:04.920
that binary check to, is does it feel personal?

19:04.920 --> 19:08.960
Does it feel like an actual person is talking to you with a little bit of emotion and personality?

19:08.960 --> 19:12.720
I think that matters when it comes to how engaged someone is with something, and when

19:12.720 --> 19:16.040
you're more engaged, you remember things better.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.440
Another simple one, just are there diagrams?

19:18.440 --> 19:20.960
If something should be illustrated, is it illustrated?

19:20.960 --> 19:25.000
This is one that's very near and dear to my heart, as I'll get to in a moment.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.560
But there's all sorts of other things you might do, and I would actually be curious

19:27.560 --> 19:31.240
what anyone else in the audience thinks could be added to this checklist.

19:31.240 --> 19:36.600
What I wanted to do for the remainder is talk through a couple points that I try to think

19:36.600 --> 19:41.320
about as I'm putting together a piece of exposition, or putting together a video.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.840
It's not a complete checklist.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.080
I don't think there exists such a thing as a checklist for pedagogy in quite the same

19:46.080 --> 19:48.080
way that there's a checklist for rigor.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.440
But I do think if we try to invite that into the culture of math exposition, the attempt

19:52.440 --> 19:55.760
to write down such a checklist could go a long way.

19:55.760 --> 20:01.240
So the channel that I run, for those of you unfamiliar, it's called Three Blue and Brown.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.760
And in a nutshell, the premise is to give lessons that are as visualized as I possibly

20:06.760 --> 20:11.040
can make them, not in a way that's superfluous, not in a way that has flashiness for the sake

20:11.040 --> 20:13.400
of production quality flashiness.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.600
But instead, for a given topic, just make sure that each statement that's made, if it

20:17.600 --> 20:22.200
makes sense to, has some kind of diagram that went along with it, or some kind of animation.

20:22.200 --> 20:26.680
Now part of this is because, as a hobby, one of the things I delight in is programming

20:26.680 --> 20:28.000
math animations.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.040
So this was sort of a love child between two different interests of mine, which is teaching

20:32.040 --> 20:35.840
math and then programming animations.

20:35.840 --> 20:40.920
But just to give a little bit of an illustration of what I have in mind, and then to also try

20:40.920 --> 20:46.480
to argue why sometimes making visuals like this isn't just a chore for the sake of adding

20:46.480 --> 20:50.240
more pizzazz to a lesson, but it can make it more interesting for the person putting

20:50.240 --> 20:52.120
together the lesson.

20:52.120 --> 20:56.240
I wanted to look at a video where the reason I made it was because of the visualizations

20:56.240 --> 20:57.640
I was playing around with.

20:57.640 --> 21:01.720
It wasn't that I wrote a script and then I started putting some kind of cartoon to the

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
script.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.120
It's instead that I was playing around with trying to visualize something, and then by

21:06.120 --> 21:10.600
seeing it in a certain way, it gave me the framing for how I wanted to describe it to

21:10.600 --> 21:11.840
others.

21:11.840 --> 21:18.280
So the topic was the Riemann's data function, and in particular analytic continuation.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.360
And I opened the video with the usual motivations you might give for the Riemann's data function,

21:22.360 --> 21:26.560
the status that the Riemann hypothesis has, that it contains information relevant to the

21:26.560 --> 21:28.000
primes, all of that.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.240
But the meet was to simply answer the question for a casual viewer who's kind of interested

21:33.240 --> 21:37.400
in math, but don't necessarily want to assume they know too much already.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
What is it?

21:38.400 --> 21:40.040
What is this function?

21:40.040 --> 21:44.600
Which is, of course, a surprisingly intricate question to answer.

21:44.600 --> 21:50.200
And half of the answer is not that hard, which is to look at a certain sum that defines

21:50.200 --> 21:54.520
it where you take zeta of s defined to be 1 over 1 to the s, plus 1 over 2 to the s,

21:54.520 --> 21:56.760
plus 1 over 3 to the s, on and on.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.720
So for example, an especially fun value to plug in here is something like 2, where you're

22:00.720 --> 22:05.800
adding up 1, plus 1 fourth, plus 1 ninth, plus 1 sixteenth, on and on and on.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.800
The sum actually converges.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.120
It was, you know, for one period in history, a problem that nobody in Europe could seem

22:12.120 --> 22:15.680
to figure out how to solve until one day Euler said, ah, I think I know the answer.

22:15.680 --> 22:19.840
It's pi squared over 6, which is delightful and surprising, and there's a lot of very

22:19.840 --> 22:22.440
fun reasons why that comes about.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.320
But for our purposes, we don't really care about the connection to the circle or the

22:26.320 --> 22:29.680
interesting discussions that you could have around the sum.

22:29.680 --> 22:33.320
It's just that this is an example of a value of this sum.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.400
It converges in this particular case.

22:35.400 --> 22:40.200
And if you plug in some other exponents into that instead of 2, you can get things that

22:40.200 --> 22:44.160
converge faster or things that converge slower.

22:44.160 --> 22:48.640
It's a fun exercise just in calculus to ask what's the condition for whether it converges

22:48.640 --> 22:50.920
or not.

22:50.920 --> 22:56.040
And all around it, it makes sense when you have s bigger than 1 that this thing would

22:56.040 --> 22:59.840
mean something because you have a bunch of terms that are getting smaller.

22:59.840 --> 23:04.880
But if the casual reader were to be very inspired by something like the lore surrounding the

23:04.880 --> 23:09.640
Riemann hypothesis and they find themselves on the Wikipedia page or they're poking around,

23:09.640 --> 23:13.640
one of the things they might find is that sometimes into this function, negative values

23:13.640 --> 23:14.640
are plugged in.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.480
And if they go back and they reference the definition, they're like, hang on, okay, what

23:17.480 --> 23:18.480
would that mean?

23:18.480 --> 23:22.680
I see that zeta of negative 1 is negative 112, but that doesn't make sense because it's

23:22.680 --> 23:26.520
got 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 and something that gets bigger and bigger.

23:26.520 --> 23:30.600
And then they go and they make videos about the sum of the natural numbers equaling negative

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
112.

23:31.600 --> 23:34.960
Then everyone gets mad at them and there's a whole kerfuffle.

23:34.960 --> 23:40.800
You want to sit back and say, okay, okay, what is the actual statement being made here?

23:40.800 --> 23:45.960
And for that, you can't have the discussion unless before you get to negative values, you

23:45.960 --> 23:50.120
talk a little bit about positive value, sorry, complex values.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.760
I suppose you can, but the usual path is going through complex analysis.

23:54.760 --> 23:59.040
So we'll think of it as a mapping, you know, for every input, I'm going to draw the inputs

23:59.040 --> 24:02.320
with a little yellow dot here and then the output of the function I'm drawing with a

24:02.320 --> 24:03.640
little green dot here.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.080
So the input 2 goes to the output pi squared over 6.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.680
And the question is, if we extend our notion of, hey, what are all the possible inputs?

24:10.680 --> 24:15.560
And instead we ask, what would happen if I plugged in complex values?

24:15.560 --> 24:19.880
So maybe I plug in something like 2 plus i, then what does that mean?

24:20.640 --> 24:24.640
Now, this is the kind of thing that, assuming you have a high school level of algebra, it

24:24.640 --> 24:28.040
looks a little intimidating at first, but it's not too much to parse and go through step

24:28.040 --> 24:32.240
by step and say, we can, again, with the aid of visuals, really understand what's being

24:32.240 --> 24:33.240
said here.

24:33.240 --> 24:38.800
Because if you take 1 half to the power 2 plus i, that's something that, assuming power

24:38.800 --> 24:44.720
rules work the same way with complex numbers, as you've learned they do with real numbers,

24:44.720 --> 24:49.000
you understand half of it, you understand the 1 half to the power 2 part, and the only

24:49.040 --> 24:53.320
other thing to really explain is what it means to raise something to an imaginary power.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.560
And this is something that, at this point on the channel, I had freshly made a video

24:56.560 --> 25:01.920
on, so it had a nice lead-in for any people who are regular viewers, where the upshot,

25:01.920 --> 25:06.080
of course, is if you parameterize that exponent and you say, okay, maybe instead of plugging

25:06.080 --> 25:11.880
in i, I imagine plugging in all other possible imaginary numbers, the output that I get,

25:11.880 --> 25:13.160
it's somewhere on a unit circle.

25:13.160 --> 25:17.720
And as I kind of move around that input, up and down on the imaginary line, the output

25:17.720 --> 25:20.600
kind of wanders around that circle, rotating.

25:20.600 --> 25:26.000
And it does so with a constant rate, if you're moving the yellow dotted constant rate.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.080
And the only thing to think about, for the sake of the sum that we're going to do, is

25:30.080 --> 25:33.960
the fact that if it wasn't 1 half that sits at the base there, but instead you had something

25:33.960 --> 25:38.080
like 1 ninth, you're playing the same game, you're mapping the real, the imaginary line

25:38.080 --> 25:40.960
onto the circle, but it moves a little bit faster.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.400
So for a particular imaginary number that you plug in, it will have rotated a little

25:44.400 --> 25:45.680
bit more.

25:45.680 --> 25:49.840
And this gives such a satisfying way to think about the sum that we started with, where

25:49.840 --> 25:56.960
let's say initially you picture a nice real number input, like our friend 1 half, or 1

25:56.960 --> 26:00.600
plus a fourth, plus a ninth on and on, and you think of each of those terms as a little

26:00.600 --> 26:06.080
vector or just a little line with a relevant length, then when you add some kind of imaginary

26:06.080 --> 26:10.680
part to that input, the lengths don't change, those all stay the same, so they're kind of

26:10.680 --> 26:15.080
like rigid lines, but each one of them rotates a little bit differently.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.360
And for each successive term, they rotate a little bit more, so what you end up with

26:18.360 --> 26:19.880
is a spiral.

26:19.880 --> 26:23.440
And because the first one that you started with, where all those lines were kind of stretched

26:23.440 --> 26:28.160
out as far as they could be, if that converged, then certainly as you're spiraling it like

26:28.160 --> 26:31.560
this, you would expect it to also converge.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.840
So there's going to be some value, some complex number on the plane that is this output.

26:35.840 --> 26:40.080
And here I got to just have a little bit too much fun after I properly written the program

26:40.080 --> 26:44.040
and say, okay, if we just grab that yellow dot corresponding to our input, and we move

26:44.080 --> 26:48.680
it around the plane and say, for various other inputs, what does this spiral sum look like?

26:48.680 --> 26:52.200
You can just see what the corresponding output would be.

26:52.200 --> 26:57.800
And most importantly, you can be reassured that it'll have some kind of meaningful output

26:57.800 --> 27:02.960
as long as the original sum converged, which in our case basically means as long as the

27:02.960 --> 27:06.120
real part of what you're starting with was bigger than one.

27:06.120 --> 27:11.400
And so if we're thinking about what is this function, unambiguous, very happy, there's

27:11.440 --> 27:15.080
nice convergence and it makes sense when the real part is bigger than one.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.880
For the other part, it doesn't make as much sense yet.

27:18.880 --> 27:24.400
But on the way to getting there, visualization can help just a little bit to nudge our minds

27:24.400 --> 27:28.520
into something we might want to think about, where what I'm going to do is say, what if

27:28.520 --> 27:32.840
we take not just one of the values that I could input in the right half of the plane,

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
what if we take all of them?

27:33.840 --> 27:37.240
I'm going to take every single one of them, and then I'm going to pump them through a

27:37.240 --> 27:41.380
program that's going to spit out the corresponding output, and I'm going to animate the movement

27:41.380 --> 27:43.380
between input and output.

27:43.380 --> 27:46.700
And I won't do it for literally everyone, because that'll be dense in filling the plane.

27:46.700 --> 27:50.500
But I'll put these grid lines up and then animate each point on those grid lines to

27:50.500 --> 27:54.340
kind of represent what's going to happen to everything.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.900
And this is one of the things where I had studied this, I had learned about the zeta

27:57.900 --> 27:59.500
function, I had thought about it.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.380
I didn't really know what was going to happen.

28:01.380 --> 28:05.100
I didn't really know what this would look like afterwards.

28:05.100 --> 28:10.500
One of the things that, sorry, go forward, is helpful to do is add a little bit more

28:10.500 --> 28:13.300
density around the input one.

28:13.300 --> 28:17.060
Those of you in the know might think about why you have to add some density around that

28:17.060 --> 28:18.580
particular point.

28:18.580 --> 28:22.980
And what comes out is basically the whole reason that I decided to make the video.

28:22.980 --> 28:27.060
I hadn't necessarily been thinking of covering the Riemann zeta function or talking about

28:27.060 --> 28:29.540
analytic continuation or anything like that.

28:29.540 --> 28:34.060
But once you see this and you actually map all of the inputs, the whole diagram is just

28:34.060 --> 28:39.700
sort of screaming at you how strange it is that there's an abrupt stop, right?

28:39.700 --> 28:44.260
You can look at this and say, okay, there seems to be this line where everything stops.

28:44.260 --> 28:48.220
And one of the very fun things about this is there's all sorts of questions that I think

28:48.220 --> 28:52.860
someone could ask if they're watching this that go way beyond anything that the video

28:52.860 --> 28:57.460
talks about that can keep the interest even if it's an expert who feels very well familiar

28:57.460 --> 28:58.740
with this concept.

28:58.740 --> 29:02.220
For example, you could ask, where is that line?

29:02.220 --> 29:04.900
Eyeballing it, you might guess that it's around 0.5.

29:04.900 --> 29:09.060
The actual answer is it's around Euler's constant, so it's a little above 0.5.

29:09.060 --> 29:10.940
You can ask, why is that the case?

29:10.940 --> 29:12.780
Why does it look like a straight line at all?

29:12.780 --> 29:14.260
Is it actually a straight line?

29:14.260 --> 29:18.620
Now, I don't need to ask those questions, but the point I want to make is just that in

29:18.620 --> 29:23.660
trying to visualize it, motivated by making it clearer for the broader public or clearer

29:23.660 --> 29:28.420
for a new student, I think the act of doing that also raises the ceiling.

29:28.420 --> 29:32.260
Done right, it actually makes it more interesting to someone who feels already familiar with

29:32.260 --> 29:34.020
the concept.

29:34.020 --> 29:37.660
So the way that the lesson proceeds from here is to essentially point out that because there's

29:37.700 --> 29:42.940
this abrupt stop, this whole function seems like it's asking to be continued in some way,

29:42.940 --> 29:49.460
that maybe it's defined well using this sum for some of the complex numbers, but we might

29:49.460 --> 29:54.020
have a conditional definition that says beyond those, it equals something else.

29:54.020 --> 29:56.500
And the question is, what should that something else be?

29:56.500 --> 30:00.980
And so if we imagined kind of filling in the rest of the grid, I can preview what that

30:00.980 --> 30:07.460
something else ends up looking like, and it does have a kind of local symmetry, I should

30:07.500 --> 30:12.300
say, one thing that's potentially misleading about the image is that it insinuates a kind

30:12.300 --> 30:17.180
of symmetry entirely left and right on this, but later on in the video, I draw out more

30:17.180 --> 30:20.820
extensions of the lines to show that's not quite the case.

30:20.820 --> 30:25.820
And this lends itself to just talking about something which is very peculiar to complex

30:25.820 --> 30:31.860
functions that if a student hadn't been studying, it would be a fun novel fact, which is that

30:31.860 --> 30:35.780
in a certain sense, even though it feels like you should have a lot of degrees of freedom

30:35.860 --> 30:40.380
for what that continuation would be, you just kind of draw the function to do whatever you

30:40.380 --> 30:42.940
want it to do for all of those other inputs.

30:42.940 --> 30:46.860
While that is true, if all you care about is defining some kind of function, or if all

30:46.860 --> 30:52.980
you do care about is constraining it by being continuous, say, what's surprising, and the

30:52.980 --> 30:56.540
fun fact to talk about, and can be kind of an upshot of the video that hopefully has

30:56.540 --> 31:00.540
a little bit of staying power, is that if you want to constrain that your function has

31:00.540 --> 31:05.860
a derivative everywhere, that that actually, if there's an extension at all, locks you

31:05.860 --> 31:10.900
into only one choice, which is, of course, one of the fundamental intuitions under complex

31:10.900 --> 31:16.180
analysis is how rigid the functions feel in contrast to real functions.

31:16.180 --> 31:22.380
And from there, again, it's like if the constraint placed on describing math is to try to visualize

31:22.380 --> 31:26.900
everything that's being said, this sentence kind of doesn't cut it, you know, if I really

31:26.940 --> 31:31.460
want it to go far, you don't just say derivative, we have to visualize what a derivative means

31:31.460 --> 31:32.820
in this context.

31:32.820 --> 31:36.260
And so the remainder of the video essentially does that, talks about notions of conformal

31:36.260 --> 31:40.140
mappings and what the intuition is for how you would think about whether something is

31:40.140 --> 31:44.660
derivative or not, and the fact that completing this diagram is a sort of infinite continuous

31:44.660 --> 31:49.100
jigsaw puzzle where every pair of lines that started off at a certain angle, you want them

31:49.100 --> 31:52.140
to continue to have that angle and the like.

31:52.140 --> 31:56.100
And all of this is just to mention one of the things that I like to keep in mind in

31:56.100 --> 32:00.420
the checklist, which is maybe a little peculiar to my case because I've kind of gone hard

32:00.420 --> 32:04.860
on this end of try to visualize every single thing, but which I think, taken a little bit

32:04.860 --> 32:09.540
more softly, can be mapped to math exposition a little bit more broadly, which is to just

32:09.540 --> 32:15.460
ask are the core ideas given diagrams, you know, another, it sounds simple, but I think

32:15.460 --> 32:16.460
it can go so far.

32:16.460 --> 32:22.300
There's another example that comes to mind where a friend of mine named Michael Nielsen,

32:22.300 --> 32:27.940
when he was a grad student, wrote what then became like one of the Bibles of quantum computing

32:27.940 --> 32:32.540
as far as textbooks are concerned, and he wrote it with a collaborator, Isaiah Chuang,

32:32.540 --> 32:35.660
and I was asking him what the collaboration process was like with that.

32:35.660 --> 32:39.580
And Nielsen is a very like a textual learner and thinker, and he would say he would just

32:39.580 --> 32:44.620
kind of go and just write out a whole bunch of text and descriptions essentially procrastinating

32:44.620 --> 32:49.260
from his thesis is the way that he wrote this textbook, which is absurd if you know the textbook

32:49.300 --> 32:51.060
at all.

32:51.060 --> 32:54.380
And then he would send them along to his collaborator, Chuang, who would then point out, oh, this

32:54.380 --> 32:58.180
needs a diagram, this needs a diagram, and basically point out and then often fill out

32:58.180 --> 33:00.500
the points that needed some kind of illustration.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.180
And the medley was something very beautiful.

33:02.180 --> 33:06.700
And I think that having a two person team like that enabled them to have this forcing

33:06.700 --> 33:10.460
function where maybe Michael would have been a little bit less willing to write certain

33:10.460 --> 33:13.660
sections if he had also been thinking about the effort that was going to be required to

33:13.660 --> 33:15.780
illustrate every single one of them.

33:15.820 --> 33:19.860
But with the mind free from having to think about that for himself and someone else taking

33:19.860 --> 33:24.020
care of that, it felt like less of a chore maybe.

33:24.020 --> 33:28.100
But again, I do kind of want to emphasize that even though it takes time to put together

33:28.100 --> 33:29.780
visuals, you know, it doesn't have to.

33:29.780 --> 33:34.140
I think just a pencil sketch or something simple in like whatever illustration software

33:34.140 --> 33:39.340
is your favorite that doesn't have to be precise, it can be a simple sketch can go a long way.

33:39.340 --> 33:42.740
These don't have to be something that's purely for the student.

33:42.740 --> 33:47.260
I think that selfishly on the part of whoever's writing, say writing the textbook or putting

33:47.260 --> 33:52.340
together a lecture or putting together a video, sometimes the visuals that you make actually

33:52.340 --> 33:54.700
elicit new intuitions.

33:54.700 --> 33:59.260
And the act of doing so, at least in my case, many, many times has deepened my own understanding

33:59.260 --> 34:00.260
of something.

34:00.260 --> 34:05.340
I feel fairly comfortable projecting that for others it stands to do the same.

34:05.340 --> 34:09.380
This might be particular to programmatic animations more so than a lot of other things.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.460
But I think almost everyone's familiar with the fact that when you're just trying to think

34:12.460 --> 34:16.100
of something while lying on the couch, somehow it's dramatically less clear than when you

34:16.100 --> 34:20.300
go to a whiteboard or you actually pull out your notes and then try to sketch something

34:20.300 --> 34:21.540
related to it.

34:21.540 --> 34:25.620
And letting it be something that's not just a nice to have, but instead sits inside a checklist

34:25.620 --> 34:30.340
of what does it mean for my piece to even be done, I think can help force that to come

34:30.340 --> 34:32.500
about a little bit more.

34:32.500 --> 34:37.020
Now the next thing that I like to think about, and this is one where, by the way, every single

34:37.020 --> 34:41.500
time I do a first draft of something, I violate the principle that I'm about to describe and

34:41.540 --> 34:44.300
I have to go and realize, oh, wait, no, I should apply this principle.

34:44.300 --> 34:47.940
There's something bizarrely unnatural about it, but I really do think it helps to make

34:47.940 --> 34:48.940
things clearer.

34:48.940 --> 34:53.580
To illustrate it, I'm going to talk about a much simpler piece of math, and instead of

34:53.580 --> 34:58.180
doing zeta function type stuff, we're going to go to simple algebra, and I mean like normal

34:58.180 --> 35:01.780
high school, middle school algebra, not abstract.

35:01.780 --> 35:05.340
And I want you to kind of put yourself back in the state of mind whenever it is the case

35:05.340 --> 35:10.740
that you were first learning, just basic algebra, whatever age you were, whatever class you

35:10.780 --> 35:16.580
might have been in, and I'm going to paint two potential classes, and I want you to just

35:16.580 --> 35:22.140
think about how much does each of those classes resonate with this imagined past version of

35:22.140 --> 35:25.540
yourself that's sitting there learning it for the first time.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.620
So the way that class A proceeds is like this.

35:28.620 --> 35:33.620
The teacher starts by asking all of the students, can anyone factor the number 35 for me?

35:33.620 --> 35:36.980
And actually, I'll do this, why not, anyone in the audience, you want to shout out the

35:37.020 --> 35:39.020
factors of 35?

35:39.020 --> 35:41.820
Five and seven, excellent.

35:41.820 --> 35:47.820
Now, the teacher then asks the students, can anyone please factor the number 143 for me?

35:47.820 --> 35:53.820
So, because this is a room full of mathematicians, everyone immediately shouts 11 times 13, which

35:53.820 --> 35:57.380
is fun, but the students, you know, maybe they think about it a little bit more, they

35:57.380 --> 36:01.340
check whether various numbers go into it, and the one that does their little long division

36:01.340 --> 36:04.660
with the 11, they raise their hand with a little bit more time than this crowd would

36:04.660 --> 36:06.500
and says 11 times 13.

36:06.500 --> 36:10.820
So then the teacher asks, can anyone factor 3599?

36:10.820 --> 36:18.740
Now this is a fun room to do it in, so 59 times 61, great.

36:18.740 --> 36:23.380
This does not happen in middle schools.

36:23.380 --> 36:29.980
Although I was recently doing something where I brought up this example in a room full of

36:29.980 --> 36:34.380
high schoolers and there was one student who said it, he said the answer, he said it's

36:34.500 --> 36:41.500
59 times 61, and there was an audible gasp from the whole room, because it's absurd if

36:41.700 --> 36:43.820
you think about it factoring the normal way.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.780
But the teacher says, you know, there's a reason that I led into it the way that I did,

36:46.780 --> 36:51.220
and the teacher invites the students to think about how 35 is very close to a square number,

36:51.220 --> 36:54.900
it's so close to something round, it's close to six times six, and it maybe doesn't feel

36:54.900 --> 36:58.700
like a coincidence that the two factors are also close to six.

36:58.700 --> 37:02.740
It looks kind of like six times six, but you just nudged one up, you nudged one down.

37:02.780 --> 37:08.540
Similarly, 143, it's very close, it's just one less than a square number, namely 12 times 12,

37:08.540 --> 37:11.580
and it's not a coincidence that the factors, if you kind of squint your eyes, also look

37:11.580 --> 37:12.780
like 12 times 12.

37:12.780 --> 37:17.660
So if you're just pattern matching, then you might guess that the factor should look something

37:17.660 --> 37:21.380
like 60 times something like 60, and if it followed the same exact pattern, it would be

37:21.380 --> 37:23.220
one more and one less.

37:23.220 --> 37:28.140
And, you know, the teacher wants, they can go through a couple other examples like this,

37:28.140 --> 37:32.260
start to convince the class that maybe, just maybe, this kind of wild fact is true,

37:32.260 --> 37:36.660
and it lets you look like that person who can receive an audible gas from all

37:36.660 --> 37:39.620
of your classmates for being able to factor a number, which is very fun.

37:39.620 --> 37:43.980
And then the teacher can draw out a diagram to help explain what's going on,

37:43.980 --> 37:48.660
where if you imagine, you know, what does a square number mean, like six squared in this case,

37:48.660 --> 37:52.660
you might imagine six by six boxes, and if we subtract one, you're kind of kicking one

37:52.660 --> 37:56.620
off of the corner, and if you rearrange this a little bit, what it means to try

37:56.620 --> 38:00.900
to factor the number is to try to arrange all of your boxes into some kind of rectangle.

38:00.900 --> 38:04.100
And in this case, we can do that where one of the rectangles has a width that's just

38:04.100 --> 38:08.100
one bigger and, or the rectangle has a width that's one bigger and then a height that's

38:08.100 --> 38:09.980
one smaller.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.580
And you can actually generalize this, if instead of kicking off a corner that was just a little

38:13.580 --> 38:19.300
one by one square, if you kicked off a y by y square, you can basically play the same

38:19.300 --> 38:22.620
game to factor it to look like x plus y times x minus y.

38:22.620 --> 38:26.460
And it's very fun, again, this gives you a lot of fun mental math tricks, where you

38:26.460 --> 38:30.740
can say things that make you seem like a genius, where someone can say factor the number

38:30.740 --> 38:36.700
at 9,991, and you can do it without a calculator, or on the flip side, it's a nice trick for

38:36.700 --> 38:41.420
multiplying certain numbers, assuming that you know the square of what sits halfway in

38:41.420 --> 38:43.180
between them.

38:43.180 --> 38:48.180
So that's class A. Class B starts off by saying, hello class, today we're going to be studying

38:48.180 --> 38:49.660
the difference of squares formula.

38:49.660 --> 38:53.620
The difference of squares formula states that if we take x squared minus y squared, this

38:53.620 --> 38:57.140
can be factored into x plus y multiplied by x minus y.

38:57.140 --> 39:00.820
The formula is very easy, it's not too hard to show, because if we expand out the right

39:00.820 --> 39:06.900
hand side, you see that you have x squared, we subtract off yx, we add y times x, so those

39:06.900 --> 39:09.980
two cancel out, and we get y squared.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.500
The instruction really doesn't take long.

39:12.500 --> 39:16.380
You can give an example, like if you plug in 1, it gives a nice fact that you can factor

39:16.380 --> 39:19.500
something into x plus 1 and x minus 1.

39:19.500 --> 39:23.380
And then there's a worksheet that you can kind of work through, which is, this is just

39:23.380 --> 39:27.460
a worksheet that I found when I was looking for classes on difference of squares formula.

39:27.460 --> 39:32.500
Now, okay, maybe I'm being a little bit unfair, not giving enough personality to the second

39:32.500 --> 39:34.220
lesson as I could have.

39:34.220 --> 39:39.140
But broadly speaking, if we try to compare what's going on with these two, class B does

39:39.140 --> 39:43.580
something which is so tempting to do in so many other contexts in math, which is that

39:43.580 --> 39:45.940
you start with the most powerful thing.

39:45.940 --> 39:48.820
You state what the powerful thing is that you're going to do.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.980
Usually that takes the form of an abstraction.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.700
It's the most true thing.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.540
It's kind of easier to show in that case.

39:55.540 --> 39:59.300
This is part of what we love about abstraction, is that it's just a lot quicker to verify

39:59.300 --> 40:04.620
that that's true than it is to try to come up with some reason why a numerical case where

40:04.620 --> 40:08.620
you're gathering around a bunch of squares or stones or whatever you're using to concretize

40:08.620 --> 40:09.620
it.

40:09.620 --> 40:13.980
And even then, the reasoning doesn't cover all the general cases necessarily, because

40:13.980 --> 40:15.820
you'd say, well, does it have to be an integer?

40:15.820 --> 40:17.180
Would this work with negative numbers?

40:17.180 --> 40:20.420
And would it work with complex numbers, all of that?

40:20.420 --> 40:26.180
So that's the temptation of class B. Class A teaches using data and examples.

40:26.180 --> 40:29.740
And it's not that the abstraction isn't a goal, it is the goal.

40:29.740 --> 40:31.500
That's the function of the lesson at the end.

40:31.500 --> 40:35.140
And it's not that you want to encourage students every single time that they come across the

40:35.140 --> 40:39.380
difference of squares formula to picture in their head a little grid of x by x and y, because

40:39.380 --> 40:42.660
sometimes you're just in the middle of doing a bunch of other algebra, and the whole point

40:42.660 --> 40:47.500
of abstraction is that you don't have to think about that and you can do it more quickly.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.420
But I think for the first time that you're seeing it, if you really want it to land inside

40:51.420 --> 40:56.980
yourself, it's more helpful to kind of think in terms of layers of abstraction where before

40:56.980 --> 41:01.380
getting to the lesson you have in mind, shift yourself one abstraction layer lower.

41:01.380 --> 41:05.300
Instead of, in this case, thinking about variables and letters, think about numbers.

41:05.300 --> 41:08.600
And then if you show lots of different examples with those numbers, it's kind of like light

41:08.600 --> 41:12.060
bulbs in the mind of the student that are thinking of all those examples.

41:12.060 --> 41:16.540
And if there's a certain ineffable character that connects them, the student can kind of

41:16.580 --> 41:20.620
think about the things that connect them, the fact that things feel close to squares,

41:20.620 --> 41:26.420
or that the two factors that you got are suspiciously close to the square root of the relevant number.

41:26.420 --> 41:30.380
And when we did the diagram, in a sense that's an abstraction layer even lower, where instead

41:30.380 --> 41:35.260
of thinking of numbers and numerals representing amounts, you're just looking at the amounts

41:35.260 --> 41:38.860
and you can see the connection between the numerical facts that got you to feel like

41:38.860 --> 41:41.780
a wizard and something more direct with those amounts.

41:41.780 --> 41:46.220
And by the time you get to the abstraction, it feels so cool and so powerful because you

41:46.260 --> 41:49.620
have a sense for all of the different things underneath that it's touching, all of the

41:49.620 --> 41:55.340
different mental math tricks that are encapsulated in such a beautiful and concise formula.

41:55.340 --> 41:59.700
It seems a little banal to those of us once you're comfortable with algebra because it's

41:59.700 --> 42:01.940
just one identity out of many.

42:01.940 --> 42:06.780
But I think reminding students that every identity that you see in algebra kind of encapsulates

42:06.780 --> 42:12.020
this whole body of potential mental math tricks or potential statements about a wide variety

42:12.020 --> 42:13.940
of little diagrams you could draw out.

42:13.980 --> 42:18.060
There's something about that that feels very inspiring, to me at least.

42:18.060 --> 42:22.820
Now class B in contrast, it teaches the same topic.

42:22.820 --> 42:28.540
It gives you the same ultimate fact and assuming the students remember the fact, I can't imagine

42:28.540 --> 42:34.700
that they would test much more poorly, at least if you do the test with this kind of

42:34.700 --> 42:38.060
worksheet that they got their practice on shortly after the lesson.

42:38.060 --> 42:41.380
I might question whether they remember the formula as well if you ask them five years

42:41.420 --> 42:46.020
later or something like that, but if I'm trying to picture what's going on in the kind of

42:46.020 --> 42:50.020
depiction of, this isn't literally what's happening in the brain, but you know my schematic

42:50.020 --> 42:54.260
for layers of abstraction in the brain, you're just sort of lighting up the one bulb you

42:54.260 --> 42:58.220
care about and it's not sitting on something else to support it, it hasn't been brought

42:58.220 --> 42:59.220
about.

42:59.220 --> 43:02.300
There wasn't a sense that it was answering a question or articulating a pattern that

43:02.300 --> 43:04.580
already existed in someone's mind.

43:04.580 --> 43:09.260
So this is a thing I like to think about as much as I can where if there's a given topic,

43:09.260 --> 43:13.140
I try to draw out what are the relevant layers of abstraction at play here.

43:13.140 --> 43:17.380
Now there's not like a universal hierarchy or something like that, but just as an example

43:17.380 --> 43:21.460
for what that might look like, at the bottom most layer we have things like quantities.

43:21.460 --> 43:25.180
One of the very first things we do when we're teaching students math is to get them to go

43:25.180 --> 43:30.620
from feeling comfortable with quantities to thinking comfortably with numerals and eventually

43:30.620 --> 43:32.500
everyone gains a certain fluency with this.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.500
Maybe there's a couple bumps in the road while they're learning about fractions and doing

43:35.500 --> 43:38.940
that, but by and large everyone kind of gets that layer of abstraction.

43:38.940 --> 43:42.380
And then similarly at some point instead of talking about numerals, we realize that there's

43:42.380 --> 43:46.980
just a lot of facts that are nicer and encapsulated with algebra and symbols and can you just

43:46.980 --> 43:50.660
communicate more, you can think more quickly with respect to certain things and it's such

43:50.660 --> 43:53.420
a powerful tool.

43:53.420 --> 43:58.260
The next layer, it's not exactly the case that functions abstract the notion of algebra,

43:58.260 --> 44:03.220
but kind of it's the case that certain, let's say, facts and calculus that you're learning,

44:03.220 --> 44:07.180
you draw out with respect to functions where every instantiation of that function that might

44:07.180 --> 44:12.780
come along looks like either algebra or some bit of trigonometry or something there.

44:12.780 --> 44:16.740
And so you write out your facts about derivatives and integrals and chain rule and the like,

44:16.740 --> 44:22.940
not with respect to specific functions, but instead just in a more abstract setting.

44:22.940 --> 44:26.740
And again the next layer is maybe a little bit silly to think of as like a definitive

44:26.740 --> 44:32.940
canonical one, but there's a sense in which functions are a single instance of function

44:32.940 --> 44:36.740
spaces at least, like a collection of functions, an instance of vector spaces.

44:36.780 --> 44:41.100
And a lot of the facts that you might have around functions can fit into a more general

44:41.100 --> 44:44.500
framework where things like the derivative and the integral you can think of in terms

44:44.500 --> 44:46.700
of linear mappings and the like.

44:46.700 --> 44:50.420
And of course you keep going on and on and on until people get talking to you about higher

44:50.420 --> 44:53.620
categories and it's just a snake that eats its own tail up there.

44:53.620 --> 44:58.540
But the point is that whatever layer you're sitting on here, you know, I give an example

44:58.540 --> 45:03.780
in a low set of those layers between numerals and algebra, but I think even at higher layers,

45:03.820 --> 45:08.900
I just personally think that it's very helpful for the first time that a student sees something

45:08.900 --> 45:14.820
to populate their mind with data of a lower layer before you articulate the higher layer,

45:14.820 --> 45:16.900
even if the goal is the higher layer.

45:16.900 --> 45:21.180
So if you're teaching linear algebra, for example, even though the whole beauty of linear

45:21.180 --> 45:26.700
algebra is the generality, the fact that it's not just describing R2 and R3 and the like,

45:26.700 --> 45:30.420
but that there's a whole body of things that you can model with vector spaces and then use

45:30.460 --> 45:35.380
facts that you've derived very rigorously just from the axioms to come to conclusions about

45:35.380 --> 45:37.540
all the different things that could be vector spaces.

45:37.540 --> 45:43.300
Nevertheless, the intuition building phase is probably best done if you populate it with

45:43.300 --> 45:44.300
a bunch of examples.

45:44.300 --> 45:49.700
Maybe it's good to spread out not just from R2 and R3, but certain other examples of more

45:49.700 --> 45:54.420
playful, you know, vector spaces that one might come up with.

45:54.420 --> 45:58.420
I think one example that comes to mind is just an excellent example to get someone starting

45:58.420 --> 46:03.300
to think about more abstract vector spaces is magic squares.

46:03.300 --> 46:06.820
And if you teach them the notion of a three-by-three magic square, where all of the columns and

46:06.820 --> 46:12.060
rows and such have to add up to a certain amount, you then ask someone how many dimensions

46:12.060 --> 46:16.820
is the space of all magic squares and what's the basis for the magic squares.

46:16.820 --> 46:19.940
And that kind of question can get them thinking, again, it's very concrete.

46:19.940 --> 46:25.460
It's a specific instance, a very specific kind of vector space, but that starts to invite

46:25.500 --> 46:31.300
them to think about what's common across the arrows drawn in 2D space examples that they

46:31.300 --> 46:33.800
might have cut their teeth on earlier.

46:33.800 --> 46:38.660
So with my checklist, I think what this means is I try to ask, are abstractions preceded

46:38.660 --> 46:39.660
with concrete examples?

46:39.660 --> 46:45.100
And like I said, for whatever reason, this is one that the first draft, if I write something,

46:45.100 --> 46:46.380
just doesn't do it.

46:46.380 --> 46:50.740
And I think it's because once you understand something, the way you think about it, at

46:50.740 --> 46:54.460
least the way I think about it, tends to be from the abstraction down, it's frankly

46:54.460 --> 46:58.500
a lot easier to think about the difference of squares formula algebraically than it is

46:58.500 --> 47:03.100
to try to think about a bunch of mental math tricks or a grid of squares or anything like

47:03.100 --> 47:04.100
that.

47:04.100 --> 47:05.420
It's just so quick to verify.

47:05.420 --> 47:08.940
And then this goes for a lot of other things where the reason we do the abstractions is

47:08.940 --> 47:12.540
because it allows for more mental fluency, but then that often can give us a mistake

47:12.540 --> 47:17.700
that it means as you're divulging the topic, the thing that is easiest for you, the expert,

47:17.700 --> 47:21.940
is necessarily the thing that is most conducive to a new learner coming in.

47:21.940 --> 47:26.740
And so by specifically writing it out and letting it be one of the checks, I think it

47:26.740 --> 47:29.900
can shift my lessons, hopefully, to be the better.

47:29.900 --> 47:34.700
Now the last one I'd like to talk about is actually something I've only more recently

47:34.700 --> 47:35.820
started thinking about.

47:35.820 --> 47:41.940
And it's hard to do in videos, and I'm curious about if there's ways to kind of do it better.

47:41.940 --> 47:43.940
It's definitely applicable in classrooms.

47:43.940 --> 47:48.260
I think done with good writing, it's applicable in textbooks.

47:48.260 --> 47:52.180
But one nice thing to illustrate it is a certain study by Manu Kapoor.

47:52.180 --> 47:56.100
He even gave a certain TED talk about studies like this.

47:56.100 --> 48:00.860
But the one that caught my eye is this paper called Productive Failure in Learning Math.

48:00.860 --> 48:04.740
And he focuses on the nature of failure, but to my mind, that's not even the most interesting

48:04.740 --> 48:05.740
part.

48:05.740 --> 48:11.420
The neat thing here is he has two different classes that he teaches or that in the experiment

48:11.420 --> 48:16.060
are taught to a group of middle school students, and the middle school students are segregated

48:16.060 --> 48:20.300
into two different groups in class A. They experience two hours.

48:20.300 --> 48:24.620
One is an instruction phase and following that is a problem-solving phase, and the only

48:24.620 --> 48:28.300
difference with the second class, the only difference is that they flip the order.

48:28.300 --> 48:32.500
They did a one-hour problem-solving phase followed by the instruction phase.

48:32.500 --> 48:35.980
And the example matters here because I don't think you can do this for any kind of problem

48:35.980 --> 48:41.820
solving, but it was a well-chosen problem-solving prompt in the case of this class because they

48:41.820 --> 48:44.780
were teaching the idea of standard deviation.

48:44.820 --> 48:48.820
And the question that they asked was to present the students with two different basketball

48:48.820 --> 48:53.020
players and they give a whole bunch of data over the course of a season of basketball

48:53.020 --> 48:56.340
for how many points each one of those players scored.

48:56.340 --> 49:00.020
And they were told, Mike and Dave are two basketball players, and an award has to be

49:00.020 --> 49:05.820
given to the most consistent player of the two, and the decision has to be made mathematically.

49:05.820 --> 49:10.380
And so the students were invited to design as many measures of consistency as they could

49:10.380 --> 49:12.500
to determine which of those players is more consistent.

49:13.140 --> 49:17.980
It's a very fun exercise, actually, and so the middle schoolers were given 60 minutes

49:17.980 --> 49:21.620
to think about this, to look over the data, try to add some things up, use their calculators

49:21.620 --> 49:25.100
that they could, come up with some measure of consistency.

49:25.100 --> 49:27.220
And a couple things came out of it.

49:27.220 --> 49:31.420
One of them is that the students in that second one that did the problem-solving phase before

49:31.420 --> 49:35.780
they did the instruction, they reported that the instruction phase was harder, that they

49:35.780 --> 49:37.860
were spending more mental energy on it.

49:38.580 --> 49:44.180
Now another relevant thing is the number of tactics they came up with, it was a lot higher.

49:44.180 --> 49:48.460
There was a lot more variation in the measures of consistency they came up with when they

49:48.460 --> 49:50.380
hadn't been taught the proper lesson yet.

49:50.380 --> 49:54.820
But the most interesting thing, to me at least, is when they did a post-test on all

49:54.820 --> 49:58.900
of this, and they had just questions trying to measure how well the students understood

49:58.900 --> 50:01.100
the topic of standard deviation.

50:01.100 --> 50:04.860
The questions broke into various different categories, so the ones that were categorized

50:04.860 --> 50:09.140
as procedural knowledge, just, are you able to carry out the computation and all that,

50:09.140 --> 50:12.660
there wasn't really much of a difference between the two camps.

50:12.660 --> 50:17.300
But the ones that the researchers marked as measuring conceptual understanding, it was

50:17.300 --> 50:21.860
like two standard deviations higher in conceptual understanding that the second group had compared

50:21.860 --> 50:23.620
to the first.

50:23.620 --> 50:27.980
And then questions that were marked as measuring how transferrable the knowledge was, were they

50:27.980 --> 50:32.420
able to transfer it to a different context, it was like one standard deviation higher.

50:32.420 --> 50:35.740
And on the one hand, kind of always have to take a little bit of grain of salt with

50:35.740 --> 50:39.980
education studies, and especially if they're small sample sizes and things like that.

50:39.980 --> 50:45.900
But to me at least, this one rings very true, the idea that if you seriously engage with

50:45.900 --> 50:50.860
a problem before you're told the answer, that that actually makes you engage more meaningfully

50:50.860 --> 50:54.060
with the answer once it's told to you in the instruction.

50:54.060 --> 50:57.540
So I think probably a lot of people in this room have had the experience of toying over

50:57.540 --> 51:01.860
some problem, not because it was assigned for homework after a given class was given,

51:01.860 --> 51:04.860
but because for whatever reason, you just were interested in that problem.

51:04.860 --> 51:08.420
And then maybe a little bit later, maybe a couple years later, you come across someone

51:08.420 --> 51:12.020
who's answering that problem, they happen to articulate exactly the thing you were looking

51:12.020 --> 51:13.020
for.

51:13.020 --> 51:17.340
In my experience, that answer sticks so much better than the answers that are given for

51:17.340 --> 51:21.460
questions that I hadn't yet been thinking about or toiling over.

51:21.460 --> 51:27.660
So the third thing that I put on this checklist is, does the lesson start with some kind of

51:27.660 --> 51:29.460
motivating question?

51:29.460 --> 51:33.820
Like I said, I think that's kind of hard to do with video because you have to invite

51:33.820 --> 51:38.420
the audience to pause and think about it, which some people will do, and that's great.

51:38.420 --> 51:42.340
But realistically, a lot of people are a little bit more passive in that moment.

51:42.340 --> 51:46.700
So it seems like something that's much better done in conjunction with instruction, whether

51:46.700 --> 51:51.540
that instruction comes in the form of a video or a textbook or something like that.

51:51.540 --> 51:55.820
I think a good author with a textbook can kind of do a lot too, at the very least, proceed

51:55.820 --> 52:02.780
the relevant sections with the right questions, maybe even give some stern suggestions to

52:02.780 --> 52:04.340
the reader that, no, really, stop.

52:04.340 --> 52:05.340
Think about this.

52:05.340 --> 52:08.420
If you really want to engage with it, if you really want to remember it, take five minutes

52:08.420 --> 52:11.700
to close the book and think about this question.

52:11.700 --> 52:15.260
But whatever form it takes, I think when the student has actually engaged with something

52:15.260 --> 52:19.420
like this, it stands to make the instruction itself land a lot more.

52:19.420 --> 52:23.100
And it's not something I've always done, so that's a thing I've been thinking about

52:23.100 --> 52:26.060
more and how I can bring that into the future.

52:26.060 --> 52:30.380
So I'm curious, actually, what other people would add to this list and what principles

52:30.380 --> 52:33.940
they have for a checklist of pedagogy.

52:33.940 --> 52:37.740
And just to reiterate the point, I do think that the reason that it's important to have

52:37.740 --> 52:42.940
something like this, rather than just letting it be subjective and fuzzy, is because those

52:42.940 --> 52:47.660
of us who are mathematically interested, we have a kind of attraction to the definite

52:47.700 --> 52:54.940
and the allure of something that's like exact in the sense that rigor is exact, is so tempting

52:54.940 --> 52:58.660
that it can sometimes mean we lose sight of the other forms of completion that are just

52:58.660 --> 52:59.900
as worthy.

52:59.900 --> 53:04.260
And I also want to reiterate, it's not a statement that rigor and clarity necessarily

53:04.260 --> 53:05.700
sit in contrast with each other.

53:05.700 --> 53:08.980
The best author is definitely achieved both at the same time.

53:08.980 --> 53:14.180
It's just when we care about something like clarity with the same verb that we care about

53:14.220 --> 53:17.660
something like rigor, with the same sense of satisfaction that comes from looking over

53:17.660 --> 53:21.340
a piece and saying, yes, I can officially check this off.

53:21.340 --> 53:24.860
That's something that feels like it's achievable when you're looking for a slight cultural

53:24.860 --> 53:30.900
shift, whereas fuzzier descriptions like we need to do better just aren't going to apply.

53:30.900 --> 53:34.420
So with that, I'd like to thank you all for coming.

53:34.420 --> 53:39.420
And thank you.

53:39.420 --> 53:50.420
Well, thank you, Grant.

53:50.420 --> 53:52.460
That was a lot of fun.

53:52.460 --> 53:59.540
For those of us like myself who grew up in a time when colored chalk was considered innovative,

53:59.540 --> 54:06.820
this was a very refreshing and eye-opening look at the ways that new ideas and technologies

54:06.860 --> 54:09.580
can help inform our work.

54:09.580 --> 54:15.980
And I think the age of digital textbooks and other kinds of interactive things that combine

54:15.980 --> 54:21.780
some of the elements you're talking about are going to offer some very exciting opportunities.

54:21.780 --> 54:23.900
We do have a little time for questions.

54:23.900 --> 54:29.820
We have a couple of microphones in the aisles, and I would invite you to line up.

54:29.820 --> 54:31.420
There are come to those microphones.

54:31.420 --> 54:35.100
If you'd like to ask a question, I think, Grant, you're up for that, right?

54:35.100 --> 54:36.100
Absolutely.

54:36.540 --> 54:40.580
I'd love to answer any questions, and I'll stick around outside of the ballroom afterwards

54:40.580 --> 54:43.020
if people want to come say hello.

54:43.020 --> 54:46.700
I'm not sure what the protocol here is, but let's say whoever is standing there at the

54:46.700 --> 54:47.700
mic first.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.700
Hi.

54:48.700 --> 54:56.060
I just wanted to ask you about in sort of exploring this idea of presenting data first

54:56.060 --> 55:00.500
and like this concrete information before getting to abstraction, do you have any thoughts

55:00.500 --> 55:06.460
on sort of in that process teaching students that you're not always going to see it, you're

55:06.460 --> 55:10.420
not always going to see it the first time, and like getting students comfortable with

55:10.420 --> 55:15.940
the idea that math can be hard, and this is an exploratory process that isn't necessarily

55:15.940 --> 55:19.140
targeted at getting to the abstraction first thing?

55:19.140 --> 55:24.700
Yeah, I think that's such a good point that even if the back of the mind goal of the exposer

55:24.700 --> 55:30.060
is that you've set up this stage so very carefully that surely anyone will follow up to the conclusion

55:30.100 --> 55:34.860
setting the expectations with everyone that like epiphany is very rare and discovery is

55:34.860 --> 55:39.180
something to be cherished, and if it was something that could happen all the time, it wouldn't

55:39.180 --> 55:41.580
be as lovely as it is.

55:41.580 --> 55:46.140
I'm not sure of the best ways to do that other than saying it in words and just kind of reassuring

55:46.140 --> 55:50.700
now and then like, hey, it's okay if you don't see this yet, or maybe holding off from a

55:50.700 --> 55:57.220
temptation to use phrases like obviously or like clearly and things like, but it's an

55:57.220 --> 55:59.540
important point to bring up, I appreciate that.

56:00.140 --> 56:01.100
On the right side here.

56:04.740 --> 56:09.740
Yeah, so there's a phrase that I've heard a couple of times, which is when teaching

56:09.740 --> 56:12.860
Matthews to teach the truth, nothing but the truth, but never the whole truth.

56:13.860 --> 56:20.300
How do you decide at what point, especially if you're teaching younger students, whatever

56:20.300 --> 56:26.980
that means, where it's good to give intuition rather than full rigor, how do you decide at

56:27.020 --> 56:29.420
which point to no longer be rigorous?

56:29.780 --> 56:30.580
That's a great question.

56:30.580 --> 56:36.100
I think I think you can always be honest about when you're being hand wavy.

56:36.860 --> 56:40.740
You know, Feynman was especially good at this with the Feynman lectures.

56:40.740 --> 56:44.540
I know because like physics is an exercise of constantly lying to people less and less over

56:44.540 --> 56:45.740
the course of their education.

56:46.140 --> 56:50.140
And he did a good job of like calling out the lies as they took place saying this is a

56:50.140 --> 56:51.300
simplifying assumption.

56:51.660 --> 56:53.060
And I don't think it takes that long.

56:53.060 --> 56:57.860
And so you can maybe tip your hat to the fact that there might be certain exceptions in

56:57.860 --> 56:58.700
certain cases.

57:00.100 --> 57:05.860
Or to the extent that's possible, you know, you you try to limit the scope of what you're

57:05.860 --> 57:10.060
saying such that if there is more complexity outside of it, you're just crystal clear about

57:10.060 --> 57:11.340
the setup as you go in.

57:11.820 --> 57:15.660
One other brief thought you said, you know, teach the truth and nothing but the truth.

57:16.060 --> 57:20.860
One direction I thought you were going with that was like, when is it fruitful to have

57:20.860 --> 57:24.820
little falsehoods through the lesson with it?

57:24.820 --> 57:30.460
I think one one form of exposition that is potentially really nice.

57:30.460 --> 57:38.340
And the friend of mine gave a name to it of discovery fiction is to try to map out a sequence

57:38.340 --> 57:42.740
of events that could lead to the discovery of a certain topic doesn't have to match the

57:42.740 --> 57:44.540
actual history of how something was discovered.

57:44.740 --> 57:47.860
But often the shape of it is that you come up with an idea that's just flawed.

57:48.260 --> 57:50.140
And then you try to fix it a little bit and fix that flaw.

57:50.140 --> 57:52.260
And then that has another flaw and then you fix it a little bit.

57:52.460 --> 57:53.340
And then that has a flaw.

57:54.100 --> 57:58.380
And as you proceed like this, sometimes it does a good job motivating why very seemingly

57:58.380 --> 58:01.340
arbitrary constructs are put in place to solve a certain problem.

58:01.700 --> 58:06.340
And the funny thing about that process is that through most of the lesson, you're like,

58:06.340 --> 58:11.700
you're describing something that is wrong or something that's not actually useful in the

58:11.700 --> 58:16.340
sense that the construct that's sitting in state in that moment isn't ever going to be

58:16.340 --> 58:16.740
used.

58:16.740 --> 58:18.660
It's just an intermediate step along the way.

58:18.900 --> 58:23.060
So I think trying to adhere too much to making sure that at every single step along the way,

58:23.340 --> 58:27.900
the objects that you're dealing with really work or the statements are fully true.

58:28.860 --> 58:33.900
You know, it's not always helpful to be constrained like that, assuming that you're very honest

58:33.900 --> 58:40.140
with the reader or the audience about where those falsehoods are and why and how they need

58:40.140 --> 58:40.900
to be corrected.

58:41.700 --> 58:42.060
All right.

58:42.220 --> 58:43.460
Other question on the left.

58:43.860 --> 58:44.140
Yeah.

58:44.140 --> 58:48.580
So suppose you have somebody you want to convey some kind of cool fact.

58:48.580 --> 58:49.260
Do you want to talk about?

58:49.420 --> 58:53.820
So I'm sure this is part of your process, but I didn't see it as one of your checks or one

58:53.820 --> 58:54.300
of your items.

58:54.300 --> 58:56.420
So I'm wondering like where this comes in the process.

58:56.420 --> 58:57.780
I mean, presumably has to be early on.

58:57.780 --> 59:01.220
But the idea of what is the right way to think about this?

59:01.220 --> 59:04.580
I mean, this has to be before planning the whole video because you have to decide like, I want

59:04.580 --> 59:05.140
to get to here.

59:05.260 --> 59:06.020
What is the route?

59:06.020 --> 59:10.300
How much time do you spend thinking about what is the right way to think about the final

59:10.300 --> 59:10.700
thing?

59:10.700 --> 59:14.300
And do you actually have that as one of your checks items that you didn't list?

59:14.380 --> 59:18.540
Yeah, I guess I exist in such a fortuitous situation where I choose

59:18.540 --> 59:22.100
the things that I teach, which is not always the case.

59:22.380 --> 59:25.940
And so I get to do this really luxurious thing where I just ambitiously learn about a lot

59:25.940 --> 59:29.500
of stuff and it's only it only ever bubbles to the point of wanting to make a video about

59:29.500 --> 59:34.220
it when it feels like there's that cool thing to show, which is often a slightly different

59:34.220 --> 59:36.420
perspective or something that was at least different to me.

59:37.460 --> 59:40.980
And so in a lot of ways, it's like, it's the zeroth law on that list, right?

59:40.980 --> 59:42.540
It's the thing that makes it get there.

59:42.940 --> 59:47.660
Now, the challenge mode question is suppose you don't live such a luxurious existence and

59:47.700 --> 59:51.140
instead you have an explicit set of things that you're supposed to teach.

59:51.580 --> 59:56.700
You know, I don't think there is like the right way to view it necessarily.

59:56.700 --> 01:00:01.780
But what I have found is, like I said, I really like to play around with visualizations of

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:06.700
stuff, sometimes just doing a sort of brain dead thing to take the important formula and

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:11.740
just slowly unpack what each part looks like has been like more fruitful than I would have

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.340
expected.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.820
So one topic that in a certain sense, I didn't choose to make it.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.980
Just a lot of people were requesting it was 48 transforms.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.500
I'm like, I don't have anything to say about 48 transforms.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.860
But there was a lot of requests and I'm like, OK, what can we say here?

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:30.140
And honestly, the video I made, it was just, I like look at the definition of it.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.300
And I started the innermost part.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:32.380
I'm like, how would you draw this?

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.820
OK, how would you draw how these relate?

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.740
OK, how would you draw these?

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.700
Now that we have this drawing, how would you interpret it?

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.100
How does that drawing change as you tweak this parameter?

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.420
And kind of literally coding it up along the way.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.340
But I don't think you have to.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.980
I think it could have just been a whiteboard sketch.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.860
And the video ended up really resonating with people.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:53.860
And I think it was just a nice lesson for me that there didn't have to be a priori,

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:58.020
some great aha that it was had, that sometimes just the seemingly brain-dead

01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.860
thing where you go step by step with this strong requirement of having an image

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:08.020
in the head for what each part means goes farther than a lot of people might appreciate.

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:12.500
Now, it can only be done on the important formulas because it's such a time-consuming

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.340
process that you wouldn't want for every single thing that comes up in a given

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.300
lecture to be like, oh, and how do we visualize this?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.140
How do we visualize this?

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:23.140
You would just never get anywhere, not just in that lecture, but in the whole course.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.900
But if you're judicious about which parts deserve that level of deep dive,

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.900
I actually think it's kind of a fruitful exercise.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.340
And whatever topic is maybe sitting in the back of your mind when you ask the question,

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:37.420
it's like maybe a fun exercise to sit down and go from the inside out saying,

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.820
just what would you draw if you had to communicate non-linguistically with someone

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.060
to convey the idea over here?

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:46.540
Hi, Grant.

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:47.580
Thanks so much for the talk.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.620
It's very enjoyable and enlightening.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:56.900
My question is how you think that this sort of pedagogy checklist is influenced

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:02.180
by students' desire to learn, because fortunately, you know, speaking of luxury,

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.900
I think it's fair to say that you're in a position where most of the people

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.460
that you get to teach nowadays are people who are there on purpose and they want to be.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:13.180
But we've all had the experience of having to teach students

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:15.420
who really don't want to learn what you're trying to teach them.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:23.420
So how do you think the checklist can maybe be modified in consideration of the fact

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:28.020
that a lot of the time in a university setting or especially in a primary

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.260
or secondary school setting, there's going to be quite a few students

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.900
who really are not interested in learning what you want to teach them?

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.020
Such a good question.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:42.100
I mean, do any of you listen to the podcast An Opinionated History of Math, by chance?

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.100
No, oh, you'll love it.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:45.340
It's one of my favorites.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.860
It's so obscure and like niche, but it's so delightful.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.780
But the author of it has on his website this little manifesto about teaching

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.900
and he lists out like the axioms of learning.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:57.740
And one of his axioms of learning is essentially your point.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.540
Like people are not, how does he phrase it?

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.980
He's so much more articulate than I am.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:06.380
But it's essentially, in order for someone to actually learn,

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.980
they have to want to learn ahead of time.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.980
And so you're right, I'm in a luxurious position.

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:14.580
Although, you know, it is the case that like every YouTuber thinks about,

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.620
how do you bring someone into the topic if they might not have been thinking about it?

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.300
And a couple of the standard things for this, like you try to appeal to a thing

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:25.780
that interested them before they even walked in the room

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.140
or before they clicked on the video.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.620
A loose example here.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.100
I'm not going to claim that things like this will always apply in the classroom,

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.980
but I think maybe some examples do and it's worth inviting.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.460
I guess last year now, I made this video about Wordle,

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.900
which was really on one hand, is jumping on a hype train

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.340
because nothing was more popular on the internet than Wordle.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.940
But it was an excuse to teach information theory.

01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.980
And I can definitively say it reached more people than it would have

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:57.860
if I had said I want to do a lesson about information theory.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.380
And I also think to good effect.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.660
There was one person who told me that it helped him get a job

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:05.340
because there was an interview that he did where a question about Shannon

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:08.860
entropy came up and like he had freshly watched the video.

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.660
He probably would have gotten the job anyway,

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.180
but I'll take all the credit I can get here.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.300
But something like that was, I think, you know,

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.540
maybe a very special example,

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:20.380
but there's probably a lot of different cases where you can find some connection

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:22.300
to a thing that maybe isn't in the zeitgeist,

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.220
but is of a pre-existing interest to the students.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.860
And just letting yourself take a little bit of time at the start of a class

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.700
to let that be a motivating example might go a long way.

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.980
The other thing I really do think clarity motivates.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.980
Like on the one hand, yes, it is very helpful to have someone

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.580
who's already interested in learning and they sit there and they're

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:45.420
they're willing to absorb whatever whatever you're going to give them,

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:46.740
regardless of the clarity.

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.740
But I also think if you if you take the time to have something

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.340
like a compelling diagram to really illustrate what's going on,

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:57.340
that is something that doesn't just feed pre-existing interest,

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.460
but it can generate interest in the first place.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:03.260
And there's a lot of people who've told me that that was the thing

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.180
about the channel that got them sucked in,

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.260
that they hadn't cared about the channel at all before,

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.860
but they started watching it because it elucidated something

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.100
that was a class they were taking or something like that.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:16.340
And so they do feed into each other.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.180
But broadly speaking, I think what you bring up is another excellent example

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.500
of something to sit on the checklist,

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.500
which is essentially, do you have a compelling reason to believe

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.620
that the audience sitting in front of you cares to listen to what you're saying?

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.140
Maybe we do one more?

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:33.820
We better call it.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.380
All right, I will happily stand outside the bar room after to say hello to folks.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.580
But thank you, everyone, for coming and have a great rest of your day.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.460
And as Grant said, he is willing to hang out a little bit.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.380
So maybe you can catch some he can catch some of your other questions.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.660
Thank you so much for being here.
