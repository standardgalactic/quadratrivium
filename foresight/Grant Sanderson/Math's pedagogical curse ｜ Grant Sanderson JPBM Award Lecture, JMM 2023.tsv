0	10160	Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's JPBM Communications Award lecture.
10160	13880	I'm Michael Pearson with the Mathematical Association of America.
13880	20320	We're part of JPBM and I'm really delighted to be able to recognize Grant Sanderson today
20320	23920	with one of this year's communications awards.
23920	31760	That is the creator and founder of Three Blue, One Brown, which is an effort to provide
31760	37360	visualization of mathematics and it's a YouTube channel easily found.
37360	39280	I hope you'll take a look at it.
39280	45120	I had done my homework as I'm supposed to do when I was warned to do this and written
45120	50760	out a nice introduction, which of course I can now not find on my electronic device,
50760	52520	which is supposed to give me that.
52520	61600	But I'll say, as I went on the site and as a harmonic analyst, I've spent a good bit
61600	67240	of time thinking about convolutions, convolution kernels and so forth.
67240	72840	I was really immediately attracted to see what Grant would do with convolution.
72840	75000	He has a nice video presentation.
75000	79040	What's the introduction to convolution?
79040	83920	Some of you may know that the German word for convolution is Faltung, folding.
83920	89320	And I think the video that Grant does with that really sort of makes that dynamic and
89320	93280	shows you why folding is such a great word for convolution.
93280	97200	So I encourage you to look at that one and any others that catch your eye.
97200	103440	In any case, Grant graduated from Stanford University from Math and Computer Science in
103440	105800	2015.
105800	112560	He spent some time working on videos and instructional materials for the Khan Academy.
112560	118040	And then by now, he's turned his full-time attention to three blue, one brown.
118040	120440	And there's some really great stuff there.
120440	123640	And without further ado, I'll let him tell us about it.
123640	125640	Thank you.
125640	132760	Thank you very much for that very warm introduction.
132760	136360	I want to start just by saying a very heartfelt thanks to the members of the Joint Policy
136360	138520	Board for the award.
138520	143600	I will admit it is a little bit intimidating to receive an award for communication and then
143600	148680	to be asked to immediately communicate to a roomful of people I have high respect for.
148680	153040	I'll do my best, but I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the names on the list
153040	157640	for this particular award in past years were just personal heroes of mine who served to
157640	160360	inspire me a lot in getting started.
160360	163760	Things like Steve Strogatz or James Glick or Matt Parker all come to mind, but those
163760	165120	are just a few of very, very many.
165120	168080	So I want to say thanks there.
168080	171920	Broadly speaking, I want to talk about math communication itself and some of my thoughts
171920	173520	around math communication.
173520	176680	But this breaks into a number of different categories, and it's kind of a hard thing
176680	181680	to think about as a unified whole because one component of that is education.
181680	186400	And even that, it feels wrong to loop into a single group because education before university
186400	190880	and math and education undergrad and on have a very qualitatively different flavor to them
190880	194880	and how you might think about what approaches are best or what's the typical engagement
194880	197040	a student has.
197040	200680	And even that is very different from other forms of communication that happen, you know,
200680	205120	presenting one's research or popularization, which is probably the bucket that I fit most
205120	210760	closely into if I had to choose just one that's where I actually sit.
210760	214640	But I do think it's very helpful, whichever one of these slices you find yourself in to
214640	220000	think about them as intersecting each other and a lot of the value coming from that intersection.
220000	223480	Some directions here are obvious, like if you're in education, it doesn't hurt to think
223480	225840	about it as a popularization effort.
225840	228680	If you want to popularize something, you try to make it more engaging.
228680	231360	You try to connect to things that people are already interested in.
231360	234160	It doesn't hurt to do the same if it's in a classroom.
234160	239000	But I also think on the flip side, as someone who popularizes things or at least tries to,
239000	242840	it's often not the right approach to do that head on and think, how can I make something
242880	246960	that's going to reach the most people, you know, has the most click-baity title and the
246960	247960	like.
247960	250400	But what I've noticed is people just want to learn.
250400	254360	The thing that makes something more popular, the thing that gets more reach, as often if
254360	258840	I do something that's meant more as a classroom supplement, because people don't want to feel
258840	263360	like they're just being watered down or talked down to, instead having a sense that what
263360	267040	they're staring at is the authentic material, as if they were studying it and becoming an
267040	268040	expert in it.
268040	270440	I think that's a very inspiring feeling.
270440	275000	So I titled this, Raising the Ceiling and Lowering the Floor of Math Exposition, referencing
275000	279800	the fact that I think some of the efforts that we can make in trying to popularize it
279800	284080	to reach more people can also make it more interesting to those who are already experts
284080	285080	in it.
285080	290600	But if I wanted to be a little bit more provocative in how I went about this talk, I could just
290600	296360	as easily give what I have in mind the name of Math's Pedagogical Curse, because I really
296360	301640	do think there's something strange going on with math, in particular, in contrast to
301640	307400	some other fields, if we think about the perception that it has in the broader public.
307400	311520	I think everybody in this room has probably had the experience of chatting with someone,
311520	313400	cocktail party type environment.
313400	317800	You mention you do something related to math, and the person says, as if there's no social
317800	321600	taboo in saying it at all, which I guess there's not, oh, I'm not really a math person.
322040	326880	Just fair, not everybody necessarily loves the subject that we do, but it's a funny phrase
326880	330600	because you don't say that with respect to other things.
330600	333720	But there's another turn of phrase that I've heard multiple different times, that in some
333720	340400	sense is even more worrying than that one, which is the, I thought I liked math until.
340400	346200	I have a very vivid memory, actually, of being a high school student touring different universities.
346200	348680	And I was one of those students who always knew that I wanted to study math.
348680	350520	I'd already fallen in love with it.
350560	353840	So if I'd meet some students at the university, they asked their natural questions, oh, what
353840	355040	do you think you might want to major in?
355040	357800	I was like, I know, I want to major in math.
357800	360920	And I remember this one student saying, oh, yeah, yeah, I thought I liked math.
360920	363080	I even wanted to be a math major.
363080	367280	And then I took a set theory class, and I discovered that I don't really like math, which is very
367280	368280	sad.
368280	371920	And I've heard variants of this through the years in various different contexts.
371920	374960	Oh, I thought I liked math, and then I took a linear algebra class, right?
374960	379120	I thought I liked math until, and then there's some point in which someone became disillusioned
379120	381240	with it for whatever reason.
381240	385640	Now that one feels like it's especially worth addressing, because it's very hard, I think,
385640	387800	to ignite the light of interest in the first place.
387800	391440	And even if maybe the more important one to address is the broad scope of people who don't
391440	396160	self-identify as math people, we could just as easily ask, what are we doing wrong such
396160	399920	that we get some people that thought they liked math and tell?
399920	402800	Maybe the answer is math is just harder than other fields.
402800	408400	It's just something you got to roll up your sleeves and work hard in order to attain, and
408400	410560	not all people are willing to do that.
410560	413440	I don't think that would be fair, though, because that kind of pushes the bump under
413440	416960	the rug where you have to instead ask, does it have to be that hard?
416960	420080	Is there anything that we're doing that makes it harder than it needs to be?
420080	425120	And I have a little theory for at least one component of what might be going on with math
425120	428000	in what makes it distinct from other fields.
428000	433000	And it has to do, bear with me here, with the legend of King Midas.
433000	438560	So for those of you who don't know, in Greek mythology, or it's one of those kind of intertwined
438560	442880	with fake Greek history that Aristotle and the like would tell the people, you have this
442880	448400	king supposedly who lived around the second millennium BC named Midas.
448400	453480	And he does some good deeds that catch the attention of certain gods, and the god Dionysus
453480	456920	says, I'm willing to give you a gift, name your gift, and I will give it to you.
456920	459520	And Midas says, oh, well, what gift should I want?
459520	462600	I think it would be great if anything that I touched could turn to gold.
462600	464920	And Dionysus says, it is done.
464920	467480	And Midas touches a twig, and it turns into gold.
467480	468480	He's delighted.
468480	472000	He goes back to his estate, and he starts touching all of the roses in his garden, and
472000	474600	they turn into a beautiful metallic sheening gold.
474600	477080	And he's just dreaming of all the wealth that he's going to have, and the wealth that his
477080	480440	entire regime is going to have.
480440	485040	And then when he gets to the banquet for dinner that night, he touches the chicken leg sitting
485040	488440	in front of him, and it turns to gold, and it's completely inedible.
488440	492040	Or in other tellings of the story, the moment that he realizes something might be a little
492040	497400	bit wrong with this gift is when his daughter comes up to him, and he touches her, and she
497400	500640	completely turns into gold, and he doesn't have her anymore.
500640	505160	And of course, it precedes where it's a story of redemption and the like.
505160	511760	But the gift that is analogous to this that I think math has, and it really is a gift,
511760	517080	is a very special kind of exactness where we have the pleasure of knowing with 100 percent
517440	520720	uncertainty if a conclusion follows from the premises.
520720	525520	Maybe not 100 percent, it's subject to our ability to fall for certain logical fallacies
525520	527560	or to miss holes in an argument.
527560	532640	But with as much precision as you could possibly hope for, math has this kind of exactness.
532640	536320	And a lot of other fields would just dream of anything like this.
536320	540760	Hard sciences get kind of close if we think of physics or computer science.
540760	545040	But even then, they're subject to a little bit of controversy with different ways you
545040	550160	might interpret something, or even the best experiments aren't 100 percent precise.
550160	553520	The softer sciences get even further away from this.
553520	557600	Most forms of writing and discourse out there are more unabashedly subjective.
557600	562440	You might think of art criticism, it's not unworthy, but it lacks this exactness.
562440	566200	And the gift that comes from this exactness is that it helps you move forward a field.
566200	570080	You don't fall into the same disputes that you might otherwise when there's room for
570080	573920	ambiguity and misinterpretations.
573920	579920	But I think what it might even mean for something to be mathematical is that it has this level
579920	580920	of exactness.
580920	585200	There's a friend of mine who's a biologist, and anytime we talk she always bemoans the
585200	589120	fact that biology needs to become more of a mathematical science.
589120	594200	Just how far could humanity progress if we could turn biology into a mathematical science.
594200	599560	And presumably what she means by that is that you get a situation where you can draw conclusions
599560	604000	from your premises with the same airtight rock solid rigor that a field like physics
604000	606160	might have.
606160	610080	The other really nice thing that this gets us, I think, is when you're writing something,
610080	614520	like you're writing a textbook or a paper or a video or you're preparing a lecture,
614520	618200	it gives a test for completion that no one else gets to have.
618200	621320	We can have this clear notion of it's not done yet and then at some point there's a
621320	623040	sense in which it's done.
623040	627120	We can go through and you can make sure all of the definitions are completely unambiguous.
627120	629240	We get to have unambiguous definitions.
629240	631480	Nothing else doesn't get to have those.
631480	636520	You can ask whether every object in the theorems that you reference have been previously defined.
636520	638000	It's like a compiler checking code.
638000	641720	You get to go through and the answer is either clearly delineated yes or clearly delineated
641720	642720	no.
642720	646400	And then most importantly for every claim that you make, you can ask was it completely
646400	647640	justified.
647640	651760	And then that constitutes a notion of explanation in some sense.
651760	656640	It gives you a clear point where before you got to that point the paper wasn't finished
656640	659920	or the lecture wasn't finished but after that point you can put a little bow around
659920	661360	it and say it was finished.
661360	665480	And like I said, I really do think it's a gift because it helps us move forward in a
665480	667240	way that other fields can't.
667240	671880	But there's a catch to this gift where in the same way that the things that King Minus
671880	675520	might touch and turn to gold but this had a problem where he wouldn't be able to eat
675520	682040	his food, the mathematician can touch anything, give it this notion of completely unambiguous
682040	683040	rigor.
683040	688880	But sometimes it runs the risk of leaving it, how shall we put it, slightly unpalatable
688880	693880	to the average casual reader or maybe a little bit harder to consume than it needs to be
693880	695880	for a typical student.
695880	701360	And I do want to emphasize I don't think that it's a necessary thing that follows.
701360	705080	I don't want to come across as implying that if something is rigorous that means that it's
705080	706840	not clear.
706840	711720	It's a little bit of an exaggeration to make the comparison with Midas quite like this.
711720	717240	But what I do think is possibly the case is that this allure of such a notion of exactness
717240	721040	where we can actually say that it is done in a certain sense means that rigor serves
721040	725280	kind of as a distraction, right?
725280	729120	I have to tell you, there will be no year that I grow tired of this meme.
729120	734560	I know it's a little bit old, but the staying power with this is just unparalleled.
734560	740760	No, but I think it's the case that a lot of really good authors manage to achieve both
740800	741960	rigor and clarity.
741960	745520	And in fact, the point of rigor is often to add more clarity.
745520	750320	But the thing that I suspect might happen every now and then is that because the rigor
750320	755120	gives you this very clean, nice thing to think about and because thinking about pedagogical
755120	759760	clarity is a lot messier, you know, it's harder to define, you can't put a bow around it.
759760	764440	There's not one point when you've gone from not done to completely done that after scratching
764440	767920	the itch of knowing that something's been written completely rigorously, it's easy to
767920	771240	call a work done when maybe we shouldn't call it done yet.
771240	775520	And there's context where this is maybe okay, research papers come to mind, but in things
775520	780840	that are more explicitly pedagogical, textbooks come to mind, I would propose that maybe it
780840	786640	makes sense to invite into the culture a similar focus that we already have on the rigor of
786640	790360	it, but instead onto something for the pedagogical clarity.
790360	795200	And I'll give an example here, which is essentially just from the book that was sitting on my
795200	797600	desk while I was putting together these slides.
797600	802240	I actually love the textbook, it's really great and one of the only reasons I feel comfortable
802240	806000	highlighting it and poking a little bit of fun at one of the sections is because it otherwise
806000	810120	holds up very well and it's one I would unabashedly recommend.
810120	815640	But I was thinking, okay, you know, how well does the author tend to think about points
815640	819760	of pedagogical clarity in addition to points of rigorous clarity?
819760	823120	And one particular section that I was looking at was about something called the Poisson
823120	827400	summation formula, many of you might be familiar with it, it essentially says for a function
827400	832560	which is sufficiently nice, if you add up the value of that function across all of the
832560	837960	integers, it gets the same thing as if you add up the Fourier transform of that function
837960	838960	across all the integers.
838960	843120	It's kind of a wild formula, very useful in many different contexts.
843120	847720	And the proof that the book gives is actually really beautiful, I liked it a lot.
847720	853600	It starts off by describing a certain function a little bit out of the blue, but if you look
853640	860400	at it, you notice that it has poles at all of the integers and the residue at those poles
860400	864960	are exactly the values that you might want to sum on the left hand side of your formula.
864960	870000	And essentially what the book does is it kind of after handing down this construct and after
870000	874200	describing a certain contour that you might integrate along, and the context here was,
874200	878320	you know, it's in a setting of assuming people are familiar with the complex analysis up
878320	882160	to the point in the book and know about contour, integrals, and the like, it goes through and
882200	886400	shows how you can have a very elegant derivation of the formula basically by unpacking what
886400	890920	this integral is saying and step by step, it eventually turns it into the sum on the
890920	892440	right hand side.
892440	896200	So it's very beautiful, it involves a lot of clever ideas, things fit together nicely
896200	901440	at the end, you can look back on it and I think as a writer, think what more could you
901440	903880	possibly want?
903880	906160	It's as clean a proof as I could imagine.
906160	910520	And I think there's a culture in math textbooks that sort of says once something is proven,
910520	912480	that means it is complete.
912480	918800	But if you try to add a secondary checklist that says what are the pedagogical considerations,
918800	922000	even though I think this is a great book, and even though I think the proof has a lot
922000	925640	of staying power, there are dozens of other questions that I could think one might want
925640	930440	to lead up to this particular fact with or follow it with.
930440	933800	You know, to start off with, you could just say, what is this formula, how do you think
933800	937600	about it, why should you expect that something like this would be true, what are the circumstances
937600	941080	that you might run into in the mathematical wild, where you would think that this is something
941080	943280	that you need to bring to bear.
943280	948240	For example, it doesn't hurt to illustrate just a little bit, like how do we parse what
948240	949560	each side is saying.
949560	953160	The left hand side, which is adding up the value of the function for all of the positive
953160	959080	integers, you could kind of think of as a extremely coarse Riemann sum for the whole
959080	960240	function.
960240	965560	And one of the terms on the right hand side, if you take the Fourier transform just at
965560	969880	zero, those of you who are comfortable with the matter know that that's just the same
969880	972440	thing as integrating the function.
972440	977320	And so what that tells you is that much of the left hand side is already encapsulated
977320	980840	just with the zero term on the right hand side, and you know, the student might then
980840	985080	be invited to think about how all of the other Fourier coefficients give you a sort of correction
985080	990640	factor between the difference of this coarse Riemann sum in the area, and that instills
990640	995000	a little bit of intuition around if you have an especially smooth function, one that stays
995000	998960	very flat, that that would suggest that less correction is needed in comparison to if it
998960	1000800	has high variation.
1000800	1004160	When it comes to the proof itself, while the author gave a delightful proof, there were
1004160	1007800	many steps where, like I said, it felt like it was handed down from on high, and what
1007800	1011280	I would love to see or would love to feel is a sense of how I might have discovered
1011280	1012280	that myself.
1012280	1016520	I think it's hard to understand just how delightful it can be if you as the reader feel like the
1016520	1021320	thing that was coming in is something that you kind of anticipated and that it's validating
1021320	1026080	rather than feeling like you're the one who has to kind of validate that the monument
1026080	1029120	that you were handed does the thing that's being claimed.
1029120	1033480	And in this case, you know, I think there's a longer description, but length isn't necessarily
1033480	1037920	the enemy, that could provide a sort of path of rediscovery for the very elegant proof
1037920	1041440	that potentially could give it even more staying power.
1041440	1047240	Now, what I mainly want to ask through the remainder of this talk is, in light of the
1047240	1052280	fact that we have such a satisfying checklist for rigor that really distinguishes math in
1052280	1057320	which I think draws the attention of the mathematician and the writer so alluringly because of how
1057320	1061360	satisfying it is to go through that checklist and know that something's complete, is it
1061360	1066480	possible to have something that's analogous for those of us who want to popularize or
1066480	1070840	educate or otherwise communicate as clearly as is possible?
1070840	1076040	Is there something that has the same sort of itched scratching satisfaction of, you
1076040	1079120	know, unambiguously knowing that you're there or you're not?
1079120	1083280	It's not a fuzzy realm where someone just qualitatively says this writing vaguely seems better,
1083280	1089200	but is there an actual set of things that we could assign a binary value to?
1089200	1093440	And the reason I think that might be valuable is that, you know, a mathematician instinct
1093440	1096480	is one that sort of likes this notion of definiteness.
1096480	1100040	And so if we can put something a little bit more definite wrapped around the indefinite
1100040	1102520	realm of pedagogy, that might be helpful.
1102520	1105400	So you could probably brainstorm a lot of things that might come to mind if you're doing
1105400	1106400	this.
1106400	1109960	A couple that I happened to write down here is, you know, does each definition that
1109960	1112440	is written down have a motivating example?
1112440	1115800	You know, a reason you would want to define something like that rather than seeing the
1115800	1122040	examples come after the proof, after the theorem and the like, do the proofs feel rediscoverable?
1122040	1126240	Like I said, it can be incredibly satisfying if a student feels like they knew what was
1126240	1127240	coming.
1127240	1132240	In our together videos, I really try to focus on a path of rediscovery, which makes it longer,
1132240	1135680	but again, I don't think length is necessarily the enemy, as long as you're not being verbose
1135680	1137800	about it.
1137800	1141720	Another very simple consideration, maybe a little bit vague, a little bit hard to assign
1141720	1144920	that binary check to, is does it feel personal?
1144920	1148960	Does it feel like an actual person is talking to you with a little bit of emotion and personality?
1148960	1152720	I think that matters when it comes to how engaged someone is with something, and when
1152720	1156040	you're more engaged, you remember things better.
1156040	1158440	Another simple one, just are there diagrams?
1158440	1160960	If something should be illustrated, is it illustrated?
1160960	1165000	This is one that's very near and dear to my heart, as I'll get to in a moment.
1165000	1167560	But there's all sorts of other things you might do, and I would actually be curious
1167560	1171240	what anyone else in the audience thinks could be added to this checklist.
1171240	1176600	What I wanted to do for the remainder is talk through a couple points that I try to think
1176600	1181320	about as I'm putting together a piece of exposition, or putting together a video.
1181320	1182840	It's not a complete checklist.
1182840	1186080	I don't think there exists such a thing as a checklist for pedagogy in quite the same
1186080	1188080	way that there's a checklist for rigor.
1188080	1192440	But I do think if we try to invite that into the culture of math exposition, the attempt
1192440	1195760	to write down such a checklist could go a long way.
1195760	1201240	So the channel that I run, for those of you unfamiliar, it's called Three Blue and Brown.
1201240	1206760	And in a nutshell, the premise is to give lessons that are as visualized as I possibly
1206760	1211040	can make them, not in a way that's superfluous, not in a way that has flashiness for the sake
1211040	1213400	of production quality flashiness.
1213400	1217600	But instead, for a given topic, just make sure that each statement that's made, if it
1217600	1222200	makes sense to, has some kind of diagram that went along with it, or some kind of animation.
1222200	1226680	Now part of this is because, as a hobby, one of the things I delight in is programming
1226680	1228000	math animations.
1228000	1232040	So this was sort of a love child between two different interests of mine, which is teaching
1232040	1235840	math and then programming animations.
1235840	1240920	But just to give a little bit of an illustration of what I have in mind, and then to also try
1240920	1246480	to argue why sometimes making visuals like this isn't just a chore for the sake of adding
1246480	1250240	more pizzazz to a lesson, but it can make it more interesting for the person putting
1250240	1252120	together the lesson.
1252120	1256240	I wanted to look at a video where the reason I made it was because of the visualizations
1256240	1257640	I was playing around with.
1257640	1261720	It wasn't that I wrote a script and then I started putting some kind of cartoon to the
1261720	1262720	script.
1262720	1266120	It's instead that I was playing around with trying to visualize something, and then by
1266120	1270600	seeing it in a certain way, it gave me the framing for how I wanted to describe it to
1270600	1271840	others.
1271840	1278280	So the topic was the Riemann's data function, and in particular analytic continuation.
1278280	1282360	And I opened the video with the usual motivations you might give for the Riemann's data function,
1282360	1286560	the status that the Riemann hypothesis has, that it contains information relevant to the
1286560	1288000	primes, all of that.
1288000	1293240	But the meet was to simply answer the question for a casual viewer who's kind of interested
1293240	1297400	in math, but don't necessarily want to assume they know too much already.
1297400	1298400	What is it?
1298400	1300040	What is this function?
1300040	1304600	Which is, of course, a surprisingly intricate question to answer.
1304600	1310200	And half of the answer is not that hard, which is to look at a certain sum that defines
1310200	1314520	it where you take zeta of s defined to be 1 over 1 to the s, plus 1 over 2 to the s,
1314520	1316760	plus 1 over 3 to the s, on and on.
1316760	1320720	So for example, an especially fun value to plug in here is something like 2, where you're
1320720	1325800	adding up 1, plus 1 fourth, plus 1 ninth, plus 1 sixteenth, on and on and on.
1325800	1327800	The sum actually converges.
1327800	1332120	It was, you know, for one period in history, a problem that nobody in Europe could seem
1332120	1335680	to figure out how to solve until one day Euler said, ah, I think I know the answer.
1335680	1339840	It's pi squared over 6, which is delightful and surprising, and there's a lot of very
1339840	1342440	fun reasons why that comes about.
1342440	1346320	But for our purposes, we don't really care about the connection to the circle or the
1346320	1349680	interesting discussions that you could have around the sum.
1349680	1353320	It's just that this is an example of a value of this sum.
1353320	1355400	It converges in this particular case.
1355400	1360200	And if you plug in some other exponents into that instead of 2, you can get things that
1360200	1364160	converge faster or things that converge slower.
1364160	1368640	It's a fun exercise just in calculus to ask what's the condition for whether it converges
1368640	1370920	or not.
1370920	1376040	And all around it, it makes sense when you have s bigger than 1 that this thing would
1376040	1379840	mean something because you have a bunch of terms that are getting smaller.
1379840	1384880	But if the casual reader were to be very inspired by something like the lore surrounding the
1384880	1389640	Riemann hypothesis and they find themselves on the Wikipedia page or they're poking around,
1389640	1393640	one of the things they might find is that sometimes into this function, negative values
1393640	1394640	are plugged in.
1394640	1397480	And if they go back and they reference the definition, they're like, hang on, okay, what
1397480	1398480	would that mean?
1398480	1402680	I see that zeta of negative 1 is negative 112, but that doesn't make sense because it's
1402680	1406520	got 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 and something that gets bigger and bigger.
1406520	1410600	And then they go and they make videos about the sum of the natural numbers equaling negative
1410600	1411600	112.
1411600	1414960	Then everyone gets mad at them and there's a whole kerfuffle.
1414960	1420800	You want to sit back and say, okay, okay, what is the actual statement being made here?
1420800	1425960	And for that, you can't have the discussion unless before you get to negative values, you
1425960	1430120	talk a little bit about positive value, sorry, complex values.
1430480	1434760	I suppose you can, but the usual path is going through complex analysis.
1434760	1439040	So we'll think of it as a mapping, you know, for every input, I'm going to draw the inputs
1439040	1442320	with a little yellow dot here and then the output of the function I'm drawing with a
1442320	1443640	little green dot here.
1443640	1447080	So the input 2 goes to the output pi squared over 6.
1447080	1450680	And the question is, if we extend our notion of, hey, what are all the possible inputs?
1450680	1455560	And instead we ask, what would happen if I plugged in complex values?
1455560	1459880	So maybe I plug in something like 2 plus i, then what does that mean?
1460640	1464640	Now, this is the kind of thing that, assuming you have a high school level of algebra, it
1464640	1468040	looks a little intimidating at first, but it's not too much to parse and go through step
1468040	1472240	by step and say, we can, again, with the aid of visuals, really understand what's being
1472240	1473240	said here.
1473240	1478800	Because if you take 1 half to the power 2 plus i, that's something that, assuming power
1478800	1484720	rules work the same way with complex numbers, as you've learned they do with real numbers,
1484720	1489000	you understand half of it, you understand the 1 half to the power 2 part, and the only
1489040	1493320	other thing to really explain is what it means to raise something to an imaginary power.
1493320	1496560	And this is something that, at this point on the channel, I had freshly made a video
1496560	1501920	on, so it had a nice lead-in for any people who are regular viewers, where the upshot,
1501920	1506080	of course, is if you parameterize that exponent and you say, okay, maybe instead of plugging
1506080	1511880	in i, I imagine plugging in all other possible imaginary numbers, the output that I get,
1511880	1513160	it's somewhere on a unit circle.
1513160	1517720	And as I kind of move around that input, up and down on the imaginary line, the output
1517720	1520600	kind of wanders around that circle, rotating.
1520600	1526000	And it does so with a constant rate, if you're moving the yellow dotted constant rate.
1526000	1530080	And the only thing to think about, for the sake of the sum that we're going to do, is
1530080	1533960	the fact that if it wasn't 1 half that sits at the base there, but instead you had something
1533960	1538080	like 1 ninth, you're playing the same game, you're mapping the real, the imaginary line
1538080	1540960	onto the circle, but it moves a little bit faster.
1540960	1544400	So for a particular imaginary number that you plug in, it will have rotated a little
1544400	1545680	bit more.
1545680	1549840	And this gives such a satisfying way to think about the sum that we started with, where
1549840	1556960	let's say initially you picture a nice real number input, like our friend 1 half, or 1
1556960	1560600	plus a fourth, plus a ninth on and on, and you think of each of those terms as a little
1560600	1566080	vector or just a little line with a relevant length, then when you add some kind of imaginary
1566080	1570680	part to that input, the lengths don't change, those all stay the same, so they're kind of
1570680	1575080	like rigid lines, but each one of them rotates a little bit differently.
1575080	1578360	And for each successive term, they rotate a little bit more, so what you end up with
1578360	1579880	is a spiral.
1579880	1583440	And because the first one that you started with, where all those lines were kind of stretched
1583440	1588160	out as far as they could be, if that converged, then certainly as you're spiraling it like
1588160	1591560	this, you would expect it to also converge.
1591560	1595840	So there's going to be some value, some complex number on the plane that is this output.
1595840	1600080	And here I got to just have a little bit too much fun after I properly written the program
1600080	1604040	and say, okay, if we just grab that yellow dot corresponding to our input, and we move
1604080	1608680	it around the plane and say, for various other inputs, what does this spiral sum look like?
1608680	1612200	You can just see what the corresponding output would be.
1612200	1617800	And most importantly, you can be reassured that it'll have some kind of meaningful output
1617800	1622960	as long as the original sum converged, which in our case basically means as long as the
1622960	1626120	real part of what you're starting with was bigger than one.
1626120	1631400	And so if we're thinking about what is this function, unambiguous, very happy, there's
1631440	1635080	nice convergence and it makes sense when the real part is bigger than one.
1635080	1638880	For the other part, it doesn't make as much sense yet.
1638880	1644400	But on the way to getting there, visualization can help just a little bit to nudge our minds
1644400	1648520	into something we might want to think about, where what I'm going to do is say, what if
1648520	1652840	we take not just one of the values that I could input in the right half of the plane,
1652840	1653840	what if we take all of them?
1653840	1657240	I'm going to take every single one of them, and then I'm going to pump them through a
1657240	1661380	program that's going to spit out the corresponding output, and I'm going to animate the movement
1661380	1663380	between input and output.
1663380	1666700	And I won't do it for literally everyone, because that'll be dense in filling the plane.
1666700	1670500	But I'll put these grid lines up and then animate each point on those grid lines to
1670500	1674340	kind of represent what's going to happen to everything.
1674340	1677900	And this is one of the things where I had studied this, I had learned about the zeta
1677900	1679500	function, I had thought about it.
1679500	1681380	I didn't really know what was going to happen.
1681380	1685100	I didn't really know what this would look like afterwards.
1685100	1690500	One of the things that, sorry, go forward, is helpful to do is add a little bit more
1690500	1693300	density around the input one.
1693300	1697060	Those of you in the know might think about why you have to add some density around that
1697060	1698580	particular point.
1698580	1702980	And what comes out is basically the whole reason that I decided to make the video.
1702980	1707060	I hadn't necessarily been thinking of covering the Riemann zeta function or talking about
1707060	1709540	analytic continuation or anything like that.
1709540	1714060	But once you see this and you actually map all of the inputs, the whole diagram is just
1714060	1719700	sort of screaming at you how strange it is that there's an abrupt stop, right?
1719700	1724260	You can look at this and say, okay, there seems to be this line where everything stops.
1724260	1728220	And one of the very fun things about this is there's all sorts of questions that I think
1728220	1732860	someone could ask if they're watching this that go way beyond anything that the video
1732860	1737460	talks about that can keep the interest even if it's an expert who feels very well familiar
1737460	1738740	with this concept.
1738740	1742220	For example, you could ask, where is that line?
1742220	1744900	Eyeballing it, you might guess that it's around 0.5.
1744900	1749060	The actual answer is it's around Euler's constant, so it's a little above 0.5.
1749060	1750940	You can ask, why is that the case?
1750940	1752780	Why does it look like a straight line at all?
1752780	1754260	Is it actually a straight line?
1754260	1758620	Now, I don't need to ask those questions, but the point I want to make is just that in
1758620	1763660	trying to visualize it, motivated by making it clearer for the broader public or clearer
1763660	1768420	for a new student, I think the act of doing that also raises the ceiling.
1768420	1772260	Done right, it actually makes it more interesting to someone who feels already familiar with
1772260	1774020	the concept.
1774020	1777660	So the way that the lesson proceeds from here is to essentially point out that because there's
1777700	1782940	this abrupt stop, this whole function seems like it's asking to be continued in some way,
1782940	1789460	that maybe it's defined well using this sum for some of the complex numbers, but we might
1789460	1794020	have a conditional definition that says beyond those, it equals something else.
1794020	1796500	And the question is, what should that something else be?
1796500	1800980	And so if we imagined kind of filling in the rest of the grid, I can preview what that
1800980	1807460	something else ends up looking like, and it does have a kind of local symmetry, I should
1807500	1812300	say, one thing that's potentially misleading about the image is that it insinuates a kind
1812300	1817180	of symmetry entirely left and right on this, but later on in the video, I draw out more
1817180	1820820	extensions of the lines to show that's not quite the case.
1820820	1825820	And this lends itself to just talking about something which is very peculiar to complex
1825820	1831860	functions that if a student hadn't been studying, it would be a fun novel fact, which is that
1831860	1835780	in a certain sense, even though it feels like you should have a lot of degrees of freedom
1835860	1840380	for what that continuation would be, you just kind of draw the function to do whatever you
1840380	1842940	want it to do for all of those other inputs.
1842940	1846860	While that is true, if all you care about is defining some kind of function, or if all
1846860	1852980	you do care about is constraining it by being continuous, say, what's surprising, and the
1852980	1856540	fun fact to talk about, and can be kind of an upshot of the video that hopefully has
1856540	1860540	a little bit of staying power, is that if you want to constrain that your function has
1860540	1865860	a derivative everywhere, that that actually, if there's an extension at all, locks you
1865860	1870900	into only one choice, which is, of course, one of the fundamental intuitions under complex
1870900	1876180	analysis is how rigid the functions feel in contrast to real functions.
1876180	1882380	And from there, again, it's like if the constraint placed on describing math is to try to visualize
1882380	1886900	everything that's being said, this sentence kind of doesn't cut it, you know, if I really
1886940	1891460	want it to go far, you don't just say derivative, we have to visualize what a derivative means
1891460	1892820	in this context.
1892820	1896260	And so the remainder of the video essentially does that, talks about notions of conformal
1896260	1900140	mappings and what the intuition is for how you would think about whether something is
1900140	1904660	derivative or not, and the fact that completing this diagram is a sort of infinite continuous
1904660	1909100	jigsaw puzzle where every pair of lines that started off at a certain angle, you want them
1909100	1912140	to continue to have that angle and the like.
1912140	1916100	And all of this is just to mention one of the things that I like to keep in mind in
1916100	1920420	the checklist, which is maybe a little peculiar to my case because I've kind of gone hard
1920420	1924860	on this end of try to visualize every single thing, but which I think, taken a little bit
1924860	1929540	more softly, can be mapped to math exposition a little bit more broadly, which is to just
1929540	1935460	ask are the core ideas given diagrams, you know, another, it sounds simple, but I think
1935460	1936460	it can go so far.
1936460	1942300	There's another example that comes to mind where a friend of mine named Michael Nielsen,
1942300	1947940	when he was a grad student, wrote what then became like one of the Bibles of quantum computing
1947940	1952540	as far as textbooks are concerned, and he wrote it with a collaborator, Isaiah Chuang,
1952540	1955660	and I was asking him what the collaboration process was like with that.
1955660	1959580	And Nielsen is a very like a textual learner and thinker, and he would say he would just
1959580	1964620	kind of go and just write out a whole bunch of text and descriptions essentially procrastinating
1964620	1969260	from his thesis is the way that he wrote this textbook, which is absurd if you know the textbook
1969300	1971060	at all.
1971060	1974380	And then he would send them along to his collaborator, Chuang, who would then point out, oh, this
1974380	1978180	needs a diagram, this needs a diagram, and basically point out and then often fill out
1978180	1980500	the points that needed some kind of illustration.
1980500	1982180	And the medley was something very beautiful.
1982180	1986700	And I think that having a two person team like that enabled them to have this forcing
1986700	1990460	function where maybe Michael would have been a little bit less willing to write certain
1990460	1993660	sections if he had also been thinking about the effort that was going to be required to
1993660	1995780	illustrate every single one of them.
1995820	1999860	But with the mind free from having to think about that for himself and someone else taking
1999860	2004020	care of that, it felt like less of a chore maybe.
2004020	2008100	But again, I do kind of want to emphasize that even though it takes time to put together
2008100	2009780	visuals, you know, it doesn't have to.
2009780	2014140	I think just a pencil sketch or something simple in like whatever illustration software
2014140	2019340	is your favorite that doesn't have to be precise, it can be a simple sketch can go a long way.
2019340	2022740	These don't have to be something that's purely for the student.
2022740	2027260	I think that selfishly on the part of whoever's writing, say writing the textbook or putting
2027260	2032340	together a lecture or putting together a video, sometimes the visuals that you make actually
2032340	2034700	elicit new intuitions.
2034700	2039260	And the act of doing so, at least in my case, many, many times has deepened my own understanding
2039260	2040260	of something.
2040260	2045340	I feel fairly comfortable projecting that for others it stands to do the same.
2045340	2049380	This might be particular to programmatic animations more so than a lot of other things.
2049380	2052460	But I think almost everyone's familiar with the fact that when you're just trying to think
2052460	2056100	of something while lying on the couch, somehow it's dramatically less clear than when you
2056100	2060300	go to a whiteboard or you actually pull out your notes and then try to sketch something
2060300	2061540	related to it.
2061540	2065620	And letting it be something that's not just a nice to have, but instead sits inside a checklist
2065620	2070340	of what does it mean for my piece to even be done, I think can help force that to come
2070340	2072500	about a little bit more.
2072500	2077020	Now the next thing that I like to think about, and this is one where, by the way, every single
2077020	2081500	time I do a first draft of something, I violate the principle that I'm about to describe and
2081540	2084300	I have to go and realize, oh, wait, no, I should apply this principle.
2084300	2087940	There's something bizarrely unnatural about it, but I really do think it helps to make
2087940	2088940	things clearer.
2088940	2093580	To illustrate it, I'm going to talk about a much simpler piece of math, and instead of
2093580	2098180	doing zeta function type stuff, we're going to go to simple algebra, and I mean like normal
2098180	2101780	high school, middle school algebra, not abstract.
2101780	2105340	And I want you to kind of put yourself back in the state of mind whenever it is the case
2105340	2110740	that you were first learning, just basic algebra, whatever age you were, whatever class you
2110780	2116580	might have been in, and I'm going to paint two potential classes, and I want you to just
2116580	2122140	think about how much does each of those classes resonate with this imagined past version of
2122140	2125540	yourself that's sitting there learning it for the first time.
2125540	2128620	So the way that class A proceeds is like this.
2128620	2133620	The teacher starts by asking all of the students, can anyone factor the number 35 for me?
2133620	2136980	And actually, I'll do this, why not, anyone in the audience, you want to shout out the
2137020	2139020	factors of 35?
2139020	2141820	Five and seven, excellent.
2141820	2147820	Now, the teacher then asks the students, can anyone please factor the number 143 for me?
2147820	2153820	So, because this is a room full of mathematicians, everyone immediately shouts 11 times 13, which
2153820	2157380	is fun, but the students, you know, maybe they think about it a little bit more, they
2157380	2161340	check whether various numbers go into it, and the one that does their little long division
2161340	2164660	with the 11, they raise their hand with a little bit more time than this crowd would
2164660	2166500	and says 11 times 13.
2166500	2170820	So then the teacher asks, can anyone factor 3599?
2170820	2178740	Now this is a fun room to do it in, so 59 times 61, great.
2178740	2183380	This does not happen in middle schools.
2183380	2189980	Although I was recently doing something where I brought up this example in a room full of
2189980	2194380	high schoolers and there was one student who said it, he said the answer, he said it's
2194500	2201500	59 times 61, and there was an audible gasp from the whole room, because it's absurd if
2201700	2203820	you think about it factoring the normal way.
2203820	2206780	But the teacher says, you know, there's a reason that I led into it the way that I did,
2206780	2211220	and the teacher invites the students to think about how 35 is very close to a square number,
2211220	2214900	it's so close to something round, it's close to six times six, and it maybe doesn't feel
2214900	2218700	like a coincidence that the two factors are also close to six.
2218700	2222740	It looks kind of like six times six, but you just nudged one up, you nudged one down.
2222780	2228540	Similarly, 143, it's very close, it's just one less than a square number, namely 12 times 12,
2228540	2231580	and it's not a coincidence that the factors, if you kind of squint your eyes, also look
2231580	2232780	like 12 times 12.
2232780	2237660	So if you're just pattern matching, then you might guess that the factor should look something
2237660	2241380	like 60 times something like 60, and if it followed the same exact pattern, it would be
2241380	2243220	one more and one less.
2243220	2248140	And, you know, the teacher wants, they can go through a couple other examples like this,
2248140	2252260	start to convince the class that maybe, just maybe, this kind of wild fact is true,
2252260	2256660	and it lets you look like that person who can receive an audible gas from all
2256660	2259620	of your classmates for being able to factor a number, which is very fun.
2259620	2263980	And then the teacher can draw out a diagram to help explain what's going on,
2263980	2268660	where if you imagine, you know, what does a square number mean, like six squared in this case,
2268660	2272660	you might imagine six by six boxes, and if we subtract one, you're kind of kicking one
2272660	2276620	off of the corner, and if you rearrange this a little bit, what it means to try
2276620	2280900	to factor the number is to try to arrange all of your boxes into some kind of rectangle.
2280900	2284100	And in this case, we can do that where one of the rectangles has a width that's just
2284100	2288100	one bigger and, or the rectangle has a width that's one bigger and then a height that's
2288100	2289980	one smaller.
2289980	2293580	And you can actually generalize this, if instead of kicking off a corner that was just a little
2293580	2299300	one by one square, if you kicked off a y by y square, you can basically play the same
2299300	2302620	game to factor it to look like x plus y times x minus y.
2302620	2306460	And it's very fun, again, this gives you a lot of fun mental math tricks, where you
2306460	2310740	can say things that make you seem like a genius, where someone can say factor the number
2310740	2316700	at 9,991, and you can do it without a calculator, or on the flip side, it's a nice trick for
2316700	2321420	multiplying certain numbers, assuming that you know the square of what sits halfway in
2321420	2323180	between them.
2323180	2328180	So that's class A. Class B starts off by saying, hello class, today we're going to be studying
2328180	2329660	the difference of squares formula.
2329660	2333620	The difference of squares formula states that if we take x squared minus y squared, this
2333620	2337140	can be factored into x plus y multiplied by x minus y.
2337140	2340820	The formula is very easy, it's not too hard to show, because if we expand out the right
2340820	2346900	hand side, you see that you have x squared, we subtract off yx, we add y times x, so those
2346900	2349980	two cancel out, and we get y squared.
2349980	2352500	The instruction really doesn't take long.
2352500	2356380	You can give an example, like if you plug in 1, it gives a nice fact that you can factor
2356380	2359500	something into x plus 1 and x minus 1.
2359500	2363380	And then there's a worksheet that you can kind of work through, which is, this is just
2363380	2367460	a worksheet that I found when I was looking for classes on difference of squares formula.
2367460	2372500	Now, okay, maybe I'm being a little bit unfair, not giving enough personality to the second
2372500	2374220	lesson as I could have.
2374220	2379140	But broadly speaking, if we try to compare what's going on with these two, class B does
2379140	2383580	something which is so tempting to do in so many other contexts in math, which is that
2383580	2385940	you start with the most powerful thing.
2385940	2388820	You state what the powerful thing is that you're going to do.
2388820	2390980	Usually that takes the form of an abstraction.
2390980	2393700	It's the most true thing.
2393700	2395540	It's kind of easier to show in that case.
2395540	2399300	This is part of what we love about abstraction, is that it's just a lot quicker to verify
2399300	2404620	that that's true than it is to try to come up with some reason why a numerical case where
2404620	2408620	you're gathering around a bunch of squares or stones or whatever you're using to concretize
2408620	2409620	it.
2409620	2413980	And even then, the reasoning doesn't cover all the general cases necessarily, because
2413980	2415820	you'd say, well, does it have to be an integer?
2415820	2417180	Would this work with negative numbers?
2417180	2420420	And would it work with complex numbers, all of that?
2420420	2426180	So that's the temptation of class B. Class A teaches using data and examples.
2426180	2429740	And it's not that the abstraction isn't a goal, it is the goal.
2429740	2431500	That's the function of the lesson at the end.
2431500	2435140	And it's not that you want to encourage students every single time that they come across the
2435140	2439380	difference of squares formula to picture in their head a little grid of x by x and y, because
2439380	2442660	sometimes you're just in the middle of doing a bunch of other algebra, and the whole point
2442660	2447500	of abstraction is that you don't have to think about that and you can do it more quickly.
2447500	2451420	But I think for the first time that you're seeing it, if you really want it to land inside
2451420	2456980	yourself, it's more helpful to kind of think in terms of layers of abstraction where before
2456980	2461380	getting to the lesson you have in mind, shift yourself one abstraction layer lower.
2461380	2465300	Instead of, in this case, thinking about variables and letters, think about numbers.
2465300	2468600	And then if you show lots of different examples with those numbers, it's kind of like light
2468600	2472060	bulbs in the mind of the student that are thinking of all those examples.
2472060	2476540	And if there's a certain ineffable character that connects them, the student can kind of
2476580	2480620	think about the things that connect them, the fact that things feel close to squares,
2480620	2486420	or that the two factors that you got are suspiciously close to the square root of the relevant number.
2486420	2490380	And when we did the diagram, in a sense that's an abstraction layer even lower, where instead
2490380	2495260	of thinking of numbers and numerals representing amounts, you're just looking at the amounts
2495260	2498860	and you can see the connection between the numerical facts that got you to feel like
2498860	2501780	a wizard and something more direct with those amounts.
2501780	2506220	And by the time you get to the abstraction, it feels so cool and so powerful because you
2506260	2509620	have a sense for all of the different things underneath that it's touching, all of the
2509620	2515340	different mental math tricks that are encapsulated in such a beautiful and concise formula.
2515340	2519700	It seems a little banal to those of us once you're comfortable with algebra because it's
2519700	2521940	just one identity out of many.
2521940	2526780	But I think reminding students that every identity that you see in algebra kind of encapsulates
2526780	2532020	this whole body of potential mental math tricks or potential statements about a wide variety
2532020	2533940	of little diagrams you could draw out.
2533980	2538060	There's something about that that feels very inspiring, to me at least.
2538060	2542820	Now class B in contrast, it teaches the same topic.
2542820	2548540	It gives you the same ultimate fact and assuming the students remember the fact, I can't imagine
2548540	2554700	that they would test much more poorly, at least if you do the test with this kind of
2554700	2558060	worksheet that they got their practice on shortly after the lesson.
2558060	2561380	I might question whether they remember the formula as well if you ask them five years
2561420	2566020	later or something like that, but if I'm trying to picture what's going on in the kind of
2566020	2570020	depiction of, this isn't literally what's happening in the brain, but you know my schematic
2570020	2574260	for layers of abstraction in the brain, you're just sort of lighting up the one bulb you
2574260	2578220	care about and it's not sitting on something else to support it, it hasn't been brought
2578220	2579220	about.
2579220	2582300	There wasn't a sense that it was answering a question or articulating a pattern that
2582300	2584580	already existed in someone's mind.
2584580	2589260	So this is a thing I like to think about as much as I can where if there's a given topic,
2589260	2593140	I try to draw out what are the relevant layers of abstraction at play here.
2593140	2597380	Now there's not like a universal hierarchy or something like that, but just as an example
2597380	2601460	for what that might look like, at the bottom most layer we have things like quantities.
2601460	2605180	One of the very first things we do when we're teaching students math is to get them to go
2605180	2610620	from feeling comfortable with quantities to thinking comfortably with numerals and eventually
2610620	2612500	everyone gains a certain fluency with this.
2612500	2615500	Maybe there's a couple bumps in the road while they're learning about fractions and doing
2615500	2618940	that, but by and large everyone kind of gets that layer of abstraction.
2618940	2622380	And then similarly at some point instead of talking about numerals, we realize that there's
2622380	2626980	just a lot of facts that are nicer and encapsulated with algebra and symbols and can you just
2626980	2630660	communicate more, you can think more quickly with respect to certain things and it's such
2630660	2633420	a powerful tool.
2633420	2638260	The next layer, it's not exactly the case that functions abstract the notion of algebra,
2638260	2643220	but kind of it's the case that certain, let's say, facts and calculus that you're learning,
2643220	2647180	you draw out with respect to functions where every instantiation of that function that might
2647180	2652780	come along looks like either algebra or some bit of trigonometry or something there.
2652780	2656740	And so you write out your facts about derivatives and integrals and chain rule and the like,
2656740	2662940	not with respect to specific functions, but instead just in a more abstract setting.
2662940	2666740	And again the next layer is maybe a little bit silly to think of as like a definitive
2666740	2672940	canonical one, but there's a sense in which functions are a single instance of function
2672940	2676740	spaces at least, like a collection of functions, an instance of vector spaces.
2676780	2681100	And a lot of the facts that you might have around functions can fit into a more general
2681100	2684500	framework where things like the derivative and the integral you can think of in terms
2684500	2686700	of linear mappings and the like.
2686700	2690420	And of course you keep going on and on and on until people get talking to you about higher
2690420	2693620	categories and it's just a snake that eats its own tail up there.
2693620	2698540	But the point is that whatever layer you're sitting on here, you know, I give an example
2698540	2703780	in a low set of those layers between numerals and algebra, but I think even at higher layers,
2703820	2708900	I just personally think that it's very helpful for the first time that a student sees something
2708900	2714820	to populate their mind with data of a lower layer before you articulate the higher layer,
2714820	2716900	even if the goal is the higher layer.
2716900	2721180	So if you're teaching linear algebra, for example, even though the whole beauty of linear
2721180	2726700	algebra is the generality, the fact that it's not just describing R2 and R3 and the like,
2726700	2730420	but that there's a whole body of things that you can model with vector spaces and then use
2730460	2735380	facts that you've derived very rigorously just from the axioms to come to conclusions about
2735380	2737540	all the different things that could be vector spaces.
2737540	2743300	Nevertheless, the intuition building phase is probably best done if you populate it with
2743300	2744300	a bunch of examples.
2744300	2749700	Maybe it's good to spread out not just from R2 and R3, but certain other examples of more
2749700	2754420	playful, you know, vector spaces that one might come up with.
2754420	2758420	I think one example that comes to mind is just an excellent example to get someone starting
2758420	2763300	to think about more abstract vector spaces is magic squares.
2763300	2766820	And if you teach them the notion of a three-by-three magic square, where all of the columns and
2766820	2772060	rows and such have to add up to a certain amount, you then ask someone how many dimensions
2772060	2776820	is the space of all magic squares and what's the basis for the magic squares.
2776820	2779940	And that kind of question can get them thinking, again, it's very concrete.
2779940	2785460	It's a specific instance, a very specific kind of vector space, but that starts to invite
2785500	2791300	them to think about what's common across the arrows drawn in 2D space examples that they
2791300	2793800	might have cut their teeth on earlier.
2793800	2798660	So with my checklist, I think what this means is I try to ask, are abstractions preceded
2798660	2799660	with concrete examples?
2799660	2805100	And like I said, for whatever reason, this is one that the first draft, if I write something,
2805100	2806380	just doesn't do it.
2806380	2810740	And I think it's because once you understand something, the way you think about it, at
2810740	2814460	least the way I think about it, tends to be from the abstraction down, it's frankly
2814460	2818500	a lot easier to think about the difference of squares formula algebraically than it is
2818500	2823100	to try to think about a bunch of mental math tricks or a grid of squares or anything like
2823100	2824100	that.
2824100	2825420	It's just so quick to verify.
2825420	2828940	And then this goes for a lot of other things where the reason we do the abstractions is
2828940	2832540	because it allows for more mental fluency, but then that often can give us a mistake
2832540	2837700	that it means as you're divulging the topic, the thing that is easiest for you, the expert,
2837700	2841940	is necessarily the thing that is most conducive to a new learner coming in.
2841940	2846740	And so by specifically writing it out and letting it be one of the checks, I think it
2846740	2849900	can shift my lessons, hopefully, to be the better.
2849900	2854700	Now the last one I'd like to talk about is actually something I've only more recently
2854700	2855820	started thinking about.
2855820	2861940	And it's hard to do in videos, and I'm curious about if there's ways to kind of do it better.
2861940	2863940	It's definitely applicable in classrooms.
2863940	2868260	I think done with good writing, it's applicable in textbooks.
2868260	2872180	But one nice thing to illustrate it is a certain study by Manu Kapoor.
2872180	2876100	He even gave a certain TED talk about studies like this.
2876100	2880860	But the one that caught my eye is this paper called Productive Failure in Learning Math.
2880860	2884740	And he focuses on the nature of failure, but to my mind, that's not even the most interesting
2884740	2885740	part.
2885740	2891420	The neat thing here is he has two different classes that he teaches or that in the experiment
2891420	2896060	are taught to a group of middle school students, and the middle school students are segregated
2896060	2900300	into two different groups in class A. They experience two hours.
2900300	2904620	One is an instruction phase and following that is a problem-solving phase, and the only
2904620	2908300	difference with the second class, the only difference is that they flip the order.
2908300	2912500	They did a one-hour problem-solving phase followed by the instruction phase.
2912500	2915980	And the example matters here because I don't think you can do this for any kind of problem
2915980	2921820	solving, but it was a well-chosen problem-solving prompt in the case of this class because they
2921820	2924780	were teaching the idea of standard deviation.
2924820	2928820	And the question that they asked was to present the students with two different basketball
2928820	2933020	players and they give a whole bunch of data over the course of a season of basketball
2933020	2936340	for how many points each one of those players scored.
2936340	2940020	And they were told, Mike and Dave are two basketball players, and an award has to be
2940020	2945820	given to the most consistent player of the two, and the decision has to be made mathematically.
2945820	2950380	And so the students were invited to design as many measures of consistency as they could
2950380	2952500	to determine which of those players is more consistent.
2953140	2957980	It's a very fun exercise, actually, and so the middle schoolers were given 60 minutes
2957980	2961620	to think about this, to look over the data, try to add some things up, use their calculators
2961620	2965100	that they could, come up with some measure of consistency.
2965100	2967220	And a couple things came out of it.
2967220	2971420	One of them is that the students in that second one that did the problem-solving phase before
2971420	2975780	they did the instruction, they reported that the instruction phase was harder, that they
2975780	2977860	were spending more mental energy on it.
2978580	2984180	Now another relevant thing is the number of tactics they came up with, it was a lot higher.
2984180	2988460	There was a lot more variation in the measures of consistency they came up with when they
2988460	2990380	hadn't been taught the proper lesson yet.
2990380	2994820	But the most interesting thing, to me at least, is when they did a post-test on all
2994820	2998900	of this, and they had just questions trying to measure how well the students understood
2998900	3001100	the topic of standard deviation.
3001100	3004860	The questions broke into various different categories, so the ones that were categorized
3004860	3009140	as procedural knowledge, just, are you able to carry out the computation and all that,
3009140	3012660	there wasn't really much of a difference between the two camps.
3012660	3017300	But the ones that the researchers marked as measuring conceptual understanding, it was
3017300	3021860	like two standard deviations higher in conceptual understanding that the second group had compared
3021860	3023620	to the first.
3023620	3027980	And then questions that were marked as measuring how transferrable the knowledge was, were they
3027980	3032420	able to transfer it to a different context, it was like one standard deviation higher.
3032420	3035740	And on the one hand, kind of always have to take a little bit of grain of salt with
3035740	3039980	education studies, and especially if they're small sample sizes and things like that.
3039980	3045900	But to me at least, this one rings very true, the idea that if you seriously engage with
3045900	3050860	a problem before you're told the answer, that that actually makes you engage more meaningfully
3050860	3054060	with the answer once it's told to you in the instruction.
3054060	3057540	So I think probably a lot of people in this room have had the experience of toying over
3057540	3061860	some problem, not because it was assigned for homework after a given class was given,
3061860	3064860	but because for whatever reason, you just were interested in that problem.
3064860	3068420	And then maybe a little bit later, maybe a couple years later, you come across someone
3068420	3072020	who's answering that problem, they happen to articulate exactly the thing you were looking
3072020	3073020	for.
3073020	3077340	In my experience, that answer sticks so much better than the answers that are given for
3077340	3081460	questions that I hadn't yet been thinking about or toiling over.
3081460	3087660	So the third thing that I put on this checklist is, does the lesson start with some kind of
3087660	3089460	motivating question?
3089460	3093820	Like I said, I think that's kind of hard to do with video because you have to invite
3093820	3098420	the audience to pause and think about it, which some people will do, and that's great.
3098420	3102340	But realistically, a lot of people are a little bit more passive in that moment.
3102340	3106700	So it seems like something that's much better done in conjunction with instruction, whether
3106700	3111540	that instruction comes in the form of a video or a textbook or something like that.
3111540	3115820	I think a good author with a textbook can kind of do a lot too, at the very least, proceed
3115820	3122780	the relevant sections with the right questions, maybe even give some stern suggestions to
3122780	3124340	the reader that, no, really, stop.
3124340	3125340	Think about this.
3125340	3128420	If you really want to engage with it, if you really want to remember it, take five minutes
3128420	3131700	to close the book and think about this question.
3131700	3135260	But whatever form it takes, I think when the student has actually engaged with something
3135260	3139420	like this, it stands to make the instruction itself land a lot more.
3139420	3143100	And it's not something I've always done, so that's a thing I've been thinking about
3143100	3146060	more and how I can bring that into the future.
3146060	3150380	So I'm curious, actually, what other people would add to this list and what principles
3150380	3153940	they have for a checklist of pedagogy.
3153940	3157740	And just to reiterate the point, I do think that the reason that it's important to have
3157740	3162940	something like this, rather than just letting it be subjective and fuzzy, is because those
3162940	3167660	of us who are mathematically interested, we have a kind of attraction to the definite
3167700	3174940	and the allure of something that's like exact in the sense that rigor is exact, is so tempting
3174940	3178660	that it can sometimes mean we lose sight of the other forms of completion that are just
3178660	3179900	as worthy.
3179900	3184260	And I also want to reiterate, it's not a statement that rigor and clarity necessarily
3184260	3185700	sit in contrast with each other.
3185700	3188980	The best author is definitely achieved both at the same time.
3188980	3194180	It's just when we care about something like clarity with the same verb that we care about
3194220	3197660	something like rigor, with the same sense of satisfaction that comes from looking over
3197660	3201340	a piece and saying, yes, I can officially check this off.
3201340	3204860	That's something that feels like it's achievable when you're looking for a slight cultural
3204860	3210900	shift, whereas fuzzier descriptions like we need to do better just aren't going to apply.
3210900	3214420	So with that, I'd like to thank you all for coming.
3214420	3219420	And thank you.
3219420	3230420	Well, thank you, Grant.
3230420	3232460	That was a lot of fun.
3232460	3239540	For those of us like myself who grew up in a time when colored chalk was considered innovative,
3239540	3246820	this was a very refreshing and eye-opening look at the ways that new ideas and technologies
3246860	3249580	can help inform our work.
3249580	3255980	And I think the age of digital textbooks and other kinds of interactive things that combine
3255980	3261780	some of the elements you're talking about are going to offer some very exciting opportunities.
3261780	3263900	We do have a little time for questions.
3263900	3269820	We have a couple of microphones in the aisles, and I would invite you to line up.
3269820	3271420	There are come to those microphones.
3271420	3275100	If you'd like to ask a question, I think, Grant, you're up for that, right?
3275100	3276100	Absolutely.
3276540	3280580	I'd love to answer any questions, and I'll stick around outside of the ballroom afterwards
3280580	3283020	if people want to come say hello.
3283020	3286700	I'm not sure what the protocol here is, but let's say whoever is standing there at the
3286700	3287700	mic first.
3287700	3288700	Hi.
3288700	3296060	I just wanted to ask you about in sort of exploring this idea of presenting data first
3296060	3300500	and like this concrete information before getting to abstraction, do you have any thoughts
3300500	3306460	on sort of in that process teaching students that you're not always going to see it, you're
3306460	3310420	not always going to see it the first time, and like getting students comfortable with
3310420	3315940	the idea that math can be hard, and this is an exploratory process that isn't necessarily
3315940	3319140	targeted at getting to the abstraction first thing?
3319140	3324700	Yeah, I think that's such a good point that even if the back of the mind goal of the exposer
3324700	3330060	is that you've set up this stage so very carefully that surely anyone will follow up to the conclusion
3330100	3334860	setting the expectations with everyone that like epiphany is very rare and discovery is
3334860	3339180	something to be cherished, and if it was something that could happen all the time, it wouldn't
3339180	3341580	be as lovely as it is.
3341580	3346140	I'm not sure of the best ways to do that other than saying it in words and just kind of reassuring
3346140	3350700	now and then like, hey, it's okay if you don't see this yet, or maybe holding off from a
3350700	3357220	temptation to use phrases like obviously or like clearly and things like, but it's an
3357220	3359540	important point to bring up, I appreciate that.
3360140	3361100	On the right side here.
3364740	3369740	Yeah, so there's a phrase that I've heard a couple of times, which is when teaching
3369740	3372860	Matthews to teach the truth, nothing but the truth, but never the whole truth.
3373860	3380300	How do you decide at what point, especially if you're teaching younger students, whatever
3380300	3386980	that means, where it's good to give intuition rather than full rigor, how do you decide at
3387020	3389420	which point to no longer be rigorous?
3389780	3390580	That's a great question.
3390580	3396100	I think I think you can always be honest about when you're being hand wavy.
3396860	3400740	You know, Feynman was especially good at this with the Feynman lectures.
3400740	3404540	I know because like physics is an exercise of constantly lying to people less and less over
3404540	3405740	the course of their education.
3406140	3410140	And he did a good job of like calling out the lies as they took place saying this is a
3410140	3411300	simplifying assumption.
3411660	3413060	And I don't think it takes that long.
3413060	3417860	And so you can maybe tip your hat to the fact that there might be certain exceptions in
3417860	3418700	certain cases.
3420100	3425860	Or to the extent that's possible, you know, you you try to limit the scope of what you're
3425860	3430060	saying such that if there is more complexity outside of it, you're just crystal clear about
3430060	3431340	the setup as you go in.
3431820	3435660	One other brief thought you said, you know, teach the truth and nothing but the truth.
3436060	3440860	One direction I thought you were going with that was like, when is it fruitful to have
3440860	3444820	little falsehoods through the lesson with it?
3444820	3450460	I think one one form of exposition that is potentially really nice.
3450460	3458340	And the friend of mine gave a name to it of discovery fiction is to try to map out a sequence
3458340	3462740	of events that could lead to the discovery of a certain topic doesn't have to match the
3462740	3464540	actual history of how something was discovered.
3464740	3467860	But often the shape of it is that you come up with an idea that's just flawed.
3468260	3470140	And then you try to fix it a little bit and fix that flaw.
3470140	3472260	And then that has another flaw and then you fix it a little bit.
3472460	3473340	And then that has a flaw.
3474100	3478380	And as you proceed like this, sometimes it does a good job motivating why very seemingly
3478380	3481340	arbitrary constructs are put in place to solve a certain problem.
3481700	3486340	And the funny thing about that process is that through most of the lesson, you're like,
3486340	3491700	you're describing something that is wrong or something that's not actually useful in the
3491700	3496340	sense that the construct that's sitting in state in that moment isn't ever going to be
3496340	3496740	used.
3496740	3498660	It's just an intermediate step along the way.
3498900	3503060	So I think trying to adhere too much to making sure that at every single step along the way,
3503340	3507900	the objects that you're dealing with really work or the statements are fully true.
3508860	3513900	You know, it's not always helpful to be constrained like that, assuming that you're very honest
3513900	3520140	with the reader or the audience about where those falsehoods are and why and how they need
3520140	3520900	to be corrected.
3521700	3522060	All right.
3522220	3523460	Other question on the left.
3523860	3524140	Yeah.
3524140	3528580	So suppose you have somebody you want to convey some kind of cool fact.
3528580	3529260	Do you want to talk about?
3529420	3533820	So I'm sure this is part of your process, but I didn't see it as one of your checks or one
3533820	3534300	of your items.
3534300	3536420	So I'm wondering like where this comes in the process.
3536420	3537780	I mean, presumably has to be early on.
3537780	3541220	But the idea of what is the right way to think about this?
3541220	3544580	I mean, this has to be before planning the whole video because you have to decide like, I want
3544580	3545140	to get to here.
3545260	3546020	What is the route?
3546020	3550300	How much time do you spend thinking about what is the right way to think about the final
3550300	3550700	thing?
3550700	3554300	And do you actually have that as one of your checks items that you didn't list?
3554380	3558540	Yeah, I guess I exist in such a fortuitous situation where I choose
3558540	3562100	the things that I teach, which is not always the case.
3562380	3565940	And so I get to do this really luxurious thing where I just ambitiously learn about a lot
3565940	3569500	of stuff and it's only it only ever bubbles to the point of wanting to make a video about
3569500	3574220	it when it feels like there's that cool thing to show, which is often a slightly different
3574220	3576420	perspective or something that was at least different to me.
3577460	3580980	And so in a lot of ways, it's like, it's the zeroth law on that list, right?
3580980	3582540	It's the thing that makes it get there.
3582940	3587660	Now, the challenge mode question is suppose you don't live such a luxurious existence and
3587700	3591140	instead you have an explicit set of things that you're supposed to teach.
3591580	3596700	You know, I don't think there is like the right way to view it necessarily.
3596700	3601780	But what I have found is, like I said, I really like to play around with visualizations of
3601780	3606700	stuff, sometimes just doing a sort of brain dead thing to take the important formula and
3606700	3611740	just slowly unpack what each part looks like has been like more fruitful than I would have
3611740	3612340	expected.
3612620	3616820	So one topic that in a certain sense, I didn't choose to make it.
3616820	3619980	Just a lot of people were requesting it was 48 transforms.
3620020	3622500	I'm like, I don't have anything to say about 48 transforms.
3623620	3625860	But there was a lot of requests and I'm like, OK, what can we say here?
3626300	3630140	And honestly, the video I made, it was just, I like look at the definition of it.
3630140	3631300	And I started the innermost part.
3631300	3632380	I'm like, how would you draw this?
3632420	3633820	OK, how would you draw how these relate?
3633860	3634740	OK, how would you draw these?
3634860	3636700	Now that we have this drawing, how would you interpret it?
3636980	3639100	How does that drawing change as you tweak this parameter?
3639860	3642420	And kind of literally coding it up along the way.
3642420	3643340	But I don't think you have to.
3643340	3644980	I think it could have just been a whiteboard sketch.
3645940	3648860	And the video ended up really resonating with people.
3649100	3653860	And I think it was just a nice lesson for me that there didn't have to be a priori,
3653860	3658020	some great aha that it was had, that sometimes just the seemingly brain-dead
3658020	3662860	thing where you go step by step with this strong requirement of having an image
3662860	3668020	in the head for what each part means goes farther than a lot of people might appreciate.
3668380	3672500	Now, it can only be done on the important formulas because it's such a time-consuming
3672860	3676340	process that you wouldn't want for every single thing that comes up in a given
3676340	3678300	lecture to be like, oh, and how do we visualize this?
3678300	3679140	How do we visualize this?
3679140	3683140	You would just never get anywhere, not just in that lecture, but in the whole course.
3683300	3686900	But if you're judicious about which parts deserve that level of deep dive,
3687820	3689900	I actually think it's kind of a fruitful exercise.
3689900	3693340	And whatever topic is maybe sitting in the back of your mind when you ask the question,
3693340	3697420	it's like maybe a fun exercise to sit down and go from the inside out saying,
3698460	3701820	just what would you draw if you had to communicate non-linguistically with someone
3702100	3705060	to convey the idea over here?
3706180	3706540	Hi, Grant.
3706540	3707580	Thanks so much for the talk.
3707580	3709620	It's very enjoyable and enlightening.
3711100	3716900	My question is how you think that this sort of pedagogy checklist is influenced
3716900	3722180	by students' desire to learn, because fortunately, you know, speaking of luxury,
3722180	3724900	I think it's fair to say that you're in a position where most of the people
3724900	3728460	that you get to teach nowadays are people who are there on purpose and they want to be.
3729460	3733180	But we've all had the experience of having to teach students
3733180	3735420	who really don't want to learn what you're trying to teach them.
3736380	3743420	So how do you think the checklist can maybe be modified in consideration of the fact
3743420	3748020	that a lot of the time in a university setting or especially in a primary
3748020	3751260	or secondary school setting, there's going to be quite a few students
3751260	3753900	who really are not interested in learning what you want to teach them?
3754140	3755020	Such a good question.
3756020	3762100	I mean, do any of you listen to the podcast An Opinionated History of Math, by chance?
3762900	3764100	No, oh, you'll love it.
3764500	3765340	It's one of my favorites.
3765340	3767860	It's so obscure and like niche, but it's so delightful.
3768340	3771780	But the author of it has on his website this little manifesto about teaching
3772020	3773900	and he lists out like the axioms of learning.
3774140	3777740	And one of his axioms of learning is essentially your point.
3777740	3780540	Like people are not, how does he phrase it?
3780540	3781980	He's so much more articulate than I am.
3782220	3786380	But it's essentially, in order for someone to actually learn,
3786380	3787980	they have to want to learn ahead of time.
3789300	3790980	And so you're right, I'm in a luxurious position.
3791180	3794580	Although, you know, it is the case that like every YouTuber thinks about,
3794580	3797620	how do you bring someone into the topic if they might not have been thinking about it?
3797940	3801300	And a couple of the standard things for this, like you try to appeal to a thing
3801300	3805780	that interested them before they even walked in the room
3805780	3807140	or before they clicked on the video.
3808540	3809620	A loose example here.
3810220	3813100	I'm not going to claim that things like this will always apply in the classroom,
3813100	3815980	but I think maybe some examples do and it's worth inviting.
3817460	3820460	I guess last year now, I made this video about Wordle,
3820740	3823900	which was really on one hand, is jumping on a hype train
3823900	3826340	because nothing was more popular on the internet than Wordle.
3826700	3828940	But it was an excuse to teach information theory.
3830260	3834980	And I can definitively say it reached more people than it would have
3834980	3837860	if I had said I want to do a lesson about information theory.
3838860	3840380	And I also think to good effect.
3840380	3842660	There was one person who told me that it helped him get a job
3842660	3845340	because there was an interview that he did where a question about Shannon
3846340	3848860	entropy came up and like he had freshly watched the video.
3849300	3850660	He probably would have gotten the job anyway,
3850660	3852180	but I'll take all the credit I can get here.
3852540	3855300	But something like that was, I think, you know,
3856180	3857540	maybe a very special example,
3857540	3860380	but there's probably a lot of different cases where you can find some connection
3860380	3862300	to a thing that maybe isn't in the zeitgeist,
3862300	3865220	but is of a pre-existing interest to the students.
3865940	3868860	And just letting yourself take a little bit of time at the start of a class
3868860	3871700	to let that be a motivating example might go a long way.
3872140	3875980	The other thing I really do think clarity motivates.
3876060	3878980	Like on the one hand, yes, it is very helpful to have someone
3878980	3881580	who's already interested in learning and they sit there and they're
3882940	3885420	they're willing to absorb whatever whatever you're going to give them,
3885420	3886740	regardless of the clarity.
3886740	3890740	But I also think if you if you take the time to have something
3890740	3893340	like a compelling diagram to really illustrate what's going on,
3893740	3897340	that is something that doesn't just feed pre-existing interest,
3897340	3899460	but it can generate interest in the first place.
3900100	3903260	And there's a lot of people who've told me that that was the thing
3903260	3905180	about the channel that got them sucked in,
3905180	3907260	that they hadn't cared about the channel at all before,
3907260	3910860	but they started watching it because it elucidated something
3910860	3913100	that was a class they were taking or something like that.
3913580	3916340	And so they do feed into each other.
3917220	3921180	But broadly speaking, I think what you bring up is another excellent example
3921180	3922500	of something to sit on the checklist,
3922500	3925500	which is essentially, do you have a compelling reason to believe
3925500	3928620	that the audience sitting in front of you cares to listen to what you're saying?
3930140	3933140	Maybe we do one more?
3933140	3933820	We better call it.
3933820	3937380	All right, I will happily stand outside the bar room after to say hello to folks.
3937380	3940580	But thank you, everyone, for coming and have a great rest of your day.
3943980	3947460	And as Grant said, he is willing to hang out a little bit.
3947460	3950380	So maybe you can catch some he can catch some of your other questions.
3950380	3951660	Thank you so much for being here.
