 Certainly! The video you described provides a step-by-step guide on how to install 2x4 floor trusses, specifically focusing on blocking the end webbing and stabilizing the joists. Here's a summary of the key points covered in the video:

1. **Follow Manufacturer's Instructions**: Always start by consulting the manufacturer's installation instructions for your specific truss system.

2. **Pre-made Trusses with Notches**: If your trusses come with notches for a 2x4 to be placed across them, you can nail a 2x4 into these notches using 16D nails from the top cord. You might also nail one or two nails into the bottom cord for additional stability.

3. **Toenailing Bottom Trusses**: For the bottom trusses, you may need to toenail them to the plates. Use 16D nails and consider using common nails, green vinyl sinkers, or whatever is recommended by the engineer or product manufacturer.

4. **End Wall Attachment**: When installing trusses over an end wall, you can nail them directly to the wall or angle the nails if the webbing is in the way.

5. **Center Stabilizing Board**: For spans larger than 16 feet, consider using a center stabilizing board at around the 10-foot mark. This board should be attached to the webbing and can help prevent lateral movement of the trusses.

6. **Blocking Options**: If your trusses are not shaped for direct attachment to a joist, you'll need to use blocks. These blocks can be placed either on edge or flat, depending on your preference and the space available. They should be secured with toenails into the joists and the framing plates.

7. **Attaching Blocks**: You can attach blocks by nailing them from the top or the side. Ensure they are securely in place with nails driven into the joist and the framing plates.

8. **Multiple Nailing Options**: The video demonstrates different ways to nail the blocks, including toenailing from the top or side and potentially driving a nail through the block into the side of the joist.

9. **Product Manufacturer's Approval**: While the methods shown in the video might be effective, it's important to ensure that they are approved by the truss manufacturer or an engineer. The lack of product information available can make it challenging to find the correct method, but the guidance provided in the video may help if such information is not forthcoming.

10. **Final Thoughts**: The video concludes with a reminder to check the manufacturer's instructions and suggests that the techniques demonstrated might be sufficient if no specific product information is available.

Remember, this summary is based on the content of the video you referenced, and it's crucial to always verify the installation methods with the truss manufacturer or a qualified engineer to ensure compliance with local building codes and safety standards.
