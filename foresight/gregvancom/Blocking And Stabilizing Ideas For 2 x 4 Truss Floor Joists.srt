00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's something that might be useful if you are going to use 2x4 floor trusses.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That would be the way to install them.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, before I get started, let's point out that you will always need to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you don't have any instructions then maybe this video will provide you with a little bit more information.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is just going to be on how to block the end webbing, let's say, and maybe stabilize the joist.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Some joists are going to come pre-made like this where they have a little notch in it for a 2x4 that's going to run across it.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is a real common design.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's go ahead and start with this one.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you do have something like this, I would imagine you could put a couple of 16D nails into the top cord and then maybe one in here, maybe two into the bottom.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And might need to toenail the bottom trusses to the plates.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now, you're probably going to have enough room.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You could probably put two toenails on each side.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The toenails in my example are going to be 16Ds.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Whether you use common nails or sinkers, green vinyl sinkers, I will leave that up to you.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Something like this would be up to the engineer or the product manufacturer.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And when you're at the end wall, if you're going to put a truss over a wall, you could simply nail it down to the wall or angle the nails in if you have to.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I could understand because the webbing could be in the way.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Another method would be to install a block on the bottom so you would install the top rim here the same as I just said, except you would be putting a block in here.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now, these blocks might not be necessary because you're going to be nailing the truss down into the framing plates and you might have enough stability.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't see a lot of this where it's blocked, but I remember doing it a long time ago when we installed these every once in a while.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Another view of the block.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, it's not uncommon to find some type of a center stabilizing board, and this would keep the trusses from moving a little bit from side to side.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Something like this would be a great benefit, especially on spans.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you have a span larger than 16 foot, I would imagine you would need something like this.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you have a 20 footer, let's say you put one in the middle at 10 foot and of course it would attach to the webbing here.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The vertical, any of the vertical members, just giving you an idea of how I would nail it.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I would try and nail it to the to the webbing and then into the top cord and whether you just use one nail on each side, that would be up to you instead of two nails as I'm looking at it here.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And of course it would just run all the way down the center of the vertical webbing.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So this right here, I'd give you an idea how to install trusses like these and block them.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But what if they aren't shaped like that?

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you're not going to have a joist that you can nail a two by four to the face of it, then you're going to need to put blocks in between them.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I'm just kind of giving you an idea how I would nail them to the truss joists.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And again, these bottom blocks might not be necessary.

34
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You might not need these.

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can affirmally attach these to the framing plates with a couple of toenails on each side.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But if you are going to give you a couple of different choices here, you can run them on the side here, put them on edge.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And of course just toenail them into the joist.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This you can toenail them into the framing plates and then put a toenail going into the joist.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go to the other side.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's change directions.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Put the blocks in flat.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And this is actually why I'm making the video.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Someone had a question.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How in the heck do you put these in?

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And so hopefully it helps.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And if it does, you know what to do with the old thumbs up button.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Always appreciated.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So here's a flat block instead of a block on the edge.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You could put one or two, I mean two or three nails in between here.

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know if this would require you nailing it to the bottom cord kind of a thing, you know, the blocking here.

51
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Like I said, this just might not be necessary.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So the flat block instead of the block on edge, you could toenail them down from the top

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and toenail them down.

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's go back there.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Got a little carried away.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Or toenail it down here into the side.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I believe I showed it on the other side here.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You could just put a nail toenail on each side.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And of course you can always put two on each side and then drive one down the center like that.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I'll leave that up to you.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And anyway, that is it for the video.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I hope this helps.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I know there are a lot of, I've been getting a lot of questions about these two by four trusses.

64
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And it doesn't seem like there's a lot of product information on it.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You know, I've been telling people to go read the product manufacturers information.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I think they're having a difficult time finding any.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So this one I showed you right here might or might not be approved by the product manufacturer.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But if you can't find any information, the information in this video just might be enough to help you with your project.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So anyway, it is off to the next video.
