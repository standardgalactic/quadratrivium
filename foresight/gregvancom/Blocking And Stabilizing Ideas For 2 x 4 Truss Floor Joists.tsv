0	7000	Here's something that might be useful if you are going to use 2x4 floor trusses.
7000	10000	That would be the way to install them.
10000	19000	Now, before I get started, let's point out that you will always need to follow the manufacturer's installation instructions.
19000	26000	If you don't have any instructions then maybe this video will provide you with a little bit more information.
26000	38000	This is just going to be on how to block the end webbing, let's say, and maybe stabilize the joist.
38000	47000	Some joists are going to come pre-made like this where they have a little notch in it for a 2x4 that's going to run across it.
47000	49000	This is a real common design.
49000	52000	Let's go ahead and start with this one.
52000	65000	If you do have something like this, I would imagine you could put a couple of 16D nails into the top cord and then maybe one in here, maybe two into the bottom.
65000	72000	And might need to toenail the bottom trusses to the plates.
72000	74000	Now, you're probably going to have enough room.
74000	77000	You could probably put two toenails on each side.
77000	80000	The toenails in my example are going to be 16Ds.
80000	86000	Whether you use common nails or sinkers, green vinyl sinkers, I will leave that up to you.
86000	93000	Something like this would be up to the engineer or the product manufacturer.
93000	104000	And when you're at the end wall, if you're going to put a truss over a wall, you could simply nail it down to the wall or angle the nails in if you have to.
104000	111000	I could understand because the webbing could be in the way.
111000	122000	Another method would be to install a block on the bottom so you would install the top rim here the same as I just said, except you would be putting a block in here.
122000	132000	Now, these blocks might not be necessary because you're going to be nailing the truss down into the framing plates and you might have enough stability.
132000	142000	I don't see a lot of this where it's blocked, but I remember doing it a long time ago when we installed these every once in a while.
142000	146000	Another view of the block.
146000	159000	Now, it's not uncommon to find some type of a center stabilizing board, and this would keep the trusses from moving a little bit from side to side.
159000	164000	Something like this would be a great benefit, especially on spans.
164000	170000	If you have a span larger than 16 foot, I would imagine you would need something like this.
170000	178000	If you have a 20 footer, let's say you put one in the middle at 10 foot and of course it would attach to the webbing here.
178000	183000	The vertical, any of the vertical members, just giving you an idea of how I would nail it.
183000	196000	I would try and nail it to the to the webbing and then into the top cord and whether you just use one nail on each side, that would be up to you instead of two nails as I'm looking at it here.
196000	203000	And of course it would just run all the way down the center of the vertical webbing.
203000	213000	So this right here, I'd give you an idea how to install trusses like these and block them.
213000	217000	But what if they aren't shaped like that?
217000	229000	If you're not going to have a joist that you can nail a two by four to the face of it, then you're going to need to put blocks in between them.
229000	235000	And I'm just kind of giving you an idea how I would nail them to the truss joists.
235000	239000	And again, these bottom blocks might not be necessary.
239000	240000	You might not need these.
240000	245000	You can affirmally attach these to the framing plates with a couple of toenails on each side.
245000	256000	But if you are going to give you a couple of different choices here, you can run them on the side here, put them on edge.
256000	261000	And of course just toenail them into the joist.
261000	268000	This you can toenail them into the framing plates and then put a toenail going into the joist.
268000	269000	Go to the other side.
269000	270000	Let's change directions.
270000	272000	Put the blocks in flat.
272000	275000	And this is actually why I'm making the video.
275000	276000	Someone had a question.
276000	278000	How in the heck do you put these in?
278000	281000	And so hopefully it helps.
281000	285000	And if it does, you know what to do with the old thumbs up button.
285000	287000	Always appreciated.
287000	291000	So here's a flat block instead of a block on the edge.
291000	295000	You could put one or two, I mean two or three nails in between here.
295000	305000	I don't know if this would require you nailing it to the bottom cord kind of a thing, you know, the blocking here.
305000	308000	Like I said, this just might not be necessary.
308000	314000	So the flat block instead of the block on edge, you could toenail them down from the top
314000	316000	and toenail them down.
316000	317000	Let's go back there.
317000	319000	Got a little carried away.
319000	322000	Or toenail it down here into the side.
322000	324000	I believe I showed it on the other side here.
324000	327000	You could just put a nail toenail on each side.
327000	331000	And of course you can always put two on each side and then drive one down the center like that.
331000	333000	And I'll leave that up to you.
333000	335000	And anyway, that is it for the video.
335000	336000	I hope this helps.
336000	342000	I know there are a lot of, I've been getting a lot of questions about these two by four trusses.
342000	347000	And it doesn't seem like there's a lot of product information on it.
347000	352000	You know, I've been telling people to go read the product manufacturers information.
352000	355000	And I think they're having a difficult time finding any.
355000	361000	So this one I showed you right here might or might not be approved by the product manufacturer.
361000	369000	But if you can't find any information, the information in this video just might be enough to help you with your project.
369000	372000	So anyway, it is off to the next video.
