1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Going on an extended vacation, where should we travel to?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,240
Morocco and Africa. All right, done deal.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,000
Actually, traveling is one of the few things that I'm not doing. There's a lot going on that

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,840
I've sprinkled throughout some of these videos in the past. Like, this is going to be one of the

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,400
last few videos in this office. Over the next, I've been thinking about two to three weeks,

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,720
Molly and I are going to be gone out of this house into a new house. And I try to share as

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,280
much as possible with y'all. I kind of feel like I have two different lives. I have my YouTube

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,720
software engineering life, which is my full-time job plus YouTube, my part-time job, if you will.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,240
And then I have the rest of my life. Like the fishing, the going out on the boats, the dog,

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,760
a lot of other things that are going on. I've always floated with the idea of either starting

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,920
a whole other channel just so I can kind of post more of non-software development stuff over there,

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,680
or if I want to just start working on integrating a lot of different aspects of my life into this

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,800
channel. Let me know what you think in the comments below. I don't care one way or another. I'm just

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,880
going to try to figure that out. But that's not why most of y'all clicked on this video. You're

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,560
trying to hear about my regrets as a computer science student. If you don't know, last May, so

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,480
May of 2018, I graduated from ODU with a computer science degree. And in this video, we're going

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,920
to go over a few things, quite a few things that I felt like I should have done better, that I regret

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,800
not doing better and things that I would do if I had to do it all over again. And I also want to

19
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,960
talk about a few things that I don't regret. Things that I did and retrospectively looking at it,

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
I did right. Now I'm going to be the first to say that there are more things that I did wrong than I

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
did right, but I figured out, you know, kind of try to balance out the video a little bit. And I

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,920
know I specified computer science in the title. This very well could be my regrets as a college

23
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,160
student, but I wanted to specify computer science because computer science is a hard degree to

24
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,560
obtain. I mean, you have to put in a lot of work. If my major back in college was incredibly simple

25
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,920
or just overall easy, not much problem solving, not much involved work, then I probably wouldn't

26
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,360
have these regrets. So let's get into them. First and foremost, it is treating college

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
like high school. In high school, I didn't have any homework. If I did, I got it done in

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,360
study block or in class or it was very, very minuscule. And in high school, I didn't study.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,840
I didn't feel like I needed to and I seemed to pass the classes just fine. So I didn't do homework

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,000
and I didn't study. I went to class. I did my work that needed to get done in class. And when I went

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,280
home, I went home. I kind of like clocked out of work, if you will. And in college, it doesn't

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,640
really work that way. While high school, you go for let's say seven, eight hours a day, and then

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,520
maybe you have one to two hours of homework at home. For college, you go to class for one to two

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,680
hours a day, and then you have seven to eight hours of homework at home. It completely flipped

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,920
everything around where everything in high school you could do in class. Your teachers were there

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,960
to teach you everything. While college, you needed to be doing everything on your own. Sure,

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,120
you had the resources of your teacher. They just kind of go over things and you have to figure it

38
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,000
out yourself. At least that's how it was in computer science. It's a lot easier to write a paper in

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,680
class or do a math worksheet in class, whatever it may be. Calc one doesn't matter. Then it is to

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,960
write an involved program in class with a language that you need to Google every other thing that

41
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,680
needs to get done in that program. That's definitely, that was definitely a big one. I also regretted

42
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,400
not completely understanding the aspect of computer science prior to signing up for computer

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
science degree and attending the computer science classes. In all honesty, I thought it was more

44
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,760
like a software development degree where I was going to go in, I was going to learn how to code,

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,120
and that was basically, that was the focus and sure I take electives here and there to make

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,600
sure I'm a well-rounded student, but I thought most of my computer science classes were going to be

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:06,240
programming, coding, but it was a lot of theory, a lot of math, a lot more work and a lot different

48
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,720
work than I previously thought and that was my own problem. I didn't do enough research going

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,440
into it. I was just naive. One thing I don't regret because I remember very vividly my early years

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,840
of college, something that helped me get through my college was when I signed up for Angelus. Now

51
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,280
this isn't necessarily a sponsor, but it kind of is in a way for this video. I remember back in

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,720
my early years, I signed up for Angelus. Think of Angelus as a place for startups, tech startups,

53
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,040
or what have you to put their company on this platform and then software engineers, software

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,040
developers, or anyone who would be needed in a particular tech space to put their resume,

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,840
similar to LinkedIn, but for startups and something that I remember scrolling through my

56
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,000
early years of computer science just dreaming about one day, maybe I can get this iOS development

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,240
job. I have a potential to get three to five percent equity and make $80,000 a year and work

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
remotely. I just remember scrolling through all of those things down through Angelus and that really

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,760
helped me drive forward and try to just pursue that dream. And if you're someone who is interested

60
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,920
in just checking out Angelus, if you're interested in being a software developer at a startup,

61
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,160
maybe you are a startup, I'm going to leave a link in the top of the description. It's a free

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,840
for life account to Angelus. You just go there, you sign up. This isn't a free trial. This is

63
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,480
you sign up just like you would be signing up to a social media account and you go from there.

64
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,240
That is a real thing. I'm glad I did simply because it helped me get through to the next step. If I ever

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,240
felt, if I ever had like, you know, the imposter syndrome or just kind of felt like I wasn't good

66
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,120
enough. I just remembered of where I wanted to be. I would scroll through that and then I would

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,240
work in order to hopefully one day get there. Now we're going to get a bit more generic. This can

68
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,920
go for all college students. My next regret is neglecting office hours. Something you got to

69
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,280
understand. While you have, you know, your class one to two hours a day per class and then you have,

70
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,600
you have your homework that you need to get done. When you do your homework or your projects or

71
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,000
whatever the heck you want to call it and you face a problem, especially in computer science and

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,880
you're trying to figure out a problem, stack overflow, whatever else your search engine, your

73
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,400
internet will show you, you need to use your office hours when you've exhausted all resources. If you

74
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,840
can't figure something out, go to your, you're not an advisor, but your professor for that class,

75
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,200
for that project so they can help guide you through it. Make sure you have a decent understanding

76
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,880
of what your problem is. You want to talk to them about the solutions that you've tried and sometimes

77
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,880
you'll figure it out yourself. Like the rubber ducky method, if I were to, you know, talk to this

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,480
globe right here, try to describe my particular problem to this globe, I can maybe figure it out

79
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,320
because I'm trying to formulate words in order to describe the problem at hand. Now that may not

80
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,040
happen and if that doesn't happen, that's where your professor will come into play and say, well,

81
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,680
maybe you got to do x, y, and z and that'll help you get over that hump and onto the next problem,

82
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,480
basically. So always use those office hours wisely because they are incredibly valuable.

83
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,800
You're paying for it. You're paying a lot of money to go to college, regardless of what degree

84
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,480
you have. That money pays for a lot of different things, a lot of which is the curriculum, the

85
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,720
professor's teaching you the stuff, and then your professor's office hours. Just imagine how much

86
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,520
money you're wasting by not using those office hours. Now, can you call something a regret when

87
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,000
you still do it to this day? Like, I regret procrastinating so much in school, but yet,

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,760
even in my own life, on particular things, I still procrastinate quite a bit. I've gotten better at it.

89
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,760
It's a process, but in school, procrastinating was worse. Like, you would be down to a couple

90
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,400
days left or maybe just the night before you have to turn something in, and you get stuck on a bug

91
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,440
or an error, especially if you're trying to write some type of program for a class,

92
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,440
and you can't go to office hours. Your professor probably won't be responding to emails, and if

93
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,240
they are, how many other people procrastinated just like you until the last night to ask a professor

94
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
via email about their problems? All emailing your professor, trying to figure out the problems while

95
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
your professor, they don't have much time. They may be trying to respond to emails at 11 p.m. when

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
your thing is due at 11.59 p.m., but who knows if they're going to get around to you. It's a lot

97
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,920
better in terms of your grades and in terms of how much you'll learn. If you work little by little

98
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,640
on these projects that you have two weeks to complete, if you start off on it on the

99
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,760
second or third day in which it's assigned or even the night of, then you're able to use those

100
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,640
office hours like I suggested in the previous regret. So just make sure you leave yourself

101
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,640
enough time. Don't procrastinate. Don't procrastinate. This is me talking to myself because, like I said,

102
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
and I want to leave this on a positive note with something that I felt like I did right,

103
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,080
and that is getting in on internships early. Like I could have maybe done earlier, but I think it was

104
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,800
the summer after my sophomore year where I got my first internship, computer science internship,

105
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,600
and then that following fall I had an internship, and then the next summer I had an internship,

106
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,240
and then that last year, my senior year, I just kind of did all the work I needed to get done so

107
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
I could graduate. So if you're going to college for anything, especially computer science,

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,800
try to get in on internships early. Don't worry about, I'm not good enough for, like they don't

109
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,760
expect much out of you. A lot of the work you're going to be doing is typical internship work,

110
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,520
something that someone from a computer science degree all the way down to a communications

111
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,480
degree. You're going to be doing the typical intern work like Excel spreadsheets, building

112
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,240
PowerPoint, basically anything Microsoft Office. You could be rewiring a whole entire data center,

113
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
which that's just pulling out plugs and plugging them back in and using new power strips and what

114
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,040
have you. Or your company is going to be sending you over to Chicago for documenting a manual

115
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,800
process in which needs to be automated, but that manual process occurs from 1 a.m. to roughly 10

116
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
a.m. That was another one of mine, or you could actually get a coding internship, and that could

117
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
be, that would be pretty cool too. Just don't be worried. They know you're an intern, you're a

118
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,360
student. They don't expect the world out of you. Just be willing to do the work and ask questions

119
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,520
when you run into a problem. And that's it. Those are my regrets as a computer science student,

120
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,600
and I sprinkled in a few positive things that I think I did right. I know I'm going to think

121
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,520
of something as soon as I hit that publish button on, oh man, I should have included that in the

122
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,000
video. I should have included that. Literally, I've been adding to this list over the past few days

123
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,520
ever since I came up with the idea for this video, and I know I'm going to have so many other regrets

124
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,120
or non-regrets that I had as a computer science student. So in order to fill that void, if you

125
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,480
all have anything similar to what I laid out in this video, leave those down in the comment below.

129
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,240
kind of want to integrate into some of these videos, or maybe have their own standalone videos on

130
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,520
this channel, or if I should just make a whole entire other channel regarding everything else

131
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,560
that's going on in my life. Until next time, guys, have a good one. Peace.
