00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Going on an extended vacation, where should we travel to?

00:05.280 --> 00:08.240
Morocco and Africa. All right, done deal.

00:09.200 --> 00:14.000
Actually, traveling is one of the few things that I'm not doing. There's a lot going on that

00:14.000 --> 00:17.840
I've sprinkled throughout some of these videos in the past. Like, this is going to be one of the

00:17.840 --> 00:22.400
last few videos in this office. Over the next, I've been thinking about two to three weeks,

00:22.400 --> 00:26.720
Molly and I are going to be gone out of this house into a new house. And I try to share as

00:26.720 --> 00:31.280
much as possible with y'all. I kind of feel like I have two different lives. I have my YouTube

00:31.280 --> 00:36.720
software engineering life, which is my full-time job plus YouTube, my part-time job, if you will.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.240
And then I have the rest of my life. Like the fishing, the going out on the boats, the dog,

00:42.240 --> 00:47.760
a lot of other things that are going on. I've always floated with the idea of either starting

00:47.760 --> 00:53.920
a whole other channel just so I can kind of post more of non-software development stuff over there,

00:53.920 --> 00:59.680
or if I want to just start working on integrating a lot of different aspects of my life into this

00:59.680 --> 01:04.800
channel. Let me know what you think in the comments below. I don't care one way or another. I'm just

01:04.800 --> 01:08.880
going to try to figure that out. But that's not why most of y'all clicked on this video. You're

01:08.880 --> 01:14.560
trying to hear about my regrets as a computer science student. If you don't know, last May, so

01:14.560 --> 01:20.480
May of 2018, I graduated from ODU with a computer science degree. And in this video, we're going

01:20.480 --> 01:25.920
to go over a few things, quite a few things that I felt like I should have done better, that I regret

01:25.920 --> 01:30.800
not doing better and things that I would do if I had to do it all over again. And I also want to

01:30.800 --> 01:36.960
talk about a few things that I don't regret. Things that I did and retrospectively looking at it,

01:36.960 --> 01:41.520
I did right. Now I'm going to be the first to say that there are more things that I did wrong than I

01:41.520 --> 01:45.520
did right, but I figured out, you know, kind of try to balance out the video a little bit. And I

01:45.520 --> 01:51.920
know I specified computer science in the title. This very well could be my regrets as a college

01:51.920 --> 01:56.160
student, but I wanted to specify computer science because computer science is a hard degree to

01:56.160 --> 02:00.560
obtain. I mean, you have to put in a lot of work. If my major back in college was incredibly simple

02:00.560 --> 02:05.920
or just overall easy, not much problem solving, not much involved work, then I probably wouldn't

02:05.920 --> 02:11.360
have these regrets. So let's get into them. First and foremost, it is treating college

02:11.360 --> 02:15.920
like high school. In high school, I didn't have any homework. If I did, I got it done in

02:15.920 --> 02:21.360
study block or in class or it was very, very minuscule. And in high school, I didn't study.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.840
I didn't feel like I needed to and I seemed to pass the classes just fine. So I didn't do homework

02:25.840 --> 02:32.000
and I didn't study. I went to class. I did my work that needed to get done in class. And when I went

02:32.000 --> 02:37.280
home, I went home. I kind of like clocked out of work, if you will. And in college, it doesn't

02:37.280 --> 02:42.640
really work that way. While high school, you go for let's say seven, eight hours a day, and then

02:42.640 --> 02:49.520
maybe you have one to two hours of homework at home. For college, you go to class for one to two

02:49.520 --> 02:55.680
hours a day, and then you have seven to eight hours of homework at home. It completely flipped

02:55.680 --> 03:01.920
everything around where everything in high school you could do in class. Your teachers were there

03:01.920 --> 03:06.960
to teach you everything. While college, you needed to be doing everything on your own. Sure,

03:06.960 --> 03:11.120
you had the resources of your teacher. They just kind of go over things and you have to figure it

03:11.120 --> 03:16.000
out yourself. At least that's how it was in computer science. It's a lot easier to write a paper in

03:16.000 --> 03:21.680
class or do a math worksheet in class, whatever it may be. Calc one doesn't matter. Then it is to

03:21.680 --> 03:26.960
write an involved program in class with a language that you need to Google every other thing that

03:26.960 --> 03:31.680
needs to get done in that program. That's definitely, that was definitely a big one. I also regretted

03:31.680 --> 03:38.400
not completely understanding the aspect of computer science prior to signing up for computer

03:38.400 --> 03:42.720
science degree and attending the computer science classes. In all honesty, I thought it was more

03:42.720 --> 03:47.760
like a software development degree where I was going to go in, I was going to learn how to code,

03:47.760 --> 03:53.120
and that was basically, that was the focus and sure I take electives here and there to make

03:53.120 --> 03:57.600
sure I'm a well-rounded student, but I thought most of my computer science classes were going to be

03:57.680 --> 04:06.240
programming, coding, but it was a lot of theory, a lot of math, a lot more work and a lot different

04:06.240 --> 04:10.720
work than I previously thought and that was my own problem. I didn't do enough research going

04:10.720 --> 04:17.440
into it. I was just naive. One thing I don't regret because I remember very vividly my early years

04:17.440 --> 04:23.840
of college, something that helped me get through my college was when I signed up for Angelus. Now

04:23.840 --> 04:29.280
this isn't necessarily a sponsor, but it kind of is in a way for this video. I remember back in

04:29.280 --> 04:34.720
my early years, I signed up for Angelus. Think of Angelus as a place for startups, tech startups,

04:34.720 --> 04:41.040
or what have you to put their company on this platform and then software engineers, software

04:41.040 --> 04:47.040
developers, or anyone who would be needed in a particular tech space to put their resume,

04:47.040 --> 04:51.840
similar to LinkedIn, but for startups and something that I remember scrolling through my

04:51.840 --> 04:58.000
early years of computer science just dreaming about one day, maybe I can get this iOS development

04:58.000 --> 05:04.240
job. I have a potential to get three to five percent equity and make $80,000 a year and work

05:04.240 --> 05:09.680
remotely. I just remember scrolling through all of those things down through Angelus and that really

05:09.680 --> 05:15.760
helped me drive forward and try to just pursue that dream. And if you're someone who is interested

05:15.760 --> 05:19.920
in just checking out Angelus, if you're interested in being a software developer at a startup,

05:19.920 --> 05:24.160
maybe you are a startup, I'm going to leave a link in the top of the description. It's a free

05:24.160 --> 05:29.840
for life account to Angelus. You just go there, you sign up. This isn't a free trial. This is

05:29.840 --> 05:34.480
you sign up just like you would be signing up to a social media account and you go from there.

05:34.480 --> 05:40.240
That is a real thing. I'm glad I did simply because it helped me get through to the next step. If I ever

05:40.240 --> 05:46.240
felt, if I ever had like, you know, the imposter syndrome or just kind of felt like I wasn't good

05:46.240 --> 05:51.120
enough. I just remembered of where I wanted to be. I would scroll through that and then I would

05:51.120 --> 05:56.240
work in order to hopefully one day get there. Now we're going to get a bit more generic. This can

05:56.240 --> 06:01.920
go for all college students. My next regret is neglecting office hours. Something you got to

06:01.920 --> 06:07.280
understand. While you have, you know, your class one to two hours a day per class and then you have,

06:07.280 --> 06:11.600
you have your homework that you need to get done. When you do your homework or your projects or

06:11.600 --> 06:16.000
whatever the heck you want to call it and you face a problem, especially in computer science and

06:16.000 --> 06:20.880
you're trying to figure out a problem, stack overflow, whatever else your search engine, your

06:20.880 --> 06:26.400
internet will show you, you need to use your office hours when you've exhausted all resources. If you

06:26.400 --> 06:31.840
can't figure something out, go to your, you're not an advisor, but your professor for that class,

06:31.840 --> 06:37.200
for that project so they can help guide you through it. Make sure you have a decent understanding

06:37.200 --> 06:42.880
of what your problem is. You want to talk to them about the solutions that you've tried and sometimes

06:42.960 --> 06:46.880
you'll figure it out yourself. Like the rubber ducky method, if I were to, you know, talk to this

06:46.880 --> 06:52.480
globe right here, try to describe my particular problem to this globe, I can maybe figure it out

06:52.480 --> 06:58.320
because I'm trying to formulate words in order to describe the problem at hand. Now that may not

06:58.320 --> 07:03.040
happen and if that doesn't happen, that's where your professor will come into play and say, well,

07:03.040 --> 07:07.680
maybe you got to do x, y, and z and that'll help you get over that hump and onto the next problem,

07:07.680 --> 07:12.480
basically. So always use those office hours wisely because they are incredibly valuable.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.800
You're paying for it. You're paying a lot of money to go to college, regardless of what degree

07:16.800 --> 07:24.480
you have. That money pays for a lot of different things, a lot of which is the curriculum, the

07:24.480 --> 07:30.720
professor's teaching you the stuff, and then your professor's office hours. Just imagine how much

07:30.720 --> 07:37.520
money you're wasting by not using those office hours. Now, can you call something a regret when

07:37.520 --> 07:44.000
you still do it to this day? Like, I regret procrastinating so much in school, but yet,

07:44.000 --> 07:49.760
even in my own life, on particular things, I still procrastinate quite a bit. I've gotten better at it.

07:49.760 --> 07:55.760
It's a process, but in school, procrastinating was worse. Like, you would be down to a couple

07:55.760 --> 08:02.400
days left or maybe just the night before you have to turn something in, and you get stuck on a bug

08:02.400 --> 08:05.440
or an error, especially if you're trying to write some type of program for a class,

08:06.160 --> 08:11.440
and you can't go to office hours. Your professor probably won't be responding to emails, and if

08:11.440 --> 08:16.240
they are, how many other people procrastinated just like you until the last night to ask a professor

08:16.240 --> 08:20.800
via email about their problems? All emailing your professor, trying to figure out the problems while

08:20.800 --> 08:26.400
your professor, they don't have much time. They may be trying to respond to emails at 11 p.m. when

08:26.400 --> 08:31.040
your thing is due at 11.59 p.m., but who knows if they're going to get around to you. It's a lot

08:31.040 --> 08:37.920
better in terms of your grades and in terms of how much you'll learn. If you work little by little

08:37.920 --> 08:42.640
on these projects that you have two weeks to complete, if you start off on it on the

08:42.640 --> 08:47.760
second or third day in which it's assigned or even the night of, then you're able to use those

08:47.760 --> 08:52.640
office hours like I suggested in the previous regret. So just make sure you leave yourself

08:52.640 --> 08:58.640
enough time. Don't procrastinate. Don't procrastinate. This is me talking to myself because, like I said,

08:58.640 --> 09:02.560
and I want to leave this on a positive note with something that I felt like I did right,

09:02.560 --> 09:08.080
and that is getting in on internships early. Like I could have maybe done earlier, but I think it was

09:08.080 --> 09:14.800
the summer after my sophomore year where I got my first internship, computer science internship,

09:14.800 --> 09:19.600
and then that following fall I had an internship, and then the next summer I had an internship,

09:19.600 --> 09:24.240
and then that last year, my senior year, I just kind of did all the work I needed to get done so

09:24.240 --> 09:28.240
I could graduate. So if you're going to college for anything, especially computer science,

09:28.240 --> 09:32.800
try to get in on internships early. Don't worry about, I'm not good enough for, like they don't

09:32.800 --> 09:37.760
expect much out of you. A lot of the work you're going to be doing is typical internship work,

09:37.760 --> 09:43.520
something that someone from a computer science degree all the way down to a communications

09:43.520 --> 09:48.480
degree. You're going to be doing the typical intern work like Excel spreadsheets, building

09:48.480 --> 09:54.240
PowerPoint, basically anything Microsoft Office. You could be rewiring a whole entire data center,

09:54.240 --> 09:58.480
which that's just pulling out plugs and plugging them back in and using new power strips and what

09:58.480 --> 10:03.040
have you. Or your company is going to be sending you over to Chicago for documenting a manual

10:03.040 --> 10:08.800
process in which needs to be automated, but that manual process occurs from 1 a.m. to roughly 10

10:08.800 --> 10:13.360
a.m. That was another one of mine, or you could actually get a coding internship, and that could

10:13.360 --> 10:17.360
be, that would be pretty cool too. Just don't be worried. They know you're an intern, you're a

10:17.360 --> 10:23.360
student. They don't expect the world out of you. Just be willing to do the work and ask questions

10:23.360 --> 10:27.520
when you run into a problem. And that's it. Those are my regrets as a computer science student,

10:27.520 --> 10:31.600
and I sprinkled in a few positive things that I think I did right. I know I'm going to think

10:31.600 --> 10:35.520
of something as soon as I hit that publish button on, oh man, I should have included that in the

10:35.520 --> 10:40.000
video. I should have included that. Literally, I've been adding to this list over the past few days

10:40.000 --> 10:45.520
ever since I came up with the idea for this video, and I know I'm going to have so many other regrets

10:45.520 --> 10:51.120
or non-regrets that I had as a computer science student. So in order to fill that void, if you

10:51.120 --> 10:56.480
all have anything similar to what I laid out in this video, leave those down in the comment below.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.240
kind of want to integrate into some of these videos, or maybe have their own standalone videos on

11:16.240 --> 11:21.520
this channel, or if I should just make a whole entire other channel regarding everything else

11:21.520 --> 11:24.560
that's going on in my life. Until next time, guys, have a good one. Peace.
