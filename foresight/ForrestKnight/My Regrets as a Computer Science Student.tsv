0	3280	Going on an extended vacation, where should we travel to?
5280	8240	Morocco and Africa. All right, done deal.
9200	14000	Actually, traveling is one of the few things that I'm not doing. There's a lot going on that
14000	17840	I've sprinkled throughout some of these videos in the past. Like, this is going to be one of the
17840	22400	last few videos in this office. Over the next, I've been thinking about two to three weeks,
22400	26720	Molly and I are going to be gone out of this house into a new house. And I try to share as
26720	31280	much as possible with y'all. I kind of feel like I have two different lives. I have my YouTube
31280	36720	software engineering life, which is my full-time job plus YouTube, my part-time job, if you will.
36720	42240	And then I have the rest of my life. Like the fishing, the going out on the boats, the dog,
42240	47760	a lot of other things that are going on. I've always floated with the idea of either starting
47760	53920	a whole other channel just so I can kind of post more of non-software development stuff over there,
53920	59680	or if I want to just start working on integrating a lot of different aspects of my life into this
59680	64800	channel. Let me know what you think in the comments below. I don't care one way or another. I'm just
64800	68880	going to try to figure that out. But that's not why most of y'all clicked on this video. You're
68880	74560	trying to hear about my regrets as a computer science student. If you don't know, last May, so
74560	80480	May of 2018, I graduated from ODU with a computer science degree. And in this video, we're going
80480	85920	to go over a few things, quite a few things that I felt like I should have done better, that I regret
85920	90800	not doing better and things that I would do if I had to do it all over again. And I also want to
90800	96960	talk about a few things that I don't regret. Things that I did and retrospectively looking at it,
96960	101520	I did right. Now I'm going to be the first to say that there are more things that I did wrong than I
101520	105520	did right, but I figured out, you know, kind of try to balance out the video a little bit. And I
105520	111920	know I specified computer science in the title. This very well could be my regrets as a college
111920	116160	student, but I wanted to specify computer science because computer science is a hard degree to
116160	120560	obtain. I mean, you have to put in a lot of work. If my major back in college was incredibly simple
120560	125920	or just overall easy, not much problem solving, not much involved work, then I probably wouldn't
125920	131360	have these regrets. So let's get into them. First and foremost, it is treating college
131360	135920	like high school. In high school, I didn't have any homework. If I did, I got it done in
135920	141360	study block or in class or it was very, very minuscule. And in high school, I didn't study.
141360	145840	I didn't feel like I needed to and I seemed to pass the classes just fine. So I didn't do homework
145840	152000	and I didn't study. I went to class. I did my work that needed to get done in class. And when I went
152000	157280	home, I went home. I kind of like clocked out of work, if you will. And in college, it doesn't
157280	162640	really work that way. While high school, you go for let's say seven, eight hours a day, and then
162640	169520	maybe you have one to two hours of homework at home. For college, you go to class for one to two
169520	175680	hours a day, and then you have seven to eight hours of homework at home. It completely flipped
175680	181920	everything around where everything in high school you could do in class. Your teachers were there
181920	186960	to teach you everything. While college, you needed to be doing everything on your own. Sure,
186960	191120	you had the resources of your teacher. They just kind of go over things and you have to figure it
191120	196000	out yourself. At least that's how it was in computer science. It's a lot easier to write a paper in
196000	201680	class or do a math worksheet in class, whatever it may be. Calc one doesn't matter. Then it is to
201680	206960	write an involved program in class with a language that you need to Google every other thing that
206960	211680	needs to get done in that program. That's definitely, that was definitely a big one. I also regretted
211680	218400	not completely understanding the aspect of computer science prior to signing up for computer
218400	222720	science degree and attending the computer science classes. In all honesty, I thought it was more
222720	227760	like a software development degree where I was going to go in, I was going to learn how to code,
227760	233120	and that was basically, that was the focus and sure I take electives here and there to make
233120	237600	sure I'm a well-rounded student, but I thought most of my computer science classes were going to be
237680	246240	programming, coding, but it was a lot of theory, a lot of math, a lot more work and a lot different
246240	250720	work than I previously thought and that was my own problem. I didn't do enough research going
250720	257440	into it. I was just naive. One thing I don't regret because I remember very vividly my early years
257440	263840	of college, something that helped me get through my college was when I signed up for Angelus. Now
263840	269280	this isn't necessarily a sponsor, but it kind of is in a way for this video. I remember back in
269280	274720	my early years, I signed up for Angelus. Think of Angelus as a place for startups, tech startups,
274720	281040	or what have you to put their company on this platform and then software engineers, software
281040	287040	developers, or anyone who would be needed in a particular tech space to put their resume,
287040	291840	similar to LinkedIn, but for startups and something that I remember scrolling through my
291840	298000	early years of computer science just dreaming about one day, maybe I can get this iOS development
298000	304240	job. I have a potential to get three to five percent equity and make $80,000 a year and work
304240	309680	remotely. I just remember scrolling through all of those things down through Angelus and that really
309680	315760	helped me drive forward and try to just pursue that dream. And if you're someone who is interested
315760	319920	in just checking out Angelus, if you're interested in being a software developer at a startup,
319920	324160	maybe you are a startup, I'm going to leave a link in the top of the description. It's a free
324160	329840	for life account to Angelus. You just go there, you sign up. This isn't a free trial. This is
329840	334480	you sign up just like you would be signing up to a social media account and you go from there.
334480	340240	That is a real thing. I'm glad I did simply because it helped me get through to the next step. If I ever
340240	346240	felt, if I ever had like, you know, the imposter syndrome or just kind of felt like I wasn't good
346240	351120	enough. I just remembered of where I wanted to be. I would scroll through that and then I would
351120	356240	work in order to hopefully one day get there. Now we're going to get a bit more generic. This can
356240	361920	go for all college students. My next regret is neglecting office hours. Something you got to
361920	367280	understand. While you have, you know, your class one to two hours a day per class and then you have,
367280	371600	you have your homework that you need to get done. When you do your homework or your projects or
371600	376000	whatever the heck you want to call it and you face a problem, especially in computer science and
376000	380880	you're trying to figure out a problem, stack overflow, whatever else your search engine, your
380880	386400	internet will show you, you need to use your office hours when you've exhausted all resources. If you
386400	391840	can't figure something out, go to your, you're not an advisor, but your professor for that class,
391840	397200	for that project so they can help guide you through it. Make sure you have a decent understanding
397200	402880	of what your problem is. You want to talk to them about the solutions that you've tried and sometimes
402960	406880	you'll figure it out yourself. Like the rubber ducky method, if I were to, you know, talk to this
406880	412480	globe right here, try to describe my particular problem to this globe, I can maybe figure it out
412480	418320	because I'm trying to formulate words in order to describe the problem at hand. Now that may not
418320	423040	happen and if that doesn't happen, that's where your professor will come into play and say, well,
423040	427680	maybe you got to do x, y, and z and that'll help you get over that hump and onto the next problem,
427680	432480	basically. So always use those office hours wisely because they are incredibly valuable.
432480	436800	You're paying for it. You're paying a lot of money to go to college, regardless of what degree
436800	444480	you have. That money pays for a lot of different things, a lot of which is the curriculum, the
444480	450720	professor's teaching you the stuff, and then your professor's office hours. Just imagine how much
450720	457520	money you're wasting by not using those office hours. Now, can you call something a regret when
457520	464000	you still do it to this day? Like, I regret procrastinating so much in school, but yet,
464000	469760	even in my own life, on particular things, I still procrastinate quite a bit. I've gotten better at it.
469760	475760	It's a process, but in school, procrastinating was worse. Like, you would be down to a couple
475760	482400	days left or maybe just the night before you have to turn something in, and you get stuck on a bug
482400	485440	or an error, especially if you're trying to write some type of program for a class,
486160	491440	and you can't go to office hours. Your professor probably won't be responding to emails, and if
491440	496240	they are, how many other people procrastinated just like you until the last night to ask a professor
496240	500800	via email about their problems? All emailing your professor, trying to figure out the problems while
500800	506400	your professor, they don't have much time. They may be trying to respond to emails at 11 p.m. when
506400	511040	your thing is due at 11.59 p.m., but who knows if they're going to get around to you. It's a lot
511040	517920	better in terms of your grades and in terms of how much you'll learn. If you work little by little
517920	522640	on these projects that you have two weeks to complete, if you start off on it on the
522640	527760	second or third day in which it's assigned or even the night of, then you're able to use those
527760	532640	office hours like I suggested in the previous regret. So just make sure you leave yourself
532640	538640	enough time. Don't procrastinate. Don't procrastinate. This is me talking to myself because, like I said,
538640	542560	and I want to leave this on a positive note with something that I felt like I did right,
542560	548080	and that is getting in on internships early. Like I could have maybe done earlier, but I think it was
548080	554800	the summer after my sophomore year where I got my first internship, computer science internship,
554800	559600	and then that following fall I had an internship, and then the next summer I had an internship,
559600	564240	and then that last year, my senior year, I just kind of did all the work I needed to get done so
564240	568240	I could graduate. So if you're going to college for anything, especially computer science,
568240	572800	try to get in on internships early. Don't worry about, I'm not good enough for, like they don't
572800	577760	expect much out of you. A lot of the work you're going to be doing is typical internship work,
577760	583520	something that someone from a computer science degree all the way down to a communications
583520	588480	degree. You're going to be doing the typical intern work like Excel spreadsheets, building
588480	594240	PowerPoint, basically anything Microsoft Office. You could be rewiring a whole entire data center,
594240	598480	which that's just pulling out plugs and plugging them back in and using new power strips and what
598480	603040	have you. Or your company is going to be sending you over to Chicago for documenting a manual
603040	608800	process in which needs to be automated, but that manual process occurs from 1 a.m. to roughly 10
608800	613360	a.m. That was another one of mine, or you could actually get a coding internship, and that could
613360	617360	be, that would be pretty cool too. Just don't be worried. They know you're an intern, you're a
617360	623360	student. They don't expect the world out of you. Just be willing to do the work and ask questions
623360	627520	when you run into a problem. And that's it. Those are my regrets as a computer science student,
627520	631600	and I sprinkled in a few positive things that I think I did right. I know I'm going to think
631600	635520	of something as soon as I hit that publish button on, oh man, I should have included that in the
635520	640000	video. I should have included that. Literally, I've been adding to this list over the past few days
640000	645520	ever since I came up with the idea for this video, and I know I'm going to have so many other regrets
645520	651120	or non-regrets that I had as a computer science student. So in order to fill that void, if you
651120	656480	all have anything similar to what I laid out in this video, leave those down in the comment below.

672720	676240	kind of want to integrate into some of these videos, or maybe have their own standalone videos on
676240	681520	this channel, or if I should just make a whole entire other channel regarding everything else
681520	684560	that's going on in my life. Until next time, guys, have a good one. Peace.
