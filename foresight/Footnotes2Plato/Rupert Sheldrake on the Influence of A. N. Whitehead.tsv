0	7440	Not too long ago, the process theologian and philosopher John Cobb, Jr. asked me
7440	14340	if I would join his Cobb Institute, which is a nonprofit trying to advance a
14340	20280	process relational worldview, as well as the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead.
20280	28400	And in particular, John wanted me to share the Science Advisory Committee, one
28400	34040	of the avenues that the Cobb Institute is hoping to advance Whitehead's work is
34040	38240	in the natural sciences. And one of the ways that I thought I could help to
38240	43040	advance this mission would be to record a number of dialogues with scientists
43040	47800	who have been influenced by Whitehead's work or who have found that there is a
47800	54960	correspondence between their approach and Whitehead's. I have already reached
55000	59480	out to a few scientists. I'm hoping to record dialogues in the near future with
59480	65320	the astrobiologist Bruce Damer, who I've spoken to in the past. I'm also going to
65320	71200	record a dialogue with the plasma physicist Timothy Eastman and others.
71200	77480	But the first scientist who was willing to speak with me about Whitehead is
77480	84520	Rupert Sheldrake. And Rupert probably needs no introduction, but for those of
84560	89880	you who are somehow unfamiliar with his work, he is a biologist, a Cambridge
89880	97080	trained biologist. He is a psychical researcher who has developed, in addition
97080	102880	to his novel biological ideas, he has also developed a number of experiments to
102880	110720	test certain parapsychological so-called phenomena and has accumulated a wealth
110880	117120	of interesting data that challenges the materialist paradigm that much science
117120	124360	still operates within. Rupert Sheldrake is rather controversial from within the
124360	131200	scientific establishment. I would be surprised if my listeners are not aware
131200	137400	of some of the controversies that he has stirred up trying to challenge, ultimately
137480	143040	I would say, trying to challenge science and scientists to be more scientific, to
143040	149520	admit more data into their understanding of how the universe works and to then
149560	157040	develop better theories to include and elucidate that data. So I will leave it
157040	160520	at that and I hope you enjoy our conversation.
161520	167520	I'm really grateful to you for making the time to speak with me. I have already
167520	173520	mentioned to our mutual friend, John Cobb, that we would be doing this and he was
173520	177520	very glad to hear that and sends his well wishes to you in hopes that you're
177520	187520	doing well. And he's excited to hear our dialogue. As you may know, John has recently
188520	195520	started the Cobb Institutes to help further a process relational worldview.
196520	201520	One of the areas that he's hoping that the Institute can help advance and carry
201520	209520	forward is Whitehead's relevance to the natural sciences. And John has asked me
209520	216520	to lead that effort. We have a committee made up of some other scientists and one
216520	220520	of the first things I wanted to do to help advance the mission of the Institute
220520	227520	was interview different scientists and you are the first one. So I'm very excited
227520	234520	about that. I'm also going to be interviewing the plasma physicist at
234520	240520	the Goddard Space Flight Institute, NASA's Institute, Timothy Eastman, he's a plasma
240520	247520	physicist and an astrobiologist named Bruce Dahmer, who's working on a very
247520	252520	interesting hypothesis. You know him, yeah, he was good friends with Terrence
252520	258520	McKenna, who you were also good friends with, so there's a connection there. So
258520	267520	let's talk about Whitehead. Just so you know, I will introduce you later when I
267520	271520	I'll record a separate introduction that will lead into this conversation. So I
271520	279520	won't do that now. So I've got a series of questions here. And the first one for
279520	285520	you would be, when did you first encounter Whitehead's ideas?
288520	294520	You suddenly froze then. But I mean, I could hear you all right, but you're
294520	300520	the visuals froze. Okay, well you heard the question then, so go ahead.
300520	307520	I can't remember actually. I think that I may have read, when I was doing History
307520	315520	of Science at Harvard in 1963-64, I was in the graduate school, I just finished
315520	320520	my undergraduate degree at Cambridge. I was doing History and Philosophy of Science
320520	327520	and I think I read Science in the modern world at that stage. Because I was very
327520	333520	interested in Whitehead's take on, you know, what was happening. The reason I was
333520	337520	doing History and Philosophy of Science at Harvard was because when I was an
337520	341520	undergraduate at Cambridge, I'd become very disillusioned with mechanistic
341520	348520	materialism. I'd been converted to atheism and materialism when I was at school
348520	356520	by my science teachers. But I began to doubt mechanistic materialism because I'd
356520	360520	gone into biology because I loved animals and plants and I noticed the first thing
360520	365520	we did was to kill them and then grind them up. And everything I was most
365520	369520	interested in about them disappeared in this process by the time you got sort of
369520	375520	DNA in a test tube. You know, the animal, I was interested, I kept homing pigeons
375520	381520	as a child. And I was interested in her pigeons' home. Of course, by the time you
381520	385520	killed the pigeon and ground up its liver and extracted its enzymes and centrifuged
385520	390520	them and looked at the properties of the enzymes in a test tube or the DNA, you
390520	397520	were an awfully long way from homing behaviour. And the rest is just sort of
397520	401520	filled with hand waving, you know, well, it's genetically programmed, you know,
401520	409520	and so on. So I got very critical of the whole approach and I didn't know
409520	415520	whether it was inevitable or whether there was an alternative. And I read
415520	419520	Goethe when I was an undergraduate and that gave me the first inklings of a
419520	425520	holistic approach to biology. So anyway, I was at Harvard and I think I read
425520	430520	Whitehead then. And then I went back to Cambridge. I was a graduate student doing
430520	437520	a PhD in developmental botany. I wanted to work on plants because I couldn't
437520	441520	spend, I didn't want to spend the rest of my career killing animals, which is
441520	451520	what zoology would have meant. And during that period, somebody approached me,
451520	455520	a fellow graduate student, and asked me to write an article for a new magazine,
455520	461520	Theoria to Theory. I don't know if you've come across it, Theoria, as in
461520	469520	Greek mystical intuition to DO theory. And that introduced me to this group in
469520	474520	Cambridge called the Epiphany Philosophers, who were a group of philosophers
474520	482520	and scientists who were interested in mystical spirituality and philosophy of
482520	489520	science. The journal of the group, Theoria to Theory, was edited by Dorothy
489520	495520	Emmett, who was a student of Whiteheads. And the whole group was permeated by
495520	501520	Whitehead because Dorothy was the editor and she was one of the key figures. The
501520	506520	other key figures in the group were Richard Braithwaite, who was a philosopher
506520	511520	of science, professor at Cambridge, and his wife Margaret Masterman, who was
511520	517520	worked on linguistic philosophy. She worked with Wittgenstein and was in charge
517520	521520	of the Cambridge Language Research Lab, which was doing pioneering work on
521520	526520	artificial intelligence and artificial translation. This was in the late 50s
526520	531520	and early 60s, she was doing this. So this was way out ahead of Google
531520	539520	Translate and stuff we now take for granted. And we had retreats every
539520	544520	year, four week-long retreats, where we, in the mornings and evenings, put on
544520	549520	robes and chanted the matins and even song prayers from the Church of England
549520	553520	in morning and evening prayers. Then we always had a seminar during these
553520	558520	retreats. We're very hard-hitting seminar on ideas. It was about holistic
558520	564520	science. Margaret Masterman and Dorothy and Richard and the other members of the
564520	568520	group took the view that if there was a conflict between science and mystical
568520	572520	religion, then there must be something wrong with science. And that was the
572520	576520	exact opposite of all the religion-science dialogues at the time, where they
576520	581520	were assumed as a conflict. Then you just got to chop religion down more and
581520	586520	more on a kind of pro-crustian bed of materialism until there's almost
586520	593520	nothing left. So I was at that stage looking for a more holistic way of
593520	600520	doing science. I met this group in 1966. And in these various seminars and so on,
600520	606520	Whitehead kept coming up all the time. And Dorothy was always having to try
606520	610520	and expand it, because no one could really grasp what he was saying. And I
610520	614520	tried reading process and reality and couldn't make head and not tail of it.
614520	620520	So I always had to go and ask Dorothy and she'd sort of explain it in more
620520	624520	simple terms. And this has been my relationship with Whitehead ever since
624520	631520	1966. I can't understand the original sources apart from science and the
631520	637520	modern world. So I always had to ask Whitehead experts the last in that
637520	641520	distinguished series is you.
641520	646520	Yes, I'm familiar with this problem.
646520	657520	So anyway, this, I was part of this group for all through the time I was a
657520	662520	research fellow at Clare. I was a don at Cambridge and I was a fellow at Clare
662520	672520	College where Merlin later went. And during that time, I was wrestling with
672520	680520	the how morphogenesis happens. In 1973, I came up with the idea of morphogenetic
680520	684520	fields and morphic resonance. Morphogenetic fields were already part of
684520	689520	biology. But the idea of morphic resonance came to me then in a kind of flash,
689520	695520	provoked not by reading Whitehead but by reading Bergson. I read Matter and
695520	702520	Memory by Bergson and that was for me absolutely seminal step. And it led to,
702520	709520	after reflecting on it, the idea of a causal memory causation, anemic causation
709520	714520	as Bertrand Russell called it over time, a kind of form of causation that could
714520	720520	work across time. And that was what the main theme of his book, Matter and
720520	727520	Memory. And I also read his creative evolution. So I was enormously inspired
727520	734520	by Bergson. And then when I started talking about this to Dorothy and the others
734520	738520	at the Epiphany philosophers, because this was a small group and I could bounce
738520	744520	ideas off them and we were always bouncing ideas. And I managed years of that
744520	749520	already. And they'd emboldened me to think more broadly because they had a very
749520	755520	radical approach to science. And we had quantum theorists and we had acupuncturists
755520	761520	and alternative medicine people and people interested in psychokinesis and telepathy.
761520	765520	And nothing was banned from these discussions except that the discussions
765520	769520	were very, very hard hitting. And most people who went to them were as soon as
769520	776520	one stage or another reduced to tears. Because Braithwaite was very, very aggressive
776520	780520	in his critiques of people. And I mean, he was open minded but aggressive and couldn't
780520	787520	stand nonsense. So anyway, then when I talked about Morphe Resnes, then Dorothy
787520	792520	said, well, there are lots of parallels for this in Whitehead and began to explain
792520	796520	how this could link up with Whitehead. But the main inspiration came more through
796520	803520	Bugsdon than Whitehead and then the linking up with Whitehead came a bit later.
803520	813520	Then just to fast forward through the story, I then left my job in Cambridge and got
813520	819520	a job in an agricultural research institute in India. I was in India for five years
819520	825520	and then for two more years after that on and off. In India, I was mainly working
825520	832520	on crop improvement in plant physiology. But when I was there, I got interested
832520	838520	and I was thinking about Morphe Resnes and I continued to develop the ideas and got
838520	843520	to the point where I felt I could write it up in a book. I did that in an ashram in
843520	849520	South India, Father Bede Griffiths, who was a Christian Benedictine monk in an Indian
849520	855520	style ashram. He wore orange robes and it was a very Indian ashram, actually more Indian
855520	860520	than Hindu ashrams which were overwhelmed with spiritual tourists from the west.
860520	864520	Because this was Christian, most spiritual tourists from the west weren't interested
864520	871520	in Christianity. So this one was ironically far more Indian than any of the Hindu ones.
871520	878520	Anyway, I left there and wrote my book A New Science of Life. And then when it came out
878520	888520	in 1981, there was a lot of interest in it in Britain and in America, particularly California.
888520	894520	And Stan Groff and the Transpersonal Association asked me to speak about it at a conference
894520	900520	they were having in India in the beginning of 82, which is where I met my wife Jill.
900520	907520	And as a result of that and the fact that people started writing about it in California,
907520	914520	I was invited to California for the launch of the American edition in 82, published by
914520	920520	Tarcher in Los Angeles. And so I went to California. I'd never been to California before.
920520	926520	I'd never been living in India for years. So this was a very strange world for me, California.
926520	932520	I was invited to Asselin, the Ohio Foundation. I was invited to speak at the Jungian Institutes
932520	939520	in San Francisco in Los Angeles. And the most interesting invitation came from David Ray Griffin,
939520	945520	who said, I'm at Claremont College. We're very interested in the relation of your work to Whitehead.
945520	951520	Could you give a seminar? So I was in LA. So I gave a seminar at Claremont College.
951520	956520	I walked into the seminar room. There were about 12, 15 people there.
956520	963520	And they all had a copy of the English edition of my book, which had come out a year before the American one.
963520	969520	And I said, well, you know, shall I give a talk? David said, no need for a talk. He said, we've all read your book.
969520	975520	And they all have these well-thumbed and marked copies. He said, we've already had several seminars discussing it.
975520	983520	Can we start straight in the Q&A and discussion? Wow, really, really ready for you.
983520	988520	Yes, that was an extraordinary experience, you know, because everywhere else I had to start at the beginning
988520	996520	and expand it step by step. But yeah, these people were, you know, I could leap straight in and they were already
996520	1003520	tightly up to speed. You know, and then say on page 27, you say this and they'd read it.
1003520	1007520	Now, how do you interpret that? And that parallels something Whitehead said.
1007520	1013520	And so that was my first encounter at Claremont College.
1013520	1018520	And then things went on and, you know, I met and talked to various Whitehead scholars over the years.
1018520	1025520	There aren't that many of them. But the next encounter, big one, was really 2011,
1025520	1033520	when John Cobb organized this two-day seminar about Morphic Resonance and Whitehead,
1033520	1039520	a two-day seminar in Claremont. And people came from all over the US for it.
1039520	1046520	You know, there were experts on Whitehead's philosophy, experts on sort of different aspects of Whitehead's work,
1046520	1049520	Whitehead's entheology, Whitehead and this and that.
1049520	1056520	There are transcripts somewhere. I don't know if you've seen them, but that's so John would have them.
1056520	1059520	Yeah.
1059520	1068520	And that was very, very helpful, actually, because, again, everyone there had actually read my work.
1068520	1074520	And so we could start straight and we didn't have to waste time on the kind of going through the background.
1074520	1079520	But to see the only context that's ever happened to me at Claremont College,
1079520	1086520	where I had this level of attention and advanced discussion.
1086520	1092520	And actually, that was quite an interesting gathering because it was happening over the Feast of All Saints,
1092520	1099520	November the 1st. It was a two-day seminar. And Claremont College is a school of theology.
1099520	1105520	And so I said to them, you know, I always observe All Saints Day because it's one of the main festivals.
1105520	1108520	And is there a service here? And they said, oh, no.
1108520	1113520	I looked and I found the nearest service at some Catholic church about 10 miles away.
1113520	1118520	And I said, well, look, I really want to go to it. And but it's very hard to get. I haven't got a car.
1118520	1121520	There's no public transport, you know.
1121520	1126520	And then I had this idea, which I said to John Carr, I said, why don't we have an All Saints service here?
1127520	1131520	And we've got an Episcopalian priest in this group.
1131520	1134520	I asked him and he said he'd be happy to take it.
1134520	1140520	And I said, and since we're all here because we admire Whitehead, let's promote him to the rank of a saint.
1140520	1144520	And because it's really about the blessed dead.
1144520	1153520	And I said to John Carr, and then could you give the homily on the theme of Whitehead as we have a mass for All Saints Day?
1153520	1157520	And so John was a bit taken aback by all this, but he agreed to it.
1157520	1163520	And and so we had this hurriedly arranged All Saints service at Claremont.
1163520	1168520	And then he said, well, he said, but that's all very well. But who's going to play the organ?
1168520	1171520	And I said, well, I will. I'm an organist.
1171520	1176520	And so when it actually came to it, they couldn't find the keys to the organ.
1176520	1178520	So I had to play the piano.
1178520	1184520	But anyway, we had we had a full scale mass with hymns for Whitehead.
1184520	1189520	So that was the that was the beatification of Alfred North Whitehead.
1189520	1191520	I did not realize he had been sainted.
1191520	1195520	So yes, very, very nice to know.
1195520	1199520	And that, you know, you and John Cobb collaborated on that.
1199520	1201520	It's quite wonderful.
1201520	1203520	So wow.
1203520	1211520	One, one more point I want to ask you about, which is that one of the people who was at this meeting was called Professor Wang.
1211520	1213520	W and G.
1213520	1221520	And I talked something about my book, The Science Delusion Science Set Free, which came out the following year.
1221520	1224520	And Professor Wang
1224520	1229520	had studied there and had set up institutes of process studies in China.
1229520	1235520	And he said, well, this is very important. And I'd like to arrange the translation of this book into Chinese.
1235520	1238520	And it's very important for process studies.
1238520	1241520	And I said, well, have you got an institute of process studies in China?
1241520	1245520	Then he said, not one Institute. I said, I said, how many?
1245520	1250520	He said, we have 32 Institute process studies in China.
1250520	1253520	It's a popular country.
1253520	1254520	Amazing, right?
1254520	1258520	The entire Western world, there's only one where we are right now.
1258520	1260520	And I said, why is that?
1260520	1263520	And he said, I have friends in the Central Committee.
1263520	1269520	He said, they want to make Chinese philosophy more Chinese.
1269520	1275520	They want to rehabilitate Chinese philosophy, including Taoism, but especially Confucianism.
1275520	1283520	He said, because if they preach revolution, then young people may think, why don't we have another revolution?
1283520	1285520	They do not want revolution.
1285520	1289520	He said, they want Confucian ethics, respect for authority.
1289520	1298520	And he said, but we cannot justify it with Chinese philosophy because in modern China, only something that comes from the West will be respected.
1298520	1304520	So I have persuaded them, Whitehead is the key to the rehabilitation of our own philosophy.
1304520	1309520	He said, now we have many institutes of process philosophy.
1309520	1311520	Did you know about that?
1311520	1313520	Oh, I did. Yes.
1313520	1317520	Back in, I mean, that's been going on for a number of years now.
1317520	1324520	And John Cobb has been very involved in networking with Chinese scholars to help forward that work.
1325520	1337520	The Communist Party has written into their constitution this ideal of moving towards what they call ecological civilization and Whitehead's work and ideas play a big part in that.
1337520	1347520	And we had a big conference back in 2015 in Claremont called Seizing an Alternative Towards an Ecological Civilization.
1348520	1353520	I believe it was the 15th International Whitehead Conference at the same time.
1353520	1360520	And we had probably 1500 people there total a dozen different tracks running simultaneously.
1360520	1365520	And there were about 500 scholars from China present.
1365520	1367520	Amazing. Yeah.
1367520	1369520	Truly amazing.
1370520	1387520	You know, there's obviously political motives here, which you're hinting at, but it's also quite wonderful to see the way that Whitehead's work is living on in contexts that none of us would have imagined.
1387520	1393520	And so I'm fascinated to see how that plays out in China.
1393520	1404520	Chinese civilization certainly seems to be moving into a new phase of world power.
1404520	1414520	You know, so I think we will see an increasingly important role for China in the world and hopefully a positive one.
1414520	1431520	I mean, that remains to be seen, but I think the more influence Whitehead's work can have moving us towards a sense of, you know, for Whitehead persuasion is so much more important for the evolution of human beings than coercion, right?
1431520	1433520	And his view of the way that power works.
1433520	1439520	And so hopefully, you know, the Chinese government moves in that direction.
1439520	1443520	Well, they haven't moved in that direction very far with the Muslims in China.
1443520	1445520	So Uighurs. Yes. Yes.
1445520	1446520	Lots of issues there.
1446520	1457520	I agree. It's an important thing. By the way, if you're in touch with Wang, remind him about the translation of the science delusion because there's a new addition just come out in England.
1457520	1460520	So if they do do translation, this is a good time.
1460520	1461520	Gotcha.
1461520	1462520	Updated.
1462520	1467520	Wonderful. Yeah, I was hoping to travel to China.
1467520	1480520	Last year and with the Trump administration and the trade war, there were some issues with the visas and it just hasn't, it wasn't the right time to travel and then the pandemic happened.
1480520	1493520	And so obviously it can't happen now, but hopefully at some point in the future, I'll be able to go inspect these at least a few of these process centers in China.
1493520	1506520	So wonderful. Wow. It seems as if you almost followed a similar pathway as Whitehead from Cambridge to Harvard. You obviously went back to Cambridge after Harvard, which Whitehead did not do but
1506520	1513520	and it's how wonderful that you got to study and learn about Whitehead from a student.
1513520	1518520	Dorothy Emmett directly I've read and she has a book I think it's called The Philosophy of Organism.
1518520	1522520	Yes, that I have read and enjoyed.
1522520	1536520	So that's, that's, and this problem that you express of lots of people telling you that there are deep resonances with Whitehead's work and but trying to study Whitehead yourself and not being able to make heads or tails of a lot of it.
1536520	1539520	It's a very common issue.
1539520	1553520	He is not easy to understand. He's developed his own language and a few of us are crazy enough to devote years of study. I've been reading Whitehead for about a decade now.
1553520	1556520	And eventually when you learn the language.
1556520	1562520	It starts to make sense, but then you still have the problem of communicating to others about it.
1562520	1576520	And so, you know, one of one of my goals as a Whitehead scholar is to try to do that work of translation and to be in dialogue with as many kindred thinkers as possible to draw connections and
1576520	1594520	if there's anyone better at doing that sort of thing, then I mean, John Cobb's been doing it too, but David Ray Griffin has an amazing capacity to immerse himself in the work of other philosophers and scientists that he thinks might be in some way connected
1594520	1601520	to Whitehead and then to engage with them to unpack those connections. He's just been doing this for decade after decade with so many different thinkers.
1601520	1612520	So, you know, his work has been absolutely essential to keeping Whitehead alive in the contemporary period.
1612520	1627520	And I think we seem to have reached a point now where I don't know that it's quite at the level of a Whitehead renaissance, but there's a lot of academic philosophers and scientists who are now beginning to reference Whitehead and to actually
1627520	1638520	engage with his writing and struggle to make those interpretations. And so I'm excited to see that happening.
1638520	1656520	But I have to say that your own books and articles have been an immense help to me because you do, because you've taken so much time and trouble to assimilate it, you are able to make it clearer what he's saying and to express it in a way that's more comprehensible.
1656520	1669520	And for me, the complete proof of this was when Merlin came to your course at Schumacher College and, you know, I don't know what five days or however long it was, a week or something.
1669520	1679520	But he came back completely enthused and Merlin is now very much a kind of Whiteheadian. And before that, he'd never shown much interest in philosophy.
1679520	1694520	And I tried to engage him with philosophy and stuff, but he'd always been a little bit skeptical about the kinds of things I'm interested in. I mean, we're quite close in our interests, of course, but, and they're very complimentary.
1694520	1715520	Suddenly, I found this sort of wave of enthusiasm for Whitehead was entirely due to your, your course. I mean, you must have some interest in the first place or otherwise he wouldn't have come but it worked so well for the way he was thinking you know ecologically and about high full growth and about biological processes and stuff.
1715520	1733520	Yeah, I mean my serial networks are a wonderful example of an analogy for the sort of networked ontology that Whitehead develops. So I think Merlin actually, if I recall correctly, said that you convinced him to come to the course.
1733520	1744520	When he had mentioned that someone was coming to teach Whitehead at Schumacher. But I'm glad to hear I infected him with Whiteheadian ideas.
1745520	1761520	And more than superficially, I mean, this is part of his very being. I mean, he sort of identifies with Whitehead and that approach very strongly. And of course, he's shown through his recent book that he has an incredible gift for communication.
1761520	1775520	And so, you know, getting this kind of general approach without necessarily mentioning Whitehead very much but it's, I mean, there's thousands and thousands of people are reading what he's written and obviously being influenced by it.
1775520	1795520	Yeah, it was very exciting to see his book come out and I've read, I'm about three quarters of the way through it and it's very well written. Mycology is a science that I was introduced to by Terence McKenna actually.
1795520	1814520	Yeah, from a different perspective. But yeah, it's it's remind me what's the title of entangled life entangled life, right? Yes. So I hope to be able to convince Merlin to talk to me to do one of these interviews at some point.
1815520	1836520	But so another question I have for you would be, which, which aspects of Whitehead's philosophy do you think are most helpful for or hold the most promise for moving science beyond materialism?
1837520	1857520	Well, there's one aspect is the kind of memory aspect, what I call Morphic Resonance. But I mean, I'm obviously biased here. I find the idea of Morphic Resonance much easier to convey to people and to use than prehension or some of the way or
1858520	1877520	So these Whitehead in terms that refer to something similar. And the thing is, it's not clear whether what they're referring to is that similar or not. And this is where, when I brought this question up at Claremont College, the seminar room sort of dissolved into different
1877520	1897520	interpretations and different factions. And even among the Whitehead scholars, there was no unanimity as to exactly what he meant and stuff. So I don't see that as the most helpful aspect, because the I can just talk about Morphic Resonance without I didn't refer to Whitehead and coming up with the idea.
1898520	1918520	You know, in a sense, the connection with Whitehead came after the idea. But the bit that I personally wrestle with and think about and find most stimulating and talk about in my lectures where it really grips people is the idea that the relation of mind and body or
1918520	1945520	mental and physical pole is a process in time that the mental poles, the future pole and the physical poles, the past pole. Now, as a way of interpreting mind body relationships. I think that's extraordinarily stimulating, interesting, exciting, undeveloped and and full of possibilities.
1946520	1957520	And I'm never sure whether my own interpretations of it are going way beyond what Whitehead intended or whether it would fit.
1958520	1977520	But the idea you see that I mean, I read things like Journal of Consciousness Studies, I get conscious on consciousness and because I talk about it in various contexts like the sense of being stared at and Morphic Resonance and memory and so on.
1978520	1989520	And I haven't seen any coherent approaches. You know, the quantum theory ones seem to me not illuminating at all they are fuscating and stuff.
1989520	2001520	But by far the most illuminating to me is the idea that mental causation works from virtual futures towards the past whereas physical causation works from the past towards the future.
2001520	2030520	And these two streams of causation sort of overlap in the present. And because the mental causation is about possibilities and choosing among them. I also find it very helpful because when people say what do you mean by consciousness as opposed to I first made the distinction that the mind can be conscious or unconscious the unconscious mind is still mental but not conscious and most of our habits are unconscious.
2031520	2034520	But they're still mental.
2034520	2050520	So if we come to consciousness per se, then I starting from Whitehead, my answer is that it's about choosing among possible actions, and the role of consciousness is to choose among possibilities and therefore consciousness is an arena of possibilities.
2050520	2069520	And possibilities are always things that haven't happened yet. So as soon as you've chosen among possible actions, you'd be the causal chain works, as it were, from that choice, which is about a future state back through times from a virtual future back through time.
2070520	2076520	And you see within the in the world I live in.
2076520	2090520	There are a lot of people discussing things like precognition, precognitive dreams, of course, limits experiments that show that the conscious choice happens after the mental change.
2090520	2096520	After the physical change brain change the brain change.
2097520	2103520	The brain change happens first and that happens afterwards.
2103520	2123520	So the thing is that there's a lot here where this could be relevant to phenomena that certainly occur. I mean I do research on precognition and pre sentiment myself and pre sentiment feeling the future.
2123520	2132520	I think it's an established fact of course it is not part of established in the main academic world because they say it's impossible as parapsychological it's impossible and so on.
2132520	2142520	But actually, it would require the idea that consciousness is somehow working from the future.
2142520	2149520	And there, of course, it's not a virtual future is an actual future.
2149520	2166520	But this is a whole area where my ideas are not fully clear on this but my starting point for thinking about these naughty problems is whitehead and I don't know any other starting point other than whitehead for these questions that make sense to me.
2167520	2188520	Yeah, I like that this is this polarity between mind and matter or past causality out of the past versus causality into the future. This does seem to me to be a very fruitful avenue for opening up science to a different understanding of the way that nature operates.
2189520	2206520	Because there's so much what I would call residual Cartesianism or Cartesian dualism in even materialist science because the mind doing the observing and all the theorizing and stuff is sort of bracketed out and forgotten about.
2206520	2224520	As nature is just thought of as a machine where only efficient or mechanical causality is operative which would be the push from the past. There's no pool or as whitehead would call it lures from the future in the materials picture and clearly to understand.
2224520	2240520	It's almost it's almost inescapable and stares you in the face in the biological realm that there's some need to invoke a lure or a future pool or a purpose a telos of some kind.
2241520	2259520	But even in physics when we understand the evolution of the universe through supposedly billions of years of different stages of development there seems to be a tendency towards organization and to stars and galaxies and these are sources of
2260520	2273520	profound order that we wouldn't expect to emerge if there wasn't some sort of a lure or tendency if there weren't some future possibilities that seem to want to manifest.
2274520	2287520	And I think whitehead provides a very rigorous coherent and scientifically applicable way of understanding this interplay between mental and physical causation.
2287520	2297520	So I completely agree that might be the most fruitful avenue to draw on whitehead to sort of fertilize the scientific worldview.
2298520	2312520	And then yeah what you're saying about precognition. I've had this discussion with many people, you know very interested in your work and who have had experiences themselves of something like a vision of the future they have a dream
2312520	2326520	and then something happens that confirms what the dream was suggesting and it seems that, you know, and David Rick Griffin has written about this I think specifically in reference to your ideas and it seems that in whitehead.
2326520	2336520	There's some room for offering an explanation of this but certainly for whitehead, he would reject the idea that the future is already determined.
2336520	2352520	And so for him, maybe there are certain possibilities that are more probable than others, but that even if I think whitehead would say if someone has a vision of the future, you know, something that's going to happen next year or even a few days from now,
2352520	2370520	I would say that's not yet determined. It could be otherwise and maybe in that moment when that precognitive experience happens, that particular future that was envisioned is the most likely, but it could still change and so I wonder what you think about that wiggle room that whitehead would insist upon that.
2370520	2382520	Well, I insist on it too, because I think that the, I totally reject the idea of the future is determined and this sort of Einstein block universe view.
2382520	2401520	And one of the things that comes out of psychical research is that the, when you have a pre sentiment or a precognition, then the precognition is not necessarily of something, which is not something in the objective outer world, it's a future state of your own experience.
2401520	2417520	So, some people in this area say we should call it pre call, as opposed to recall, that it recall is recalling something that happened during your experience in the past, and pre call is linking to your experience in the future.
2417520	2432520	It's your experience you're linking to, not the outer world. And J. W. Dunne was, you know, who read that famous book and experiment with time, you know, in the 1920s.
2432520	2450520	I think the best book on precognitive dreaming J W Dunne pointed out that he had this dream of a volcanic eruption in Martinique, leading to 20,000 deaths.
2450520	2462520	He wrote it down because he recorded his dreams and then he read in the Daily Telegraph a couple of days later being this eruption in Martinique with 20,000 deaths.
2463520	2477520	And for him, this was a pre call of this reading this a few days later. However, the twist on this is very interesting that what he'd done, he'd misread it, it wasn't 20,000, it was 2,000.
2477520	2494520	And when he later checked up, he found that actually when he looked at the paper, it didn't say 20,000, he thought it had said 20,000. So it wasn't what the paper actually said, or what had actually happened, it was what he thought it had said or what that mattered.
2494520	2506520	So, so that's, that's one thing you see and then there's there's pre sentiment. This is a short term thing Dean Radin's worked on. I don't know if you've read about pre sentiment.
2506520	2515520	Yeah, I'm familiar with some of Radin's work. Yeah, it's over a few seconds today you respond to something that's emotionally arising.
2515520	2528520	So, you see one way of dealing with that would be again taking a lead from Whitehead that we normally think of the present as defined in terms of you know instantaneous microsecond or something.
2528520	2537520	But actually, I mean his word the specious present is is about a spreading out of the present I suppose but he gets from William James. Yeah.
2537520	2553520	Yes, that you could you could actually say that the present in relation to dreams are present maybe extended over several days, or are present maybe extended over, you know, several 10 seconds or something.
2553520	2566520	If you, I mean, it's obvious the present is the fact that the cinema works shows that we actually 10, you know, 10th of a second we blow them all together those that our content is spread out in time.
2566520	2579520	But in some circumstances it may be spread out more and others less. And, and if it's spread out in time the usual assumption is that the present instant is here and if it's spread out is 10 seconds into the past.
2579520	2585520	But if it's spread out in time, it could be five seconds into the future and five seconds into the past.
2585520	2600520	And, and in which case, something happens five seconds in the future is part of the present and would cause reactions, emotional responses to erotic pictures in Dean Radiance experiments.
2600520	2611520	I mean, actually, parapsychology is very hard to get people to accept but I'm working at the moment with somebody developing a day trading market app.
2611520	2616520	And I've discovered by interviewing people on trading floors in the city of London.
2616520	2631520	You know, people are doing this day trading there, they're making, they're predicting the market within the next three or four seconds, you know, they're sort of saying it's going to go up and this can't be based on a rational analysis of trends or reading Wall Street
2631520	2643520	Journal or anything. And when, when I've talked to people on the trading floor floors, you know, I've asked to speak to the best trader and friendly with the chap who runs one of the best companies in London.
2643520	2654520	He's kind of found of mine. So he let me into the trading floor and I was able to speak to these people. And I asked to speak to his best trader and he said, you know, this guy's a phenomenon.
2654520	2664520	He just seems to know when news is going to flash up on the screen just seems to feel which of the 10 screens he's working at, where the action is going to be just seems to know where it's going to.
2664520	2673520	And I talked to this chap and I said, you know, do you know how you know he said, no, he said, I read the papers and I just think, you know, I'm sort of tuned in and stuff.
2673520	2680520	But when I said has it occurred to you might be pre sent from you said what's that, you know, yeah.
2680520	2699520	I think this is actually happening all the time. So I'm trying to develop an app. People use on their mobile phones, where you can, we'd start with monopoly money, you know, sort of, you'd give people $500,000 to start with, and they trade and doing it just on feelings.
2699520	2717520	So if one could show that you can make millions by developing this intuitive skill. The question that does pre sentiment exist or not would cease to be a question people would be clamoring to go on training courses, and no computer be able to compete.
2717520	2726520	Yeah, that's very interesting. I've, I'm friends with Tom Steadall, who I believe works with you on an app about phone calls.
2727520	2752520	And it's, it's really wonderful to accumulate data on this and my understanding, you know, as a sort of general takeaway from a lot of this parapsychological research is that there is a higher than significantly higher than random correlation between even the average person, their ability to predict the future is
2752520	2771520	more than random. And then there are some people who seem to have a special capacity for this and it's significantly higher than random but the data is, is there waiting to be integrated into our understanding of what's possible but so many scientists locked in the materialist paradigm just refused to look at the data.
2771520	2775520	And this has been a problem for you for many decades, I think.
2775520	2791520	Yes, they just refused to look at it doesn't matter how good it is they just refused to look at it. You know I had argument Daniel Dennett two three years ago we were at a conference and, and I said you know what about a public debate and I said you're a member of the committee for sceptical inquiry you're
2791520	2800520	implacably opposed to psychic phenomena. I said, what about doing a public debate and then we could find out why it is you're so opposed.
2800520	2812520	And he said no I don't want to do that so why not he said, if I did a public debate, but I don't have to read up the literature and he said I want to waste time on something that's so obviously false.
2812520	2824520	He said well, you know, if you haven't read the literature and how can you possibly be sure it's so far he got terribly angry if he's just really angry that you know that when I pressed him.
2824520	2827520	It's a denial movement.
2828520	2842520	Whereas you see, most some people try within the Paris I'm on the Paris psychology discussion list which is an email discussion, written that Dean Radins on it and you know Julia Mossbridge most people in the field are on it.
2842520	2857520	And most of the discussions about precognition are about possible retro causation in quantum theory, which I don't think it's very fruitful line. I mean, it might be but they've been on this for decades now and hasn't got anywhere.
2857520	2861520	I mean, in the epiphany philosophers we were discussing this in the 1960s.
2861520	2878520	So there's a tremendous sense of deja vu with a lot of these discussions. Whereas, why tend to know if we have the idea of conscious causation and mental causation, working from virtual futures to the past.
2878520	2887520	Then, sometimes from actual futures, you know, this could be a starting point. It's the most promising one I can think of.
2887520	2901520	Yeah, as well as being the most promising starting point for thinking about what makes consciousness different from unconsciousness and also, as we were saying you know what how to understand the mind body relationship.
2901520	2914520	I mean, the way I often look at it is that if we were to adopt the whitehead in paradigm. If we were to fully inhabit the whitehead in cosmos then all of this parapsychological phenomenon just becomes psychology.
2914520	2930520	It's just, it's a feature of our experience and we have to incorporate it into our normal understanding of how human consciousness, the place that it has in relationship to the rest of the universe and so it's not paranormal anymore.
2930520	2944520	It's just perfectly normal. Whitehead even says this in the fourth part towards the end of process in reality. He's just finished this really elaborate reconstruction of how we understand space.
2944520	2958520	He calls it the extensive continuum. It's the hardest part of the hardest book that Whitehead wrote. And at the end of it, he's like one of the implications of this new understanding of space and energy vectors is that telepathy is likely a real phenomenon.
2958520	2972520	He just drops that in one sentence doesn't say much more about it. But he, his cosmology normalizes what for the materialist paradigm is woo woo and spooky and strange but it's not strange in Whitehead's universe.
2972520	2982520	No, well, I completely agree. I mean, for me, it has to be normal not paranormal. In fact, I don't like the word parapsychology. I prefer psychic research.
2983520	2998520	And so, yes, I think there's an area there where Whitehead's ideas could be relevant to science in yet another way and much more mainstream area, which is that in developmental biology.
2998520	3009520	More and more people, some people use the concept of morphogenetic fields. Not in my sense, because that would be too provocative.
3009520	3017520	But more in Waddington sense of the word. And as you know, Waddington was very influenced by Whitehead. I don't know if you've tracked that.
3017520	3019520	Yeah, yeah.
3019520	3027520	But you know in his famous diagram of the creode, the canonized pathway of change.
3027520	3031520	You're familiar with that, are you? Yes.
3031520	3045520	Well, basically, when René Tom, the French mathematician, worked out, you know, the founder of catastrophe theory, worked out models for creodes in morphogenetic fields.
3045520	3056520	The end point of the creode he called the attractor, using the concept the attractor, which is in dynamics, you know, well-named concept in mathematical dynamics.
3056520	3068520	And basically, this leads to the idea that development is goal-directed, and it's a way in which teleology has been smuggled back in to science.
3068520	3075520	And the mathematicians who developed the dynamical attractor didn't know teleology was banned in science.
3075520	3081520	And, you know, they just made models, and this was a good way of making a model.
3081520	3093520	And in these models, interestingly, the ball rolling down the groove, or the basin of attraction, which is the principal metaphor in dynamics,
3093520	3098520	is basically a pudding basin you throw little marbles in and they all roll and end up at the bottom.
3098520	3103520	The source of the attraction in all these models is gravitation.
3103520	3111520	And personally, I think that gravitation is an attractive force. In other words, I think gravitation is a lure from the future.
3111520	3117520	It's usually treated as simply, you know, something in Newton's equations or something.
3117520	3126520	But if you think about it, what gravitation would do, left to its own devices, would pull the entire universe into an ultimate black hole,
3126520	3134520	into a final unity. Now, it's opposed by the dark energy, the expansive force that's making the universe expand.
3134520	3142520	But if you took away dark energy and left it to gravitation, the whole universe would begin collapsing inwards,
3142520	3149520	and stars and galaxies would amalgamate, and everything would finally implode in the opposite of the Big Bang, the Big Crunch.
3149520	3158520	And the ultimate attractor of gravity would be a final unity that mirrored the initial unity at the moment of the Big Bang.
3158520	3164520	And so I think gravitation is much, much more mysterious than most people assume.
3164520	3172520	You know, you just think, oh, we've got the equations of gravitation, no product, the masses, inverse square of the distance, gravitational constant.
3172520	3182520	Whitehead was, of course, very interested in this because his mathematical theory of general relativity made somewhat different predictions from Einstein's
3182520	3189520	and were allowed for variability in the gravitational constant, which actually happens.
3189520	3201520	So, I think that attractive forces, including gravitation, and teleological processes modeled by attractors in developmental biology,
3201520	3211520	goal directed development, are something which mechanistic science has nothing to say about, because teleology was amputated in the 17th century.
3211520	3217520	And it's been smuggled back in by these mathematical models, but not fully explicitly.
3217520	3229520	And so, teleology is the elephant in the room of modern science, and you need to have it to explain why we have purposes and why organisms are purposeful.
3229520	3240520	And when I was studying biology at school, I was told the very last thing you were allowed to say was to say, what is a wing for or an eye for, because that implies it's got a purpose.
3240520	3253520	You could say, why is it that natural selection worked on random variants, which gave an increased ability to see that could finally result through long perifersive random selection in an eye?
3253520	3257520	That was what you had to say. You couldn't say what's an eye for.
3257520	3268520	And, of course, the dishonesty in that is that living organisms already exist and they already have their ultimate purposes of survival and reproduction.
3268520	3277520	They're already purposive, and these structures serve their purposes. So they're within an already teleological system.
3277520	3285520	So personally, I've always found Aristotle much more helpful than any other philosopher in this respect, you know, with final causes.
3285520	3300520	And in a sense, you get a hint of that in Whitehead, but for when I'm thinking about that, I go back to Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas more than Whitehead because it's clearer to me.
3300520	3309520	But I think that in the context of modern science, people like Michael Levin at Tufts, I don't know if you're familiar with his work, but
3309520	3312520	I don't think so. What is he, what's his research?
3312520	3319520	He's by far the best and most interesting developmental biologist operating at the moment.
3319520	3324520	In my view, L-E-V-I-N.
3324520	3332520	And he's wrote a paper on morphogenetic fields and he's done fascinating work on morphogenesis.
3332520	3341520	You see, almost everyone in developmental biology is still obsessed with the bottom-up explanation in terms of genes and molecular biology.
3341520	3346520	And so he's very well, and I think he's aware of, like, Whitehead's work.
3346520	3352520	And he might be somebody that you could bring into your survey.
3352520	3356520	But, and Merlin's into Levin too.
3356520	3359520	And he's very, very prolific.
3359520	3363520	But let me give you an example of the kinds of experiments he's doing.
3363520	3370520	In one experiment, he trained flatworms, you know, which are very simple.
3370520	3378520	With high regenerative capacity, he trained them to avoid particular things on a standard learning, moving around, learning protocol.
3378520	3381520	Avoid colored light of a particular kind.
3381520	3385520	So you can train them, they learn, it's conditioned reflex type thing.
3385520	3391520	He then cut off their heads, where what little brain they have is located.
3391520	3394520	And within a few days, they regenerate a head.
3394520	3400520	And when they've regenerated the head, they remember everything they'd learned.
3400520	3401520	Fascinating.
3401520	3402520	Fascinating.
3402520	3415520	So you see, when he, I emailed him about that experiment, and I said, well, in his paper, he said, well, that suggests the memory must be stored, distributed throughout the whole body, not just in the central ganglion.
3415520	3417520	And perhaps the environment as well.
3417520	3419520	And perhaps the environment.
3419520	3426520	But he's got a motive behind all this, which is to move biology on to a much more holistic approach.
3426520	3436520	And for example, he's been studying the development of African Claude frog is an opus development.
3436520	3447520	And he's shown, if you look at the embryos, as they develop, he's got an electrically sensitive die, which reveals electrical potential differences.
3447520	3453520	So with living samples under the microscope, you can actually see the electric field around the embryo.
3453520	3462520	Now, of course, molecular biologists and genetic engineering people don't see electric fields because all they do is grind things up and analyze the genes.
3462520	3467520	And they don't look for electric fields invisible to them.
3467520	3473520	And then what you see is in the area that's going to become a face, two areas sort of light up.
3473520	3480520	And, and then another area that the eyes and the mouth sort of light up, you can actually see them under the microscope.
3480520	3491520	And as he points out, they've done all the genetic analysis. This is not because the mouse and the eye genes have been activated and giving signals that cause the change in electrical potential.
3491520	3499520	This electrical change occurs before the genes are activated and in fact seems to trigger the activation of the appropriate genes.
3499520	3507520	In other words, there's literally a field in this case an electrical field patterning the developing system.
3507520	3512520	Then of course the next question is what patterns the electrical field.
3512520	3521520	Now, he doesn't address that question because I think the answer would have to be a morphogenetic field, which I think work through electric fields.
3521520	3527520	But he's pushing up against the very limits of where you can go in contemporary biology.
3527520	3532520	You know, he's sticking to electricity. He doesn't mention me or morphogenetic fields.
3532520	3539520	And what Levin is doing is, is, and the stuff gets on the cover of science, non-nature and stuff.
3539520	3543520	And everyone says, what fascinating research and stuff.
3543520	3551520	And he always, his papers are always full of molecular biology data where he proves about the genes and claims the genes and that sort of thing.
3551520	3557520	So the people say, well, this is good science, you know, because it's familiar to them.
3557520	3566520	So he's the person who's, I would say today at the very frontier of where things are going and leading the way.
3566520	3569520	That's so wonderful. Thank you for sharing his research.
3569520	3582520	It's quite astonishing and it makes me, I'm profoundly grateful to the scientists who do the slow, difficult, detailed laboratory work of establishing these things.
3582520	3587520	I understand why he wants to be so careful not to speculate about its larger implications.
3587520	3598520	And maybe that's the role for philosophers to step in and, you know, look at his scientific work and say, well, this is what it might mean for the larger field of biology and the place of life in the universe.
3598520	3624520	It almost seems as though, I mean, from a Whiteheadian or a Berksonian point of view, the part of the living organism that we can see and weigh and that we call material is it's almost like the, it's the wake left behind a creative process that unfolds in a way that's
3624520	3629520	invisible to our normal capacities to to sense and measure.
3629520	3649520	It's the morphic field, perhaps, but it's, it's as if there's a creative unfolding occurring at a subtler level and what science materialistic science has been studying is the, is the material left in the wake of this creative process that's unfolding and trying to just, it's as if we're trying to understand what makes the
3649520	3653520	boat go by just studying the wake behind it, right?
3653520	3662520	And these thinkers like Whitehead or Berkson allow us to understand that we need to go deeper to understand the causal influences at play here.
3662520	3670520	Yes, and what's steering the boat and why it goes in one direction rather than another. I agree. It's a very good metaphor. We're looking at the wake.
3670520	3677520	Yes, I, yeah, I think that's very good metaphor.
3677520	3684520	So we've reached the end of our hour and I don't want to take too much more of your time. But if you'd like, if you can hang out for another 10 minutes, I have another.
3684520	3691520	Yeah, I'm happy to hang out longer. Yes. This is, I mean, these are things very close to my heart.
3691520	3699520	So, sort of a very different topic now that I'd like to ask you about.
3699520	3717520	In terms of the relationship between science and religion, Whitehead seems to me to offer a rather unique and promising approach to reintegrating them, not to collapse them, they're very different.
3717520	3735520	But they can be in a different kind of dialogue with one another that is perhaps mutually enhancing and enriching. And I think Whitehead offers us one way of understanding the role that science plays in human civilization and human life and the role that religion plays.
3735520	3745520	You know, Whitehead had a whole understanding of the evolution of religion in his small little book, Religion, the Making. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
3745520	3753520	I've not read it, but no. I'm just going to put on the light because it's getting dark here. Oh, sure, yeah.
3753520	3761520	And so I wonder, you know, if let me, let me briefly in a sentence or two summarize what Whitehead says about the evolution of religion.
3761520	3776520	Yeah, perfect. I'm sorry I didn't send my lighting crew out to give you a makeup and proper lighting and everything, but very low budget here, unfortunately.
3776520	3800520	So in his book, Religion and the Making, Whitehead describes this evolution of humanity from sort of primal tribal context where through certain play behaviors that are very common among all mammals, but especially among human beings where we have this prolonged period of childhood, where the parents are
3800520	3820520	finding the food and protecting the young from predators and whatnot. It produces a relaxed field where the normal pressures of the environment are subdued and through this play behavior as it gets elaborated in the evolution of our species.
3820520	3837520	Early human beings began to recognize the way in which certain movements, dance, song would reliably produce certain states of consciousness, certain emotions, certain experiences of the newness or transcendent.
3837520	3855520	And that gradually these these performances of dance and music became ritual and then they were symbolically elaborated and then eventually myth and narrative began to be developed and then eventually we entered the stage of what Whitehead calls rational
3855520	3877520	religion where you get theology and whole elaborate cosmologies, but for Whitehead it's all rooted in ritual play and ceremony and feasts and the practical dimension of religious life, you know, gathering together and participating in a dimension of reality.
3878520	3893520	And then that would be the source of religion for Whitehead and the ground of the religious feeling, religious emotion and religious insight, rather than the way I think modern people typically understand religion as a set of beliefs in something.
3893520	3907520	As you believe in whatever the dogma is or the teaching is, then you are a member about religion. Whitehead saying religion is not about believing in a certain set of information, it's about practices of transformation.
3907520	3922520	And that most of these practices are very embodied or they involve eating, feasting or communion of some kind that you're participating in a bodily way in these transcendent dimensions.
3922520	3938520	I wonder if, given your exposure to Whitehead, if you think that his approach allows us to have a new kind of dialogue to avoid this culture war that continues between science and religion.
3938520	3950520	And what ways do you see Whitehead's view being helpful and what is your own view of how science and religion can come into a more harmonious relationship?
3950520	3961520	Well, it's very similar to his actually. I didn't know that aspect of his work, but I don't know. Have you seen my two recent books, Science and Spiritual Practices?
3961520	3963520	I haven't read it yet though, yes.
3963520	3971520	And Ways to Go Beyond and Why They Work. These are two books, each book I deal with seven different spiritual practices.
3971520	3987520	And what I say is more or less what you just said that religion is not primarily about beliefs. I mean atheists like to frame it as being a set of absurd beliefs that are rationally untenable in which they've refuted.
3987520	3992520	That's not the way it actually is for most religious people.
3992520	4010520	And, you know, I'm a regular church going Anglican Christian and when I go to church, I'm pretty sure that if you asked most people what they actually believed after saying the creed, you'd come up with a whole set of different answers.
4010520	4020520	Somebody actually did a survey of this kind recently and they found almost everyone had a different interpretation or understanding of it or misunderstanding.
4020520	4028520	So it's not, I mean the creed is a statement I believe it's the one bit of the service which actually is about beliefs.
4028520	4032520	And, and it's by no means uniform.
4032520	4050520	So, no, my science and spiritual practices the the first book science and spiritual practices. I have a chapter on meditation, connecting with nature, gratitude, singing and chanting pilgrimage rituals.
4050520	4055520	And what's the other one.
4055520	4060520	There's another one. It'll come to me.
4060520	4076520	And then ways to go beyond. I have traps on sports which I think is the main way in the modern world people enter altered states of consciousness, learning from animals, which bring us into the present prayer.
4076520	4095520	Early days and festivals, spiritual openings through psychedelics and morality basically being kind, you know, kind of ethical dimension.
4096520	4104520	I did. And what I show in these books is that these practices are common to practically all religions.
4104520	4108520	You know, they all have fast. Oh fasting. That's the other one.
4108520	4121520	And this fasting mean Jewish people fast at Yom Kippur, Muslims in Ramadan, Christians in Lent Hindus have lots of fasting days shamanic cultures fast before rites of passage and so on.
4121520	4128520	And yet, and you can study physical you all these are things you can study all of these practices have measurable effects.
4128520	4145520	And the general conclusion from thousands of papers that have now been written on the effects of spiritual and religious practices shows that people who have these practices are healthier, happier and live longer than those that don't on average.
4146520	4156520	Conversely, those that don't have them are unhealthier, unhappier and shorter than those that do. That's why I think militant atheism should come with a health warning.
4157520	4161520	So the.
4161520	4182520	So I completely agree with that approach of white heads and I think what I'd add to that though is that one of the things that is absolutely key to many religious traditions is mystical experience and mystical experience can come through practices can also come spontaneously.
4182520	4190520	You know, some people have near death experiences they don't go out saying I want to be in an accident so I can nearly die.
4190520	4200520	They have an accident and then as part of the accident they nearly die and then they find this is floating out of the body, going into the light, their lives are changed.
4200520	4202520	And these have happened.
4202520	4205520	It's in Plato, the myth of earth.
4206520	4216520	You know, these people have had these people have had these for millennia, and they give this sense of being part of a much greater consciousness than our own.
4216520	4225520	They happen spontaneously they happen as a result of spiritual practices they can happen as a result of psychedelics and some traditional cultures have taken psychedelics.
4225520	4233520	You know, the Eleusinian mystery is so ma we don't know what they were but they were clearly taking something.
4233520	4247520	I would say in addition to Whitehead, his list of things which I completely agree with that approach that mystical experience is probably the most key thing I mean, the Buddha didn't get enlightened through doing a PhD.
4247520	4254520	He got enlightened through sitting under trees meditating for many years and exploring consciousness from within.
4254520	4261520	And so mystical experiences direct exploration of consciousness is one thing.
4261520	4279520	And then I think dreams is another because I think a lot of the figures in visionary experience and indeed psychedelic visionary experience are akin to the dream world and you could say that there are different ways of accessing that same world of the
4279520	4284520	imagination, which we all have access to every night in our dreams.
4284520	4288520	And I would say that's another major ingredient.
4288520	4305520	So, I think singing together, chanting together dancing together all those things that Whitehead says are key parts and rituals and rights of passage we know that early cultures had burials and stuff and mean very early in human history.
4305520	4308520	So there must have been rights of passage.
4308520	4326520	And those rights of passage are related to the idea that there's a life after this and so life after this the evidence for that would come from near death experiences from shamanic trans mediumship and communication of the departed, which is common in many shamanic cultures,
4326520	4333520	and also encountering the departed in your dreams, which most of us have done.
4333520	4348520	And I would say that that that is an approach. And of course it's not totally different from William James, who the seven types of religious experience is is not about belief it's about experience.
4348520	4362520	Certainly and I don't think there is safe play to another philosopher that was more influential influential on Whitehead than William James, and certainly his huge study varieties of religious experience.
4362520	4368520	He was in the background you know Whitehead quotes James and his little book religion in the making.
4368520	4387520	And I think James was James's view of the experiential dimension of religion is really what's motivating Whitehead's view and so the way Whitehead would put it is that, you know, he has this critique of what he calls the bifurcation of nature,
4387520	4404520	the idea would be human consciousness is on one side and then the mechanical world of nature is on the other side and nature is just mute matter in motion, and then human consciousness has sense and sounds and poetry and value and all of this
4404520	4411520	says no no no it's it's continuous human beings are part of the universe and in the context of religion.
4411520	4430520	The history of human spiritual and religious experience is a part it's part of the data that we need to include if we want to understand this universe because we are beings emergent from this cosmological evolutionary process and so of course part of that process
4430520	4442520	means the history of religious experience that's all data that needs to be part of what we include in our interpretation of the universe.
4442520	4458520	And so that's that's what follows from eliminating this bifurcation of nature and Whitehead's view that religion is, if you want, I mean I know then it Daniel then it would say this but I mean it in a different way, a Whiteheadian way, religion is a natural phenomenon.
4458520	4462520	It's part of what the universe does in its human form.
4462520	4474520	Right and so I completely agree, you know, I'm, and I think that, you know, some of the most interesting thinking at the moment about these things is in the leading edges of theology.
4474520	4477520	I don't know if you follow the theological literature at all.
4477520	4479520	I tried to.
4479520	4484520	But then my favorite see a legends David Bentley Hart, I don't know if you've come across his book.
4484520	4487520	He writes about imagination a lot doesn't he.
4487520	4494520	He does do but the one I like most is a book called the experience of God being consciousness bliss.
4494520	4512520	And what he shows is that there's a kind of Trinitarian understanding which many religions explicitly or implicitly have in common and what unites them is much much closer than what separates them it's as much more in common.
4512520	4522520	And basically, the being consciousness bliss obviously is from Sat Chit Ananda and the Hindu.
4522520	4535520	But the ground of being a conscious being is the ground of all things then Chit is that which is known names and forms and I'm a Rupa or forms and ideas.
4535520	4538520	I mean, we'd like the platonic realm in a sense.
4538520	4550520	And then ananda this is ultimate consciousness is joyful, which is why mystical experiences are usually blissful because we link into that experience.
4550520	4559520	And, but another aspect you see is the dynamical principle in the Christian version, God the father is is conscious being in the present.
4559520	4564520	I am that I am his first revelation to Moses.
4564520	4580520	Then the Logos the second person Trinity God the son Logos is not just Jesus of Nazareth it's it's the, you know, the principle through which all things were made as it says in the Creed, you know, this is the word of God through which all things were made.
4580520	4593520	It's the name and form principle or the platonic idea principle which St Augustine and other early theologians were platonists and or or neoplatonists and that's what got built in.
4593520	4609520	And then the spirit, the Holy Spirit is the dynamical principle of movement and change the energy flow light flight of the bird flames of fire all the images of the spirit breath movement.
4609520	4621520	And so you have the created world, grounded in the being of God the father who sustains all things from moment to moment and without who's being everything would vanish and disappear.
4621520	4632520	It's expressed through these two principles the formative principle, the word or Logos which I think of as fields, and the moving principle which I think of as energy.
4632520	4650520	And then you look at modern science, what's nature consists of its fields and energy sustained by some kind of ground of being that keeps them in operation from moment to moment fields of what give form energy is what gives flow change movement.
4651520	4661520	And the so called laws of nature that govern fields and energy there, but the they're not part of nature they're sort of our abstraction from it.
4661520	4675520	But anyway, David Bentley Hart's view on this is, I don't know if he mentions Whitehead, but he's, he's, it's a wonderful work of synthesis he's highly intelligent and really interesting writer.
4675520	4688520	And I recommend taking a look at his, his work, because I think I don't think he brings it into process, he doesn't bring process theology explicitly into his synthesis.
4688520	4702520	But, and I mean process theology is a kind of niche, not very well known subdivision of theology, I mean it's big in Clermont, obviously, but in, you know, when I talked to other.
4702520	4718520	I went to a wonderful conference in Cambridge last year, she was one of the biggest theological conferences for a long time, the biggest in the sense, big ideas, and it may not have been the most numerous but all the big headers were there including David Bentley Hart,
4718520	4729520	Rowan Williams, and so on. And there were Jewish theologians, Muslim theologians, Hindu the, anyway, it was called Neutronitarian ontologies.
4729520	4742520	And so really what they, what's so interesting you see is that we're seeing this as a fundamental ontology, through which we can understand nature, and, and God is not in that view.
4742520	4753520	It's supernatural. The expression of the divine being is through nature, and God, it's sort of pan-antheistic, God's in nature and nature's in God.
4753520	4763520	And I would say the leading edge of serious theology, that's where they're going, all the most interesting theological thinkers at the moment.
4763520	4780520	Because we've had decades of sort of word analysis and biblical criticism and did Jesus really say that. And, and so we have lots and lots of that kind of theology. This is much, much more interesting and much deeper and much more compatible with the kind of things you're
4780520	4783520	interested in, the time you're interested in.
4783520	4797520	Right, right. There's a chapter in one of Whitehead's books, Adventures of Ideas, which he published in 1933, it's called The New Reformation.
4797520	4800520	I'm not sure if you've read this book, but in this chapter.
4800520	4803520	I haven't read it, I've already decided it too.
4803520	4821520	So what you're saying about the importance of a Trinitarian understanding reminds me of what Whitehead says in this chapter, where he, he describes these three different culminating phases in the history of Western theology and philosophy,
4821520	4827520	beginning with the Plato's idea of participation.
4827520	4840520	And then Jesus is in Whitehead's terms exemplification of this idea, and then the elaboration of the Trinity by the early Christian fathers.
4840520	4860520	Whitehead thinks that this, these three phases of theological development of this, this important, not only idea, but as exemplified by Jesus and as elaborated theologically by the early Christian theologians that
4860520	4876520	we need to return to that, that matrix of ideas to rejuvenate the importance of, of Trinitarian thinking, not only for our religious life today, but for our scientific understanding of nature as well.
4876520	4887520	It's a very interesting chapter that I think was really seminal for the elaboration of process theology, particularly in a Christian context.
4887520	4889520	So I recommend that to you.
4889520	4893520	I'll take a look at that, and the chapter's name again, I need to write it down.
4893520	4895520	The New Reformation.
4895520	4900520	New.
4900520	4916520	Yeah, very good. I mean, that's, yes, that's, that's exactly the kind of thing I'm, I'm so interested in and, and the, in my book, ways to go beyond and why they work.
4916520	4926520	In the last chapter, I try and integrate why it is that all these different spiritual practices that are so different can all be spiritual practices.
4926520	4929520	And again, I relate that to the Trinity.
4929520	4936520	You know, if insofar as sports can be a spiritual practice or dancing, these are about movement.
4936520	4943520	And those, I think, and singing, and those are aligned with the spirit, which is the principle of movement.
4943520	4952520	Insofar as contemplating the beauty of a flower can be a spiritual practice or a beautiful building like a cathedral or a temple.
4952520	4958520	Then that's more like the log, as you're relating to the sort of name and form aspect of the ultimate.
4958520	4970520	Insofar as through meditation, you reach a state of utter stillness and the sense of ground of being, you're relating to the site to the, you know, the ground of being.
4970520	4978520	So I think these different spiritual practices have different emphases and relate to this Trinitarian model.
4978520	4985520	And incidentally, although it's elaborated by Christian theologians.
4985520	4992520	In many elaborations, the seeds of it are all present in, you know, the first few verses of the book of Genesis.
4992520	5000520	You know, the world was that form in the beginning, the world was that form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.
5000520	5003520	The spirit of God moved over the face of the deep.
5003520	5013520	The spirit is wind. I mean, Ruach in Hebrew and what happens when wind moves over the face of the deep or the ocean or the primal chaos is waves.
5013520	5015520	I mean, that's what you get.
5015520	5027520	So the first thing is waves, a process of waves, which is one reason, as I understand it, Whitehead thought quantum theory revealed this process thing because waves can't be localized as an instant.
5027520	5030520	You can't have a wave as an instant.
5030520	5039520	And so the first thing is all the chapter to Genesis is waves, a process and and God said, let there be light.
5039520	5045520	Then you have the creative logos, the word, obviously the spoken word.
5045520	5051520	And the spoken word is about form structure.
5051520	5065520	And indeed, the primary metaphor in the Jewish and the Christian model of the Trinity is speaking, because like I'm speaking now, unless there was not for breath, the words in my mind would be silent.
5065520	5067520	Just inside my mind.
5067520	5072520	If I adjust the breath, it's a kind of white noise, no structure.
5072520	5081520	But speaking is you have the breath, we've already got the breath in verse two, or verse one, which in the spirit of God moved over the face of the deep.
5081520	5090520	And God said, then there's the first word that they'd be like, it creates structure, form, it separates light from darkness.
5090520	5091520	It differentiates.
5091520	5096520	It's, it's, it's chipped. It's the contents of consciousness as in such it's an end.
5096520	5104520	It's not the consciousness itself. It's that which is known as opposed to the never and and of course they're all unified.
5104520	5110520	So I would say this model is absolutely fundamental to the whole Judeo-Christian tradition.
5110520	5112520	Yes, yes.
5112520	5120520	And it strikes me that when we're talking about something as profound as the creation of the world.
5120520	5132520	You know, we can turn to Genesis or many other creation stories that the world's various religious traditions have articulated to get at this mystery.
5132520	5145520	And that when, when physical cosmologists try to talk about the beginning of the universe, they try to do it as if they could be purely empirical and rational and scientific but almost always,
5145520	5149520	inevitably, I hear them doing theology.
5149520	5164520	And as far as I can tell, the best kind of theology that one can do would be conscious deliberate theology in dialogue with the history of this tradition of trying to think about or maybe think with the divine.
5164520	5170520	We better do that consciously rather than pretending we're not doing it because then we're liable to do bad theology.
5171520	5179520	Absolutely. I mean, what's that chap who read the universe from nothing that American Lawrence Krause Lawrence Krause.
5179520	5187520	Yes, I was in a debate at a philosophy festival last year where somebody was defending Lawrence Krause's view of the universe from nothing.
5187520	5194520	And I said that, you know, what struck me about it was so theologically conservative.
5194520	5205520	He has the principle of logos, the laws of nature, they're there at the very beginning, the universe comes in because the laws of nature already there before the universe.
5205520	5217520	And then he has the primal energy, the quantum fluctuation that gives rise to the whole universe. He has the spirit, the, the dynamical principle that gives rise to the universe.
5218520	5226520	So he's got these two elements of a Trinitarian model and the laws of nature imply a mind in which they exist.
5226520	5235520	The only difference is that conventional theology, the ultimate being that gives rise to it all is conscious and joyful.
5235520	5242520	Whereas Lawrence Krause's model, it's unconscious and joy less otherwise the models in the same.
5242520	5250520	Yeah, I've had a number of conversations with physicists who say, look, we don't need God to explain the universe. We know the laws.
5250520	5257520	We can understand how it all works together to produce the world that we see. And, you know, I just asked the simple question, well, where did the laws come from?
5257520	5266520	And they, they all of a sudden get all uncomfortable and say, well, well, that's a philosophical issue and maybe we'll understand it one day, but I don't have anything to say about that.
5266520	5270520	But it's like, well, that's the very foundation of what you're arguing.
5270520	5276520	It's laws all the way down.
5276520	5284520	So one final question for you and then I'll let you go. I'm sure you want to go eat dinner.
5284520	5286520	I really appreciate your time, Rupert.
5286520	5290520	No, it's just fun. I'm really enjoying this.
5290520	5297520	So the final question I think is in a very whiteheadian spirit. Whitehead was a very humble man.
5297520	5311520	And it was said that he actually his, his will asked for his all of his papers to be destroyed because he didn't want graduate students to be pouring through them searching for the secret to his philosophy.
5311520	5321520	His family, his family did not follow his wishes. His papers were recently everyone thought they were all destroyed but they were recently discovered that there's a whole group.
5321520	5332520	I think out of Edinburgh University that the Whitehead research project that's scanning all of this material and publishing some of it and making it available.
5332520	5335520	But in any event, you know, Whitehead was very humble.
5335520	5346520	He wouldn't have wanted people to consider process in reality as some sort of a revealed, you know, new, new religion that people have to just learn and stick to.
5346520	5355520	He would want the research and philosophy and science to continue, maybe draw on his ideas but don't be afraid to tinker with them and expand them.
5355520	5365520	So in that spirit, I wonder if there's something in Whitehead's work that you've come across that you feel like, no, I don't think he got that quite right.
5365520	5371520	Or maybe there's another approach to this and, you know, Whitehead went down the wrong track on that issue.
5371520	5384520	I wonder if there's anything like that that you've encountered in his work.
5384520	5395520	I can't say that there is exactly. I mean, I could, what I could say is I wish he'd written more clearly or I wish he made his views less obscure.
5395520	5400520	I don't really think that.
5400520	5408520	I don't, I haven't studied his theology well enough to, to know exactly.
5408520	5423520	I mean, I think he, what bits I have looked at, it doesn't seem that he was very up to speed with theology and the theological tradition, maybe he was but
5424520	5428520	that
5428520	5435520	I think he could have paid more attention to the mystical side of religion and, you know, mystical insight.
5435520	5442520	It's rather rationalistic and he started as a mathematician and sort of very mind based.
5442520	5457520	So I think more of a kind of mystical dimension, but I mean that comes in, I suppose, via William James and his approach to religion.
5457520	5470520	I don't think there's anything there that, and again, for me, the philosopher who's influenced me more than Whitehead as I said is Berkson because Berkson writes very clearly and he's a pleasure to read.
5471520	5478520	Whitehead is, is not clear and a lot of it and is not a pleasure to read.
5478520	5490520	That's what Whitehead says about Berkson actually is in a lecture, one of his early lectures at Harvard, he says that, you know, basically I'm summarizing that Berkson is such a pleasure and a joy to read.
5490520	5501520	But Whitehead, the mathematician and logician actually thought he said that, you know, but it's never quite clear what Berkson's trying to say, which is interesting because when I read him, like, like you're saying, it's pretty clear.
5501520	5510520	But Whitehead, the logician wants to know in more with more precise mathematical rigor, exactly what's implied by the literary beauty of Berkson's writing.
5511520	5520520	So, no, I don't think there's anything where I've sort of come across something Whitehead, but I think that's just wrong.
5520520	5528520	There's lots of places I think it's unclear or perhaps inadequate or could be developed further and that sort of thing.
5528520	5533520	But I don't know that there's anything I've come across, I feel no, that's wrong.
5533520	5549520	And you see, I think that where he's read one final point about his relevance today is that with this panpsychist turn that's going on at the moment in philosophy of mind, you know, people like Philip Goff and
5549520	5551520	I'll be talking to him soon too.
5552520	5569520	Well, you see, I think that Whitehead is so much more interesting, because basically the current theme of these panpsychists to solve the hard problem by endowing matter with an extra quality consciousness, awareness or experience.
5570520	5576520	But basically, that's, they just think they can solve the hard problem that way.
5576520	5583520	The reason where this has come out in a debate was on the parapsychology discussion list.
5583520	5589520	There was a discussion recently about, you know, here are all these panpsychists.
5589520	5595520	Does it help in understanding psi phenomena, parapsychological phenomena?
5595520	5605520	And I actually asked Philip Goff, you know, and he said no, you know, because basically everything stays the same, we just interpret it differently.
5605520	5606520	Yeah.
5606520	5617520	And I don't even think he thinks that consciousness has any causal influence on the behavior of matter, it's just sort of the witness that's going along for the ride.
5617520	5619520	Parallel phenomenon.
5619520	5620520	Yes.
5620520	5635520	Well, that's it. So that's why you see, I think that since that kind of panpsychism is becoming more and more predominant and actually respectable and academically, if not orthodox, at least respectable.
5635520	5641520	That's another area where I think the Whitehead approach to panpsychism is so much more interesting.
5641520	5651520	It's got something to tell us over and above just getting rid of the hard problem by a few armchair speculations or a flurry of words.
5651520	5660520	It's actually can deliver something. And that's why when I was writing my paper on is the sun conscious.
5660520	5673520	The Whiteheadian approach is actually, you know, treating consciousness as considering possible actions. The sun's mind deciding where to send out a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection.
5673520	5684520	It's not just parallel to the activity of the sun. It's something does something. And that's why I think that the Whiteheadian approach.
5684520	5695520	That's probably the thing which has most to offer today as together with a deeper understanding of teleology and biology and indeed pictures a whole.
5695520	5698520	Yes, exactly.
5698520	5713520	I think when I wrote this journal article which I shared with you about Whitehead's relevance to this emerging panpsychist paradigm in analytic philosophy of mind.
5713520	5725520	Because it seems to me that, yes, Whitehead is a kind of panpsychist, but unlike Philip Goff and other analytic philosophers who are toying with panpsychism.
5725520	5746520	Whitehead has a process relational ontology that grounds his panpsychism whereas, for the most part what I've seen is in analytic philosophy, it's still working within a Whitehead we call a substance property ontology which goes back to Aristotle and in so many ways, I think Whitehead is very Aristotelian.
5746520	5764520	Aristotle is a neoplatonist, right, you know, but Whitehead's taking Aristotle's organic philosophy and putting it on a processional ground instead of a substance ground and, you know, we can still think of, I think Aristotle's understanding of substance was very dynamic.
5764520	5766520	You know, these weren't static substances.
5766520	5774520	About becoming about becoming in final causes and and that's very process oriented, I would have thought.
5774520	5788520	I think Whitehead wants to open it up a little bit more to make room for evolutionary emergence in a way that maybe in Aristotle's sense of a more stable cosmos.
5788520	5795520	Whitehead sort of pushes the great chain of being over on its side so that it unrolls into the future.
5795520	5809520	But yes, this I think Whitehead's panpsychism on this process oriented ontological basis is as different from the substance oriented panpsychisms like Goff as it is for materialism.
5809520	5820520	So there's a real difference here in the way that Whitehead is approaching panpsychism that I'm hoping to get into when I when I speak to Philip Goff at next month.
5820520	5823520	So stay tuned for that.
5823520	5830520	Sure paper. I thought you brought this out very well. In fact, it helped clarify for me the difference between that.
5830520	5842520	Okay, so I very much hope that you're able to sort of express possibly express Whitehead's ideas in non Whiteheadian language.
5842520	5851520	That's what you're trying to do, you know, to to bring this into this debate, because it's not just looking back at the history of philosophy.
5851520	5855520	I think very relevant in these areas, which is obviously why you're doing this.
5855520	5866520	Yes, yes. Definitely. Well, thank you so much, Rupert. This has been such an enjoyable conversation.
5866520	5878520	And I think that others will enjoy it. I know John Cobb will be thrilled to listen to our to our dialogue here and keep up the good work.
5878520	5891520	I think the efforts that you've been making over decades to push the scientific establishment to be more scientific are paying off slowly but surely.
5891520	5897520	And so thank you for your work and thank you for this conversation today.
5897520	5906520	Well, thank you, Matt. I'm so glad you're doing what you're doing. I mean, I couldn't think of in philosophy is one of the most important things to be doing right now.
5907520	5926520	I'm very much appreciated. And I'm thrilled that you and Manin have linked up in this way because, you know, there's a lot more mileage in this in biology and in philosophy and hopefully by interacting over years to come, you'll both be able to carry it further forward, a lot further forward.
5926520	5946520	Oh, I hope so. You know, I'm not a scientist and I love to make friends with scientists so that I can learn more from them and try to integrate it into a philosophical speculative philosophical paradigm that then influences future scientists to ask certain questions that maybe they wouldn't have asked.
5946520	5954520	I definitely look forward to the remaining in conversation with Merlin and with you and I also enjoy Cosmos music.
5954520	5961520	I was listening to that on my drive. So very talented family.
5961520	5965520	Well, very good. Well, hopefully to be continued sooner or later.
5965520	5967520	I would love that. I would love that.
5967520	5968520	Good.
5968520	5972520	All right, Robert. Well, you have a good night and let's stay in touch.
5972520	5974520	Bye for now.
5974520	5975520	Bye.
