1. **Laser Level Check**: Before installing the joists, use a laser level to check for any settlement of the hangers or blocks. This prevents having to adjust everything later if some hangers are higher than others.

2. **New Chalk Line**: After the concrete has set, draw a new chalk line as a reference for hanging the joists. This ensures that the joists align with the intended height, even though the original chalk line from before the concrete set won't move.

3. **Alignment**: Use a 2x4 to check and adjust the alignment of each joist against the reference chalk line. Make minor adjustments using shims if necessary to ensure the joists are perfectly straight, which will prevent issues with flooring and baseboard installation later on.

4. **Subfloor Installation**: Ensure that the subfloor is flush with the top of the concrete for a smooth finish. This step is crucial as it sets the stage for the rest of the construction.

5. **Advantages of Completing to the Roof**: By continuing to install the ICF walls all the way to the roof, you gain several benefits including resilience, wind resistance, sound resistance, continuous insulation, thermal mass, and more. These advantages are due to the nature of ICF construction, which provides a monolithic structure with superior performance in terms of energy efficiency and durability.

6. **Simplicity of Continuation**: The process of installing joists and hangers to the roof is straightforward and easy once the footings and lower levels are complete. It's a natural progression in the build process that takes advantage of the ICF system's capabilities.

7. **Efficiency and Time Savings**: By carefully planning and executing each step, you can save time and effort later on in the construction process. Attention to detail at this stage means fewer corrections needed during finishing touches like flooring and baseboards.

In summary, completing the joist and hanger installation all the way to the roof with Levan hangers is a logical next step after laying the footings and lower ICF walls. It's a process that, once forethought and planning are applied, can be done efficiently and effectively, setting you up for a successful build with all the benefits of an ICF home.
