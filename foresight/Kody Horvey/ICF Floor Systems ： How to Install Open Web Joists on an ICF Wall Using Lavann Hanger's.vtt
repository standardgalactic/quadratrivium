00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
So on this episode, what I want to discuss is how to hang a floor-dry system from an ICF wall

00:06.240 --> 00:12.240
so we can take the ICF right to the roof. And it's very simple. I want to show you that you

00:12.240 --> 00:18.240
don't have to cap yourself. You can use ICF past just the basement, right? So just kind of open

00:18.240 --> 00:24.080
your mind. It's easy to do and there's tons of advantages. You hear of lots of stories where

00:24.080 --> 00:28.480
someone's like, oh man, like, I know a guy who has an ICF basement. Oh, it's the best. Like,

00:28.560 --> 00:35.120
he loves it. It's super warm in the winter, you know, nice and cool in the summer. It's a beauty

00:35.120 --> 00:42.160
thing. So my point today is, why not just take that to the roof of your house? That's what we do on

00:42.160 --> 00:49.280
a day-to-day basis. That's kind of our niche is we do full ICF houses. So if you look up here,

00:49.280 --> 00:56.080
you can see where we got a bunch of hangers inserted into the wall. And that's where we're

00:56.080 --> 01:01.680
going to hang the floor from. But I'll just kind of back up a little bit and I'll show you

01:02.800 --> 01:09.200
how we got there. When we start stacking this block, we'll get, you know, say three rows high.

01:09.200 --> 01:16.160
We won't have any of this bracing up. Then before we put our bracing, so these are what

01:16.160 --> 01:22.320
we call the shields. And this is what holds the whole wall together. It allows you to straighten

01:22.320 --> 01:28.000
your walls. It holds your scaffold up so you can have something stand on while you pour the concrete.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.960
But before you put the shields up, you have to do a floor layout. So just a little bit of forethought.

01:35.600 --> 01:42.720
So what we do is we got three rows high. We lay out our floor joist system based off our floor

01:42.720 --> 01:51.760
layout. So these, this is a three and a half inch wide, 20 inch high, open webbed floor joist

01:51.760 --> 02:00.800
at two foot on center. So here's one joist. Here's another joist. And here's another joist.

02:01.520 --> 02:08.160
So we do a full layout. Then we know where to put our shields so that they're not in the way of a

02:08.160 --> 02:14.400
floor joist or in the way of a hanger. So let's jump up top. I'll show you the hanger system we're

02:14.400 --> 02:19.920
using today. A couple more tips on what to keep in mind so that once the concrete's placed,

02:20.560 --> 02:25.840
you can hang your floor simply. It just keeps everything easy. And then you just keep stacking

02:25.840 --> 02:32.640
block from there. A whole bunch of steps later, a bunch of block, rebar obviously. You set all

02:32.640 --> 02:38.960
your bracing up your scaffold so you can walk. Then you're at a point where you can start setting

02:38.960 --> 02:44.720
your hangers in at the height that you need. So whatever you need for your basement slab

02:44.720 --> 02:50.800
and the ceiling height in your basement, figure all that out. Now what's worked out really well

02:50.800 --> 03:00.640
here is after our shields, they're 10 feet high. We've actually gone and chalked out the top of

03:00.720 --> 03:08.240
our subfloor right here. So we've set up our laser level. We can chalk this line above all these

03:08.240 --> 03:14.320
shields so that they're not in the way. Works beauty. Then we just measured from the top there

03:14.320 --> 03:20.000
to the bottom of our hangers. So in this scenario, it's 20 and three quarters, 20 inch for the open

03:20.000 --> 03:26.160
web joist, three quarters of an inch for our subfloor. Once you have all that information,

03:27.120 --> 03:28.640
then you can insert your hangers.

03:33.920 --> 03:39.360
So this is the Levan hanger. What's nice about it, I just have to do two vertical cuts

03:39.920 --> 03:46.560
so I can put this hanger anywhere in the whole, in the whole ICF system. I'm not limited to anything.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.800
Now once I know my heights, then I just basically do my two vertical cuts

03:53.440 --> 03:55.360
and I slide these bad boys in place.

04:07.360 --> 04:16.880
Like so. Then what we've done here is because I can't actually screw through the hanger into a tie,

04:17.680 --> 04:24.000
we've had to do this two by four ledger, which is just a perfect distance down from the top of

04:24.000 --> 04:30.400
our subfloor. Screw it to the webs. Then I screw my hanger down to it.

04:34.880 --> 04:42.960
That prevents any settling or potentially any lifting of the hangers. I'll spray foam the hangers

04:42.960 --> 04:47.760
in place so that the concrete doesn't want to tip them forward. I still need to run rebar

04:48.480 --> 04:53.120
through the two holes on the inside of the wall. So those two holes on the back of the hanger

04:53.120 --> 05:00.640
will run rebar through those. And then we got a little more prep work to do,

05:00.640 --> 05:07.600
but then we're ready to, or then we're ready to pour the concrete. Now another couple elements that

05:08.160 --> 05:14.480
in this viewpoint is this is going to be the front entry of the house. So you see a secondary

05:14.480 --> 05:20.000
chalk line. We actually just got to cut this down for our door buck and there's a few elements

05:20.000 --> 05:24.800
there that I won't share today, but you do have to think ahead. Make sure you get your doors in

05:24.800 --> 05:30.000
position because when we pour, we're going to pour our concrete up here about halfway in this block

05:30.560 --> 05:35.840
and then it'll taper down and we'll just go nice and level across the bottom of where the

05:35.840 --> 05:41.520
future door is going to go for the main floor. The best thing about this Levan hanger system is

05:42.160 --> 05:48.560
it doesn't take a whole lot of forethought. You know, a few tricks that I've showed you right now,

05:48.560 --> 05:55.760
then you pour it. It's after that, it's simply set the beams in your beam pockets,

05:55.760 --> 06:03.040
couple teleposts. You just drop your floor joists in place and away you go. It's pretty much done.

06:03.040 --> 06:08.400
So it's a very simple system, a little thinking ahead of time, but then when it comes to setting

06:08.400 --> 06:30.400
the floor, it's quick and easy. So this is the next step. You can see that it's a lot cleaner

06:30.400 --> 06:36.080
job site. We've poured the concrete, we've stripped down our bracing, and now we're ready to land the

06:36.080 --> 06:41.440
floor system. So we'll simply, we'll just put in our center beams, we'll land the floors, but we'll

06:41.440 --> 06:46.240
show you that as we go. And then it's just easy to keep going on, taking this thing to the roof.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.200
Let's check out how simple it was just to land those joists and those hangers. So we put a little

06:53.200 --> 06:59.600
forethought into the hangers, but then after that we just simply drop them in place. We sheet the

06:59.600 --> 07:04.880
floor and then we'll just jump up top and we'll just do the ICF right from the main floor and

07:04.880 --> 07:10.480
take it to the roof. But let's take a look at these hangers. The first thing you're going to want to do

07:10.480 --> 07:16.800
is just take your laser level and just go around the whole building and try to just figure out,

07:17.840 --> 07:23.680
you know, if some of the hangers settled or if some of the blocks settled, figure out which

07:23.680 --> 07:28.400
hanger is the highest and then just kind of base everything off of that. Just kind of get an idea

07:29.040 --> 07:35.360
what's happening. Because the worst thing is if you set all your joists too low and then a couple

07:35.360 --> 07:39.360
hangers were high and then you had to adjust everything else. So it's just kind of one of those

07:39.360 --> 07:46.080
four thought things. But the other, the other thing to point out with when you're hanging this

07:46.080 --> 07:53.120
system is don't go by your original chalk line that we had the other day. You'll want to chalk

07:53.120 --> 08:00.560
a brand new line and it's just a reference line. So I think what we did here is the joists are 20

08:00.560 --> 08:08.880
inches high. We went 21 and a half. We chalk a brand new line because then that's deadly,

08:08.880 --> 08:15.920
the concrete set and nothing is going to move. This, this line will have a 20 inch joist and

08:15.920 --> 08:22.960
then what we can do is you can see we've got a string line here. We can put a 2x4 on top of

08:22.960 --> 08:29.680
the hanger or we can put a 2x4 on the top of the joist and slide it up and make sure it's bang

08:29.680 --> 08:34.320
on with the chalk line. And then if we just need to tweak and put a little shim in there just to

08:34.320 --> 08:41.120
get it perfect, that's what we do. The most important thing at this stage is to make sure that the

08:41.120 --> 08:47.280
joists are all perfectly straight. Because if you just throw these in and yeah, we've done a good job

08:47.280 --> 08:52.640
of putting the hangers in who we're going to be very close. But if there is a little wave and you

08:52.640 --> 08:58.720
put hardwood flooring in and when you put your baseboard down you might have to scribe the baseboard

08:58.720 --> 09:04.720
in order to match. So if you just put a little more effort into this then it'll save you down the

09:04.720 --> 09:09.520
road when you're finishing. And that just goes with construction in general. It's just doing a

09:09.520 --> 09:14.560
little bit now to save yourself time later. Just in case I freaked a few of you out talking about

09:14.560 --> 09:20.080
shimmy joists and all that, don't be afraid. As you can see everything worked out really well.

09:20.080 --> 09:25.520
We we only had to shim maybe one or two joists and I'm talking a micron. It wasn't much at all.

09:25.520 --> 09:29.120
I'm not here to freak you out. I'm just trying to give you all the information you need

09:29.120 --> 09:33.200
to do the job properly. The other thing I want to point out is as you look down

09:34.320 --> 09:40.800
the top of these joists and you can see this orange string line here that's the top of our

09:40.800 --> 09:46.880
subfloor. And you can see how we planned it so that when we poured this concrete here

09:47.280 --> 09:53.440
the subfloor and the top of the concrete are deadly flush with each other. Congratulations you

09:53.440 --> 09:59.120
did it. You got up above the floor. You installed your Levan hangers. Now it's smooth sailing.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.840
You're out of the mud. 70% of your hard work is done. Your footings, your peel and stick,

10:03.840 --> 10:07.760
your waterproofing, your weeping tile, all that. You can see where I'm going with this.

10:09.440 --> 10:14.080
I'm halfway done already. I just go a little further. Now I have a nine foot

10:14.080 --> 10:18.480
ceiling height on my main floor. Now you have all the benefits that go along with

10:18.480 --> 10:24.960
a full ICF house, the resilience, the wind resistance, sound resistance, continuous

10:24.960 --> 10:29.840
insulation, you have the thermal mass, all of those advantages. So I have other videos

10:29.840 --> 10:36.880
describing what those are. I'm just saying it's such a beneficial system. It's easy to take it

10:36.880 --> 10:42.480
to the top and I'm here to show you how.
