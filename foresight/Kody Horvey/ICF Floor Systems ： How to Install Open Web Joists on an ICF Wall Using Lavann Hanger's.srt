00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
So on this episode, what I want to discuss is how to hang a floor-dry system from an ICF wall

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,240
so we can take the ICF right to the roof. And it's very simple. I want to show you that you

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,240
don't have to cap yourself. You can use ICF past just the basement, right? So just kind of open

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,080
your mind. It's easy to do and there's tons of advantages. You hear of lots of stories where

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,480
someone's like, oh man, like, I know a guy who has an ICF basement. Oh, it's the best. Like,

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,120
he loves it. It's super warm in the winter, you know, nice and cool in the summer. It's a beauty

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,160
thing. So my point today is, why not just take that to the roof of your house? That's what we do on

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,280
a day-to-day basis. That's kind of our niche is we do full ICF houses. So if you look up here,

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,080
you can see where we got a bunch of hangers inserted into the wall. And that's where we're

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,680
going to hang the floor from. But I'll just kind of back up a little bit and I'll show you

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,200
how we got there. When we start stacking this block, we'll get, you know, say three rows high.

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,160
We won't have any of this bracing up. Then before we put our bracing, so these are what

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,320
we call the shields. And this is what holds the whole wall together. It allows you to straighten

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,000
your walls. It holds your scaffold up so you can have something stand on while you pour the concrete.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,960
But before you put the shields up, you have to do a floor layout. So just a little bit of forethought.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,720
So what we do is we got three rows high. We lay out our floor joist system based off our floor

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:51,760
layout. So these, this is a three and a half inch wide, 20 inch high, open webbed floor joist

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:00,800
at two foot on center. So here's one joist. Here's another joist. And here's another joist.

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,160
So we do a full layout. Then we know where to put our shields so that they're not in the way of a

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,400
floor joist or in the way of a hanger. So let's jump up top. I'll show you the hanger system we're

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
using today. A couple more tips on what to keep in mind so that once the concrete's placed,

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,840
you can hang your floor simply. It just keeps everything easy. And then you just keep stacking

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,640
block from there. A whole bunch of steps later, a bunch of block, rebar obviously. You set all

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,960
your bracing up your scaffold so you can walk. Then you're at a point where you can start setting

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,720
your hangers in at the height that you need. So whatever you need for your basement slab

26
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,800
and the ceiling height in your basement, figure all that out. Now what's worked out really well

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:00,640
here is after our shields, they're 10 feet high. We've actually gone and chalked out the top of

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,240
our subfloor right here. So we've set up our laser level. We can chalk this line above all these

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,320
shields so that they're not in the way. Works beauty. Then we just measured from the top there

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:20,000
to the bottom of our hangers. So in this scenario, it's 20 and three quarters, 20 inch for the open

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,160
web joist, three quarters of an inch for our subfloor. Once you have all that information,

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
then you can insert your hangers.

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,360
So this is the Levan hanger. What's nice about it, I just have to do two vertical cuts

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,560
so I can put this hanger anywhere in the whole, in the whole ICF system. I'm not limited to anything.

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,800
Now once I know my heights, then I just basically do my two vertical cuts

36
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,360
and I slide these bad boys in place.

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Like so. Then what we've done here is because I can't actually screw through the hanger into a tie,

38
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,000
we've had to do this two by four ledger, which is just a perfect distance down from the top of

39
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,400
our subfloor. Screw it to the webs. Then I screw my hanger down to it.

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,960
That prevents any settling or potentially any lifting of the hangers. I'll spray foam the hangers

41
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,760
in place so that the concrete doesn't want to tip them forward. I still need to run rebar

42
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,120
through the two holes on the inside of the wall. So those two holes on the back of the hanger

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,640
will run rebar through those. And then we got a little more prep work to do,

44
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,600
but then we're ready to, or then we're ready to pour the concrete. Now another couple elements that

45
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,480
in this viewpoint is this is going to be the front entry of the house. So you see a secondary

46
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,000
chalk line. We actually just got to cut this down for our door buck and there's a few elements

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,800
there that I won't share today, but you do have to think ahead. Make sure you get your doors in

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,000
position because when we pour, we're going to pour our concrete up here about halfway in this block

49
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,840
and then it'll taper down and we'll just go nice and level across the bottom of where the

50
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,520
future door is going to go for the main floor. The best thing about this Levan hanger system is

51
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,560
it doesn't take a whole lot of forethought. You know, a few tricks that I've showed you right now,

52
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,760
then you pour it. It's after that, it's simply set the beams in your beam pockets,

53
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:03,040
couple teleposts. You just drop your floor joists in place and away you go. It's pretty much done.

54
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,400
So it's a very simple system, a little thinking ahead of time, but then when it comes to setting

55
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:30,400
the floor, it's quick and easy. So this is the next step. You can see that it's a lot cleaner

56
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,080
job site. We've poured the concrete, we've stripped down our bracing, and now we're ready to land the

57
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,440
floor system. So we'll simply, we'll just put in our center beams, we'll land the floors, but we'll

58
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,240
show you that as we go. And then it's just easy to keep going on, taking this thing to the roof.

59
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Let's check out how simple it was just to land those joists and those hangers. So we put a little

60
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,600
forethought into the hangers, but then after that we just simply drop them in place. We sheet the

61
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,880
floor and then we'll just jump up top and we'll just do the ICF right from the main floor and

62
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,480
take it to the roof. But let's take a look at these hangers. The first thing you're going to want to do

63
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,800
is just take your laser level and just go around the whole building and try to just figure out,

64
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,680
you know, if some of the hangers settled or if some of the blocks settled, figure out which

65
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,400
hanger is the highest and then just kind of base everything off of that. Just kind of get an idea

66
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,360
what's happening. Because the worst thing is if you set all your joists too low and then a couple

67
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
hangers were high and then you had to adjust everything else. So it's just kind of one of those

68
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,080
four thought things. But the other, the other thing to point out with when you're hanging this

69
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:53,120
system is don't go by your original chalk line that we had the other day. You'll want to chalk

70
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,560
a brand new line and it's just a reference line. So I think what we did here is the joists are 20

71
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,880
inches high. We went 21 and a half. We chalk a brand new line because then that's deadly,

72
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,920
the concrete set and nothing is going to move. This, this line will have a 20 inch joist and

73
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,960
then what we can do is you can see we've got a string line here. We can put a 2x4 on top of

74
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,680
the hanger or we can put a 2x4 on the top of the joist and slide it up and make sure it's bang

75
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
on with the chalk line. And then if we just need to tweak and put a little shim in there just to

76
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,120
get it perfect, that's what we do. The most important thing at this stage is to make sure that the

77
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,280
joists are all perfectly straight. Because if you just throw these in and yeah, we've done a good job

78
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,640
of putting the hangers in who we're going to be very close. But if there is a little wave and you

79
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,720
put hardwood flooring in and when you put your baseboard down you might have to scribe the baseboard

80
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,720
in order to match. So if you just put a little more effort into this then it'll save you down the

81
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,520
road when you're finishing. And that just goes with construction in general. It's just doing a

82
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,560
little bit now to save yourself time later. Just in case I freaked a few of you out talking about

83
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,080
shimmy joists and all that, don't be afraid. As you can see everything worked out really well.

84
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,520
We we only had to shim maybe one or two joists and I'm talking a micron. It wasn't much at all.

85
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,120
I'm not here to freak you out. I'm just trying to give you all the information you need

86
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,200
to do the job properly. The other thing I want to point out is as you look down

87
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,800
the top of these joists and you can see this orange string line here that's the top of our

88
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,880
subfloor. And you can see how we planned it so that when we poured this concrete here

89
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:53,440
the subfloor and the top of the concrete are deadly flush with each other. Congratulations you

90
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,120
did it. You got up above the floor. You installed your Levan hangers. Now it's smooth sailing.

91
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,840
You're out of the mud. 70% of your hard work is done. Your footings, your peel and stick,

92
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,760
your waterproofing, your weeping tile, all that. You can see where I'm going with this.

93
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,080
I'm halfway done already. I just go a little further. Now I have a nine foot

94
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,480
ceiling height on my main floor. Now you have all the benefits that go along with

95
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,960
a full ICF house, the resilience, the wind resistance, sound resistance, continuous

96
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,840
insulation, you have the thermal mass, all of those advantages. So I have other videos

97
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,880
describing what those are. I'm just saying it's such a beneficial system. It's easy to take it

98
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,480
to the top and I'm here to show you how.
