0	6240	So on this episode, what I want to discuss is how to hang a floor-dry system from an ICF wall
6240	12240	so we can take the ICF right to the roof. And it's very simple. I want to show you that you
12240	18240	don't have to cap yourself. You can use ICF past just the basement, right? So just kind of open
18240	24080	your mind. It's easy to do and there's tons of advantages. You hear of lots of stories where
24080	28480	someone's like, oh man, like, I know a guy who has an ICF basement. Oh, it's the best. Like,
28560	35120	he loves it. It's super warm in the winter, you know, nice and cool in the summer. It's a beauty
35120	42160	thing. So my point today is, why not just take that to the roof of your house? That's what we do on
42160	49280	a day-to-day basis. That's kind of our niche is we do full ICF houses. So if you look up here,
49280	56080	you can see where we got a bunch of hangers inserted into the wall. And that's where we're
56080	61680	going to hang the floor from. But I'll just kind of back up a little bit and I'll show you
62800	69200	how we got there. When we start stacking this block, we'll get, you know, say three rows high.
69200	76160	We won't have any of this bracing up. Then before we put our bracing, so these are what
76160	82320	we call the shields. And this is what holds the whole wall together. It allows you to straighten
82320	88000	your walls. It holds your scaffold up so you can have something stand on while you pour the concrete.
88640	94960	But before you put the shields up, you have to do a floor layout. So just a little bit of forethought.
95600	102720	So what we do is we got three rows high. We lay out our floor joist system based off our floor
102720	111760	layout. So these, this is a three and a half inch wide, 20 inch high, open webbed floor joist
111760	120800	at two foot on center. So here's one joist. Here's another joist. And here's another joist.
121520	128160	So we do a full layout. Then we know where to put our shields so that they're not in the way of a
128160	134400	floor joist or in the way of a hanger. So let's jump up top. I'll show you the hanger system we're
134400	139920	using today. A couple more tips on what to keep in mind so that once the concrete's placed,
140560	145840	you can hang your floor simply. It just keeps everything easy. And then you just keep stacking
145840	152640	block from there. A whole bunch of steps later, a bunch of block, rebar obviously. You set all
152640	158960	your bracing up your scaffold so you can walk. Then you're at a point where you can start setting
158960	164720	your hangers in at the height that you need. So whatever you need for your basement slab
164720	170800	and the ceiling height in your basement, figure all that out. Now what's worked out really well
170800	180640	here is after our shields, they're 10 feet high. We've actually gone and chalked out the top of
180720	188240	our subfloor right here. So we've set up our laser level. We can chalk this line above all these
188240	194320	shields so that they're not in the way. Works beauty. Then we just measured from the top there
194320	200000	to the bottom of our hangers. So in this scenario, it's 20 and three quarters, 20 inch for the open
200000	206160	web joist, three quarters of an inch for our subfloor. Once you have all that information,
207120	208640	then you can insert your hangers.
213920	219360	So this is the Levan hanger. What's nice about it, I just have to do two vertical cuts
219920	226560	so I can put this hanger anywhere in the whole, in the whole ICF system. I'm not limited to anything.
228720	232800	Now once I know my heights, then I just basically do my two vertical cuts
233440	235360	and I slide these bad boys in place.
247360	256880	Like so. Then what we've done here is because I can't actually screw through the hanger into a tie,
257680	264000	we've had to do this two by four ledger, which is just a perfect distance down from the top of
264000	270400	our subfloor. Screw it to the webs. Then I screw my hanger down to it.
274880	282960	That prevents any settling or potentially any lifting of the hangers. I'll spray foam the hangers
282960	287760	in place so that the concrete doesn't want to tip them forward. I still need to run rebar
288480	293120	through the two holes on the inside of the wall. So those two holes on the back of the hanger
293120	300640	will run rebar through those. And then we got a little more prep work to do,
300640	307600	but then we're ready to, or then we're ready to pour the concrete. Now another couple elements that
308160	314480	in this viewpoint is this is going to be the front entry of the house. So you see a secondary
314480	320000	chalk line. We actually just got to cut this down for our door buck and there's a few elements
320000	324800	there that I won't share today, but you do have to think ahead. Make sure you get your doors in
324800	330000	position because when we pour, we're going to pour our concrete up here about halfway in this block
330560	335840	and then it'll taper down and we'll just go nice and level across the bottom of where the
335840	341520	future door is going to go for the main floor. The best thing about this Levan hanger system is
342160	348560	it doesn't take a whole lot of forethought. You know, a few tricks that I've showed you right now,
348560	355760	then you pour it. It's after that, it's simply set the beams in your beam pockets,
355760	363040	couple teleposts. You just drop your floor joists in place and away you go. It's pretty much done.
363040	368400	So it's a very simple system, a little thinking ahead of time, but then when it comes to setting
368400	390400	the floor, it's quick and easy. So this is the next step. You can see that it's a lot cleaner
390400	396080	job site. We've poured the concrete, we've stripped down our bracing, and now we're ready to land the
396080	401440	floor system. So we'll simply, we'll just put in our center beams, we'll land the floors, but we'll
401440	406240	show you that as we go. And then it's just easy to keep going on, taking this thing to the roof.
408400	413200	Let's check out how simple it was just to land those joists and those hangers. So we put a little
413200	419600	forethought into the hangers, but then after that we just simply drop them in place. We sheet the
419600	424880	floor and then we'll just jump up top and we'll just do the ICF right from the main floor and
424880	430480	take it to the roof. But let's take a look at these hangers. The first thing you're going to want to do
430480	436800	is just take your laser level and just go around the whole building and try to just figure out,
437840	443680	you know, if some of the hangers settled or if some of the blocks settled, figure out which
443680	448400	hanger is the highest and then just kind of base everything off of that. Just kind of get an idea
449040	455360	what's happening. Because the worst thing is if you set all your joists too low and then a couple
455360	459360	hangers were high and then you had to adjust everything else. So it's just kind of one of those
459360	466080	four thought things. But the other, the other thing to point out with when you're hanging this
466080	473120	system is don't go by your original chalk line that we had the other day. You'll want to chalk
473120	480560	a brand new line and it's just a reference line. So I think what we did here is the joists are 20
480560	488880	inches high. We went 21 and a half. We chalk a brand new line because then that's deadly,
488880	495920	the concrete set and nothing is going to move. This, this line will have a 20 inch joist and
495920	502960	then what we can do is you can see we've got a string line here. We can put a 2x4 on top of
502960	509680	the hanger or we can put a 2x4 on the top of the joist and slide it up and make sure it's bang
509680	514320	on with the chalk line. And then if we just need to tweak and put a little shim in there just to
514320	521120	get it perfect, that's what we do. The most important thing at this stage is to make sure that the
521120	527280	joists are all perfectly straight. Because if you just throw these in and yeah, we've done a good job
527280	532640	of putting the hangers in who we're going to be very close. But if there is a little wave and you
532640	538720	put hardwood flooring in and when you put your baseboard down you might have to scribe the baseboard
538720	544720	in order to match. So if you just put a little more effort into this then it'll save you down the
544720	549520	road when you're finishing. And that just goes with construction in general. It's just doing a
549520	554560	little bit now to save yourself time later. Just in case I freaked a few of you out talking about
554560	560080	shimmy joists and all that, don't be afraid. As you can see everything worked out really well.
560080	565520	We we only had to shim maybe one or two joists and I'm talking a micron. It wasn't much at all.
565520	569120	I'm not here to freak you out. I'm just trying to give you all the information you need
569120	573200	to do the job properly. The other thing I want to point out is as you look down
574320	580800	the top of these joists and you can see this orange string line here that's the top of our
580800	586880	subfloor. And you can see how we planned it so that when we poured this concrete here
587280	593440	the subfloor and the top of the concrete are deadly flush with each other. Congratulations you
593440	599120	did it. You got up above the floor. You installed your Levan hangers. Now it's smooth sailing.
599120	603840	You're out of the mud. 70% of your hard work is done. Your footings, your peel and stick,
603840	607760	your waterproofing, your weeping tile, all that. You can see where I'm going with this.
609440	614080	I'm halfway done already. I just go a little further. Now I have a nine foot
614080	618480	ceiling height on my main floor. Now you have all the benefits that go along with
618480	624960	a full ICF house, the resilience, the wind resistance, sound resistance, continuous
624960	629840	insulation, you have the thermal mass, all of those advantages. So I have other videos
629840	636880	describing what those are. I'm just saying it's such a beneficial system. It's easy to take it
636880	642480	to the top and I'm here to show you how.
