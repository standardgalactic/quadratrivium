Checking NVIDIA/NVIDIA GTC May 2020 Keynote Pt2： NVIDIA RTX - A New Era for Computer Graphics.txt
1. **RTX Technology**: NVIDIA's RTX technology has revolutionized real-time ray tracing, making it possible 10 years ahead of schedule. With the introduction of DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling), high-quality images with ray tracing and high resolutions can be achieved while maintaining high frame rates. This has significantly improved the gaming experience in titles like Minecraft.

2. **NVIDIA Omniverse**: This is a new platform that leverages NVIDIA's advancements over the past decade, including RTX technology and AI capabilities via tensor cores. It facilitates real-time collaboration among artists, designers, and engineers by enabling them to work on shared 3D worlds in real time with ray tracing and physically accurate materials. Omniverse uses NVIDIA's RTX servers equipped with RTX A6000 GPUs, virtual application servers, and smart networking with NVIDIA's BlueField-2 DPU (Data Processing Unit) to create a seamless collaborative environment.

3. **Remote Collaboration**: Omniverse allows multiple designers from different locations to work simultaneously on a single design, with reviewers able to request changes in real time. This is made possible through 'portals' within the Omniverse platform that visualize and stream the shared space to any device.

4. **Demo of Omniverse**: A demonstration was shown, highlighting a stunning, fully ray-traced scene created by NVIDIA engineers. The scene featured realistic lighting, shadows, and adherence to the laws of physics, all achieved in real time with Omniverse. This showcased the power of remote collaboration using NVIDIA's technology.

5. **Availability**: The Omniverse platform is available with preconfigured servers from various manufacturers, including Box, Dell, HP, and Supermicro. These servers come equipped with the necessary hypervisors, networking stack, and virtual GPUs to support Omniverse's collaborative capabilities.

In summary, NVIDIA's RTX technology has set a new standard for real-time ray tracing, and the Omniverse platform is a groundbreaking tool that enables seamless collaboration among creative professionals in 3D content creation, leveraging the full spectrum of NVIDIA's technologies including RTX, AI via tensor cores, and smart networking.

1. **Spark 3.0 Acceleration**: NVIDIA has significantly accelerated Apache Spark, a distributed data processing engine widely used in the industry. This was achieved by integrating three main components:
   - A new scheduler that can partition and distribute work to GPUs efficiently.
   - Rapids, a library that supports GPU-accelerated data operations such as data ingestion, feature engineering, and SQL queries, which interfaces with Spark.
   - Optimizations in Catalyst, Spark's SQL engine, for NVIDIA GPUs.

2. **Performance Benchmark**: NVIDIA demonstrated the performance of Rapids on a TPCX BB benchmark, showing that it can process 163 gigabytes per second at a cost of two million dollars, which is 10 times faster and only twice as expensive as the state-of-the-art solution that costs a million dollars and processes 17 gigabytes per second.

3. **Data Center Implications**: The benchmark shows that creating a data center with similar performance using DGX systems would cost 10 times more and require twice the power consumption. This highlights the cost-effectiveness of Rapids for large-scale data processing.

4. **Industry Adoption**: Cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Databricks are embracing NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate their cloud services for Spark, including data processing, machine learning pipelines, and data analytics.

5. **End-to-End AI Acceleration**: NVIDIA's AI stack includes Rapids for data processing, QDNN as a core deep learning library, and TensorRT as an inference optimizing compiler. This end-to-end acceleration covers the entire machine learning pipeline from training to deployment.

6. **Future Developments**: NVIDIA is committed to continuously advancing AI capabilities by improving these components and ensuring that data scientists can leverage the full power of GPUs for their work. The presentation concluded with a sense of pride in the achievements and the collaborative efforts of the team involved in this groundbreaking work.
