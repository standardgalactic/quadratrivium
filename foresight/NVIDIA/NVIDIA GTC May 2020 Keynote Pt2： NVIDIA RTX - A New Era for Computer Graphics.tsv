0	8440	Computer graphics is the driving force of NVIDIA.
8440	12160	It is one of the world's most computationally intensive applications.
12160	15840	It has been for decades, and it will continue to be for decades to come.
15840	23160	Forty years ago, one of NVIDIA's researchers wrote a seminal paper on a technique to simulate
23160	25320	light we call ray tracing.
25320	30640	To trace a light beam through an environment bouncing off surfaces, reflecting, refracting
30640	36040	or illuminating that surface ultimately generate what is a photorealistic image.
36040	42840	Two years ago, at 2018 SIGGRAPH in Vancouver, BC, we announced one of our most ambitious
42840	44160	endeavors.
44160	46240	We call it the NVIDIA RTX.
46240	50720	NVIDIA RTX fuses two groundbreaking technologies.
50720	55640	The first is accelerated ray tracing, and the second breakthrough is deep learning.
55640	60040	Ray tracing is so computationally intensive, even with the amazing accelerator that we've
60040	63600	created, it just simply wasn't fast enough.
63600	66360	And then the breakthrough of artificial intelligence happened.
66360	71360	And over the last three years, we've been piling onto this technology to solve the
71360	73380	last missing piece of the puzzle.
73380	78400	We use ray tracing in our programmable shaders, and the fastest possible GPUs we could make
78480	81760	to generate a relatively low resolution image.
81760	85440	And in this particular case, 540p, not even anti-aliased.
85440	88920	It also generates, along with it, a motion vector.
88920	92960	Where the pixel is and where it's traveling, that goes into an artificial intelligence
92960	97540	network which tries to synthesize a higher resolution image.
97540	102800	We teach this artificial intelligence network what extremely high resolution and high quality
102800	104080	images look like.
104080	111320	In this particular case, we use a supercomputer to render 16K anti-aliased resolution images.
111320	116040	We then compare what comes out of the neural network with this ground truth.
116040	120960	The difference propagates back into the network through a supercomputer, and it corrects the
120960	125400	weights of the neurons as to improve its ability to guess the next time.
125400	127400	We go through this trillions of times.
127400	133320	Eventually, this neural network could take just a few pixels, 540p in this case, and
133320	136840	synthesize what otherwise would be a beautiful image.
136840	138040	Incredible.
138040	141640	Then we take this neural network, we download it into your GeForce computers, particularly
141640	146880	the ones with Turing, are now ready to receive this neural network and process it on the
146880	150040	tensor core processor in the Turing GPU.
150040	155120	We call this technology DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling.
155120	158960	What you're looking at here is the image generated by the supercomputer.
158960	162200	Its 16K resolution is completely anti-aliased.
162200	166320	This is a scene from an Unreal Engine demo that Epic did called Infiltrator.
166320	167600	It's really a beautiful demo.
167600	168880	They did this several years ago.
168880	172200	Here, what I'm showing you is 16K ground truth.
172200	175960	The next scene is rendered, and it's 720p.
175960	176960	Notice how blurry it is.
176960	179000	Let me just go back one more time so you can see it.
179000	183000	This is ground truth, 16K, look at the small lights.
183000	187960	We like to look at the leaves on the trees, the clouds from afar, that is so crisp.
187960	189440	The detail is incredible.
189440	194480	This is rendered at 720p, and here what I'm showing you is our first try, and we call
194480	197480	it DLSS 1.0.
197480	202760	Notice it improves the resolution that appears, but only by a little bit.
202760	208200	Most people felt that the artificial intelligence technology was not going to work, but we believed
208200	210120	in it and we didn't give up.
210120	217720	This is, ladies and gentlemen, DLSS 2.0, scaling from 720p, generating the pixels necessary
217720	221680	to create a 1080p anti-aliased image.
221680	226960	Look at that, first generation, a little blurry, second generation.
226960	228560	Look at all the lights.
228560	230720	It's much, much more than sharpening.
230720	234000	Look at all the lights that all of a sudden appear that didn't appear before.
234000	237480	How do you create content where content did not exist?
237480	242320	Well, partly because the neural network has learned what the image should look like, and
242320	248360	secondarily, because we have motion vectors and the pixels by observing across a few scenes,
248360	251600	the neural network can predict what each scene should look like.
251600	256640	Now, if you were to render this with native 1080p, using the GPU to render each and every
256640	259120	pixel anti-aliased, this is what it looks like.
259120	263880	This is native 1080p, and look, artificial intelligence actually does a better job going
263880	265920	back to DLSS 2.0.
265920	270120	Look at that, AI does a better job than 1080p native.
270120	272160	That is a complete breakthrough.
272160	277280	Suppose we started from 540p, and because there are so few pixels, most of the pixels
277280	279640	are blurry when we scale it up to this image.
279640	284960	Now imagine if we were to take this 540p image and put it into a artificial intelligence
284960	290280	network, DLSS 2.0, and this neural network had learned from beautiful images that were
290280	295320	generated by a supercomputer, and it's now asked to recreate that image.
295320	296320	Look at that.
296320	302640	This is the input, 540p, and this is the output, DLSS 2.0, 540p to 1080p.
302640	304040	What an amazing breakthrough.
304040	310200	Let's take a look at the combination of RTX and DLSS on the most popular game in the
310200	311920	world, Minecraft.
311920	317280	Because each one of the worlds are created by the gamer, it is not possible to pre-bake
317280	323460	a lot of the shadows and lighting effects that you see in very big blockbuster games.
323460	328500	This is created by the users themselves, and so the lighting effects can't be cheated,
328500	333020	and it has to be generated by the program, which is the reason why we chose to work with
333020	336060	the team at Minecraft to bring RTX to it.
336060	341180	Now with this particular scene, you can see that when we render Minecraft without DLSS
341180	345160	with just ray tracing, the frame rate was only 35 frames per second.
345160	351460	With DLSS, we can render this beautiful image and then use DLSS to scale that low resolution
351460	353980	image and still maintain the speed.
353980	360300	So now you get beautiful image with ray tracing, high resolution, and high speed all at the
360300	364020	same time, and that is the requirement for modern computer graphics.
364020	367380	Let me show you now a video that we just made of Minecraft.
367380	370540	The reception has been incredible all over the world.
370540	371340	You're going to love this video.
411460	430620	Oh my goodness, this looks insane.
430620	431620	Look at the shiny floor.
431620	433300	I feel like I'm going to slip and fall down.
433300	434300	It hurt myself.
434300	435300	Look at that.
435300	436300	Look at that.
436300	437300	Look at that.
437300	438300	Look at that.
438300	439300	Look at that.
439460	440460	Out.
440460	441460	Boom.
441460	447020	Look at the way the light comes through the wall.
447020	449940	It really adds just this level of depth.
449940	450940	Is that mirrors?
450940	455220	It's mirrors.
455220	460660	Ladies and gentlemen, RTX on, ray tracing, DLSS.
460660	465780	We've made possible real-time ray tracing 10 years earlier than anybody thought was
465780	466780	possible.
466780	471860	When we launched it, people were skeptical, but now it is very, very clear that ray tracing
471860	474700	is here and it's the next big thing.
474700	477140	Creating 3D content is hard.
477140	481940	It takes so many different types of disciplines from artists to designers to software programmers.
481940	487740	Uses all kinds of different tools from MyEd, 3D Studio Max, to Photoshop, and they're creating
487740	491100	these worlds that take enormous databases.
491100	495460	That's one of the reasons why it's so expensive and so hard to create world-class 3D content.
495540	496740	We have a solution for that.
496740	502020	We call it the NVIDIA Omniverse and it leverages all of NVIDIA's technology over the last
502020	503020	10 years.
503020	508500	On the foundation is our RTX server, our latest generation GPUs, then it's built on top of
508500	511460	a virtual application server.
511460	517020	Each one of the GPUs could be shared by many different designers using virtual quadro or
517020	521180	many GPUs could gang up to accelerate one application.
521180	526020	The networking is accelerated and offloaded by Melanox Nix, the smart Nix that we were
526020	527420	talking about earlier.
527420	530940	And then one of the virtual machines is the Omniverse Nucleus.
530940	536860	This nucleus has created a shared space, a shared world, and this shared world has portals.
536860	542860	The output of that portal is visualized and streamed to any device you like.
542860	548220	Multiple designers could work on one design at the same time and reviewers could ask for
548220	550300	changes in real time.
550300	553860	The ultimate design collaboration platform.
553860	557340	Let me show you a demo that's created by NVIDIA engineers.
557340	559600	What I'm about to show you is really amazing.
559600	563500	This was done over the course of the last couple of months.
563500	567660	Artist designers from different locations and it's never been seen before.
567660	570460	It is completely ray traced.
570460	574300	None of the lights are baked, none of the shadows are baked, everything is completely
574300	576380	lit and shadowed in real time.
576460	580420	And one of the most important things is everything obeys the laws of physics.
580420	581420	Let's roll it.
726380	733340	Isn't that amazing?
733340	738460	Real time ray tracing, physically based materials, obeys the laws of physics.
738460	744220	It was created by just a few designers and engineers on top of Omniverse working remotely
744220	746580	from different states.
746580	747720	Incredible achievement.
747720	748720	Just so beautiful.
748720	749720	I love it.
749720	752340	And so ladies and gentlemen, this is the NVIDIA Omniverse.
752340	755820	It starts with a server with a whole bunch of RTX 8000s.
755820	761140	These are the most powerful ray tracing GPUs in the world, tensor core processing to do
761140	766740	AI so that we can both have beautiful images and high resolution and high performance at
766740	767900	the same time.
767900	771220	The servers are available from Box, Dell, HP and Supermicro.
771220	776860	And it's been preconfigured with all the hypervisors necessary, the networking stack
776860	781740	and the virtual quadros so that you can remotely run applications so that you could create
781740	784060	portals into the shared space.
784060	786020	It's really, really an amazing thing.
786020	791100	In today's world where you have to work remotely and share and collaborate with large numbers
791100	794300	of people, this couldn't have come at a better time.
794300	795380	The NVIDIA Omniverse.
