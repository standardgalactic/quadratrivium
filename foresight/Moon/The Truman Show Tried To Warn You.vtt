00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
The Truman Show is one of my favourite movies.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.480
It's incredibly rare for a film to be as funny, cohesive,

00:04.480 --> 00:07.040
beautifully paced and rich in detail as The Truman Show.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.760
However, it's even rarer for a movie to go beyond this

00:09.760 --> 00:12.640
and give accurate, prophetic insights about the world.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.440
20 years later, and The Truman Show's allegorical message

00:15.440 --> 00:16.800
is more relevant than ever.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.800
But the only way we can truly understand its meaning

00:18.800 --> 00:20.240
is by diving into the story.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.400
The film begins with a monologue from Kristoff,

00:22.400 --> 00:24.320
who sets up the main premise of the movie.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.960
Truman is the unwitting star of a reality TV show

00:26.960 --> 00:28.160
centred around his life.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.960
Truman, a child abandoned at birth, has been brought up

00:30.960 --> 00:32.720
to believe that he is a normal guy living

00:32.720 --> 00:34.720
in the idyllic town of Seahaven Island.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.880
However, Truman's entire world is a lie.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.640
All the people he knows, including his mother,

00:38.640 --> 00:41.600
his best friend and his wife, are all paid actors.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.320
Seahaven Island is also fake, and is in reality

00:44.320 --> 00:46.560
just a huge setting close by a massive dome.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.800
This gives Kristoff, the director of The Truman Show,

00:48.800 --> 00:51.040
almost complete control over Truman's world.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.120
This ranges from the ability to control the weather

00:53.120 --> 00:55.680
to the day-night cycle and even the stars in the sky.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.080
Truman's every moment is broadcast around the world.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.120
With extra funding from the show coming from product placement.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.520
From the start of the film, we see a camera implanted

01:03.520 --> 01:05.760
in Truman's bathroom mirror, where Truman is pretending

01:05.760 --> 01:07.760
to be an explorer whilst getting ready for work.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.080
It's as though this is just another regular day for Truman,

01:10.080 --> 01:11.520
with him saying hello to his neighbors,

01:11.520 --> 01:13.360
making a coffee and getting into his car.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.040
But just as he's getting into his car,

01:15.040 --> 01:16.720
a stage slide drops from the sky,

01:16.720 --> 01:18.960
right onto the road outside of his house.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.640
Truman then walks over to inspect the light

01:20.640 --> 01:22.560
and sees that it says Sirius on it,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.480
referring to the brightest star in the night sky.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.080
But eerily, on his drive to work,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.640
the radio starts to run a story about a plane wreckage

01:28.640 --> 01:31.280
falling from the sky in order to explain the light.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.880
Here's a news flash just then,

01:32.880 --> 01:35.600
an aircraft in trouble began shitting parts

01:35.600 --> 01:37.760
as it flew over to see him in just a few moments ago.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.840
It then starts to talk about the dangers of flying,

01:39.840 --> 01:41.680
which is one of the first of many subtle ways

01:41.680 --> 01:43.360
that Krystal tries to influence Truman

01:43.360 --> 01:45.120
into staying on the island through fear.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.520
He is being subconsciously controlled by the radio.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.400
This subconscious manipulation then continues throughout the film.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.000
Like when Truman is asked by his boss

01:52.000 --> 01:54.160
to deal with something that will require a boat trip.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.960
By doing this, the boss is setting up Truman's aquaphobia

01:56.960 --> 01:59.280
as we see he is unable to even get in the boat,

01:59.280 --> 02:00.800
a phobia that's later revealed

02:00.800 --> 02:03.200
to be another subconscious manipulation of Truman.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.960
This whole day feels very strange for Truman,

02:04.960 --> 02:06.960
so he hurriedly comes back to his wife, Meryl,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.200
who then conspicuously shows off her new kitchen tool

02:09.200 --> 02:10.480
that she bought at the store,

02:10.480 --> 02:12.960
showing it off almost like she's advertising it.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.520
It's a dicer, greater, peeler, all in one.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.600
Never need sharpening, dishwasher safe.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.960
Truman becomes suspicious

02:18.960 --> 02:20.560
and when out with his best friend, Marlon,

02:20.560 --> 02:22.160
Truman's behavior starts to be off

02:22.160 --> 02:24.880
and he brings up his desire to leave and go to Fiji.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.120
Marlon catches that Truman is starting to wake up,

02:27.120 --> 02:28.720
so he quickly shoots down the idea.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.160
He doesn't want Truman escaping.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.520
That would break the whole game.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.960
In the next scene, we see Truman go off

02:32.960 --> 02:34.240
to spend some time on the beach,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.080
where he remembers the tragic boat accident

02:36.080 --> 02:38.880
that seemingly killed his father and gave him his aquaphobia.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.960
Kristoff then even hides in Truman's misery

02:40.960 --> 02:43.680
by adding a specific path of rain to follow Truman.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.440
And with Truman's breakdown growing,

02:45.440 --> 02:47.760
we see the audience's engrossed reactions.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.600
It's all these early scenes that serve to illustrate

02:49.600 --> 02:51.760
that the fictional Truman show can only function

02:51.760 --> 02:54.000
when Truman buys into this false reality.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
The Truman show therefore has to make sure

02:56.000 --> 02:57.920
that Truman can't escape his cage,

02:57.920 --> 02:59.600
or even see that he's in a cage

02:59.600 --> 03:02.640
if he knows that he's in a cage the whole game collapses.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.560
The ways that Kristoff keeps Truman deluded

03:04.560 --> 03:06.560
are the most striking aspects of the allegory.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.400
The most obvious and egregious of these

03:08.400 --> 03:10.240
is how Truman is kept complacent

03:10.240 --> 03:12.240
by exploiting his deepest fears.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.920
For example, Truman's aquaphobia

03:13.920 --> 03:16.160
works perfectly to keep Truman on the island.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.560
Kristoff even risks Truman overcoming this fear

03:18.560 --> 03:21.120
when he sends Truman to unsuccessfully board the boat.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.120
The fact that Truman can't overcome his phobia

03:23.120 --> 03:24.640
only reinforces this.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.200
Truman is also constantly barraged by propaganda

03:27.200 --> 03:29.680
and subliminal messages to induce a fear of flying.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.000
There are constant reminders of the dangers of flying.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.760
It takes this rampant fear mongering

03:33.760 --> 03:35.360
to keep Truman's delusion alive.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.680
However, this time the propaganda sluts to weaken.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.720
Truman still fantasizes about taking a flight to Fiji.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.080
His aquaphobia is still strong,

03:42.080 --> 03:43.680
but it's revealed that this is most likely

03:43.680 --> 03:45.600
because it originates from the undressed guilt

03:45.600 --> 03:46.960
over Truman's father's death.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.880
But it's not just the fear that influences Truman.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.720
The control that Kristoff has over his world

03:50.800 --> 03:51.440
is total.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.600
Everything Truman takes in on a daily basis

03:53.600 --> 03:55.360
is designed with a secret purpose.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.680
The TV he watches reinforces the message.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.040
The media always has headlines

03:59.040 --> 04:01.520
directly promoting whatever they want Truman to believe.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.040
Even the people that Truman talks to

04:03.040 --> 04:05.520
on a daily basis spout the same canned lines

04:05.520 --> 04:07.120
and positive affirmations.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.280
Propaganda is seeping into every aspect

04:09.280 --> 04:10.880
of Truman's life and society.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.160
You think I'm flying somewhere?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.520
Nope. Oh, good.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.840
A lot like its infiltration of our society.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.840
Just like Truman, we're always bombarded

04:17.840 --> 04:20.000
with propaganda just to keep us complacently

04:20.000 --> 04:22.560
unaware of the delusions of modern ideology.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.480
Every day society tells us who we are,

04:24.480 --> 04:26.480
what we ought to do, and who our enemies are.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.400
Just like Truman, we're encouraged to ignore

04:28.400 --> 04:29.840
the clues that we're living in a lie,

04:29.840 --> 04:32.320
where we're made to still become wages in the matrix.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.800
And then everyone who buys into the societal delusion

04:34.800 --> 04:36.160
helps perpetuate it.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.560
This means that lots of well-meaning rational people

04:38.560 --> 04:41.520
are swept up to become mouthpieces of a failing system.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.000
The cracks are present in both reality and fiction.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.400
They just exist solely on the personal level for Truman

04:46.400 --> 04:48.800
rather than the societal level that we're starting to see.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.400
But what is the society-wide delusion?

04:50.400 --> 04:52.560
Well, in the Truman Show, it's obvious and literal.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.760
It's the premise of the movie.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.440
The Truman Show is a reality show.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.520
But how does this translate into our real world?

04:57.520 --> 04:58.960
Well, this is where it gets interesting.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.200
The Habitus is a tool used by sociologists

05:01.200 --> 05:04.240
for describing the ways in which a society's culture functions.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.320
Society rests upon an enormous amount

05:06.320 --> 05:08.400
of unsaid rules and expectations.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.240
These are often performed without thinking about them.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.640
It's more like a learned skill than a conscious decision.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.000
What would do the French intellectual

05:14.000 --> 05:15.360
who brought the term to prominence

05:15.360 --> 05:16.720
often compared it to sports?

05:16.720 --> 05:18.400
People tend to know the rules of the game.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.920
For example, it's generally accepted

05:19.920 --> 05:21.600
that when you're finished at the supermarket,

05:21.600 --> 05:22.960
you return your shopping cart.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.360
There's no personal reward or egotistic incentive.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.360
It's just a learned polite expectation.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.320
In the context of the supermarket, though, it's very important.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.320
The whole system would collapse without it.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.800
Some abstracts of the Habitus are nearly invisible

05:34.800 --> 05:36.720
because they seem so natural to us.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.840
Even your taste in musical food are influenced by the Habitus.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.760
This is because the cultural expectations

05:41.760 --> 05:44.000
that the Habitus instills go so deep.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.840
They're established from the moment you're born,

05:45.840 --> 05:47.920
reinforced throughout your childhood by your family

05:47.920 --> 05:50.720
and then further built upon by your education and work.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.760
This then makes the Habitus a self-perpetuating structure.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.520
Those brought up in certain Habitus

05:55.520 --> 05:57.600
will nurture its specific values in their children,

05:57.600 --> 06:00.240
for example, making sure the cycle continues.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.920
The Truman Show gives a literal picture

06:01.920 --> 06:03.440
of what a Habitus can look like.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.600
We can see all the actors in the fictional Truman Show

06:05.600 --> 06:06.880
is being sucked into this.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.800
The actors act in certain learned ways

06:08.800 --> 06:11.440
in order to perpetuate the essence of the Truman Show.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.920
Now, the key difference between fiction and reality

06:13.920 --> 06:14.960
is the incentive.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.040
Literally, the actors in the fictional Truman Show

06:17.040 --> 06:18.560
are being paid to play their parts.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.360
But in the real world, people play their parts in the Habitus

06:21.360 --> 06:24.400
because the Habitus itself has conditioned them into it.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.000
Everyone is one of the actors.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.520
Everyone makes the Delusion real.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.200
And what the Truman Show goes on to tell us

06:29.200 --> 06:31.120
is that when the Habitus has been altered

06:31.120 --> 06:33.840
into something too detached from an authentic society,

06:33.840 --> 06:36.480
cracks start to show when lies start to perpetuate,

06:36.480 --> 06:39.120
when the ego gets in the way, when power corrupts,

06:39.120 --> 06:40.640
the Habitus starts to break

06:40.640 --> 06:43.280
and this ripples throughout entire civilizations.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.720
See, throughout the movie's progression,

06:44.720 --> 06:47.200
we see Truman gradually wake up to the Delusion

06:47.200 --> 06:48.720
that has consumed his life,

06:48.720 --> 06:51.760
which inevitably causes a breakdown of the entire Habitus.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.600
The further Truman moves towards truth,

06:53.600 --> 06:55.520
the faster the Delusion collapses

06:55.520 --> 06:57.520
and thus the more resistance he faces.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.000
The Habitus of our world is just as deluded

07:00.000 --> 07:01.360
as the one in the Truman Show.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.200
This is because what's valuable culturally

07:03.200 --> 07:06.480
has been drastically changed by reality TV and social media.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.000
The Truman Show almost predicted this

07:08.000 --> 07:09.920
with its commentary on reality TV.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.040
The vapid values of reality TV expanded to shape

07:13.040 --> 07:14.320
the entire Habitus.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.920
Now, limited to reality TV,

07:15.920 --> 07:17.440
and this doesn't seem too harmful,

07:17.440 --> 07:18.480
but it gets so much worse

07:18.480 --> 07:20.320
when you consider this in our own reality,

07:20.320 --> 07:23.440
especially with the effects of social media on our values.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.480
Nowadays, everyone's the star of their own reality TV show.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.880
People project vapid and unattainable standards

07:28.880 --> 07:31.040
by advertising a fake life on social media.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.440
That 14-year-old girls who use social media

07:33.440 --> 07:35.200
more than five hours a day

07:35.200 --> 07:38.400
saw a 50% spike in depression symptoms.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.000
This feeds into people's values.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.600
They see other people's fake lives

07:41.600 --> 07:43.360
and hold their own up to the same standard.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.280
These people then perpetuate the cycle,

07:45.280 --> 07:46.720
which then brings the Habitus

07:46.720 --> 07:49.280
further and further away from authenticity and truth.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.840
Corporatization of societies then also reflected

07:51.840 --> 07:53.520
in the Habitus of both the Truman Show

07:53.520 --> 07:54.800
and in our own society.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.640
In the Truman Show, the effects are obvious.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.360
Truman's wife is constantly advertising and shitting brands.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.880
It's almost a learned response

08:00.880 --> 08:02.640
that has been ingrained into her.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.400
You really ought to throw out that mower.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.040
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.160
Which is why at this point,

08:08.160 --> 08:10.000
Truman is actively interrogating her

08:10.000 --> 08:11.280
on the lie that they've been living.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.720
In response, Truman's wife defaults

08:12.800 --> 08:15.120
to an almost robotic speech about a coffee brand.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.320
This is the Habitus failing.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.080
Truman's wife is so deeply submerged

08:18.080 --> 08:19.280
in the Truman Show delusion

08:19.280 --> 08:20.720
that she has no other response.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.400
She just keeps reading the same script,

08:22.400 --> 08:24.320
but it's so much worse in our own society

08:24.320 --> 08:26.640
where our Habitus is so heavily corporatized,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.200
with corporate values being held in such a high regard

08:29.200 --> 08:32.160
that we value our careers more than our families.

08:32.160 --> 08:34.000
Never before in history has this happened.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.400
Truman's suspicions of reality are then brought up again

08:36.400 --> 08:38.640
when his father, who he assumes is dead,

08:38.640 --> 08:41.120
shows up on his way to work dressed as a beggar.

08:41.120 --> 08:41.680
Dead?

08:41.680 --> 08:44.080
Truman's father is then quickly whisked away on a bus,

08:44.080 --> 08:45.920
but not before Truman sees his face.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.360
He realizes something is up,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.560
so he goes to talk to his mother

08:48.560 --> 08:50.720
who tries to explain away his father's reappearance

08:50.720 --> 08:53.280
by suggesting that he's just crazy and hallucinated it.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.880
This time, it doesn't convince Truman,

08:54.880 --> 08:57.920
who also notices how often his wife name drops brands.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.680
As Truman starts to go through his old things,

08:59.680 --> 09:01.840
the movie flashes back to Truman's collages

09:01.840 --> 09:04.160
and a chance encounter he had with a woman named Lauren.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.000
Lauren's meant to be a background character,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.680
but the two sides meet across the room.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.240
They share a conversation in a romantic moment on the beach.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.920
Lauren then goes out of character

09:11.920 --> 09:14.800
to try to reveal to Truman that his whole reality is fake.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.080
Lauren, who reveals her real name as Sylvia,

09:24.080 --> 09:26.080
tries to explain that Truman's world is a lie,

09:26.080 --> 09:29.520
but then again, she stops short by a man saying he is her father

09:29.520 --> 09:31.280
and that she's just talking nonsense.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.120
As Truman starts to think back to this,

09:33.120 --> 09:35.280
it's revealed that he still longs to see Sylvia,

09:35.280 --> 09:38.080
with him even recreating her face from fashion magazines,

09:38.080 --> 09:41.040
because Sylvia is the only thing that's real in this fake world.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.520
It's then later revealed that Truman is obsessed with Fiji

09:43.520 --> 09:45.520
as Sylvia is reported to be moving there.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.000
Truman then starts to see more and more suspicious things.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.640
His radio specifically describes his every move

09:50.640 --> 09:51.920
in an apparent malfunction.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.480
Truman's also seeing every part of the background set,

09:58.480 --> 10:00.320
but he's always escorted away from it.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.120
This sequence of events brings his suspicions to a breaking point,

10:03.120 --> 10:05.680
as Truman concludes that it seems that his entire world

10:05.680 --> 10:07.920
revolves around him in some weird way.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.200
Fearing that he's going crazy,

10:09.200 --> 10:11.600
he brings up these questions to Marlon, his best friend,

10:11.600 --> 10:13.360
who then just tries to brush it all off.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.200
And in response to his increased suspicion,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.200
Truman's then further barraged by suggestions

10:17.200 --> 10:19.680
that everything is just fine, that he's just being weird.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.160
His mother then shows fake pictures of him at Mount Rushmore,

10:22.160 --> 10:25.920
and even the TV runs a program about the benefits of a small town life.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.080
But by now, things don't work like they used to.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.480
He's seen the society that he lives in starts to crack.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.400
It's also laughable and ridiculous.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.920
This whole thing is a facade.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.000
And now that Truman is waking up to this reality,

10:36.080 --> 10:38.800
the lullabies of deception can't draw him back to sleep.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.000
After noticing that his wife is crossing her fingers in his wedding pictures,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.280
Truman follows her to work.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.240
Despite multiple attempts by extras to delay and stop Truman

10:46.240 --> 10:48.320
from seeing the surgery that his wife is helping with,

10:48.320 --> 10:50.960
Truman breaks into the hospital and sees the fake surgery

10:50.960 --> 10:53.760
being played out by actors who have no idea what they're doing.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.480
Determined to leave, Truman then visits a travel agency.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.000
By this point, Truman's had enough.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.120
He's determined to leave.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.880
He wants to escape this sick society.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.640
So he tries to book a flight to Fiji,

11:02.640 --> 11:04.960
but the clerk says they're all sold out for at least a month.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.560
So then Truman tries to get a bus out,

11:06.560 --> 11:08.720
but it conveniently breaks down just before leaving.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.640
Truman then sitting in a car at home,

11:10.640 --> 11:12.480
waits for his wife to come back from work.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.560
When she does, she gets in the car with him

11:14.560 --> 11:16.560
as he points out the clockwork regularity

11:16.560 --> 11:18.400
of the people who go past their road.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.800
Unsatisfied with her unrealistic reaction to this,

11:20.800 --> 11:24.000
Truman then locks the car and takes Meryl on an impromptu road trip.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.160
To everyone around him, he seems like he's having a breakdown.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.240
He's breaking the rotten habit of surrounding him.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.760
But then instantly traffic jam starts stopping Truman in his tracks.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.200
Truman then pretends to go back home,

11:33.200 --> 11:34.720
which disperses the traffic completely.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.000
But then turns right around

11:36.000 --> 11:38.320
and makes his way out of the suburbs and onto the road.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.280
Once they reach the bridge,

11:39.280 --> 11:40.960
which stands between Truman and the mainland,

11:40.960 --> 11:44.000
it seems that his conditioned aquaphobia will stop his escape plan.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.200
All the conditioning and propaganda is the only barrier to his freedom.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.120
However, Truman overcomes his fears

11:49.120 --> 11:51.440
by closing his eyes and forcing Meryl to steer the car

11:51.440 --> 11:53.040
while he holds down the accelerator.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.240
Once they're over the bridge,

11:54.240 --> 11:56.000
other obstacles are set up by Christoff

11:56.000 --> 11:57.440
to try and stop Truman from leaving.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.280
Truman even drives through wildfire,

11:59.280 --> 12:01.840
but is stopped by a roadblock due to a convenient leak

12:01.840 --> 12:03.280
at the nearby power plant.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.600
In desperation, Truman tries to get through on foot,

12:05.600 --> 12:08.080
but is tackled and subdued by men in hazmat suits,

12:08.080 --> 12:09.200
who take him back home.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.200
The implausibility of all these events

12:11.200 --> 12:13.440
cement Truman's skepticism of the world around him,

12:13.440 --> 12:14.640
which brings up the question,

12:14.640 --> 12:17.280
how many so-called emergency events in our own world

12:17.280 --> 12:18.880
could be equally implausible?

12:19.520 --> 12:21.200
All the lies told by our media,

12:21.200 --> 12:23.200
all the false narratives pushed onto us,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.840
all the divisions sowed by algorithms in the news,

12:25.840 --> 12:28.400
all these layers of fallacy that have been embedded

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
into every aspect of society.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.640
We all have the means to stop this nonsensical

12:32.640 --> 12:34.400
fictional reality that we abide by,

12:34.400 --> 12:36.320
and yet we choose not to confront it.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.360
When anyone does,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.280
they are breaking the habit of surrounding them,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.960
which threatens the whole house of cars

12:40.960 --> 12:42.320
the society is built on,

12:42.320 --> 12:44.400
which is why true authentic reality

12:44.400 --> 12:46.320
is always outrunning our apprehension.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.000
So then how can we ever know the truth

12:48.000 --> 12:49.120
when the lens we look through

12:49.120 --> 12:51.200
is tainted by a corrupted habitus,

12:51.200 --> 12:53.200
tainted by all the models and distractions

12:53.200 --> 12:54.640
that we don't even acknowledge?

12:54.640 --> 12:56.480
If we can't comprehend true reality,

12:56.480 --> 12:58.480
we no longer know what truth is.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.040
We don't have a grasp on what our values really are,

13:01.040 --> 13:03.040
and it's this flattening of our values,

13:03.040 --> 13:04.640
of our society, of our culture

13:04.640 --> 13:06.640
that dampens our outrage and emotion.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.360
Everything becomes muted by a post-modern reality.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.240
In the Truman Show,

13:10.240 --> 13:11.680
Truman's deserved outrage

13:11.680 --> 13:13.280
at the cage he has been trapped in

13:13.280 --> 13:14.480
is never tapped into.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.520
He's never angry,

13:15.520 --> 13:17.600
instead he's always left in a state of confusion

13:17.600 --> 13:18.400
and distraction.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.960
He's meant to feel crazy by searching for the truth.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.960
This is because for the show to be successful,

13:22.960 --> 13:24.800
it relies on Truman and his belief

13:24.800 --> 13:26.080
in the society around him.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.280
If he starts questioning this,

13:27.280 --> 13:28.960
since society goes down with him,

13:28.960 --> 13:31.040
so society has to prevent him from questioning

13:31.040 --> 13:32.480
the habitus he is surrounded by.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.840
And aren't we any different?

13:33.840 --> 13:36.320
Is this why we live in a culture without soul or value?

13:36.320 --> 13:37.600
Where everything we think and do

13:37.600 --> 13:39.200
is shrink down by reductionism.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.520
Where the phenomena of nature, personality,

13:41.520 --> 13:42.640
the essence of life,

13:42.640 --> 13:45.360
is just reduced to statistics and banal labels.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.280
Our world is filled with mystery and wonder.

13:47.280 --> 13:48.400
It's filled with adventure,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.760
but our world is being reduced

13:49.760 --> 13:52.320
to nothing more than a banal monotonous cage,

13:52.320 --> 13:55.520
numbing us into this bored, flaccid, apathetic state,

13:55.520 --> 13:57.520
which is what the Truman Show tries to show us.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.240
Once home, Truman is now feeling like an animal in a cage.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.080
His wife, unable to come down,

14:02.080 --> 14:03.120
offers him some coffee

14:03.120 --> 14:04.960
with a less than subtle product placement.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.480
Truman immediately senses out the fact

14:06.480 --> 14:07.920
that she is performing for someone,

14:07.920 --> 14:09.520
and so he confronts her about it.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.520
He's starting to reject this ridiculous reality

14:11.520 --> 14:12.560
he is surrounded by,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.320
and because of this, he seems crazy,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.480
which is why then the actor of Truman's wife

14:16.480 --> 14:17.680
begins to break character

14:17.680 --> 14:20.080
and pulls out a sharpened kitchen utensil

14:20.080 --> 14:21.280
to defend herself.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.640
It's these sorts of cracks in the show

14:22.640 --> 14:25.280
that only happen when Truman stops believing in it.

14:25.280 --> 14:25.920
Like in our world,

14:25.920 --> 14:28.320
we're now starting to see the rise of political outsiders.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.760
We're seeing the rise of extremism

14:29.760 --> 14:31.520
and a general apathy of all the people

14:31.520 --> 14:33.360
who refuse to believe in our current system.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.800
With our government starting to collapse

14:34.800 --> 14:35.760
with war imminent,

14:35.760 --> 14:37.680
no one trusts our broken society.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.200
And in the case of the Truman Show,

14:39.200 --> 14:40.560
it's this unravelling madness

14:40.560 --> 14:42.000
that almost ends with Truman's wife

14:42.000 --> 14:43.360
revealing her acted role.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.520
Only until Truman's lifelong friend, Marlon,

14:45.520 --> 14:46.640
bursts in at the last minute

14:46.640 --> 14:49.120
and whisks Truman away to have a heart-to-heart conversation.

14:49.120 --> 14:49.840
But at this point,

14:49.840 --> 14:52.000
it's like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.280
The floodgates are now open,

14:53.280 --> 14:54.880
and Truman's belief is dwindling.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.720
In this scene, the two are sitting near the river

14:56.720 --> 14:57.760
and begin reminiscing.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.680
Christoph through Marlon reassures Truman

14:59.680 --> 15:01.680
that Truman's life has meaning and is normal.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.440
He comforts Truman by assuring him

15:03.440 --> 15:05.120
that if what Truman believed was real,

15:05.120 --> 15:07.760
then everyone would have to be in on it, including him.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.560
Though this isn't possible as Marlon would never lie.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.200
On the surface, Truman seemingly takes this into heart.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.640
But deep down, he knows that Marlon

15:14.640 --> 15:15.840
is just a victim of the game.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.560
And so he deliberately shows to him that he bought the ruse.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.400
He knows that Marlon isn't a bad person,

15:20.400 --> 15:22.080
but that he's not a real person.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.800
Morning arrives and Truman seems to be back to his old self.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.560
He draws with a bar of soap on in the morning.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.200
He has the usual conversations with his neighbours and co-workers,

15:29.200 --> 15:32.160
and seems interested in a new office mate he will have next to him.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.640
Evening rolls around and everything seems business as usual

15:34.640 --> 15:35.920
with Truman fast asleep.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.000
However, Christoph senses something is off.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.040
Truman fell asleep in the basement rather than his bed.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.360
So Marlon is again sent over with a six-pack

15:43.360 --> 15:45.520
to investigate and talk Truman back to sense.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.000
However, this time he finds that Truman isn't there

15:48.000 --> 15:49.600
and has escaped from the house.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.160
Christoph calls for all actors to search for Truman,

15:52.160 --> 15:55.040
and for the first time in the show's history, cuts the transmission.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.840
However, even with all the actors searching the entire set,

15:57.840 --> 15:59.120
Truman cannot be found.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.800
At his wit's end, Christoph has the set illuminated into daylight mode early.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.680
And, on a hunch, has the team begin looking through the cameras

16:05.680 --> 16:07.200
near the harbour and on the boat.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.640
After cycling through a few cameras,

16:08.640 --> 16:10.560
the team finds Truman aboard a sailboat,

16:10.560 --> 16:12.960
and Christoph gives the call to resume transmission.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.560
After a few moments of peace sailing,

16:14.560 --> 16:16.160
Christoph is then faced with a dilemma.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.360
He either continues the transmission at risk of Truman finding the truth,

16:19.360 --> 16:21.360
or he gets rid of Truman entirely.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.320
So, he decides to send a violent storm above Truman's boat.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.080
Christoph increases the violence of the weather,

16:26.080 --> 16:28.160
but after a few long minutes, relents.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.720
Amidst this, Truman shows his willingness to die for the truth.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.840
By shouting to the sky,

16:31.840 --> 16:33.040
is this the best you've got?

16:33.040 --> 16:34.400
Christoph, in Godlike stupid,

16:34.400 --> 16:36.960
descends to send the most violent bout of weather yet.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.880
All to the dismay of his crew and producer.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.440
Truman, however, holds on, but is knocked unconscious.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.480
But at the last minute, Christoph rescues the weather and removes the storm,

16:44.480 --> 16:46.080
resuming the tranquil waters.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.880
Truman regains consciousness and begins sailing his boat again.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.520
He has beaten the storm and the sea seems to be in his favor.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.800
However, after a few minutes,

16:52.800 --> 16:55.440
the bow of Truman's boat launches through the side of the set,

16:55.440 --> 16:57.040
leaving a big hole in the skydome.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.600
By now, all of Truman's suspicions have been confirmed,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.760
and in an ecstasy, begins punching the wall.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.640
However, the reality of Truman's situation begins to dawn on him,

17:04.640 --> 17:06.560
as he sees the ramp at the end of the water.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.880
Truman walks across this ramp, walking on the water.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.000
The audience is gripped.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.840
The culmination of his 30 years in the Truman show seems to be at its finale.

17:13.840 --> 17:17.200
Truman locates a staircase and slowly ascends to the side of the set.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.080
At the top, he locates the door labeled exit and opens it,

17:20.080 --> 17:21.600
revealing the abyss beyond his realm.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.680
The gold-like voice then thunders through the sky,

17:23.680 --> 17:28.000
as Christoph reveals that Truman was the star of the TV show with the whole world watching.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.520
Truman asks, was nothing real?

17:29.520 --> 17:32.240
And in response, Christoph responds that Truman is real,

17:32.240 --> 17:34.560
and that's what made him so enjoyable for millions.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.560
Christoph then tries to keep Truman in the set,

17:36.560 --> 17:39.360
by indicating that there was no more truth out in the real world,

17:39.360 --> 17:41.920
and that in the world he created for him, he had nothing to fear.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.280
The ignorance was bliss.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.720
After a few moments of silence,

17:44.720 --> 17:48.240
Truman looks up at the camera and says his final words before leaving the show.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.160
Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.360
It's Truman's overriding impulse to return to what is real,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.440
that makes the entire show fall apart.

17:55.440 --> 18:00.080
His drive to understand true reality is enough to bring down the false reality he'd been living in.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.520
As he goes through the door, this symbolizes Truman taking back control,

18:03.520 --> 18:06.160
and turning back on a sterile, hollowed-out reality.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.000
And today, we're in the same process.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.400
The increasingly ridiculousness of our society,

18:10.400 --> 18:13.360
and the habitus that we're serviled to, is beginning to crack.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.320
With our world, economy, and culture crumbling into the ground,

18:16.320 --> 18:18.560
we're seeing a rejection of this tired system.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.840
We're seeing new waves of younger generations dropping out of the workforce,

18:21.840 --> 18:25.600
rejecting the habitus imposed on them, and millions taking the untrodden path,

18:25.600 --> 18:28.000
which is causing society to reach a crossroads.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.560
We're faced with a new path, because those in control of our reality are now making a new one.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.040
A path of metaverse is in virtual AI reality to take us astray from our current world,

18:37.040 --> 18:39.920
and the other path is a reversion back to what is truly felt.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.520
But whichever path we take, our belief in society is falling apart.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.080
The cracks are starting to show everywhere you look,

18:46.080 --> 18:48.320
and the game is collapsing in on itself.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.320
So the question is, where does it go from here?

18:53.280 --> 18:55.440
I have a quick, important announcement to make.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.200
I'm sick of being demonetized on YouTube.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.760
I'm sick of censoring these videos for the YouTube algorithm.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.040
So this is going to change.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.680
Every month, I'm going to be releasing unfiltered, raw, controversial videos for YouTube members.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.120
Videos about the darkest corners of the internet, TikTok, the CIA,

19:09.120 --> 19:11.680
China Rothschilds, and Mr. Robot's series review.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.680
And by the end of the month slash early August,

19:13.680 --> 19:17.280
I'll be releasing a video on Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unibomber,

19:17.280 --> 19:20.320
where we'll talk about his story, going from a mathematical prodigy

19:20.320 --> 19:22.400
to living in the wild, sending bombs in the mail,

19:22.400 --> 19:25.360
and having his manifesto on the front page of the New York Times.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.840
Not only that, but by becoming a member of the channel,

19:27.840 --> 19:31.120
you'll have access to my Discord server to talk with other like-minded people,

19:31.120 --> 19:33.920
where every month I'll be doing a Q&A for all your questions.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.560
And if you're still not happy with your membership in the first month,

19:36.560 --> 19:38.000
I will personally refund you.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.600
All you have to do is email me.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.520
So if you want to watch exclusive, unfiltered,

19:41.520 --> 19:43.760
controversial videos that I can't release to the public,

19:43.760 --> 19:46.320
which includes access to my server and a monthly Q&A,

19:46.320 --> 19:48.480
join my channel for only £5.99 a month.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.360
This will also help us out a ton too in making these videos.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.200
And if you want to support the channel even more,

19:53.200 --> 19:56.320
I will hard code your name into my videos for only £3 more.
