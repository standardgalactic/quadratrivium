0	4080	Imagine if you lived in a world where you were constantly watched, a world where everything
4080	8560	is controlled by the elite, where you're bombarded with non-stop propaganda, a world where everyone
8560	14160	is repressed, lonely and isolated, existing as one insignificant cog in an incomprehensible machine.
14160	19600	This is the chilling vision of the future that George Orwell put forward in his masterpiece 1984,
19600	24160	and does it sound familiar? It's no coincidence that his predictions have come true nearly every
24160	29520	single way in our modern society today, so let's take a deep dive into the story of 1984 to learn
29520	34640	how you're all being controlled and if you can ever break free. Now the movie begins with a quote
34640	39040	from the iconic book that it was adapted from, who controls the past controls the future,
39040	44240	who controls the present controls the past, and this sets the stage. And then without delay,
44240	48640	we are then shown the iconic shots of a crowd of people staring at propaganda presented by the
48640	53200	party. The party is the shadowy government which controls every aspect of life through their
53200	59200	ideology in suck. The basic principle is to control information so tightly that every aspect of life
59200	64960	is dictated and controlled by the party. Absolute obedience is expected, down to rejecting basic
64960	69840	facts about life and even your own thoughts and memories. On the screen, a video player is creating
69840	75200	an idyllic image of the country that the West has become, all under this totalitarian rule, Oceana.
75200	80400	This is one of the three super states which make up the world of 1984, with control over the Americas,
80400	84640	Britain, Australia and some parts of Africa. And this is when we're introduced to the concept of
84640	89120	Big Brother and a man named Goldstein who attempts to persuade the people of Oceana that they are
89120	93200	being duped. But despite the truth in what he's saying, it's drowned out by shouts from the
93200	97840	audience. Insoc has conditioned them to reject the truth entirely, to the point they don't even want
97840	101920	to hear it. Throughout the demonstration, you can see the Insoc salutes, something that was
101920	106960	borrowed from historical totalitarian regimes. And after this propaganda video reaches its climax,
106960	111200	the crowd is pacified by the symbol of Insoc, alongside the face of Big Brother.
112720	116560	It's afterwards that we're introduced to our main character, Winston Smith, who is working
116560	121120	in an office cubicle for the Ministry of Truth. His job is to edit past broadcasts to reflect
121120	125040	the current reality that they're pushing. So if the sugar ration has been reduced from last year,
125040	128960	he will then edit last year's paper to imply that it actually went up instead. And then once he's
128960	133360	finished with his day's work, Winston makes his way back home, where propaganda has already been
133360	138000	played in his house. This time it's a man being shamed for falling under Goldstein's influence.
138000	142320	The man has been charged for attempting to persuade the public that they're not at a war with Eurasia,
142320	147360	but rather East Asia. This information control and Eurasia is central to Big Brother's control
147360	152960	of the people. As over time, the party has rewritten reality to suit their needs. Now Winston is a
152960	157680	key part of this process, but obviously this brings up contradictions. And that's where the concept
157680	163200	of double thing comes in. The idea of wholeheartedly believing in two separate contradictory facts.
163200	167520	One of the examples they give in the novel is the simultaneous belief that the party is a bastion
167520	173120	of democracy. And also that democracy is impossible. And it's through this concept that the party
173120	178880	rewrites reality, replacing it with an illusion of their own creation. And this is the all-encompassing
178880	184480	lie that maintains 1984 society. It's only through everyone believing it that it becomes real. But
184480	188960	this concept of a world founded on fiction isn't something that all are created all by himself.
188960	192720	Instead, this is something that's very real and has been observed throughout history.
192720	196880	Thousands of years ago, Plato wrote some of the first recorded philosophy on this concept.
196880	201520	Through what he called the noble lie, where people know their place in society through their belief
201520	206160	an entirely fictional story about the society's origin. The details aren't important,
206160	210480	so long as it gives justification for the social order. And this gives people a reason to accept
210480	214720	how the world is and that their equal man is somehow better or worse than him. And we see this
214720	218800	today when our own version of Big Brother's is one thing and then means another. Like when the
218800	223200	establishment media, politicians and world economic forum claim to be working for freedom and free
223200	228160	speech, also while doing everything they can to bully and censor all criticism into silence.
228160	232480	And there are just countless examples of this. Like when the fattest, most grotesque politicians
232480	236720	of them all claim that they're promoting health. And this concept has evolved over time as people
236720	241520	realise that all of society's institutions are built upon a necessary fiction. And this is known
241520	246320	as the habitus. It's the thou you need to see through for society to make sense. Now the concept
246320	250400	is similar to the noble lie, but the habitus goes much deeper. You see throughout your life,
250480	254240	you are influenced by your environment and your interactions with other people. And these,
254240	258480	combined with your personality, create your view of the world. And it's in this way that you buy
258480	263200	into the habitus, the shared societal illusion of how the world should be. You are socialised into
263200	268080	the habitus. It's come down from above and everyone else around you believes in it. The habitus is
268080	272640	the social contract between you, your fellow man and the government. And it's what determines your
272640	277200	culture. It's what determines all the societal trends around you. And therefore also decides
277200	282080	the rules of society. And this stretches to everything, our ideas of beauty, what's seen as
282080	286160	valuable, what's seen as even right and wrong. But because it's influenced by the environment and
286160	291120	how people treat each other, the habitus is always changing to reflect this. And the world of 1984
291120	297360	operates on a habitus. The problem with the 1984 habitus is that it's been cracked to the top
297360	301680	and severely deformed. And because it's been poisoned to the top, it's trickled down into
301680	308000	all elements of society. And this is why 1984 is so scary. In fact, 1984 is far more unsettling
308000	312240	than any dumb horror film because it's so realistic. We all instinctively know what the
312240	316960	future could be like because we're so close to it today. Our society that we live in right now is
316960	321680	just a few steps away from totalitarianism. And all while we're trying to warn us of all of this.
321680	325760	Because throughout the story, we're going to see exactly how the party has brought the habitus
325760	330800	and society and how it's affected everyone within the society. So getting straight back into the
330800	335440	story, and we see Winston sitting alone in his decrepit apartment, and it's here after lighting
335440	340320	a cigarette that Winston introduces us the concept of thought crime. Now thought crime is the act of
340320	345760	going against the habitus of the world, even in your deepest thoughts. Just considering rebellion
345760	350240	is already rebellion because it's something outside of the party's reality. The party enforces
350240	354400	this through the thought police, a secret organization which uses informant surveillance
354400	359040	and undercover agents to root out anyone who even thinks about rebelling. And as the propaganda
359040	363120	continues playing in the background on the ever present screen, Winston lifts a brick from his
363120	367120	house and uncovers his journal, something that's definitely banned in the world he lives in. And
367120	371680	it's in this journal that Winston reminisces about a world where thought was free, a time where minds
371680	375520	weren't controlled by big brother and the thought police. And by doing this, he's already become a
375520	379600	thought criminal just through his own memories. And upon waking up the next day, Winston is then
379600	384000	subjected to a mandatory exercise routine in front of his television, to which he is signalled out for
384000	388880	not performing adequately. Winston then half-heartedly waves the insoucane signal and makes his way to
388880	392560	work. And that's when he treats it even more propaganda playing on the television during
392560	396800	lunch hour. However, what instead catches the eye of Winston is a young woman staring at him.
396800	400800	Winston then sits down and begins eating his meal, when one of his colleagues comments on the new
400800	405600	shortened dictionary and how positive the destructions of word really is. Newspeak, as they call it,
405600	409840	is a new language invented by the party that reduces English to its bare essentials,
409840	414160	where controversial words are removed, meaning that if it works then rebellion will be impossible,
414160	418800	because it won't even be able to be considered. The words just won't exist for it. Back at work,
418800	423280	Winston then continues his job at the Ministry of Truth, this time unpersoning someone. Now
423280	427280	unpersoning is the act of essentially removing someone from history and replacing them with
427280	431920	someone else. And this is just one of the many aspects of 1984 which has its roots in previous
431920	436400	autocracies. Now in this, all world was specifically alluding to Stalin's dictatorship, where this
436400	440560	was an extremely common practice. Enemies of the state or rather enemies of Stalin wouldn't just
440560	445200	be executed. Every mention of their name and even their image and photographs was erased,
445200	449440	completely removing them from history. However, this practice of course hasn't died out.
449440	453360	The Chinese government, for example, was infamous for disappearing anyone they don't like.
453360	457360	Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba, essentially disappeared from public view after making
457360	461440	economic suggestions that would shift power away from the Chinese Communist Party. And today,
461440	464960	he's all but vanished from the public eye, spending his time in exile under constant
464960	469440	surveillance. But we're not just talking about China, this is happening all over the West. When
469440	473520	anyone who speaks out against the agenda set in place by Western governments, they are then often
473520	477760	censored or bullied into silence. Whether it be Julian Assange or Edward Snowden talking about
477760	481680	the government's crimes, or any other supposed thought criminal who's been cancelled on social
481680	485920	media for talking about COVID and its origins. Anything deemed a thought crime and you can
485920	490160	be cancelled immediately. I mean it's gone to the point now where FBI and other government
490160	495680	intelligence agencies are infiltrating and working in conjunction with all the big social media sites.
495680	500240	And once they have control of sites like Twitter, they can then censor any narrative they don't like,
500240	504240	shadow banning or completely deleting people from the sites. But it's not just social media
504240	509600	companies. Now even companies like Uber, PayPal and even Airbnb can ban you for having the wrong
509600	514640	opinions online. And then over in China is their infamous social credit system. The basic idea is
514640	518480	for each person to be assigned a personal score based on how trust whether they are according
518480	522560	to the Chinese government. Certain things can increase your score, like making a social media
522560	526800	post praising the government. But on the other hand, things like getting into debt, buying too many
526800	531680	video games, reading the bible or criticizing the government, deducts points from your score.
531680	536240	And if your score falls too low, the CCP will then severely reduce your already restricted
536240	540480	freedoms. As people with a low score can have trouble buying train or even plane tickets,
540480	544160	some people have even had their pets taken away from them. With one student even been denied a
544160	548400	place at university because his father had a low score. For now the system has only been put into
548400	552560	practice by some scattered regional governments, but it won't be that way for very long. And recently
552560	556480	is usually being pushed through new laws to lay the groundwork, meaning that a nationwide social
556560	561440	credit system is just a few years away. I mean recently it's gotten so bad in China that a new
561440	565920	law just passed, which means that farmers can only plant the crops the government approves of.
565920	571360	And the personal planting of vegetables like beans, melons, squashes in your front or backyard is now
571360	576000	strictly forbidden. And in the west we're also seeing a gradual progression of repression,
576000	580320	which is exactly what George Orwell feared. So after he finishes with his work for the day,
580320	584160	Winston makes his way to an antique store in the slum districts of London and meets the owner
584160	588880	who sold him his journal. He buys a coral figurine, tapes with glass, and makes his way out of the
588880	592960	store, where he meets the same woman who was staring at him during lunch. The woman continues
592960	597440	looking at him ominously, going into the proletariat zones in London, something that is forbidden by
597440	602080	the party. She could slum out and so Winston considers killing her back at his apartment.
602080	605840	Coincidentally enough though, the two see each other the very next day in an underpass. The
605840	610240	woman stumbles and forces the ground, but quickly makes her way back on her feet. Secretly as he's
610240	615040	helping her, the woman hands Winston a note before leaving. At work, Winston unveils the note and
615040	620240	he reads, I love you. Along with a meetup location on the backside, seemingly without a second thought,
620240	624480	Winston tosses the note into the incinerator, and we transition back to his apartment,
624480	628480	but Winston is fixing his neighbour's drain at the behest of his neighbour's wife. At the apartment,
628480	631840	one of the neighbour's children loudly accuses him of being a thought criminal. Obviously this
631840	635920	makes Winston very nervous. It's an accusation which can lead to death and suffering, and it's
635920	640720	coincidentally true, but both of the adults ignore it. It's just a result of youth indoctrination.
640720	644640	However, it's true all the same. Luckily before the confrontation go any further though,
644640	648240	a newsflash interrupts the engagement. The announcement states that the war with Eurasia
648240	652560	is reaching an end, but with how the flow of information works in a totalitarian state,
652560	656400	who can really say if this is the case? And as afterwards we see immobile citizens cheering
656400	660960	on executions playing from the television, along with a bunch of Eurasian prisoners being escorted
660960	664960	to their impending death. Winston is among this crowd, along with a mysterious woman who hands
664960	669360	Winston another note. She is relying on him to destroy it. Winston abides and says that he will
669360	673600	finally meet her at the drop point, taking a train to the destination. On the train ride,
673600	677920	a band of children are then singing a propaganda song, where they pledge lower devotion to the state
677920	682080	and to die with dignity. And it's in these two scenes where we see a worrying aspect of the
682080	687680	war in 1984. The party only came to power just a few decades ago, but the new generation of
687680	692240	completely indoctrinated children is already approaching adulthood. In the novel, Winston
692240	696480	notes that the children are the most pragmatic and fanatic supporters of Big Brother. Growing up
696480	700800	in the system means that a habitus is completely under the control of government, one day the
700800	704640	last people who can remember the old war like Winston will die, leaving no one left who knows
704640	709600	anything outside of the state's control. A truly terrifying thought. And so once Winston exits on
709600	714000	a stop, we see our first glimpse of nature in the movie. This change of scenery is a stark contrast
714000	718160	to the industrial environment that the majority of Oceana presides in. Winston is now out in the
718160	722960	forest and looking for the drop point, until he hears a twig snap behind him. It's the woman,
722960	726800	and she has been following him the whole time. When the two get to a scheduled hiding place,
726800	730960	it's here where we get an insight into Winston's worldview. After learning that the woman has done
730960	734960	this exact stunt with hundreds of men, Winston says that he hates goodness, and doesn't want
734960	748080	virtue to exist anywhere. Winston wants everyone corrupt,
748480	752720	much to the delight of the woman. This state of mind is a direct response to the tyranny of
752720	757440	Winston's society, meaning that everything the party in the habitus sees as good is turned on
757440	762160	its head. And because of this overwhelming level of control in the society, all Winston really
762160	766400	wants to do is yell bullshit at all the lies slung at him. But most of the things that Winston
766400	770880	thinks are bad or corrupted just aren't, the normal parts of life which the party sees as a
770880	775040	threat to their authority, and therefore its outlawed. It's part of the tactic of keeping
775040	780320	the people impoverished and uneducated, as this makes them far easier to control. Because real
780320	785120	education and economic prosperity are the two worst things for Big Brother. As they're not
785120	789600	trying to enlighten you or save your soul, it's all about control. The more you commit to their
789600	793840	ideology, the more they can poison your soul. And that's why in the book All Well Writes,
793840	798640	every record has been destroyed or failed, every book rewritten, every picture repainted,
798640	803680	every statue in street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. It's a beautiful
803680	808240	thing the destruction of words. And today in our own world, we're seeing a very similar process
808240	812880	unfold. You see things as simple as children's books. I'm talking real dull books, and now
812880	818000	being pushed through a demented purity filter, where all bad words or paragraphs are now being
818000	823040	rewritten. Words like witches have been turned to hags, fat turned to ginormous, black person to
823040	827920	dark, cloud men to cloud people. Entire sections of these children books are being rewritten to
827920	832400	eliminate any wrongthink. And this isn't just children's books, this is happening throughout
832400	837040	all genres. Roald Dahl's just the most egregious example of this. But it doesn't even stop there,
837040	841920	because even a recent UK government-backed report has now claimed that reading George All
841920	847760	Well's 1984 is a sign of quote, extremism. So Western governments are now characterising people
847760	853280	who read 1984 as potential enemies of the state. And this isn't just happening with words,
853280	857600	we're also seeing this in the same form of economic control. As we're all familiar with,
857600	862320	the past few decades have seen enormous inequality that has steadily risen over the last 40 years.
862320	867360	Which is why by 2019, the world's richest 26 people earned more wealth than the poorest 50%.
868080	872080	But then after COVID, the biggest wealth transfer in history occurred. Now to put into
872080	877200	scale how big this wealth transfer truly was, we have to look at the stats. In early 2020,
877200	882560	before COVID began, billionaires alone as just people, earned 2% of total global wealth. And
882560	886720	this is only including publicly available information. But just a year later, and this
886720	893840	number was now 3.5%. 1.5% more of the total global wealth has gone to just billionaires alone,
893840	898160	all in a single year. And the result of this is ginormous wealth for the top elites,
898160	902240	and a never-ending hamster wheel for the masses. Where you can never control your own money,
902240	906560	where you never own anything, where you have no property, land or assets, or even any prospect
906560	910640	of owning these things in the future, just continually renting everything with nothing to
910640	914720	your name. Because in the last couple years, as wages have stagnated, the cost of everything
914720	918800	around you has gone up exponentially, only continued to go up and up while your income
918800	923280	starts to shrink. And so it was no surprise that as this great wealth transfer unfolded,
923280	927920	the World Economic Forum unveiled their new plan, the Great Reset. Now for those of you
927920	932560	unaware, the World Economic Forum is a priestly class of people, mixed up with global leaders,
932560	937280	rural families, black rock, the world's biggest companies, the biggest banks, the biggest pharmaceutical
937280	941840	companies, mainstream media outlets and the top celebrities. Pretty much a culmination of the
941840	946160	world's most powerful people. And these are the people who create agendas and policies that
946160	951120	are then adopted by organizations such as the UN, World Bank, IMF and national governments.
951120	956000	And this private organization has no democratic vote, and yet it is quite clearly one of the most
956000	960960	powerful organizations the world has ever seen. Not just affecting the West, but also Russia and
960960	965680	China. So when they unveiled their plan for a Great Reset, this marked a new chapter in human
965680	970160	history. And the leader of this organization is Klaus Schwab, who claimed the Great Reset would
970160	976320	provide a unique window of opportunity to reshape our world. And I see the need for action. I see
976320	980800	the need for a Great Reset. And one part of this agenda was to make the world greener and more
980800	985600	carbon neutral, which sounds great. But what exactly did he mean by this? Well, as you might have
985600	990240	noticed, all governments in the West in just the last year have promoted these policies heavily,
990240	994640	with the West now being forced to cut their ammonium and nitrogen emissions by 50% alone.
994640	998320	However, for many farmers in Europe, their livestock normally produce ammonia,
998320	1004400	urine and feces. And so farmers all across Europe were recently forced to cut 30% of their livestock,
1004400	1008800	which meant huge swaths of farmers were forced out of business by the government. And yet these
1008800	1013280	same rules never applied for sectors like the airline industry. So suddenly, farmers and workers
1013280	1017600	across Europe protested. But at first, these protests were smeared as just crazy right-wingers.
1017600	1021600	But as this resentment grew and the protests gripped European nations, the government acted
1021600	1026160	harshly, with live rounds being fired upon these protesters. I mean, in the Netherlands,
1026160	1031120	they even changed the law that officers who killed protesters were now immune from manslaughter
1031120	1035040	charges. And whilst the media covered this up, the Dutch government would never receive any
1035040	1039680	backlash as they were cowing to the World Economic Forum orders. And the working class people in
1039680	1043520	Europe were forced to see their futures destroyed before them as they were attacked and mocked in
1043520	1047440	the media. And so it was no surprise that around this period, Klaus Schwab, the leader of the
1047440	1052800	World Economic Forum, warned of increasing anger. We have to prepare for a more angry world.
1052800	1056320	Because the Western governments were now forcing the food supply to run dry,
1056320	1060960	whilst artificially inflating the prices amidst the global food shortage, only deepening the
1060960	1065280	economic crisis that the majority of the West were facing. And in an act of double-think,
1065280	1069840	something that came straight out of 1984, media outlets like Reuters would then claim that there
1069840	1074160	was no evidence that the Dutch government worked with the World Economic Forum to impose these
1074160	1078480	new laws. Which really isn't all that surprising given the World Economic Forum partnered with
1078480	1083360	Reuters for exclusive content distribution, as the World Economic Forum, otherwise known as Big
1083360	1087600	Brother, controls the flow of information. And whilst you might not see the anger in the news,
1087600	1091840	these protests haven't stopped in Europe. I mean, just recently, protests have gripped the country
1091840	1096400	of France. As the President Macron has risen the pension age, many is going to take longer and longer
1096400	1101040	before workers can ever receive a pension. Even though the majority of France hates this idea,
1101040	1106480	this was imposed anyway, as democracy in Western nations is becoming a façade. In fact, democracies
1106480	1110720	aren't even obeying the people anymore. They obey corporate and financial interests rather than
1110720	1114880	the popular vote, the World Economic Forum over the people. And that's why our freedoms have
1114880	1119280	slowly been stripped economically and socially. Because if everyone had social and economic
1119280	1123600	freedom, then the whole system would collapse. And instead of new parties emerging and addressing
1123600	1128400	these protests, you're now seeing the militarisation of the police, more surveillance, more distraction.
1128400	1132640	And it's following this agenda that people like Bill Gates are claiming at the World Economic Forum
1132640	1137280	that during our current worst cost of living crisis, and the ongoing fuel shortages,
1137280	1141440	build things that workers should now also be paying carbon taxes. All whilst people like
1141440	1145280	Bill Gates are using the most carbon of all. They'll preach things like private property
1145280	1149680	for the average person will be a bygone relic, all whilst snapping up record amounts of farmland
1149680	1154560	across the US. Following their mantra of your own nothing and be happy. And all you're left with is
1154560	1158960	again, more distraction, more noise, more misery, more tension and more depression. No more family
1158960	1163520	units, less farms, less freedoms and no more rights to pursue happiness. And this is just one
1163520	1167680	of the reasons our habitat has been violently shifted towards consumerism and hollow material
1167680	1172640	wealth. Because we're being starved of it. And it's the perfect means to keep control in society.
1172640	1176560	But how did things ever get this bad? This has never really happened in living memory.
1176560	1180720	But what all world didn't foresee was that pleasure was just as useful a tool to keep
1180720	1184640	the masses numbed. You see, as they slowly siphon the wealth out of the economy,
1184640	1188880	the elites keep us distracted with hollow, empty hedonism. And modern technology is the
1188880	1193920	perfect tools for this. By exploiting the basic social need to be accepted, social media applications
1193920	1197920	exploit your dopamine receptors in the exact same way as cocaine. Years of split testing of
1197920	1201840	perfecting the algorithms and billions of dollars in research have made big tech companies like
1201840	1206400	Facebook and TikTok as addictive as possible. And as people build up a tolerance, they always need
1206400	1210800	more content faster to stay engaged, all while procrastinating and wasting their life away,
1210800	1215120	being numbed into flaccid apathy in their bedrooms. The rise of TikTok, YouTube Shorts and
1215120	1219680	all these other short form social media sites is just a direct result of this process. It's why
1219680	1223840	we're developing parasocial relationships with streamers and not our own communities.
1223840	1227200	Given the people, the illusion of community and knowing what's going on in the world,
1227200	1231600	we're without any real substance or true information. And by providing a drip drip of
1231600	1236480	anodine lethargic dross, the meaning in your life is sucked away. The resentment you feel
1236480	1241360	at the government is numbed and repressed inside of you. And so you accept it. And anytime you
1241360	1245440	feel depressed, isolated, like things are just outside of your control, there's always that
1245440	1250560	little dopamine fix just sitting in your pocket, pushing people more and more into the online realms,
1250560	1254480	stuck alone in your bedroom. And the result of this is what you see today, the most depressed
1254480	1259200	and downtrodden generation in living memory. As the normal societal habitat is breaking down,
1259200	1262720	it's taking away your motivation to go out in the world and make something of yourself.
1262720	1266400	You don't have the energy to call out bullshit against your government and the people preaching
1266400	1272000	their agenda. Responsibility, duty, purpose, these key pairs that have motivated men for millennia
1272000	1276400	have all been pushed out of the societal framework. Instead, consumerism and greed are the only things
1276400	1281040	to look up to now. But the worst aspect of this is the effect it's had on people's relationships
1281040	1286640	with each other. I mean, our current habitat right now is leaving 63% of men under age 30,
1286640	1291840	single and alone, and a large majority of them on dating a tool. Millions of men are experiencing
1291840	1296000	the exact same lovelessness that Winston's known his entire life up until now.
1298160	1301040	But before we continue, I want to tell you about something I've been working on this
1301040	1304960	past month. You see, I've built something that I legitimately think will change your life,
1304960	1309200	because you see, from most of your life, you've always been fed a constant stream of lies.
1309200	1312240	Lies that have poisoned your value systems, purpose and passion in life,
1312240	1316720	whilst also poisoning the community around you. And it's why you feel so lazy, so meaningless,
1316720	1320880	so lonely. And so it's time that we've come up with real solutions, not just modern-day
1320960	1324880	BS solutions. I'm talking about a new form of community, a way for us to take back control
1324880	1329120	of our lives. Where I will go deep into the real solutions, answers and value systems of
1329120	1333280	thousands of philosophers consents into an easy to understand package, or to help you improve
1333280	1337680	your life. All at no cost to you, I will send you a weekly essay on the solutions to the problems
1337680	1341440	we discuss on this channel, so just click on the link in the description and add your email
1341440	1345840	on the name down below. After Winston and the woman get to know each other a little better,
1345840	1349920	we then transition back to the antique store, where Winston plans on renting out the place,
1349920	1353760	and once they're sure they're finally somewhere private, the jurors secretly engage
1353760	1358400	in an unsanctioned relationship against the state. We also finally get the name of the woman,
1358400	1363280	being revealed as Julia. In this moment, both of them can finally relax and enjoy themselves,
1363280	1367520	even if just for a little while. They then enjoy some contraband items that Julia smuggles from
1367520	1372080	the party like real chocolate and coffee, and for a while their little conspiracy works quite
1372080	1376480	well for them. Up until this point, Winston has been completely in the dark on whether there's
1376480	1381280	an active resistance movement, but in his mind, he's certain that he has some level of understanding
1381280	1386320	with an inner party member, a man called O'Brien. So when O'Brien corners Winston in a hallway,
1386320	1390880	he's full of hope for a way to resist. O'Brien tells Winston that he's a fan of his writing,
1390880	1395360	but he does mention that there were a few unwords in his latest piece, and recommends he reads the
1395360	1400080	state's next dictionary edition. When he goes to collect it from O'Brien's office, Winston is
1400080	1404800	astounded by the luxuries that he enjoys. He offers him real wine, something that Winston has never
1404800	1409680	tasted before, and O'Brien can even turn off his telescreen. But the most precious thing O'Brien
1409680	1414240	offers Winston is hope, when he tells him about the resistance against the party, and it's here
1414240	1419840	that we get an introduction to the shadowy practices of how Ensok truly operates. Between the pages of
1419840	1424640	dictionary that O'Brien gave him, Winston finds a different book titled, The Theory and Practice of
1424640	1429200	Oligarchal Collectivism, which is basically a manual on how Ensok and Big Brother operate,
1429200	1433440	and the author is listed as Emmanuel Goldstein. Now it goes over a lot of what we've already
1434000	1437760	covered, but it also tells Winston about what's really going on in the world's politics.
1437760	1442880	You see, in the world of 1984, three super states have reached global dominance. There's Oceana,
1442880	1448000	which controls the Americas, South Africa, and the UK. Then there's Eurasia, a Soviet successor state,
1448000	1452160	which rules over Russia, parts of Asia, and Europe. And then finally there's East Asia,
1452160	1457760	a successor of China, which controls the Far East. The three states exist in a constant cycle of war,
1457760	1461680	endlessly shifting alliances and fighting for control over the rest of the world,
1461680	1465360	but they're not trying to win. They all have enough resources for their impoverished people.
1465360	1469760	The states are also pretty much the same in their beliefs. Eurasia's neo-Bolshevikism
1469760	1474400	and East Asia's obliteration of the self are almost identical to Ensok, meaning there aren't
1474400	1479360	really any ideological differences. Instead, this war only exists to suck up resources and
1479360	1484480	keep people in poverty. It keeps their societies and their brutal ideologies running, all in order
1484480	1489600	to maintain control. George Orwell envisioned a dead end to put it simply. A world where progress
1489600	1493680	and forward movement have been stifled by three world powers to guarantee their control over the
1493680	1498720	people. And so as Winston sits at home, we learn that Oceana has once again shifted alliances,
1498720	1503600	and now the war is with East Asia, and Eurasia is now their ally. Which is just another bit of
1503600	1507360	double-think, and it doesn't really change anything for Oceana's people. It's just more
1507360	1511680	propaganda and more control for the populace. And that's why the parallels of our real life
1511680	1517360	politics and that of 1984 is truly uncanny, where secret families and powerful shadowy
1517360	1522320	organizations like the World Economic Forum fuel both sides of wars, where world enemies
1522320	1526720	are friends behind closed doors, where governments continually change our enemies and ally with
1526720	1530720	people that we're told to hate. But then this really does beg the question, where do these
1530720	1535040	big, powerful governments and these shadowy organizations actually come from? Why does
1535040	1540560	Big Brother exist? And why do we decide as humans to follow the order of these totalitarian regimes
1540560	1544640	and governments? Well, the answer simply lies in understanding how governments form in the first
1544720	1548880	place. Now, Thomas Hobbes was one of the first political theorists to understand this, in his
1548880	1553200	widely renowned book, Leviathan. Now, he wrote this after his experiences during the English
1553200	1558160	Civil War, a brutal conflict where the country for over a decade was split into two by the
1558160	1562640	parliamentarians and the royalists. During this period, but headings were common and the violence
1562640	1567760	was barbaric, and it was this chaos that inspired his thoughts on governance. In his book, he first
1567760	1572160	talks about human nature and primitive life, back in the time when human were cavemen, living a
1572160	1577680	tribal existence. And he famously described this life as nasty, brutish, and short. The lack of
1577680	1582800	laws and complete chaos of nature led to a constant fear of death in the people. There was no actual
1582800	1586800	progress, because people were either too afraid of each other or just too busy in their fight for
1586800	1591840	survival. There was hardly any social cohesion, there was no rule of law, and there was no societal
1591840	1596560	development. And it was this primitive fear for survival that laid the groundwork for society.
1596560	1601280	So to avoid this constant struggle for survival, men willingly lay down their claims to the world
1601280	1606000	to live in a peaceful collective under one powerful ruler. And for Thomas Hobbes, this was
1606000	1611280	the optimal form of government, where one powerful state with a sole ruler did his best to protect
1611280	1616560	the people. That way, everything follows one trajectory of the leader. All quarrels between
1616560	1621360	the masses are distilled by ultimate power, and only then can the lives of everyone improve.
1621360	1625600	But you see, Thomas Hobbes was actually wrong with this, as this only ever worked with a truly
1625600	1630800	virtuous and benevolent ruler. And yet the oligarchy of 1984 and the oligarchies we see today
1630800	1634720	are just the complete opposite of this. But nonetheless, when there is this benevolent
1634720	1640000	ruler who controls a massive population, the culture and societal norms of that population
1640000	1645200	always trickle down from the top. And this is where social habitus forms. Now it may change
1645200	1649440	based on the environment and the people that form the society, but a specific code of conduct
1649440	1653680	always takes shape along the same lines. You see, for example, in a healthy society,
1653680	1659200	the habitus is always focused on ideals like liberty, responsibility, virtue and discipline.
1659280	1663840	These would be the values virtues and moral code of the elite, and then that would trickle down
1663840	1669200	into all areas of society. So this is how the habitus works. And sociologists use the idea of
1669200	1673520	habitus to illustrate the manner in which a society's culture works. You see, there are many
1673520	1679200	unspoken assumptions and standards that underpin society. These are frequently carried out automatically,
1679200	1683680	and they are more akin to acquired skills than deliberate actions. The French thinker Bordeaux,
1683680	1688160	who popularized the word, frequently linked it to sports. For example, the rules of football are
1688160	1692240	set in stone, and you play the game without thinking why the rules are there in the first place.
1692240	1696480	And yet these rules are crucial, otherwise the whole game just wouldn't work without it.
1696480	1700320	And this is also how societies and culture flourishes. And that's why the renaissance
1700320	1704640	was so remarkable. The new habitus that was developing in Europe in this time gave birth
1704640	1709520	to a whole new wave of creativity, discipline, focus, moral code and beauty. But then what
1709520	1713840	happens when the values of the elite starts to crack, and the habitus becomes poisoned?
1713840	1717120	What does this then mean for the rest of society? Well, you don't really have to
1717120	1721280	look very far to see how fractured and malformed our habitus has become. I mean,
1721280	1725280	we only need to take a look at who our icons are in society to give us an understanding of
1725280	1730000	what has truly happened here. Due to our hyper crony capitalist system, the elites in their greed
1730000	1734400	and love of money have spread into every level of society. And I'm not talking about simple
1734400	1739040	capitalism here. I'm talking about the special kind, the special kind of corporatism and socialism
1739040	1743440	for the rich. You see, for example, we no longer value the European holistic lifestyle,
1743440	1748480	where a person's value is based on many layers of their personality. Instead, today in the West,
1748480	1753280	we only value the superficial to understand someone's value. And this explains the rapid
1753280	1757840	rise of these fake gurus you see online. People like Grant Cardone, London Real and these vacuous
1757840	1762880	new mega churches. You see, things like this would never even exist without millions of people
1762880	1767440	orientating their self worth and motivations entirely around money. You see, in contrast to
1767440	1771760	the Renaissance period, they used to care about art and religion. But our new religion is following
1771760	1775600	hedonistic and materialistic pursuits. Now, obviously, there's always need for money,
1775600	1779120	and it's a great way to have freedom in your own life. But it's these sorts of scammers that
1779120	1783840	completely rely on greed to survive. And greed is the name of the game in modern society. And
1783840	1788480	that's why the greediest of all are then promoted even further, going all the way up to the top of
1788480	1792960	the World Economic Forum. And in a lot of cases, people are just making money simply by talking
1792960	1797520	about money and nothing else. Nothing on natural societal value. And it's not just these sorts
1797600	1802960	of people. Our society now praises these celebrities whose only value lies in their image and wealth.
1802960	1807280	The caressions are always mentioned, but there's just so many others, people like Cardi B,
1807280	1811680	the entire cast of Love Island, or any other vacuous hollered out shell of a human being
1811680	1816720	celebrity. And because we praise these false idols, everyone then buys into the societal delusion,
1816720	1820880	helping to perpetuate this broken habitus even more. And that's why lots of well-meaning
1820880	1825120	rational people are swept up to becoming mouthpieces of a failing system. And one of the
1825200	1829520	perfect analogies for our twisted habitus could be seen with the FTX scandal recently.
1829520	1832400	From celebrities to established financial institutions,
1832400	1837600	Saint-Bank-Mont-Fried fooled the world by using his own artificial pumped-up currency that had
1837600	1842320	no attachment to anything real to make billions. Everyone believed in it, and that's where the
1842320	1846320	value of these coins came from. By everyone believing in Saint-Bank-Mont-Fried's lies,
1846320	1850320	he was able to make unthinkable money. But at the top of the pyramid of FTX,
1850320	1854880	this CEO was a lazy gamer playing League of Legends in the Bahamas, with his whole value
1854880	1859040	being tricking everyone into believing his money was worth something. But then when a gust of wind
1859040	1864320	came, this whole facade came tumbling down in just a matter of days. And our society is heading
1864320	1869120	exactly the same way. You see, as the habitus gets twisted even more, it becomes harder and harder
1869120	1873520	for people to reconcile it with the real world. Then when the illusion breaks and people realize
1873520	1879360	everything is built on a lie, it eventually collapses. And Winston and Julie have also been
1879360	1883280	living a lie separate to the great lie of their society. You see, despite knowing they'll eventually
1883360	1887600	be found out, they carry on seeing each other in the room above the shop. A taste of real life
1887600	1891600	is just too tempting. So Winston and Joy is reading subvertive literature to Julia,
1891600	1895280	all while enjoying the contraband food that Julia smuggled from the inner party.
1895280	1899200	Things are going great, they finally escape the clutches of Big Brother, they've had a taste
1899200	1903760	of freedom and love, all until one day, when Julia and Winston are relaxing in their room.
1903760	1907760	As they watch a working class woman washing some clothes and singing a song, they marvel at the
1907760	1912640	beauty of life, all the more stunning because they know their time is limited. Winston says to Julia,
1912640	1917520	we are the dead, and Julia says the same. And then a voice from behind says, you are the dead.
1917520	1921360	They turn around to see a painting fall off the wall, revealing a telescreen with the
1921360	1925520	visage of Big Brother. The voice directs them to stand in the middle of the room,
1925520	1930000	as the thought police break in through the window and the door. Even worse, the antique shop owner
1930000	1934720	walks up the stairs and reveals himself to be an agent of the thought police. Ever since Winston
1934720	1939040	set foot in the shop, he was always under their supervision. The agents take Goldstein's book
1939040	1943680	and smash the piece of coral, one of the last things of beauty left from the old world, and it's
1943680	1948560	one of the last things Winston sees before they take him away to the sinister Ministry of Loth.
1948560	1953040	We are then shown Winston and Cussidy, along with his neighbour Parsons. Parsons not knowing it
1953040	1958000	himself is apparently an agent of Goldstein, and also a thought criminal. However, he reveals
1958000	1961920	that he was taken in because his daughter reported him for things he said in his sleep.
1961920	1966400	Despite Parsons coming across as completely indoctrinated, he's still going to be tortured
1966400	1971280	and broken down anyway. The two remain in custody for some time until an announcement wakes them up,
1971280	1976320	Room 101. Parsons seems to already know what this entails and begs the correctional officers not to
1976320	1980080	take him there. Winston on the other hand doesn't seem to have a clue about what's going to happen,
1980080	1984320	but gives a knowing look that it probably isn't going to be good. Despite all of his pleading,
1984320	1988960	Parsons is then taken to Room 101, and Winston waits alone in his cell for some time,
1988960	1992880	until he is met with O'Brien. O'Brien takes Winston into an interrogation room,
1992880	1996720	where he is tortured with an electric restraining device. Throughout the time,
1996720	2001600	O'Brien educates Winston on the principles of double-think. He reaffirms the notion that Oceana
2001600	2006080	has always been a war with East Asia instead of Eurasia, despite the contrary being previously
2006080	2011520	correct. Along with this, O'Brien then asserts that two plus two can equal three, four, or five,
2011520	2016720	sometimes even all of them at once. And this is the final and most essential ingredient for keeping
2016720	2022560	the party and their stilted habitus alive, rejecting real authentic reality itself. They
2022560	2027760	need people to trust the party over their own eyes and ears. It's how people are willing to accept
2027760	2032240	that the enemy can change at a moment's notice, and it's how the party will have taken power in
2032240	2037200	the first place. It's in times of great chaos and upheaval that regimes and governments fall
2037200	2042000	and new ones take that place. It's just the cycle of history and we've seen it happen over and over
2042000	2046640	again. It's how the world ordered changes, and in our current world right now, the transition
2046640	2051440	is almost here. One of the most famous experts in this field, Ray Dalio, describes the process in
2051440	2056880	a study on historical cycles, beginning with the rise of civilisations. This is when a new state,
2056880	2061200	founded on the dominant ideals of the time, grows in power to take control of their world,
2061200	2065840	like the Roman Empire all the way to America after World War II. Then comes the golden age of
2065840	2070720	prosperity, a long period of time where a civilisation enjoys their position at the top. But
2070720	2075280	this is also where the problems start to arise. People make financial bets on the world order
2075280	2080240	continuing forever, unable to see a future unlike the present. As the leading powers economy grows
2080240	2085440	to dominate the others, their currency becomes the international standard. Internal conflicts also
2085440	2090400	arise as the founding ideology becomes out of date with the world, and eventually a bubble forms,
2090400	2094800	as people bet more and more on continued growth and prosperity, whilst internal divisions and
2094800	2099680	problems only get worse. Those with power try to consolidate their grip on it, alienating more
2099680	2103920	of the people whilst holding all of the wealth. And this then only fuels extremist sentiment and
2103920	2108000	revolution even more. However, sometimes this can be peacefully dealt with, although eventually
2108000	2112560	these problems get so large and the power structure becomes so stagnant that a revolution
2112560	2117200	and changing of the guard becomes inevitable. Then another rising power eventually eclipses the
2117200	2121840	stagnating one. Most of the time there's a war or sets of wars until the dust settles and a new
2121840	2126560	world power comes to the forefront. And time and time again this cycle has just repeated itself.
2126560	2130640	In recent history it was the Dutch who were dominant, followed by the British, then the US,
2130640	2134880	and now China is rising to challenge the US. And that's where we are today, on the cusp of
2134880	2139200	this transitional period. And because of this, our current societal habitats just won't be able
2139200	2143200	to cope with the changing world. As the cracks start to show in the habitats, and the society
2143200	2147680	becomes more and more deranged, we'll then see a massive shift back towards additionalism. Because
2147680	2152000	as birth reads full, young people fail to find love or happiness. The standard of living starts
2152000	2156320	to drop, and the ideals that the constitution starts to get ripped apart, right-wing sentiments
2156320	2160560	will rise again. Meanwhile, the elites at the top are going to keep tightening their grip on power,
2160560	2164960	bringing us closer and closer to a 1984 future. I mean for starters we've already talked about
2164960	2168800	the great recess, but this is only the tip of the iceberg here. Because right now it's becoming
2168800	2173360	very clear that corporate elites will keep pushing their elites as fake leftism on the masses,
2173360	2177600	or to maintain control of the world order. I mean we're already seeing this in the west,
2177600	2181600	with huge companies like PayPal's recent announcements on handing out fines for quotes
2181600	2186480	misinformation. Or like MasterCard's carbon fees, where their new credit card cuts people off for
2186480	2191040	exceeding carbon emission levels. All while oil companies make record profits, but can't find
2191040	2195440	the money to fix their pipelines and stop massive oil leaks. However the most disturbing part of
2195440	2200960	this is the new idea of CBDCs, one of the most odious forms of corporate control. And so if
2200960	2205280	corporations and financial institutions manage to purse the idea into the mainstream, it will
2205280	2209920	eventually give the banks and governments greater control over people's lives. It's digital currency,
2209920	2214160	but controlled centrally through the banks, Bank of England. So instead of having a bank account
2214160	2219360	with whatever HSBC or Bank of America, you'll have a bank account directly within the American
2219360	2224080	context with the Fed, in the UK directly with the Bank of England. You have a personal bank account
2224080	2227920	and you're given digital money in that bank account. These are called central banking digital
2227920	2232720	currencies. Because a centralized bank digital currency means that the government then has full
2232720	2237440	control of the money and so that everything you spend it on is tracked by the government. And with
2237440	2241920	one push of a button, they will be able to cut off your funds entirely, all for saying the wrong
2241920	2246400	thing. And this will then paralyze you, leaving you at the government's mercy. And this has also
2246400	2250880	response to the rise of crypto. And yes, crypto may be a paradise for scam artists. The crypto world
2250880	2254880	does also offer currency out of the government's control, which is a massive threat for the growing
2254880	2258640	control in Western society and is something that can't be accepted by the elite in this
2258640	2263040	transitional period. Now obviously in 1984, the party and big brother are far more advanced in
2263040	2266800	their efforts to control the people. But then again, all the ingredients for their kind of tyranny
2266800	2270800	in our own world are already present. They won't need to torture and indoctrinate people in the
2270800	2275520	way the party does. It's much more subtle than this. It's just a small shift in the habitus.
2275520	2280000	But eventually the end result is the same, complete acceptance of big brother's control.
2280000	2284640	And that's why during his torture, Winston begins to disassociate and hallucinates being in a grass
2284640	2289200	field, along with O'Brien. O'Brien states that Winston is one of them. And under significant
2289200	2294080	illusion, Winston says that he loves O'Brien, who suddenly turns into Julia. He still isn't
2294080	2299040	broken down yet. His love for Julia is still there. But just as this happens, the image of Julia is
2299040	2303440	shot, and Winston awakens back in his cell, where he is delusionally talking to himself.
2303440	2307200	Winston then snaps back to reality after being met with O'Brien once more.
2307200	2311840	O'Brien then asks Winston what he thinks of big brother, and Winston responds that he hates him.
2311840	2315840	This comes to the distaste of O'Brien, who states that it's not enough to obey big brother,
2315840	2321920	but in fact you must love him. So O'Brien escorts Winston to room 101. Room 101 is a torture chamber,
2321920	2326080	where the worst things in the world awaits his prisoners. A specialized room that houses the
2326080	2330880	victim's worst phobias. Winston is then strapped to a chair, and starts experiencing the horrors
2330880	2335040	of room 101. Now throughout the movie, we've seen that Winston is deathly afraid of rats.
2335040	2338960	He's dreamt about them, and he associates them with his tragic past. And O'Brien knows about
2338960	2344080	this, and he's going to exploit it to finally eradicate Winston's desire to resist. And so in
2344080	2349520	room 101, we see a compartmental cage filled with rats, with a set of two doors that is attached
2349520	2354000	to Winston's face. O'Brien then threatens him, and opens the first door, letting the rats out
2354000	2357920	within inches of Winston's face. And after what could have been months or years of this torture,
2357920	2362480	this is the last draw. And it's here that Winston loses his final bit of humanity,
2362480	2367200	as he pleads with O'Brien to do it to Julia, to finally put the woman that he loves the most
2367200	2372080	through the same unbearable punishment. It's the final betrayal, and what seals Winston's fate as
2372080	2378000	a broken puppet of the party. O'Brien is finally satisfied. Winston has been completely broken.
2378000	2382240	Sometime later, Winston is released, and we then transition to the Chestnut Tree Cafe,
2382240	2386480	where Winston awaits at a chessboard. Julia arrives, but they're both apathetic. They've
2386480	2390320	been changed forever, and after their betrayals, they don't really love each other anymore.
2390320	2394160	They only love Big Brother. And just as Winston makes a comment on thought crime,
2394160	2396560	Julia then excuses herself with a half hearted,
2396560	2397760	You must meet again.
2397760	2402400	to which Winston apathetically agrees to. We are then shown Winston on public television,
2402400	2406560	embellishing his supposed crimes, along with admitting to crimes he didn't commit,
2406560	2410880	such as poisoning the water supply, and guiding rocket bombs onto airstrip 1 through coded radio
2410880	2414880	signals. Eventually, Winston charges himself as guilty on all counts,
2414880	2417760	labelling himself a victim of Goldstein's influence.
2417760	2422720	We are then shown him alone at the cafe, fiddling with the chessboard. Using the dust on the table,
2422720	2427520	Winston then writes 2 plus 2 equals 4 on the countertop, and grabs a night piece just as
2427520	2431360	another announcement is made on the television. And that's when we are then shown a final shot
2431360	2436960	of Winston gazing longingly into a picture of Big Brother. He then turns away with tears in his eyes,
2436960	2439840	and says, I love you, as the credits roar.
2439840	2443760	But then this brings up the question, how can we avoid a situation like this,
2443760	2447760	where people are nothing more than just mindless individuals becoming statistics on a government
2447760	2452560	database? How can we avoid being just another loveless depressed, nihilistic cog in an uncaring
2452560	2456320	machine? Well, I'd love to tell you that the answer is simple. I'd love to say that the solution
2456320	2460480	is just waking up at 4am, having a cold shower and going to the gym. I'd love to say it's
2460480	2464640	hiding away in the middle of the forest. I'd love to say it's money, or a Tony Robbins lecture.
2464640	2469520	I'd love to say it's as easy as buying a $3,000 dropshipping course and escaping the matrix,
2469520	2474080	driving a Lambo in the palm. But let's be real here, this doesn't actually do anything. By
2474080	2478560	themselves, these are all great things to make you have an easier life. Self-improvement is vital,
2478560	2483040	and it's incredibly lacking in modern society, but it doesn't really change the world that you live
2483040	2487600	in. It only changes yourself, but it doesn't change the system that put you where you are today.
2487600	2491920	It doesn't change your values, the values of your associates, friends and family. It doesn't
2491920	2496640	change the why behind all of this self-improvement stuff. Why should you improve your life? Why
2496640	2501200	should you seek freedom? Why should you even care about Big Brother? If life is just so cruel,
2501200	2505840	hopeless, depressing and empty, then why bother chasing rewards from that system when the system
2505840	2510800	itself is so demented? Well, trust me when I say that the solution to all of this is just so much
2510800	2516240	deeper than you've ever been told. And to understand why, we need to go back 3,000 years in time to one
2516240	2521040	of the earliest philosophical texts in human history, a text that has transcended time, culture and
2521040	2525360	religion, a text known as the Book of Job. Now, for those who don't know, the book is a thought
2525360	2529280	provoking and complex piece on God, giving direction on the meaning of life in the face of
2529280	2533840	overwhelming nihilism. You see, the story centers around a wealthy and righteous man named Job,
2533840	2537760	who is living a comfortable and prosperous life. However, in short, Satan challenges
2537760	2541600	God's assertion that Job was righteous, suggesting that he is only faithful because
2541600	2545680	of his good fortune. So God agrees to allow Satan to test Job's faith by taking away his
2545680	2550880	possessions, his family and his health. This causes immense suffering for Job, but Job refuses
2550880	2555120	to curse God or renounce his faith. However, he does struggle to understand why he is suffering,
2555120	2559120	and he moans about the injustice of his situation. As almost all of us would,
2559120	2563120	he questions why God would allow such terrible things to happen to a righteous person like
2563120	2568160	himself. He's forced to go through various trials and tribulations. Job is tested to his core,
2568160	2572240	which forces him to grow through a journey of his self. Job's friends who come to comfort him
2572240	2576000	offer him traditional explanations for his suffering. They suggest that he must have sinned
2576000	2580160	and that his suffering is just a punishment from God, that he's a bad guy who deserves it.
2580160	2584960	But Job rejects all these simple explanations, insisting that he is not sinned and demands an
2584960	2588880	audience with God to plead his case. Eventually, this whole book culminates in God's response to
2588880	2593520	Job's demands. God speaks to Job from a whirlwind and challenges him to consider the vastness and
2593520	2598400	complexity of the natural world, asking Job if he can even comprehend the mysteries of the universe,
2598400	2603120	and Job humbly acknowledges his own limitations. As God tells him that he made all these terrible
2603120	2607920	elements of society and nature, he made the universe, and all of the badness in the universe
2607920	2612480	is God's creation. And so God's response to Job is how dare you question any of these things?
2612480	2616880	As these challenges put on Job are just tests of his ethical ability, they're essential for
2616880	2622080	Job to evolve and grow as a person, just like it is for us. You see, I'm not even religious here,
2622080	2626720	but the terrible parts of nature and society that God has supposedly created are only noticed with
2626720	2631760	consciousness. Like Job being aware of losing his family fortunes in the future he could have had,
2631760	2635600	and then the results in suffering from it that has come from his consciousness. And then you see
2635600	2640080	when we are unconscious like animals, we are always in the present unaware of true reality.
2640080	2644640	But as consciousness emerged in humans, we became more and more aware of the dark realities around
2644640	2648560	us. Reality is like the horrors of death and human suffering, and it's with these dark,
2648560	2653280	soul-crushing realities that we have an impulse to return to unconsciousness, and we do this through
2653280	2657840	instant gratification in empty pursuits, like never maturing, choosing to be ignorant, drugs,
2657840	2661840	alcohol, and terminally living online. These are just some of the things that we use to cope with
2661840	2666240	the real world and the pain that comes with it. But Cole Young suggested that what the book of Job
2666240	2671120	tells us about our own life is that to escape the horrors of man, Job and you watching this needed
2671120	2675600	to become more conscious, as consciousness was actually the true solution to all of this. As by
2675600	2680080	being more and more conscious of reality, it allows you to elevate above it, because all the burdens
2680080	2684960	and pain of life are just a necessary process to make you a whole person. To be a good person,
2684960	2689920	to build a great civilization, you have to face these trials and tribulations. You need to be
2689920	2694480	more aware, more thoughtful of all the evil in the world, to be a better person, to be strong in
2694480	2698640	the face of evil. You need to be strong in the face of all the devastating facts of life, of the
2698640	2703040	derangement of the elites, and the degeneracy of the society around you. You should never avoid all
2703040	2706960	the terrible thoughts and events confronting you. You should never ignore all the pain, suffering,
2706960	2710720	and nihilism being thrown at you by our corrupt society. As Young famously said,
2710720	2714560	that which you most need will be found where you least want to look. And that's why instead of
2714560	2718800	following your bliss that modern culture tells you to, you need to instead follow your blisters,
2718800	2723600	for a true awakening. And so with all of this in mind, Job then finally understood that God was
2723600	2728400	there to build order from chaos, because here's the embodiment of evolution and growth. While on
2728400	2732880	the surface you may just view this as some basic religious story, the actual meaning to the story
2732880	2738960	is deeply profound, and provides a perfect solution to the problem of 1984 and our own modern world.
2738960	2742880	You see the whole point of this, the whole point of why this text has transcended thousands of
2742880	2747200	years of history. The reason it's been studied by millions of scholars is for a reason. The writers
2747280	2752080	use the story as an allegory of the spirit of individual growth, and thus the whole of human
2752080	2757200	civilization. God in this instance is the analogy for the spirit of meaning growth and human potential,
2757200	2761120	the spirit that generates human culture. And that's why throughout all religions of mankind,
2761120	2765040	God has been above the culture, as he is the spirit of it. And there's a reason this is so
2765040	2768720	important to understand. I'm not trying to convert you to any religion here, this is just a very
2768720	2772640	necessary foundation to understand the solution to all of this subversion and control of the big
2772640	2777040	brother. You see this whole story is one of faith in the face of adversity, of trusting in your
2777040	2781600	mind and intuition. And that's why God, the spirit of growth and potential, is revealed to us through
2781600	2786000	the actions we undertake in our life. This is why prayer is a key element of all religions.
2786000	2789040	And I'm not talking about the kind of prayer where you ask for something and God automatically
2789040	2793360	gives you it. Prayer is not a vending machine. The idea of true prayer is saying the problem and
2793360	2797920	then changing who you are, so that God treats you differently and the problem fades away. You're not
2797920	2802320	supposed to be the same person before you pray. The prayer is meant to instead act on your mind,
2802320	2806320	by trusting your intuition and mind to be the better person. And then through your actions,
2806320	2810800	growth and rewards come to you, which is ultimately the solution to big brother in our modern world,
2810800	2815040	by trusting your intuition and guts and by being an individual. You know before in the US,
2815040	2819680	the dignity of the individual was paramount. But now if you notice, this concept is being portrayed.
2819680	2823920	As Oscar Wilde said, most people now are just other people, their lives are mimicry, their
2823920	2828400	passions are quotation, which is why you must trust yourself. You must reject big brother. All
2828400	2833120	the supported authority figures you're meant to believe are liars. They're the worst among us,
2833120	2837200	and they will lead you to your own destruction. The world you live is not some democratic liberal
2837200	2841040	utopia where everyone has a piece of the action, where culture and policies determined by all of
2841040	2846160	us. That is total BS. The priestly cast at the top, big brother, wants to control you. They're not
2846160	2850320	there to save your soul or fire the spirit up inside of your mind, which is why the more you
2850320	2854320	follow the narratives and their lifestyle, the more you start to poison yourself. You see,
2854320	2858480	the reason you're lazy, the reason you have all these bad habits, the reason you never achieve
2858480	2862960	the life that you want or chase the goals and passion that you believe in, is because you've
2862960	2868000	been repressed. The meaning and soul of your life has been stripped away from you, making you a cog
2868000	2872240	in an uncaring machine. Your life is someone else's, where your best years, your character,
2872240	2877040	creativity and hopes are being stolen from you. And that's why you must insist on your dignity.
2877040	2881600	You need to free your mind. You must reject all the noise around you and embrace the chaos,
2881600	2886720	the pain and the sorrow to grow. And if you don't, you become another pawn of big brother. You're
2886720	2891840	the person who didn't even fight back. You never did anything to go against the system poisoning
2891840	2895920	your life, too passive to actually care what's happening to you and the people around you.
2895920	2899360	Is this the life you want to live? Well, for many of us, we're starting to see the rejection of all
2899360	2903040	of this, because as we enter the age of Western civilization collapsing, with the government
2903040	2906800	trying to control us more and people becoming more atomized, depressed and lonelier than ever,
2906800	2910960	we're now starting to see antibodies being produced to overcome the societal disease.
2910960	2914720	We're seeing more and more people rejecting the values of our twisted habitus, of all the
2914720	2919600	bullshit fed to you by big brother. The pendulum towards individualism is swinging back. And that's
2919600	2924080	why when I see this rise in self-improvement, this rise in individualism, when I see all these big
2924080	2928000	political changes happening in the world, it just shows to me that the new world order is on the
2928000	2933360	horizon. The spirit of growth is nearing. A spirit of dignity, empowerment and hope for young men.
2933360	2937840	The hope that our culture has killed and used against us. And so after millions of successfully
2937840	2942240	lived lives throughout all periods of history, the challenge to grow now passes on to you.
2942240	2946400	You will determine the future of the next generation. Your mind determines the direction of
2946400	2950320	everything. So don't just give it up for some sick cultural narratives. Giving your genius to
2950320	2955120	the worst among us. You should act without regret. Follow the path in front of you and take back
2955120	2961040	control of your mind. I want to tell you about something I've been working on this past month.
2961040	2964960	You see, I've built something that I legitimately think will change your life. Because you see,
2964960	2969440	from most of your life, you've always been fed a constant stream of lies. Lies that have poisoned
2969440	2973680	your value systems, purpose and passion in life, whilst also poisoning the community around you.
2973680	2978400	And it's why you feel so lazy, so meaningless, so lonely. And so it's time that we've come up with
2978400	2982960	real solutions. Not just modern day BS solutions. I'm talking about a new form of community. A
2982960	2987040	way for us to take back control of our lives. Where I will go deep into the real solutions,
2987040	2991200	answers and value systems of thousands of philosophers, consents into an easy to understand
2991200	2995920	package. All to help you improve your life. All at no cost to you. I will send you a weekly essay
2995920	2999440	on the solutions to the problems we discuss on this channel. So just click on the link in the
2999440	3003680	description and I will email the name down below.
