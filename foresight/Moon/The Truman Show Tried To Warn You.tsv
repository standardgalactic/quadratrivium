0	2000	The Truman Show is one of my favourite movies.
2000	4480	It's incredibly rare for a film to be as funny, cohesive,
4480	7040	beautifully paced and rich in detail as The Truman Show.
7040	9760	However, it's even rarer for a movie to go beyond this
9760	12640	and give accurate, prophetic insights about the world.
12640	15440	20 years later, and The Truman Show's allegorical message
15440	16800	is more relevant than ever.
16800	18800	But the only way we can truly understand its meaning
18800	20240	is by diving into the story.
20240	22400	The film begins with a monologue from Kristoff,
22400	24320	who sets up the main premise of the movie.
24320	26960	Truman is the unwitting star of a reality TV show
26960	28160	centred around his life.
28160	30960	Truman, a child abandoned at birth, has been brought up
30960	32720	to believe that he is a normal guy living
32720	34720	in the idyllic town of Seahaven Island.
34720	36880	However, Truman's entire world is a lie.
36880	38640	All the people he knows, including his mother,
38640	41600	his best friend and his wife, are all paid actors.
41600	44320	Seahaven Island is also fake, and is in reality
44320	46560	just a huge setting close by a massive dome.
46560	48800	This gives Kristoff, the director of The Truman Show,
48800	51040	almost complete control over Truman's world.
51040	53120	This ranges from the ability to control the weather
53120	55680	to the day-night cycle and even the stars in the sky.
55680	58080	Truman's every moment is broadcast around the world.
58160	61120	With extra funding from the show coming from product placement.
61120	63520	From the start of the film, we see a camera implanted
63520	65760	in Truman's bathroom mirror, where Truman is pretending
65760	67760	to be an explorer whilst getting ready for work.
67760	70080	It's as though this is just another regular day for Truman,
70080	71520	with him saying hello to his neighbors,
71520	73360	making a coffee and getting into his car.
73360	75040	But just as he's getting into his car,
75040	76720	a stage slide drops from the sky,
76720	78960	right onto the road outside of his house.
78960	80640	Truman then walks over to inspect the light
80640	82560	and sees that it says Sirius on it,
82560	84480	referring to the brightest star in the night sky.
84480	86080	But eerily, on his drive to work,
86080	88640	the radio starts to run a story about a plane wreckage
88640	91280	falling from the sky in order to explain the light.
91280	92880	Here's a news flash just then,
92880	95600	an aircraft in trouble began shitting parts
95600	97760	as it flew over to see him in just a few moments ago.
97760	99840	It then starts to talk about the dangers of flying,
99840	101680	which is one of the first of many subtle ways
101680	103360	that Krystal tries to influence Truman
103360	105120	into staying on the island through fear.
105120	107520	He is being subconsciously controlled by the radio.
107520	110400	This subconscious manipulation then continues throughout the film.
110400	112000	Like when Truman is asked by his boss
112000	114160	to deal with something that will require a boat trip.
114240	116960	By doing this, the boss is setting up Truman's aquaphobia
116960	119280	as we see he is unable to even get in the boat,
119280	120800	a phobia that's later revealed
120800	123200	to be another subconscious manipulation of Truman.
123200	124960	This whole day feels very strange for Truman,
124960	126960	so he hurriedly comes back to his wife, Meryl,
126960	129200	who then conspicuously shows off her new kitchen tool
129200	130480	that she bought at the store,
130480	132960	showing it off almost like she's advertising it.
132960	135520	It's a dicer, greater, peeler, all in one.
135520	137600	Never need sharpening, dishwasher safe.
137600	138960	Truman becomes suspicious
138960	140560	and when out with his best friend, Marlon,
140560	142160	Truman's behavior starts to be off
142160	144880	and he brings up his desire to leave and go to Fiji.
144880	147120	Marlon catches that Truman is starting to wake up,
147120	148720	so he quickly shoots down the idea.
148720	150160	He doesn't want Truman escaping.
150160	151520	That would break the whole game.
151520	152960	In the next scene, we see Truman go off
152960	154240	to spend some time on the beach,
154240	156080	where he remembers the tragic boat accident
156080	158880	that seemingly killed his father and gave him his aquaphobia.
158880	160960	Kristoff then even hides in Truman's misery
160960	163680	by adding a specific path of rain to follow Truman.
163680	165440	And with Truman's breakdown growing,
165440	167760	we see the audience's engrossed reactions.
167760	169600	It's all these early scenes that serve to illustrate
169600	171760	that the fictional Truman show can only function
171760	174000	when Truman buys into this false reality.
174000	176000	The Truman show therefore has to make sure
176000	177920	that Truman can't escape his cage,
177920	179600	or even see that he's in a cage
179600	182640	if he knows that he's in a cage the whole game collapses.
182640	184560	The ways that Kristoff keeps Truman deluded
184560	186560	are the most striking aspects of the allegory.
186560	188400	The most obvious and egregious of these
188400	190240	is how Truman is kept complacent
190240	192240	by exploiting his deepest fears.
192240	193920	For example, Truman's aquaphobia
193920	196160	works perfectly to keep Truman on the island.
196160	198560	Kristoff even risks Truman overcoming this fear
198560	201120	when he sends Truman to unsuccessfully board the boat.
201120	203120	The fact that Truman can't overcome his phobia
203120	204640	only reinforces this.
204640	207200	Truman is also constantly barraged by propaganda
207200	209680	and subliminal messages to induce a fear of flying.
209680	212000	There are constant reminders of the dangers of flying.
212000	213760	It takes this rampant fear mongering
213760	215360	to keep Truman's delusion alive.
215360	217680	However, this time the propaganda sluts to weaken.
217680	220720	Truman still fantasizes about taking a flight to Fiji.
220720	222080	His aquaphobia is still strong,
222080	223680	but it's revealed that this is most likely
223680	225600	because it originates from the undressed guilt
225600	226960	over Truman's father's death.
226960	228880	But it's not just the fear that influences Truman.
228880	230720	The control that Kristoff has over his world
230800	231440	is total.
231440	233600	Everything Truman takes in on a daily basis
233600	235360	is designed with a secret purpose.
235360	237680	The TV he watches reinforces the message.
237680	239040	The media always has headlines
239040	241520	directly promoting whatever they want Truman to believe.
241520	243040	Even the people that Truman talks to
243040	245520	on a daily basis spout the same canned lines
245520	247120	and positive affirmations.
247120	249280	Propaganda is seeping into every aspect
249280	250880	of Truman's life and society.
250880	252160	You think I'm flying somewhere?
252160	253520	Nope. Oh, good.
253520	255840	A lot like its infiltration of our society.
255840	257840	Just like Truman, we're always bombarded
257840	260000	with propaganda just to keep us complacently
260000	262560	unaware of the delusions of modern ideology.
262560	264480	Every day society tells us who we are,
264480	266480	what we ought to do, and who our enemies are.
266480	268400	Just like Truman, we're encouraged to ignore
268400	269840	the clues that we're living in a lie,
269840	272320	where we're made to still become wages in the matrix.
272320	274800	And then everyone who buys into the societal delusion
274800	276160	helps perpetuate it.
276160	278560	This means that lots of well-meaning rational people
278560	281520	are swept up to become mouthpieces of a failing system.
281520	284000	The cracks are present in both reality and fiction.
284000	286400	They just exist solely on the personal level for Truman
286400	288800	rather than the societal level that we're starting to see.
288800	290400	But what is the society-wide delusion?
290400	292560	Well, in the Truman Show, it's obvious and literal.
292560	293760	It's the premise of the movie.
293760	295440	The Truman Show is a reality show.
295440	297520	But how does this translate into our real world?
297520	298960	Well, this is where it gets interesting.
298960	301200	The Habitus is a tool used by sociologists
301200	304240	for describing the ways in which a society's culture functions.
304240	306320	Society rests upon an enormous amount
306320	308400	of unsaid rules and expectations.
308400	310240	These are often performed without thinking about them.
310240	312640	It's more like a learned skill than a conscious decision.
312640	314000	What would do the French intellectual
314000	315360	who brought the term to prominence
315360	316720	often compared it to sports?
316720	318400	People tend to know the rules of the game.
318400	319920	For example, it's generally accepted
319920	321600	that when you're finished at the supermarket,
321600	322960	you return your shopping cart.
322960	325360	There's no personal reward or egotistic incentive.
325360	327360	It's just a learned polite expectation.
327360	330320	In the context of the supermarket, though, it's very important.
330320	332320	The whole system would collapse without it.
332320	334800	Some abstracts of the Habitus are nearly invisible
334800	336720	because they seem so natural to us.
336720	339840	Even your taste in musical food are influenced by the Habitus.
339840	341760	This is because the cultural expectations
341760	344000	that the Habitus instills go so deep.
344000	345840	They're established from the moment you're born,
345840	347920	reinforced throughout your childhood by your family
347920	350720	and then further built upon by your education and work.
350720	353760	This then makes the Habitus a self-perpetuating structure.
353760	355520	Those brought up in certain Habitus
355520	357600	will nurture its specific values in their children,
357600	360240	for example, making sure the cycle continues.
360240	361920	The Truman Show gives a literal picture
361920	363440	of what a Habitus can look like.
363440	365600	We can see all the actors in the fictional Truman Show
365600	366880	is being sucked into this.
366880	368800	The actors act in certain learned ways
368800	371440	in order to perpetuate the essence of the Truman Show.
371440	373920	Now, the key difference between fiction and reality
373920	374960	is the incentive.
374960	377040	Literally, the actors in the fictional Truman Show
377040	378560	are being paid to play their parts.
378560	381360	But in the real world, people play their parts in the Habitus
381360	384400	because the Habitus itself has conditioned them into it.
384400	386000	Everyone is one of the actors.
386000	387520	Everyone makes the Delusion real.
387520	389200	And what the Truman Show goes on to tell us
389200	391120	is that when the Habitus has been altered
391120	393840	into something too detached from an authentic society,
393840	396480	cracks start to show when lies start to perpetuate,
396480	399120	when the ego gets in the way, when power corrupts,
399120	400640	the Habitus starts to break
400640	403280	and this ripples throughout entire civilizations.
403280	404720	See, throughout the movie's progression,
404720	407200	we see Truman gradually wake up to the Delusion
407200	408720	that has consumed his life,
408720	411760	which inevitably causes a breakdown of the entire Habitus.
411760	413600	The further Truman moves towards truth,
413600	415520	the faster the Delusion collapses
415520	417520	and thus the more resistance he faces.
417520	420000	The Habitus of our world is just as deluded
420000	421360	as the one in the Truman Show.
421360	423200	This is because what's valuable culturally
423200	426480	has been drastically changed by reality TV and social media.
426480	428000	The Truman Show almost predicted this
428000	429920	with its commentary on reality TV.
429920	433040	The vapid values of reality TV expanded to shape
433040	434320	the entire Habitus.
434320	435920	Now, limited to reality TV,
435920	437440	and this doesn't seem too harmful,
437440	438480	but it gets so much worse
438480	440320	when you consider this in our own reality,
440320	443440	especially with the effects of social media on our values.
443440	446480	Nowadays, everyone's the star of their own reality TV show.
446480	448880	People project vapid and unattainable standards
448880	451040	by advertising a fake life on social media.
451040	453440	That 14-year-old girls who use social media
453440	455200	more than five hours a day
455200	458400	saw a 50% spike in depression symptoms.
458400	460000	This feeds into people's values.
460000	461600	They see other people's fake lives
461600	463360	and hold their own up to the same standard.
463360	465280	These people then perpetuate the cycle,
465280	466720	which then brings the Habitus
466720	469280	further and further away from authenticity and truth.
469280	471840	Corporatization of societies then also reflected
471840	473520	in the Habitus of both the Truman Show
473520	474800	and in our own society.
474800	476640	In the Truman Show, the effects are obvious.
476640	479360	Truman's wife is constantly advertising and shitting brands.
479360	480880	It's almost a learned response
480880	482640	that has been ingrained into her.
482640	484400	You really ought to throw out that mower.
485120	487040	Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.
487040	488160	Which is why at this point,
488160	490000	Truman is actively interrogating her
490000	491280	on the lie that they've been living.
491280	492720	In response, Truman's wife defaults
492800	495120	to an almost robotic speech about a coffee brand.
495120	496320	This is the Habitus failing.
496320	498080	Truman's wife is so deeply submerged
498080	499280	in the Truman Show delusion
499280	500720	that she has no other response.
500720	502400	She just keeps reading the same script,
502400	504320	but it's so much worse in our own society
504320	506640	where our Habitus is so heavily corporatized,
506640	509200	with corporate values being held in such a high regard
509200	512160	that we value our careers more than our families.
512160	514000	Never before in history has this happened.
514000	516400	Truman's suspicions of reality are then brought up again
516400	518640	when his father, who he assumes is dead,
518640	521120	shows up on his way to work dressed as a beggar.
521120	521680	Dead?
521680	524080	Truman's father is then quickly whisked away on a bus,
524080	525920	but not before Truman sees his face.
525920	527360	He realizes something is up,
527360	528560	so he goes to talk to his mother
528560	530720	who tries to explain away his father's reappearance
530720	533280	by suggesting that he's just crazy and hallucinated it.
533280	534880	This time, it doesn't convince Truman,
534880	537920	who also notices how often his wife name drops brands.
537920	539680	As Truman starts to go through his old things,
539680	541840	the movie flashes back to Truman's collages
541840	544160	and a chance encounter he had with a woman named Lauren.
544160	546000	Lauren's meant to be a background character,
546000	547680	but the two sides meet across the room.
547680	550240	They share a conversation in a romantic moment on the beach.
550320	551920	Lauren then goes out of character
551920	554800	to try to reveal to Truman that his whole reality is fake.
562160	564080	Lauren, who reveals her real name as Sylvia,
564080	566080	tries to explain that Truman's world is a lie,
566080	569520	but then again, she stops short by a man saying he is her father
569520	571280	and that she's just talking nonsense.
571280	573120	As Truman starts to think back to this,
573120	575280	it's revealed that he still longs to see Sylvia,
575280	578080	with him even recreating her face from fashion magazines,
578080	581040	because Sylvia is the only thing that's real in this fake world.
581040	583520	It's then later revealed that Truman is obsessed with Fiji
583520	585520	as Sylvia is reported to be moving there.
585520	588000	Truman then starts to see more and more suspicious things.
588000	590640	His radio specifically describes his every move
590640	591920	in an apparent malfunction.
596240	598480	Truman's also seeing every part of the background set,
598480	600320	but he's always escorted away from it.
600320	603120	This sequence of events brings his suspicions to a breaking point,
603120	605680	as Truman concludes that it seems that his entire world
605680	607920	revolves around him in some weird way.
607920	609200	Fearing that he's going crazy,
609200	611600	he brings up these questions to Marlon, his best friend,
611600	613360	who then just tries to brush it all off.
613360	615200	And in response to his increased suspicion,
615200	617200	Truman's then further barraged by suggestions
617200	619680	that everything is just fine, that he's just being weird.
619680	622160	His mother then shows fake pictures of him at Mount Rushmore,
622160	625920	and even the TV runs a program about the benefits of a small town life.
625920	628080	But by now, things don't work like they used to.
628080	630480	He's seen the society that he lives in starts to crack.
630480	632400	It's also laughable and ridiculous.
632400	633920	This whole thing is a facade.
633920	636000	And now that Truman is waking up to this reality,
636080	638800	the lullabies of deception can't draw him back to sleep.
638800	642000	After noticing that his wife is crossing her fingers in his wedding pictures,
642000	643280	Truman follows her to work.
643280	646240	Despite multiple attempts by extras to delay and stop Truman
646240	648320	from seeing the surgery that his wife is helping with,
648320	650960	Truman breaks into the hospital and sees the fake surgery
650960	653760	being played out by actors who have no idea what they're doing.
653760	656480	Determined to leave, Truman then visits a travel agency.
656480	658000	By this point, Truman's had enough.
658000	659120	He's determined to leave.
659120	660880	He wants to escape this sick society.
660880	662640	So he tries to book a flight to Fiji,
662640	664960	but the clerk says they're all sold out for at least a month.
664960	666560	So then Truman tries to get a bus out,
666560	668720	but it conveniently breaks down just before leaving.
668720	670640	Truman then sitting in a car at home,
670640	672480	waits for his wife to come back from work.
672480	674560	When she does, she gets in the car with him
674560	676560	as he points out the clockwork regularity
676560	678400	of the people who go past their road.
678400	680800	Unsatisfied with her unrealistic reaction to this,
680800	684000	Truman then locks the car and takes Meryl on an impromptu road trip.
684000	686160	To everyone around him, he seems like he's having a breakdown.
686160	688240	He's breaking the rotten habit of surrounding him.
688240	691760	But then instantly traffic jam starts stopping Truman in his tracks.
691760	693200	Truman then pretends to go back home,
693200	694720	which disperses the traffic completely.
694720	696000	But then turns right around
696000	698320	and makes his way out of the suburbs and onto the road.
698320	699280	Once they reach the bridge,
699280	700960	which stands between Truman and the mainland,
700960	704000	it seems that his conditioned aquaphobia will stop his escape plan.
704000	707200	All the conditioning and propaganda is the only barrier to his freedom.
707200	709120	However, Truman overcomes his fears
709120	711440	by closing his eyes and forcing Meryl to steer the car
711440	713040	while he holds down the accelerator.
713040	714240	Once they're over the bridge,
714240	716000	other obstacles are set up by Christoff
716000	717440	to try and stop Truman from leaving.
717440	719280	Truman even drives through wildfire,
719280	721840	but is stopped by a roadblock due to a convenient leak
721840	723280	at the nearby power plant.
723280	725600	In desperation, Truman tries to get through on foot,
725600	728080	but is tackled and subdued by men in hazmat suits,
728080	729200	who take him back home.
729200	731200	The implausibility of all these events
731200	733440	cement Truman's skepticism of the world around him,
733440	734640	which brings up the question,
734640	737280	how many so-called emergency events in our own world
737280	738880	could be equally implausible?
739520	741200	All the lies told by our media,
741200	743200	all the false narratives pushed onto us,
743200	745840	all the divisions sowed by algorithms in the news,
745840	748400	all these layers of fallacy that have been embedded
748400	750400	into every aspect of society.
750400	752640	We all have the means to stop this nonsensical
752640	754400	fictional reality that we abide by,
754400	756320	and yet we choose not to confront it.
756320	757360	When anyone does,
757360	759280	they are breaking the habit of surrounding them,
759280	760960	which threatens the whole house of cars
760960	762320	the society is built on,
762320	764400	which is why true authentic reality
764400	766320	is always outrunning our apprehension.
766320	768000	So then how can we ever know the truth
768000	769120	when the lens we look through
769120	771200	is tainted by a corrupted habitus,
771200	773200	tainted by all the models and distractions
773200	774640	that we don't even acknowledge?
774640	776480	If we can't comprehend true reality,
776480	778480	we no longer know what truth is.
778480	781040	We don't have a grasp on what our values really are,
781040	783040	and it's this flattening of our values,
783040	784640	of our society, of our culture
784640	786640	that dampens our outrage and emotion.
786640	789360	Everything becomes muted by a post-modern reality.
789360	790240	In the Truman Show,
790240	791680	Truman's deserved outrage
791680	793280	at the cage he has been trapped in
793280	794480	is never tapped into.
794480	795520	He's never angry,
795520	797600	instead he's always left in a state of confusion
797600	798400	and distraction.
798400	800960	He's meant to feel crazy by searching for the truth.
800960	802960	This is because for the show to be successful,
802960	804800	it relies on Truman and his belief
804800	806080	in the society around him.
806080	807280	If he starts questioning this,
807280	808960	since society goes down with him,
808960	811040	so society has to prevent him from questioning
811040	812480	the habitus he is surrounded by.
812480	813840	And aren't we any different?
813840	816320	Is this why we live in a culture without soul or value?
816320	817600	Where everything we think and do
817600	819200	is shrink down by reductionism.
819200	821520	Where the phenomena of nature, personality,
821520	822640	the essence of life,
822640	825360	is just reduced to statistics and banal labels.
825360	827280	Our world is filled with mystery and wonder.
827280	828400	It's filled with adventure,
828400	829760	but our world is being reduced
829760	832320	to nothing more than a banal monotonous cage,
832320	835520	numbing us into this bored, flaccid, apathetic state,
835520	837520	which is what the Truman Show tries to show us.
837600	840240	Once home, Truman is now feeling like an animal in a cage.
840240	842080	His wife, unable to come down,
842080	843120	offers him some coffee
843120	844960	with a less than subtle product placement.
844960	846480	Truman immediately senses out the fact
846480	847920	that she is performing for someone,
847920	849520	and so he confronts her about it.
849520	851520	He's starting to reject this ridiculous reality
851520	852560	he is surrounded by,
852560	854320	and because of this, he seems crazy,
854320	856480	which is why then the actor of Truman's wife
856480	857680	begins to break character
857680	860080	and pulls out a sharpened kitchen utensil
860080	861280	to defend herself.
861280	862640	It's these sorts of cracks in the show
862640	865280	that only happen when Truman stops believing in it.
865280	865920	Like in our world,
865920	868320	we're now starting to see the rise of political outsiders.
868320	869760	We're seeing the rise of extremism
869760	871520	and a general apathy of all the people
871520	873360	who refuse to believe in our current system.
873360	874800	With our government starting to collapse
874800	875760	with war imminent,
875760	877680	no one trusts our broken society.
877680	879200	And in the case of the Truman Show,
879200	880560	it's this unravelling madness
880560	882000	that almost ends with Truman's wife
882000	883360	revealing her acted role.
883360	885520	Only until Truman's lifelong friend, Marlon,
885520	886640	bursts in at the last minute
886640	889120	and whisks Truman away to have a heart-to-heart conversation.
889120	889840	But at this point,
889840	892000	it's like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound.
892000	893280	The floodgates are now open,
893280	894880	and Truman's belief is dwindling.
894880	896720	In this scene, the two are sitting near the river
896720	897760	and begin reminiscing.
897760	899680	Christoph through Marlon reassures Truman
899680	901680	that Truman's life has meaning and is normal.
901680	903440	He comforts Truman by assuring him
903440	905120	that if what Truman believed was real,
905120	907760	then everyone would have to be in on it, including him.
907760	910560	Though this isn't possible as Marlon would never lie.
910560	913200	On the surface, Truman seemingly takes this into heart.
913200	914640	But deep down, he knows that Marlon
914640	915840	is just a victim of the game.
915840	918560	And so he deliberately shows to him that he bought the ruse.
918560	920400	He knows that Marlon isn't a bad person,
920400	922080	but that he's not a real person.
922080	924800	Morning arrives and Truman seems to be back to his old self.
924800	926560	He draws with a bar of soap on in the morning.
926560	929200	He has the usual conversations with his neighbours and co-workers,
929200	932160	and seems interested in a new office mate he will have next to him.
932160	934640	Evening rolls around and everything seems business as usual
934640	935920	with Truman fast asleep.
935920	938000	However, Christoph senses something is off.
938000	941040	Truman fell asleep in the basement rather than his bed.
941040	943360	So Marlon is again sent over with a six-pack
943360	945520	to investigate and talk Truman back to sense.
945520	948000	However, this time he finds that Truman isn't there
948000	949600	and has escaped from the house.
949600	952160	Christoph calls for all actors to search for Truman,
952160	955040	and for the first time in the show's history, cuts the transmission.
955040	957840	However, even with all the actors searching the entire set,
957840	959120	Truman cannot be found.
959120	962800	At his wit's end, Christoph has the set illuminated into daylight mode early.
962800	965680	And, on a hunch, has the team begin looking through the cameras
965680	967200	near the harbour and on the boat.
967200	968640	After cycling through a few cameras,
968640	970560	the team finds Truman aboard a sailboat,
970560	972960	and Christoph gives the call to resume transmission.
972960	974560	After a few moments of peace sailing,
974560	976160	Christoph is then faced with a dilemma.
976160	979360	He either continues the transmission at risk of Truman finding the truth,
979360	981360	or he gets rid of Truman entirely.
981360	984320	So, he decides to send a violent storm above Truman's boat.
984320	986080	Christoph increases the violence of the weather,
986080	988160	but after a few long minutes, relents.
988160	990720	Amidst this, Truman shows his willingness to die for the truth.
990720	991840	By shouting to the sky,
991840	993040	is this the best you've got?
993040	994400	Christoph, in Godlike stupid,
994400	996960	descends to send the most violent bout of weather yet.
996960	998880	All to the dismay of his crew and producer.
998880	1001440	Truman, however, holds on, but is knocked unconscious.
1001440	1004480	But at the last minute, Christoph rescues the weather and removes the storm,
1004480	1006080	resuming the tranquil waters.
1006080	1008880	Truman regains consciousness and begins sailing his boat again.
1008880	1011520	He has beaten the storm and the sea seems to be in his favor.
1011520	1012800	However, after a few minutes,
1012800	1015440	the bow of Truman's boat launches through the side of the set,
1015440	1017040	leaving a big hole in the skydome.
1017040	1019600	By now, all of Truman's suspicions have been confirmed,
1019600	1021760	and in an ecstasy, begins punching the wall.
1021760	1024640	However, the reality of Truman's situation begins to dawn on him,
1024640	1026560	as he sees the ramp at the end of the water.
1026560	1028880	Truman walks across this ramp, walking on the water.
1028880	1030000	The audience is gripped.
1030000	1033840	The culmination of his 30 years in the Truman show seems to be at its finale.
1033840	1037200	Truman locates a staircase and slowly ascends to the side of the set.
1037200	1040080	At the top, he locates the door labeled exit and opens it,
1040080	1041600	revealing the abyss beyond his realm.
1041600	1043680	The gold-like voice then thunders through the sky,
1043680	1048000	as Christoph reveals that Truman was the star of the TV show with the whole world watching.
1048000	1049520	Truman asks, was nothing real?
1049520	1052240	And in response, Christoph responds that Truman is real,
1052240	1054560	and that's what made him so enjoyable for millions.
1054560	1056560	Christoph then tries to keep Truman in the set,
1056560	1059360	by indicating that there was no more truth out in the real world,
1059360	1061920	and that in the world he created for him, he had nothing to fear.
1061920	1063280	The ignorance was bliss.
1063280	1064720	After a few moments of silence,
1064720	1068240	Truman looks up at the camera and says his final words before leaving the show.
1068240	1070160	Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
1070160	1073360	It's Truman's overriding impulse to return to what is real,
1073360	1075440	that makes the entire show fall apart.
1075440	1080080	His drive to understand true reality is enough to bring down the false reality he'd been living in.
1080080	1083520	As he goes through the door, this symbolizes Truman taking back control,
1083520	1086160	and turning back on a sterile, hollowed-out reality.
1086160	1088000	And today, we're in the same process.
1088000	1090400	The increasingly ridiculousness of our society,
1090400	1093360	and the habitus that we're serviled to, is beginning to crack.
1093440	1096320	With our world, economy, and culture crumbling into the ground,
1096320	1098560	we're seeing a rejection of this tired system.
1098560	1101840	We're seeing new waves of younger generations dropping out of the workforce,
1101840	1105600	rejecting the habitus imposed on them, and millions taking the untrodden path,
1105600	1108000	which is causing society to reach a crossroads.
1108000	1112560	We're faced with a new path, because those in control of our reality are now making a new one.
1112560	1117040	A path of metaverse is in virtual AI reality to take us astray from our current world,
1117040	1119920	and the other path is a reversion back to what is truly felt.
1119920	1123520	But whichever path we take, our belief in society is falling apart.
1123520	1126080	The cracks are starting to show everywhere you look,
1126080	1128320	and the game is collapsing in on itself.
1128320	1130320	So the question is, where does it go from here?
1133280	1135440	I have a quick, important announcement to make.
1135440	1137200	I'm sick of being demonetized on YouTube.
1137200	1139760	I'm sick of censoring these videos for the YouTube algorithm.
1139760	1141040	So this is going to change.
1141040	1145680	Every month, I'm going to be releasing unfiltered, raw, controversial videos for YouTube members.
1145760	1149120	Videos about the darkest corners of the internet, TikTok, the CIA,
1149120	1151680	China Rothschilds, and Mr. Robot's series review.
1151680	1153680	And by the end of the month slash early August,
1153680	1157280	I'll be releasing a video on Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unibomber,
1157280	1160320	where we'll talk about his story, going from a mathematical prodigy
1160320	1162400	to living in the wild, sending bombs in the mail,
1162400	1165360	and having his manifesto on the front page of the New York Times.
1165360	1167840	Not only that, but by becoming a member of the channel,
1167840	1171120	you'll have access to my Discord server to talk with other like-minded people,
1171120	1173920	where every month I'll be doing a Q&A for all your questions.

1176560	1178000	I will personally refund you.
1178000	1179600	All you have to do is email me.
1179600	1181520	So if you want to watch exclusive, unfiltered,
