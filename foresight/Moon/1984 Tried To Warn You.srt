1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Imagine if you lived in a world where you were constantly watched, a world where everything

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,560
is controlled by the elite, where you're bombarded with non-stop propaganda, a world where everyone

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,160
is repressed, lonely and isolated, existing as one insignificant cog in an incomprehensible machine.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,600
This is the chilling vision of the future that George Orwell put forward in his masterpiece 1984,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
and does it sound familiar? It's no coincidence that his predictions have come true nearly every

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,520
single way in our modern society today, so let's take a deep dive into the story of 1984 to learn

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,640
how you're all being controlled and if you can ever break free. Now the movie begins with a quote

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,040
from the iconic book that it was adapted from, who controls the past controls the future,

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,240
who controls the present controls the past, and this sets the stage. And then without delay,

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,640
we are then shown the iconic shots of a crowd of people staring at propaganda presented by the

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,200
party. The party is the shadowy government which controls every aspect of life through their

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
ideology in suck. The basic principle is to control information so tightly that every aspect of life

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,960
is dictated and controlled by the party. Absolute obedience is expected, down to rejecting basic

14
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,840
facts about life and even your own thoughts and memories. On the screen, a video player is creating

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,200
an idyllic image of the country that the West has become, all under this totalitarian rule, Oceana.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
This is one of the three super states which make up the world of 1984, with control over the Americas,

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,640
Britain, Australia and some parts of Africa. And this is when we're introduced to the concept of

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,120
Big Brother and a man named Goldstein who attempts to persuade the people of Oceana that they are

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,200
being duped. But despite the truth in what he's saying, it's drowned out by shouts from the

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
audience. Insoc has conditioned them to reject the truth entirely, to the point they don't even want

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
to hear it. Throughout the demonstration, you can see the Insoc salutes, something that was

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,960
borrowed from historical totalitarian regimes. And after this propaganda video reaches its climax,

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
the crowd is pacified by the symbol of Insoc, alongside the face of Big Brother.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,560
It's afterwards that we're introduced to our main character, Winston Smith, who is working

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,120
in an office cubicle for the Ministry of Truth. His job is to edit past broadcasts to reflect

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,040
the current reality that they're pushing. So if the sugar ration has been reduced from last year,

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,960
he will then edit last year's paper to imply that it actually went up instead. And then once he's

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,360
finished with his day's work, Winston makes his way back home, where propaganda has already been

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
played in his house. This time it's a man being shamed for falling under Goldstein's influence.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,320
The man has been charged for attempting to persuade the public that they're not at a war with Eurasia,

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,360
but rather East Asia. This information control and Eurasia is central to Big Brother's control

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,960
of the people. As over time, the party has rewritten reality to suit their needs. Now Winston is a

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,680
key part of this process, but obviously this brings up contradictions. And that's where the concept

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,200
of double thing comes in. The idea of wholeheartedly believing in two separate contradictory facts.

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,520
One of the examples they give in the novel is the simultaneous belief that the party is a bastion

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,120
of democracy. And also that democracy is impossible. And it's through this concept that the party

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,880
rewrites reality, replacing it with an illusion of their own creation. And this is the all-encompassing

38
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,480
lie that maintains 1984 society. It's only through everyone believing it that it becomes real. But

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,960
this concept of a world founded on fiction isn't something that all are created all by himself.

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,720
Instead, this is something that's very real and has been observed throughout history.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,880
Thousands of years ago, Plato wrote some of the first recorded philosophy on this concept.

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,520
Through what he called the noble lie, where people know their place in society through their belief

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,160
an entirely fictional story about the society's origin. The details aren't important,

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,480
so long as it gives justification for the social order. And this gives people a reason to accept

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,720
how the world is and that their equal man is somehow better or worse than him. And we see this

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,800
today when our own version of Big Brother's is one thing and then means another. Like when the

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,200
establishment media, politicians and world economic forum claim to be working for freedom and free

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,160
speech, also while doing everything they can to bully and censor all criticism into silence.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,480
And there are just countless examples of this. Like when the fattest, most grotesque politicians

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
of them all claim that they're promoting health. And this concept has evolved over time as people

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,520
realise that all of society's institutions are built upon a necessary fiction. And this is known

52
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,320
as the habitus. It's the thou you need to see through for society to make sense. Now the concept

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,400
is similar to the noble lie, but the habitus goes much deeper. You see throughout your life,

54
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,240
you are influenced by your environment and your interactions with other people. And these,

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,480
combined with your personality, create your view of the world. And it's in this way that you buy

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,200
into the habitus, the shared societal illusion of how the world should be. You are socialised into

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,080
the habitus. It's come down from above and everyone else around you believes in it. The habitus is

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,640
the social contract between you, your fellow man and the government. And it's what determines your

59
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,200
culture. It's what determines all the societal trends around you. And therefore also decides

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,080
the rules of society. And this stretches to everything, our ideas of beauty, what's seen as

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,160
valuable, what's seen as even right and wrong. But because it's influenced by the environment and

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,120
how people treat each other, the habitus is always changing to reflect this. And the world of 1984

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,360
operates on a habitus. The problem with the 1984 habitus is that it's been cracked to the top

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
and severely deformed. And because it's been poisoned to the top, it's trickled down into

65
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,000
all elements of society. And this is why 1984 is so scary. In fact, 1984 is far more unsettling

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,240
than any dumb horror film because it's so realistic. We all instinctively know what the

67
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,960
future could be like because we're so close to it today. Our society that we live in right now is

68
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,680
just a few steps away from totalitarianism. And all while we're trying to warn us of all of this.

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,760
Because throughout the story, we're going to see exactly how the party has brought the habitus

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,800
and society and how it's affected everyone within the society. So getting straight back into the

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,440
story, and we see Winston sitting alone in his decrepit apartment, and it's here after lighting

72
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,320
a cigarette that Winston introduces us the concept of thought crime. Now thought crime is the act of

73
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,760
going against the habitus of the world, even in your deepest thoughts. Just considering rebellion

74
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,240
is already rebellion because it's something outside of the party's reality. The party enforces

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
this through the thought police, a secret organization which uses informant surveillance

76
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,040
and undercover agents to root out anyone who even thinks about rebelling. And as the propaganda

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,120
continues playing in the background on the ever present screen, Winston lifts a brick from his

78
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
house and uncovers his journal, something that's definitely banned in the world he lives in. And

79
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
it's in this journal that Winston reminisces about a world where thought was free, a time where minds

80
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
weren't controlled by big brother and the thought police. And by doing this, he's already become a

81
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
thought criminal just through his own memories. And upon waking up the next day, Winston is then

82
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,000
subjected to a mandatory exercise routine in front of his television, to which he is signalled out for

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,880
not performing adequately. Winston then half-heartedly waves the insoucane signal and makes his way to

84
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,560
work. And that's when he treats it even more propaganda playing on the television during

85
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,800
lunch hour. However, what instead catches the eye of Winston is a young woman staring at him.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,800
Winston then sits down and begins eating his meal, when one of his colleagues comments on the new

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
shortened dictionary and how positive the destructions of word really is. Newspeak, as they call it,

88
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,840
is a new language invented by the party that reduces English to its bare essentials,

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,160
where controversial words are removed, meaning that if it works then rebellion will be impossible,

90
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,800
because it won't even be able to be considered. The words just won't exist for it. Back at work,

91
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,280
Winston then continues his job at the Ministry of Truth, this time unpersoning someone. Now

92
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,280
unpersoning is the act of essentially removing someone from history and replacing them with

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,920
someone else. And this is just one of the many aspects of 1984 which has its roots in previous

94
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,400
autocracies. Now in this, all world was specifically alluding to Stalin's dictatorship, where this

95
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,560
was an extremely common practice. Enemies of the state or rather enemies of Stalin wouldn't just

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,200
be executed. Every mention of their name and even their image and photographs was erased,

97
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,440
completely removing them from history. However, this practice of course hasn't died out.

98
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,360
The Chinese government, for example, was infamous for disappearing anyone they don't like.

99
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba, essentially disappeared from public view after making

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
economic suggestions that would shift power away from the Chinese Communist Party. And today,

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,960
he's all but vanished from the public eye, spending his time in exile under constant

102
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
surveillance. But we're not just talking about China, this is happening all over the West. When

103
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,520
anyone who speaks out against the agenda set in place by Western governments, they are then often

104
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,760
censored or bullied into silence. Whether it be Julian Assange or Edward Snowden talking about

105
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,680
the government's crimes, or any other supposed thought criminal who's been cancelled on social

106
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,920
media for talking about COVID and its origins. Anything deemed a thought crime and you can

107
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,160
be cancelled immediately. I mean it's gone to the point now where FBI and other government

108
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,680
intelligence agencies are infiltrating and working in conjunction with all the big social media sites.

109
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
And once they have control of sites like Twitter, they can then censor any narrative they don't like,

110
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
shadow banning or completely deleting people from the sites. But it's not just social media

111
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,600
companies. Now even companies like Uber, PayPal and even Airbnb can ban you for having the wrong

112
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,640
opinions online. And then over in China is their infamous social credit system. The basic idea is

113
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,480
for each person to be assigned a personal score based on how trust whether they are according

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,560
to the Chinese government. Certain things can increase your score, like making a social media

115
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,800
post praising the government. But on the other hand, things like getting into debt, buying too many

116
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,680
video games, reading the bible or criticizing the government, deducts points from your score.

117
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,240
And if your score falls too low, the CCP will then severely reduce your already restricted

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,480
freedoms. As people with a low score can have trouble buying train or even plane tickets,

119
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,160
some people have even had their pets taken away from them. With one student even been denied a

120
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,400
place at university because his father had a low score. For now the system has only been put into

121
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,560
practice by some scattered regional governments, but it won't be that way for very long. And recently

122
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,480
is usually being pushed through new laws to lay the groundwork, meaning that a nationwide social

123
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,440
credit system is just a few years away. I mean recently it's gotten so bad in China that a new

124
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,920
law just passed, which means that farmers can only plant the crops the government approves of.

125
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,360
And the personal planting of vegetables like beans, melons, squashes in your front or backyard is now

126
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
strictly forbidden. And in the west we're also seeing a gradual progression of repression,

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
which is exactly what George Orwell feared. So after he finishes with his work for the day,

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
Winston makes his way to an antique store in the slum districts of London and meets the owner

129
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,880
who sold him his journal. He buys a coral figurine, tapes with glass, and makes his way out of the

130
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,960
store, where he meets the same woman who was staring at him during lunch. The woman continues

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,440
looking at him ominously, going into the proletariat zones in London, something that is forbidden by

132
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,080
the party. She could slum out and so Winston considers killing her back at his apartment.

133
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,840
Coincidentally enough though, the two see each other the very next day in an underpass. The

134
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,240
woman stumbles and forces the ground, but quickly makes her way back on her feet. Secretly as he's

135
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,040
helping her, the woman hands Winston a note before leaving. At work, Winston unveils the note and

136
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,240
he reads, I love you. Along with a meetup location on the backside, seemingly without a second thought,

137
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,480
Winston tosses the note into the incinerator, and we transition back to his apartment,

138
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,480
but Winston is fixing his neighbour's drain at the behest of his neighbour's wife. At the apartment,

139
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,840
one of the neighbour's children loudly accuses him of being a thought criminal. Obviously this

140
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,920
makes Winston very nervous. It's an accusation which can lead to death and suffering, and it's

141
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,720
coincidentally true, but both of the adults ignore it. It's just a result of youth indoctrination.

142
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,640
However, it's true all the same. Luckily before the confrontation go any further though,

143
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,240
a newsflash interrupts the engagement. The announcement states that the war with Eurasia

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,560
is reaching an end, but with how the flow of information works in a totalitarian state,

145
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,400
who can really say if this is the case? And as afterwards we see immobile citizens cheering

146
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,960
on executions playing from the television, along with a bunch of Eurasian prisoners being escorted

147
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,960
to their impending death. Winston is among this crowd, along with a mysterious woman who hands

148
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,360
Winston another note. She is relying on him to destroy it. Winston abides and says that he will

149
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,600
finally meet her at the drop point, taking a train to the destination. On the train ride,

150
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,920
a band of children are then singing a propaganda song, where they pledge lower devotion to the state

151
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,080
and to die with dignity. And it's in these two scenes where we see a worrying aspect of the

152
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,680
war in 1984. The party only came to power just a few decades ago, but the new generation of

153
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,240
completely indoctrinated children is already approaching adulthood. In the novel, Winston

154
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
notes that the children are the most pragmatic and fanatic supporters of Big Brother. Growing up

155
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
in the system means that a habitus is completely under the control of government, one day the

156
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
last people who can remember the old war like Winston will die, leaving no one left who knows

157
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,600
anything outside of the state's control. A truly terrifying thought. And so once Winston exits on

158
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,000
a stop, we see our first glimpse of nature in the movie. This change of scenery is a stark contrast

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,160
to the industrial environment that the majority of Oceana presides in. Winston is now out in the

160
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,960
forest and looking for the drop point, until he hears a twig snap behind him. It's the woman,

161
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,800
and she has been following him the whole time. When the two get to a scheduled hiding place,

162
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,960
it's here where we get an insight into Winston's worldview. After learning that the woman has done

163
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,960
this exact stunt with hundreds of men, Winston says that he hates goodness, and doesn't want

164
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:28,080
virtue to exist anywhere. Winston wants everyone corrupt,

165
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,720
much to the delight of the woman. This state of mind is a direct response to the tyranny of

166
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,440
Winston's society, meaning that everything the party in the habitus sees as good is turned on

167
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,160
its head. And because of this overwhelming level of control in the society, all Winston really

168
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,400
wants to do is yell bullshit at all the lies slung at him. But most of the things that Winston

169
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,880
thinks are bad or corrupted just aren't, the normal parts of life which the party sees as a

170
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,040
threat to their authority, and therefore its outlawed. It's part of the tactic of keeping

171
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,320
the people impoverished and uneducated, as this makes them far easier to control. Because real

172
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,120
education and economic prosperity are the two worst things for Big Brother. As they're not

173
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
trying to enlighten you or save your soul, it's all about control. The more you commit to their

174
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,840
ideology, the more they can poison your soul. And that's why in the book All Well Writes,

175
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,640
every record has been destroyed or failed, every book rewritten, every picture repainted,

176
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,680
every statue in street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. It's a beautiful

177
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,240
thing the destruction of words. And today in our own world, we're seeing a very similar process

178
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,880
unfold. You see things as simple as children's books. I'm talking real dull books, and now

179
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,000
being pushed through a demented purity filter, where all bad words or paragraphs are now being

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,040
rewritten. Words like witches have been turned to hags, fat turned to ginormous, black person to

181
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,920
dark, cloud men to cloud people. Entire sections of these children books are being rewritten to

182
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,400
eliminate any wrongthink. And this isn't just children's books, this is happening throughout

183
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,040
all genres. Roald Dahl's just the most egregious example of this. But it doesn't even stop there,

184
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,920
because even a recent UK government-backed report has now claimed that reading George All

185
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,760
Well's 1984 is a sign of quote, extremism. So Western governments are now characterising people

186
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,280
who read 1984 as potential enemies of the state. And this isn't just happening with words,

187
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,600
we're also seeing this in the same form of economic control. As we're all familiar with,

188
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,320
the past few decades have seen enormous inequality that has steadily risen over the last 40 years.

189
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,360
Which is why by 2019, the world's richest 26 people earned more wealth than the poorest 50%.

190
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
But then after COVID, the biggest wealth transfer in history occurred. Now to put into

191
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,200
scale how big this wealth transfer truly was, we have to look at the stats. In early 2020,

192
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,560
before COVID began, billionaires alone as just people, earned 2% of total global wealth. And

193
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,720
this is only including publicly available information. But just a year later, and this

194
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,840
number was now 3.5%. 1.5% more of the total global wealth has gone to just billionaires alone,

195
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,160
all in a single year. And the result of this is ginormous wealth for the top elites,

196
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
and a never-ending hamster wheel for the masses. Where you can never control your own money,

197
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,560
where you never own anything, where you have no property, land or assets, or even any prospect

198
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,640
of owning these things in the future, just continually renting everything with nothing to

199
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,720
your name. Because in the last couple years, as wages have stagnated, the cost of everything

200
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,800
around you has gone up exponentially, only continued to go up and up while your income

201
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,280
starts to shrink. And so it was no surprise that as this great wealth transfer unfolded,

202
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,920
the World Economic Forum unveiled their new plan, the Great Reset. Now for those of you

203
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,560
unaware, the World Economic Forum is a priestly class of people, mixed up with global leaders,

204
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,280
rural families, black rock, the world's biggest companies, the biggest banks, the biggest pharmaceutical

205
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,840
companies, mainstream media outlets and the top celebrities. Pretty much a culmination of the

206
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,160
world's most powerful people. And these are the people who create agendas and policies that

207
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,120
are then adopted by organizations such as the UN, World Bank, IMF and national governments.

208
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,000
And this private organization has no democratic vote, and yet it is quite clearly one of the most

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,960
powerful organizations the world has ever seen. Not just affecting the West, but also Russia and

210
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,680
China. So when they unveiled their plan for a Great Reset, this marked a new chapter in human

211
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,160
history. And the leader of this organization is Klaus Schwab, who claimed the Great Reset would

212
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,320
provide a unique window of opportunity to reshape our world. And I see the need for action. I see

213
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,800
the need for a Great Reset. And one part of this agenda was to make the world greener and more

214
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,600
carbon neutral, which sounds great. But what exactly did he mean by this? Well, as you might have

215
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
noticed, all governments in the West in just the last year have promoted these policies heavily,

216
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,640
with the West now being forced to cut their ammonium and nitrogen emissions by 50% alone.

217
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,320
However, for many farmers in Europe, their livestock normally produce ammonia,

218
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,400
urine and feces. And so farmers all across Europe were recently forced to cut 30% of their livestock,

219
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,800
which meant huge swaths of farmers were forced out of business by the government. And yet these

220
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,280
same rules never applied for sectors like the airline industry. So suddenly, farmers and workers

221
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,600
across Europe protested. But at first, these protests were smeared as just crazy right-wingers.

222
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,600
But as this resentment grew and the protests gripped European nations, the government acted

223
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,160
harshly, with live rounds being fired upon these protesters. I mean, in the Netherlands,

224
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,120
they even changed the law that officers who killed protesters were now immune from manslaughter

225
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,040
charges. And whilst the media covered this up, the Dutch government would never receive any

226
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,680
backlash as they were cowing to the World Economic Forum orders. And the working class people in

227
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,520
Europe were forced to see their futures destroyed before them as they were attacked and mocked in

228
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,440
the media. And so it was no surprise that around this period, Klaus Schwab, the leader of the

229
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,800
World Economic Forum, warned of increasing anger. We have to prepare for a more angry world.

230
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,320
Because the Western governments were now forcing the food supply to run dry,

231
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,960
whilst artificially inflating the prices amidst the global food shortage, only deepening the

232
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,280
economic crisis that the majority of the West were facing. And in an act of double-think,

233
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,840
something that came straight out of 1984, media outlets like Reuters would then claim that there

234
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,160
was no evidence that the Dutch government worked with the World Economic Forum to impose these

235
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,480
new laws. Which really isn't all that surprising given the World Economic Forum partnered with

236
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,360
Reuters for exclusive content distribution, as the World Economic Forum, otherwise known as Big

237
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,600
Brother, controls the flow of information. And whilst you might not see the anger in the news,

238
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,840
these protests haven't stopped in Europe. I mean, just recently, protests have gripped the country

239
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,400
of France. As the President Macron has risen the pension age, many is going to take longer and longer

240
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,040
before workers can ever receive a pension. Even though the majority of France hates this idea,

241
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,480
this was imposed anyway, as democracy in Western nations is becoming a façade. In fact, democracies

242
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,720
aren't even obeying the people anymore. They obey corporate and financial interests rather than

243
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
the popular vote, the World Economic Forum over the people. And that's why our freedoms have

244
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,280
slowly been stripped economically and socially. Because if everyone had social and economic

245
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,600
freedom, then the whole system would collapse. And instead of new parties emerging and addressing

246
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,400
these protests, you're now seeing the militarisation of the police, more surveillance, more distraction.

247
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
And it's following this agenda that people like Bill Gates are claiming at the World Economic Forum

248
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,280
that during our current worst cost of living crisis, and the ongoing fuel shortages,

249
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,440
build things that workers should now also be paying carbon taxes. All whilst people like

250
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,280
Bill Gates are using the most carbon of all. They'll preach things like private property

251
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,680
for the average person will be a bygone relic, all whilst snapping up record amounts of farmland

252
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,560
across the US. Following their mantra of your own nothing and be happy. And all you're left with is

253
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,960
again, more distraction, more noise, more misery, more tension and more depression. No more family

254
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,520
units, less farms, less freedoms and no more rights to pursue happiness. And this is just one

255
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,680
of the reasons our habitat has been violently shifted towards consumerism and hollow material

256
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,640
wealth. Because we're being starved of it. And it's the perfect means to keep control in society.

257
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,560
But how did things ever get this bad? This has never really happened in living memory.

258
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,720
But what all world didn't foresee was that pleasure was just as useful a tool to keep

259
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,640
the masses numbed. You see, as they slowly siphon the wealth out of the economy,

260
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,880
the elites keep us distracted with hollow, empty hedonism. And modern technology is the

261
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,920
perfect tools for this. By exploiting the basic social need to be accepted, social media applications

262
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,920
exploit your dopamine receptors in the exact same way as cocaine. Years of split testing of

263
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,840
perfecting the algorithms and billions of dollars in research have made big tech companies like

264
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,400
Facebook and TikTok as addictive as possible. And as people build up a tolerance, they always need

265
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,800
more content faster to stay engaged, all while procrastinating and wasting their life away,

266
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,120
being numbed into flaccid apathy in their bedrooms. The rise of TikTok, YouTube Shorts and

267
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,680
all these other short form social media sites is just a direct result of this process. It's why

268
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,840
we're developing parasocial relationships with streamers and not our own communities.

269
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,200
Given the people, the illusion of community and knowing what's going on in the world,

270
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,600
we're without any real substance or true information. And by providing a drip drip of

271
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,480
anodine lethargic dross, the meaning in your life is sucked away. The resentment you feel

272
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,360
at the government is numbed and repressed inside of you. And so you accept it. And anytime you

273
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,440
feel depressed, isolated, like things are just outside of your control, there's always that

274
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,560
little dopamine fix just sitting in your pocket, pushing people more and more into the online realms,

275
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,480
stuck alone in your bedroom. And the result of this is what you see today, the most depressed

276
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,200
and downtrodden generation in living memory. As the normal societal habitat is breaking down,

277
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,720
it's taking away your motivation to go out in the world and make something of yourself.

278
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,400
You don't have the energy to call out bullshit against your government and the people preaching

279
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,000
their agenda. Responsibility, duty, purpose, these key pairs that have motivated men for millennia

280
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,400
have all been pushed out of the societal framework. Instead, consumerism and greed are the only things

281
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,040
to look up to now. But the worst aspect of this is the effect it's had on people's relationships

282
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,640
with each other. I mean, our current habitat right now is leaving 63% of men under age 30,

283
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,840
single and alone, and a large majority of them on dating a tool. Millions of men are experiencing

284
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,000
the exact same lovelessness that Winston's known his entire life up until now.

285
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,040
But before we continue, I want to tell you about something I've been working on this

286
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,960
past month. You see, I've built something that I legitimately think will change your life,

287
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,200
because you see, from most of your life, you've always been fed a constant stream of lies.

288
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,240
Lies that have poisoned your value systems, purpose and passion in life,

289
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,720
whilst also poisoning the community around you. And it's why you feel so lazy, so meaningless,

290
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,880
so lonely. And so it's time that we've come up with real solutions, not just modern-day

291
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,880
BS solutions. I'm talking about a new form of community, a way for us to take back control

292
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
of our lives. Where I will go deep into the real solutions, answers and value systems of

293
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,280
thousands of philosophers consents into an easy to understand package, or to help you improve

294
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,680
your life. All at no cost to you, I will send you a weekly essay on the solutions to the problems

295
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,440
we discuss on this channel, so just click on the link in the description and add your email

296
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,840
on the name down below. After Winston and the woman get to know each other a little better,

297
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,920
we then transition back to the antique store, where Winston plans on renting out the place,

298
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,760
and once they're sure they're finally somewhere private, the jurors secretly engage

299
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,400
in an unsanctioned relationship against the state. We also finally get the name of the woman,

300
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,280
being revealed as Julia. In this moment, both of them can finally relax and enjoy themselves,

301
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,520
even if just for a little while. They then enjoy some contraband items that Julia smuggles from

302
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,080
the party like real chocolate and coffee, and for a while their little conspiracy works quite

303
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,480
well for them. Up until this point, Winston has been completely in the dark on whether there's

304
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,280
an active resistance movement, but in his mind, he's certain that he has some level of understanding

305
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,320
with an inner party member, a man called O'Brien. So when O'Brien corners Winston in a hallway,

306
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,880
he's full of hope for a way to resist. O'Brien tells Winston that he's a fan of his writing,

307
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,360
but he does mention that there were a few unwords in his latest piece, and recommends he reads the

308
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,080
state's next dictionary edition. When he goes to collect it from O'Brien's office, Winston is

309
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,800
astounded by the luxuries that he enjoys. He offers him real wine, something that Winston has never

310
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,680
tasted before, and O'Brien can even turn off his telescreen. But the most precious thing O'Brien

311
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,240
offers Winston is hope, when he tells him about the resistance against the party, and it's here

312
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,840
that we get an introduction to the shadowy practices of how Ensok truly operates. Between the pages of

313
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,640
dictionary that O'Brien gave him, Winston finds a different book titled, The Theory and Practice of

314
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,200
Oligarchal Collectivism, which is basically a manual on how Ensok and Big Brother operate,

315
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
and the author is listed as Emmanuel Goldstein. Now it goes over a lot of what we've already

316
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,760
covered, but it also tells Winston about what's really going on in the world's politics.

317
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,880
You see, in the world of 1984, three super states have reached global dominance. There's Oceana,

318
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,000
which controls the Americas, South Africa, and the UK. Then there's Eurasia, a Soviet successor state,

319
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,160
which rules over Russia, parts of Asia, and Europe. And then finally there's East Asia,

320
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,760
a successor of China, which controls the Far East. The three states exist in a constant cycle of war,

321
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,680
endlessly shifting alliances and fighting for control over the rest of the world,

322
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,360
but they're not trying to win. They all have enough resources for their impoverished people.

323
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,760
The states are also pretty much the same in their beliefs. Eurasia's neo-Bolshevikism

324
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,400
and East Asia's obliteration of the self are almost identical to Ensok, meaning there aren't

325
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,360
really any ideological differences. Instead, this war only exists to suck up resources and

326
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,480
keep people in poverty. It keeps their societies and their brutal ideologies running, all in order

327
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,600
to maintain control. George Orwell envisioned a dead end to put it simply. A world where progress

328
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,680
and forward movement have been stifled by three world powers to guarantee their control over the

329
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,720
people. And so as Winston sits at home, we learn that Oceana has once again shifted alliances,

330
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,600
and now the war is with East Asia, and Eurasia is now their ally. Which is just another bit of

331
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,360
double-think, and it doesn't really change anything for Oceana's people. It's just more

332
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,680
propaganda and more control for the populace. And that's why the parallels of our real life

333
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,360
politics and that of 1984 is truly uncanny, where secret families and powerful shadowy

334
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,320
organizations like the World Economic Forum fuel both sides of wars, where world enemies

335
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,720
are friends behind closed doors, where governments continually change our enemies and ally with

336
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
people that we're told to hate. But then this really does beg the question, where do these

337
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,040
big, powerful governments and these shadowy organizations actually come from? Why does

338
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,560
Big Brother exist? And why do we decide as humans to follow the order of these totalitarian regimes

339
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,640
and governments? Well, the answer simply lies in understanding how governments form in the first

340
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,880
place. Now, Thomas Hobbes was one of the first political theorists to understand this, in his

341
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,200
widely renowned book, Leviathan. Now, he wrote this after his experiences during the English

342
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,160
Civil War, a brutal conflict where the country for over a decade was split into two by the

343
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,640
parliamentarians and the royalists. During this period, but headings were common and the violence

344
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,760
was barbaric, and it was this chaos that inspired his thoughts on governance. In his book, he first

345
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,160
talks about human nature and primitive life, back in the time when human were cavemen, living a

346
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,680
tribal existence. And he famously described this life as nasty, brutish, and short. The lack of

347
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,800
laws and complete chaos of nature led to a constant fear of death in the people. There was no actual

348
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,800
progress, because people were either too afraid of each other or just too busy in their fight for

349
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,840
survival. There was hardly any social cohesion, there was no rule of law, and there was no societal

350
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,560
development. And it was this primitive fear for survival that laid the groundwork for society.

351
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,280
So to avoid this constant struggle for survival, men willingly lay down their claims to the world

352
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,000
to live in a peaceful collective under one powerful ruler. And for Thomas Hobbes, this was

353
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,280
the optimal form of government, where one powerful state with a sole ruler did his best to protect

354
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,560
the people. That way, everything follows one trajectory of the leader. All quarrels between

355
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,360
the masses are distilled by ultimate power, and only then can the lives of everyone improve.

356
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,600
But you see, Thomas Hobbes was actually wrong with this, as this only ever worked with a truly

357
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,800
virtuous and benevolent ruler. And yet the oligarchy of 1984 and the oligarchies we see today

358
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,720
are just the complete opposite of this. But nonetheless, when there is this benevolent

359
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,000
ruler who controls a massive population, the culture and societal norms of that population

360
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,200
always trickle down from the top. And this is where social habitus forms. Now it may change

361
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,440
based on the environment and the people that form the society, but a specific code of conduct

362
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,680
always takes shape along the same lines. You see, for example, in a healthy society,

363
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,200
the habitus is always focused on ideals like liberty, responsibility, virtue and discipline.

364
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:43,840
These would be the values virtues and moral code of the elite, and then that would trickle down

365
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,200
into all areas of society. So this is how the habitus works. And sociologists use the idea of

366
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
habitus to illustrate the manner in which a society's culture works. You see, there are many

367
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,200
unspoken assumptions and standards that underpin society. These are frequently carried out automatically,

368
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,680
and they are more akin to acquired skills than deliberate actions. The French thinker Bordeaux,

369
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,160
who popularized the word, frequently linked it to sports. For example, the rules of football are

370
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,240
set in stone, and you play the game without thinking why the rules are there in the first place.

371
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,480
And yet these rules are crucial, otherwise the whole game just wouldn't work without it.

372
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,320
And this is also how societies and culture flourishes. And that's why the renaissance

373
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,640
was so remarkable. The new habitus that was developing in Europe in this time gave birth

374
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,520
to a whole new wave of creativity, discipline, focus, moral code and beauty. But then what

375
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,840
happens when the values of the elite starts to crack, and the habitus becomes poisoned?

376
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,120
What does this then mean for the rest of society? Well, you don't really have to

377
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,280
look very far to see how fractured and malformed our habitus has become. I mean,

378
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,280
we only need to take a look at who our icons are in society to give us an understanding of

379
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,000
what has truly happened here. Due to our hyper crony capitalist system, the elites in their greed

380
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,400
and love of money have spread into every level of society. And I'm not talking about simple

381
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,040
capitalism here. I'm talking about the special kind, the special kind of corporatism and socialism

382
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,440
for the rich. You see, for example, we no longer value the European holistic lifestyle,

383
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,480
where a person's value is based on many layers of their personality. Instead, today in the West,

384
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,280
we only value the superficial to understand someone's value. And this explains the rapid

385
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,840
rise of these fake gurus you see online. People like Grant Cardone, London Real and these vacuous

386
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,880
new mega churches. You see, things like this would never even exist without millions of people

387
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,440
orientating their self worth and motivations entirely around money. You see, in contrast to

388
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,760
the Renaissance period, they used to care about art and religion. But our new religion is following

389
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,600
hedonistic and materialistic pursuits. Now, obviously, there's always need for money,

390
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,120
and it's a great way to have freedom in your own life. But it's these sorts of scammers that

391
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,840
completely rely on greed to survive. And greed is the name of the game in modern society. And

392
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,480
that's why the greediest of all are then promoted even further, going all the way up to the top of

393
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,960
the World Economic Forum. And in a lot of cases, people are just making money simply by talking

394
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,520
about money and nothing else. Nothing on natural societal value. And it's not just these sorts

395
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,960
of people. Our society now praises these celebrities whose only value lies in their image and wealth.

396
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,280
The caressions are always mentioned, but there's just so many others, people like Cardi B,

397
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,680
the entire cast of Love Island, or any other vacuous hollered out shell of a human being

398
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,720
celebrity. And because we praise these false idols, everyone then buys into the societal delusion,

399
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,880
helping to perpetuate this broken habitus even more. And that's why lots of well-meaning

400
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,120
rational people are swept up to becoming mouthpieces of a failing system. And one of the

401
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,520
perfect analogies for our twisted habitus could be seen with the FTX scandal recently.

402
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,400
From celebrities to established financial institutions,

403
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,600
Saint-Bank-Mont-Fried fooled the world by using his own artificial pumped-up currency that had

404
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,320
no attachment to anything real to make billions. Everyone believed in it, and that's where the

405
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
value of these coins came from. By everyone believing in Saint-Bank-Mont-Fried's lies,

406
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,320
he was able to make unthinkable money. But at the top of the pyramid of FTX,

407
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,880
this CEO was a lazy gamer playing League of Legends in the Bahamas, with his whole value

408
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,040
being tricking everyone into believing his money was worth something. But then when a gust of wind

409
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,320
came, this whole facade came tumbling down in just a matter of days. And our society is heading

410
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,120
exactly the same way. You see, as the habitus gets twisted even more, it becomes harder and harder

411
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,520
for people to reconcile it with the real world. Then when the illusion breaks and people realize

412
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,360
everything is built on a lie, it eventually collapses. And Winston and Julie have also been

413
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,280
living a lie separate to the great lie of their society. You see, despite knowing they'll eventually

414
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,600
be found out, they carry on seeing each other in the room above the shop. A taste of real life

415
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,600
is just too tempting. So Winston and Joy is reading subvertive literature to Julia,

416
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,280
all while enjoying the contraband food that Julia smuggled from the inner party.

417
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,200
Things are going great, they finally escape the clutches of Big Brother, they've had a taste

418
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,760
of freedom and love, all until one day, when Julia and Winston are relaxing in their room.

419
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,760
As they watch a working class woman washing some clothes and singing a song, they marvel at the

420
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,640
beauty of life, all the more stunning because they know their time is limited. Winston says to Julia,

421
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,520
we are the dead, and Julia says the same. And then a voice from behind says, you are the dead.

422
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,360
They turn around to see a painting fall off the wall, revealing a telescreen with the

423
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,520
visage of Big Brother. The voice directs them to stand in the middle of the room,

424
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,000
as the thought police break in through the window and the door. Even worse, the antique shop owner

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,720
walks up the stairs and reveals himself to be an agent of the thought police. Ever since Winston

426
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,040
set foot in the shop, he was always under their supervision. The agents take Goldstein's book

427
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,680
and smash the piece of coral, one of the last things of beauty left from the old world, and it's

428
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,560
one of the last things Winston sees before they take him away to the sinister Ministry of Loth.

429
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,040
We are then shown Winston and Cussidy, along with his neighbour Parsons. Parsons not knowing it

430
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,000
himself is apparently an agent of Goldstein, and also a thought criminal. However, he reveals

431
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,920
that he was taken in because his daughter reported him for things he said in his sleep.

432
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,400
Despite Parsons coming across as completely indoctrinated, he's still going to be tortured

433
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,280
and broken down anyway. The two remain in custody for some time until an announcement wakes them up,

434
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,320
Room 101. Parsons seems to already know what this entails and begs the correctional officers not to

435
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,080
take him there. Winston on the other hand doesn't seem to have a clue about what's going to happen,

436
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,320
but gives a knowing look that it probably isn't going to be good. Despite all of his pleading,

437
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,960
Parsons is then taken to Room 101, and Winston waits alone in his cell for some time,

438
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,880
until he is met with O'Brien. O'Brien takes Winston into an interrogation room,

439
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,720
where he is tortured with an electric restraining device. Throughout the time,

440
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,600
O'Brien educates Winston on the principles of double-think. He reaffirms the notion that Oceana

441
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,080
has always been a war with East Asia instead of Eurasia, despite the contrary being previously

442
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,520
correct. Along with this, O'Brien then asserts that two plus two can equal three, four, or five,

443
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,720
sometimes even all of them at once. And this is the final and most essential ingredient for keeping

444
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,560
the party and their stilted habitus alive, rejecting real authentic reality itself. They

445
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,760
need people to trust the party over their own eyes and ears. It's how people are willing to accept

446
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,240
that the enemy can change at a moment's notice, and it's how the party will have taken power in

447
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,200
the first place. It's in times of great chaos and upheaval that regimes and governments fall

448
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,000
and new ones take that place. It's just the cycle of history and we've seen it happen over and over

449
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,640
again. It's how the world ordered changes, and in our current world right now, the transition

450
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,440
is almost here. One of the most famous experts in this field, Ray Dalio, describes the process in

451
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,880
a study on historical cycles, beginning with the rise of civilisations. This is when a new state,

452
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,200
founded on the dominant ideals of the time, grows in power to take control of their world,

453
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,840
like the Roman Empire all the way to America after World War II. Then comes the golden age of

454
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,720
prosperity, a long period of time where a civilisation enjoys their position at the top. But

455
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,280
this is also where the problems start to arise. People make financial bets on the world order

456
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,240
continuing forever, unable to see a future unlike the present. As the leading powers economy grows

457
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,440
to dominate the others, their currency becomes the international standard. Internal conflicts also

458
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,400
arise as the founding ideology becomes out of date with the world, and eventually a bubble forms,

459
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,800
as people bet more and more on continued growth and prosperity, whilst internal divisions and

460
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,680
problems only get worse. Those with power try to consolidate their grip on it, alienating more

461
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,920
of the people whilst holding all of the wealth. And this then only fuels extremist sentiment and

462
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,000
revolution even more. However, sometimes this can be peacefully dealt with, although eventually

463
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,560
these problems get so large and the power structure becomes so stagnant that a revolution

464
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,200
and changing of the guard becomes inevitable. Then another rising power eventually eclipses the

465
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,840
stagnating one. Most of the time there's a war or sets of wars until the dust settles and a new

466
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,560
world power comes to the forefront. And time and time again this cycle has just repeated itself.

467
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,640
In recent history it was the Dutch who were dominant, followed by the British, then the US,

468
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,880
and now China is rising to challenge the US. And that's where we are today, on the cusp of

469
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,200
this transitional period. And because of this, our current societal habitats just won't be able

470
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
to cope with the changing world. As the cracks start to show in the habitats, and the society

471
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,680
becomes more and more deranged, we'll then see a massive shift back towards additionalism. Because

472
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,000
as birth reads full, young people fail to find love or happiness. The standard of living starts

473
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,320
to drop, and the ideals that the constitution starts to get ripped apart, right-wing sentiments

474
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,560
will rise again. Meanwhile, the elites at the top are going to keep tightening their grip on power,

475
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,960
bringing us closer and closer to a 1984 future. I mean for starters we've already talked about

476
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,800
the great recess, but this is only the tip of the iceberg here. Because right now it's becoming

477
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,360
very clear that corporate elites will keep pushing their elites as fake leftism on the masses,

478
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,600
or to maintain control of the world order. I mean we're already seeing this in the west,

479
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,600
with huge companies like PayPal's recent announcements on handing out fines for quotes

480
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,480
misinformation. Or like MasterCard's carbon fees, where their new credit card cuts people off for

481
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,040
exceeding carbon emission levels. All while oil companies make record profits, but can't find

482
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,440
the money to fix their pipelines and stop massive oil leaks. However the most disturbing part of

483
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,960
this is the new idea of CBDCs, one of the most odious forms of corporate control. And so if

484
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,280
corporations and financial institutions manage to purse the idea into the mainstream, it will

485
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,920
eventually give the banks and governments greater control over people's lives. It's digital currency,

486
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,160
but controlled centrally through the banks, Bank of England. So instead of having a bank account

487
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,360
with whatever HSBC or Bank of America, you'll have a bank account directly within the American

488
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:04,080
context with the Fed, in the UK directly with the Bank of England. You have a personal bank account

489
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,920
and you're given digital money in that bank account. These are called central banking digital

490
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,720
currencies. Because a centralized bank digital currency means that the government then has full

491
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,440
control of the money and so that everything you spend it on is tracked by the government. And with

492
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,920
one push of a button, they will be able to cut off your funds entirely, all for saying the wrong

493
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,400
thing. And this will then paralyze you, leaving you at the government's mercy. And this has also

494
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,880
response to the rise of crypto. And yes, crypto may be a paradise for scam artists. The crypto world

495
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,880
does also offer currency out of the government's control, which is a massive threat for the growing

496
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,640
control in Western society and is something that can't be accepted by the elite in this

497
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,040
transitional period. Now obviously in 1984, the party and big brother are far more advanced in

498
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,800
their efforts to control the people. But then again, all the ingredients for their kind of tyranny

499
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,800
in our own world are already present. They won't need to torture and indoctrinate people in the

500
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,520
way the party does. It's much more subtle than this. It's just a small shift in the habitus.

501
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,000
But eventually the end result is the same, complete acceptance of big brother's control.

502
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,640
And that's why during his torture, Winston begins to disassociate and hallucinates being in a grass

503
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,200
field, along with O'Brien. O'Brien states that Winston is one of them. And under significant

504
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,080
illusion, Winston says that he loves O'Brien, who suddenly turns into Julia. He still isn't

505
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,040
broken down yet. His love for Julia is still there. But just as this happens, the image of Julia is

506
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,440
shot, and Winston awakens back in his cell, where he is delusionally talking to himself.

507
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,200
Winston then snaps back to reality after being met with O'Brien once more.

508
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,840
O'Brien then asks Winston what he thinks of big brother, and Winston responds that he hates him.

509
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,840
This comes to the distaste of O'Brien, who states that it's not enough to obey big brother,

510
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,920
but in fact you must love him. So O'Brien escorts Winston to room 101. Room 101 is a torture chamber,

511
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,080
where the worst things in the world awaits his prisoners. A specialized room that houses the

512
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,880
victim's worst phobias. Winston is then strapped to a chair, and starts experiencing the horrors

513
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,040
of room 101. Now throughout the movie, we've seen that Winston is deathly afraid of rats.

514
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,960
He's dreamt about them, and he associates them with his tragic past. And O'Brien knows about

515
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,080
this, and he's going to exploit it to finally eradicate Winston's desire to resist. And so in

516
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,520
room 101, we see a compartmental cage filled with rats, with a set of two doors that is attached

517
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,000
to Winston's face. O'Brien then threatens him, and opens the first door, letting the rats out

518
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,920
within inches of Winston's face. And after what could have been months or years of this torture,

519
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,480
this is the last draw. And it's here that Winston loses his final bit of humanity,

520
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,200
as he pleads with O'Brien to do it to Julia, to finally put the woman that he loves the most

521
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,080
through the same unbearable punishment. It's the final betrayal, and what seals Winston's fate as

522
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:38,000
a broken puppet of the party. O'Brien is finally satisfied. Winston has been completely broken.

523
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,240
Sometime later, Winston is released, and we then transition to the Chestnut Tree Cafe,

524
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,480
where Winston awaits at a chessboard. Julia arrives, but they're both apathetic. They've

525
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,320
been changed forever, and after their betrayals, they don't really love each other anymore.

526
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,160
They only love Big Brother. And just as Winston makes a comment on thought crime,

527
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,560
Julia then excuses herself with a half hearted,

528
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,760
You must meet again.

529
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,400
to which Winston apathetically agrees to. We are then shown Winston on public television,

530
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,560
embellishing his supposed crimes, along with admitting to crimes he didn't commit,

531
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,880
such as poisoning the water supply, and guiding rocket bombs onto airstrip 1 through coded radio

532
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,880
signals. Eventually, Winston charges himself as guilty on all counts,

533
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
labelling himself a victim of Goldstein's influence.

534
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,720
We are then shown him alone at the cafe, fiddling with the chessboard. Using the dust on the table,

535
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,520
Winston then writes 2 plus 2 equals 4 on the countertop, and grabs a night piece just as

536
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,360
another announcement is made on the television. And that's when we are then shown a final shot

537
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:36,960
of Winston gazing longingly into a picture of Big Brother. He then turns away with tears in his eyes,

538
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,840
and says, I love you, as the credits roar.

539
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,760
But then this brings up the question, how can we avoid a situation like this,

540
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,760
where people are nothing more than just mindless individuals becoming statistics on a government

541
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,560
database? How can we avoid being just another loveless depressed, nihilistic cog in an uncaring

542
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,320
machine? Well, I'd love to tell you that the answer is simple. I'd love to say that the solution

543
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,480
is just waking up at 4am, having a cold shower and going to the gym. I'd love to say it's

544
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,640
hiding away in the middle of the forest. I'd love to say it's money, or a Tony Robbins lecture.

545
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,520
I'd love to say it's as easy as buying a $3,000 dropshipping course and escaping the matrix,

546
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,080
driving a Lambo in the palm. But let's be real here, this doesn't actually do anything. By

547
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,560
themselves, these are all great things to make you have an easier life. Self-improvement is vital,

548
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,040
and it's incredibly lacking in modern society, but it doesn't really change the world that you live

549
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,600
in. It only changes yourself, but it doesn't change the system that put you where you are today.

550
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,920
It doesn't change your values, the values of your associates, friends and family. It doesn't

551
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,640
change the why behind all of this self-improvement stuff. Why should you improve your life? Why

552
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,200
should you seek freedom? Why should you even care about Big Brother? If life is just so cruel,

553
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,840
hopeless, depressing and empty, then why bother chasing rewards from that system when the system

554
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,800
itself is so demented? Well, trust me when I say that the solution to all of this is just so much

555
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,240
deeper than you've ever been told. And to understand why, we need to go back 3,000 years in time to one

556
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,040
of the earliest philosophical texts in human history, a text that has transcended time, culture and

557
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,360
religion, a text known as the Book of Job. Now, for those who don't know, the book is a thought

558
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,280
provoking and complex piece on God, giving direction on the meaning of life in the face of

559
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,840
overwhelming nihilism. You see, the story centers around a wealthy and righteous man named Job,

560
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,760
who is living a comfortable and prosperous life. However, in short, Satan challenges

561
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,600
God's assertion that Job was righteous, suggesting that he is only faithful because

562
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,680
of his good fortune. So God agrees to allow Satan to test Job's faith by taking away his

563
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,880
possessions, his family and his health. This causes immense suffering for Job, but Job refuses

564
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,120
to curse God or renounce his faith. However, he does struggle to understand why he is suffering,

565
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,120
and he moans about the injustice of his situation. As almost all of us would,

566
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,120
he questions why God would allow such terrible things to happen to a righteous person like

567
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,160
himself. He's forced to go through various trials and tribulations. Job is tested to his core,

568
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,240
which forces him to grow through a journey of his self. Job's friends who come to comfort him

569
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,000
offer him traditional explanations for his suffering. They suggest that he must have sinned

570
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,160
and that his suffering is just a punishment from God, that he's a bad guy who deserves it.

571
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,960
But Job rejects all these simple explanations, insisting that he is not sinned and demands an

572
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,880
audience with God to plead his case. Eventually, this whole book culminates in God's response to

573
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,520
Job's demands. God speaks to Job from a whirlwind and challenges him to consider the vastness and

574
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,400
complexity of the natural world, asking Job if he can even comprehend the mysteries of the universe,

575
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,120
and Job humbly acknowledges his own limitations. As God tells him that he made all these terrible

576
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,920
elements of society and nature, he made the universe, and all of the badness in the universe

577
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,480
is God's creation. And so God's response to Job is how dare you question any of these things?

578
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,880
As these challenges put on Job are just tests of his ethical ability, they're essential for

579
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,080
Job to evolve and grow as a person, just like it is for us. You see, I'm not even religious here,

580
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,720
but the terrible parts of nature and society that God has supposedly created are only noticed with

581
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,760
consciousness. Like Job being aware of losing his family fortunes in the future he could have had,

582
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,600
and then the results in suffering from it that has come from his consciousness. And then you see

583
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:00,080
when we are unconscious like animals, we are always in the present unaware of true reality.

584
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,640
But as consciousness emerged in humans, we became more and more aware of the dark realities around

585
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,560
us. Reality is like the horrors of death and human suffering, and it's with these dark,

586
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,280
soul-crushing realities that we have an impulse to return to unconsciousness, and we do this through

587
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,840
instant gratification in empty pursuits, like never maturing, choosing to be ignorant, drugs,

588
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,840
alcohol, and terminally living online. These are just some of the things that we use to cope with

589
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,240
the real world and the pain that comes with it. But Cole Young suggested that what the book of Job

590
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,120
tells us about our own life is that to escape the horrors of man, Job and you watching this needed

591
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,600
to become more conscious, as consciousness was actually the true solution to all of this. As by

592
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,080
being more and more conscious of reality, it allows you to elevate above it, because all the burdens

593
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,960
and pain of life are just a necessary process to make you a whole person. To be a good person,

594
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,920
to build a great civilization, you have to face these trials and tribulations. You need to be

595
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,480
more aware, more thoughtful of all the evil in the world, to be a better person, to be strong in

596
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,640
the face of evil. You need to be strong in the face of all the devastating facts of life, of the

597
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,040
derangement of the elites, and the degeneracy of the society around you. You should never avoid all

598
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,960
the terrible thoughts and events confronting you. You should never ignore all the pain, suffering,

599
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,720
and nihilism being thrown at you by our corrupt society. As Young famously said,

600
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,560
that which you most need will be found where you least want to look. And that's why instead of

601
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,800
following your bliss that modern culture tells you to, you need to instead follow your blisters,

602
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,600
for a true awakening. And so with all of this in mind, Job then finally understood that God was

603
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,400
there to build order from chaos, because here's the embodiment of evolution and growth. While on

604
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,880
the surface you may just view this as some basic religious story, the actual meaning to the story

605
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,960
is deeply profound, and provides a perfect solution to the problem of 1984 and our own modern world.

606
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,880
You see the whole point of this, the whole point of why this text has transcended thousands of

607
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,200
years of history. The reason it's been studied by millions of scholars is for a reason. The writers

608
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,080
use the story as an allegory of the spirit of individual growth, and thus the whole of human

609
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,200
civilization. God in this instance is the analogy for the spirit of meaning growth and human potential,

610
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,120
the spirit that generates human culture. And that's why throughout all religions of mankind,

611
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,040
God has been above the culture, as he is the spirit of it. And there's a reason this is so

612
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,720
important to understand. I'm not trying to convert you to any religion here, this is just a very

613
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,640
necessary foundation to understand the solution to all of this subversion and control of the big

614
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,040
brother. You see this whole story is one of faith in the face of adversity, of trusting in your

615
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,600
mind and intuition. And that's why God, the spirit of growth and potential, is revealed to us through

616
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,000
the actions we undertake in our life. This is why prayer is a key element of all religions.

617
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,040
And I'm not talking about the kind of prayer where you ask for something and God automatically

618
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,360
gives you it. Prayer is not a vending machine. The idea of true prayer is saying the problem and

619
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,920
then changing who you are, so that God treats you differently and the problem fades away. You're not

620
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,320
supposed to be the same person before you pray. The prayer is meant to instead act on your mind,

621
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,320
by trusting your intuition and mind to be the better person. And then through your actions,

622
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,800
growth and rewards come to you, which is ultimately the solution to big brother in our modern world,

623
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,040
by trusting your intuition and guts and by being an individual. You know before in the US,

624
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,680
the dignity of the individual was paramount. But now if you notice, this concept is being portrayed.

625
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,920
As Oscar Wilde said, most people now are just other people, their lives are mimicry, their

626
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,400
passions are quotation, which is why you must trust yourself. You must reject big brother. All

627
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,120
the supported authority figures you're meant to believe are liars. They're the worst among us,

628
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,200
and they will lead you to your own destruction. The world you live is not some democratic liberal

629
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,040
utopia where everyone has a piece of the action, where culture and policies determined by all of

630
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,160
us. That is total BS. The priestly cast at the top, big brother, wants to control you. They're not

631
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,320
there to save your soul or fire the spirit up inside of your mind, which is why the more you

632
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,320
follow the narratives and their lifestyle, the more you start to poison yourself. You see,

633
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,480
the reason you're lazy, the reason you have all these bad habits, the reason you never achieve

634
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,960
the life that you want or chase the goals and passion that you believe in, is because you've

635
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,000
been repressed. The meaning and soul of your life has been stripped away from you, making you a cog

636
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,240
in an uncaring machine. Your life is someone else's, where your best years, your character,

637
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,040
creativity and hopes are being stolen from you. And that's why you must insist on your dignity.

638
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,600
You need to free your mind. You must reject all the noise around you and embrace the chaos,

639
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,720
the pain and the sorrow to grow. And if you don't, you become another pawn of big brother. You're

640
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,840
the person who didn't even fight back. You never did anything to go against the system poisoning

641
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,920
your life, too passive to actually care what's happening to you and the people around you.

642
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,360
Is this the life you want to live? Well, for many of us, we're starting to see the rejection of all

643
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,040
of this, because as we enter the age of Western civilization collapsing, with the government

644
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,800
trying to control us more and people becoming more atomized, depressed and lonelier than ever,

645
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,960
we're now starting to see antibodies being produced to overcome the societal disease.

646
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,720
We're seeing more and more people rejecting the values of our twisted habitus, of all the

647
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,600
bullshit fed to you by big brother. The pendulum towards individualism is swinging back. And that's

648
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,080
why when I see this rise in self-improvement, this rise in individualism, when I see all these big

649
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,000
political changes happening in the world, it just shows to me that the new world order is on the

650
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,360
horizon. The spirit of growth is nearing. A spirit of dignity, empowerment and hope for young men.

651
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,840
The hope that our culture has killed and used against us. And so after millions of successfully

652
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,240
lived lives throughout all periods of history, the challenge to grow now passes on to you.

653
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,400
You will determine the future of the next generation. Your mind determines the direction of

654
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,320
everything. So don't just give it up for some sick cultural narratives. Giving your genius to

655
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,120
the worst among us. You should act without regret. Follow the path in front of you and take back

656
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:21,040
control of your mind. I want to tell you about something I've been working on this past month.

657
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,960
You see, I've built something that I legitimately think will change your life. Because you see,

658
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,440
from most of your life, you've always been fed a constant stream of lies. Lies that have poisoned

659
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,680
your value systems, purpose and passion in life, whilst also poisoning the community around you.

660
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,400
And it's why you feel so lazy, so meaningless, so lonely. And so it's time that we've come up with

661
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,960
real solutions. Not just modern day BS solutions. I'm talking about a new form of community. A

662
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,040
way for us to take back control of our lives. Where I will go deep into the real solutions,

663
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,200
answers and value systems of thousands of philosophers, consents into an easy to understand

664
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,920
package. All to help you improve your life. All at no cost to you. I will send you a weekly essay

665
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,440
on the solutions to the problems we discuss on this channel. So just click on the link in the

666
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,680
description and I will email the name down below.
