0	3920	Charlie D'Amelio, Alison Rae, Zach King, Bella Porch and MrBeast.
3920	7600	Right now, these social media stars are the most popular celebrities in the world.
7600	12000	They use TikTok to provide us endless hours of seemingly harmless, bite-sized entertainment,
12000	13920	and they're making an insane living doing so.
13920	17440	But what if I told you that these people were unknowingly involved
17440	21920	in one of the most sinister geopolitical conspiracies the world has ever seen?
21920	22720	Let me explain.
22720	26800	It's no secret that TikTok is currently the driving force behind popular culture in the West.
26800	30640	Every popularized song, meme, style, trend, development and slang can be traced back to
30640	34480	TikTok in some shape or form, because everyone you know is consuming its content.
34480	37920	With all other social media platforms that were once the cusp of every trend and development
37920	42240	in internet culture have now seemingly fallen behind the curve, and TikTok has taken the mantle,
42240	45360	amassing over 1 billion current active users around the world,
45360	47600	80 million of which are in the United States alone,
47600	50000	and with its growing hold over Generation Z in particular,
50000	53280	it might be obvious why TikTok is growing to be a trendsetting powerhouse.
53280	56160	And when you think about it, the youth are really the arbiters of popular culture,
56160	60560	and so by providing a platform in which the youth can dictate content rapidly and instantaneously,
60560	62960	means the set platform now dictates popular culture.
62960	66320	And although it's just one country, popular culture in the United States is extremely
66320	68640	important. It's a pay-setter for the Western world,
68640	72160	what becomes popular in the United States quickly becomes popular everywhere else.
72160	76480	And this is what makes TikTok and its most followed individuals extremely powerful,
76480	79760	with the app mixing and homogenizing the world's entire culture.
79760	84320	This process will only accelerate as the average TikTok user spends over an hour and a half on
84320	89440	the app every single day, and 60% of TikTok users are from Generation Z.
89440	93920	And as I'm sure you're all aware, TikTok has bled into everyday life on such an unprecedented
93920	98800	scale, meaning that by now, it has an immeasurable impact on people's culture and their personal
98800	103920	lives. Now at first glance, popular TikTokers like MrBeast, Alison Rae, Zach King are just simply
103920	108080	the youth driving cultures they always have, making fun and entertaining videos to be consumed
108080	112080	and shared by the masses, creating trends that attract existing celebrities and people of order
112080	116080	generations who fear being left out or left behind. However, what if I told you that it's
116080	120560	not exactly Gen C or influencers who are at the wheel driving popular culture at all,
120560	125040	and maybe instead the wheel is being tightly gripped by the white-knockled hands of a fascist
125040	128560	government in a country that is one of the greatest threats to the United States.
128560	132800	To understand what I mean by this, we first need to understand how TikTok came to be.
132800	137680	Q Bydance, founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, the Beijing tech company Bydance began working on
137680	141280	an algorithm that would change the world, and this algorithm was perfectly designed to
141280	145600	predict its users by feeding them short-form content rapidly, analyzing their viewing habits
145600	149600	and carefully creating their intake to keep them consuming for as long as possible. After all,
149600	153520	in the modern world, attention equals currency, but how is this seemingly random Chinese company
153520	157120	going to implement the world's most advanced algorithm that the world has ever seen?
157120	162080	Well, the start in 2017, when Bydance acquired the Shanghai-based social media startup Musically.
162080	165760	Through Musically's app, users could create 15-second to one-minute music videos with their
165760	169440	lips synced to popular songs and interacted with their communities, and Bydance saw the
169440	173600	value in combining this with the score-focused interface of their existing property Flippagram
173600	177360	to create what we now know as TikTok. Bydance had already seen the success of Vine, and they
177360	181760	understood the power of these bite-sized videos, and by mixing all of these apps together, Bydance
181760	186160	was developing the perfect algorithm, and with its user-generated content now being rapidly fed
186160	190400	in scottable bite-sized pieces to the masses, TikTok became the perfect avenue for aspiring
190400	195360	creators and influencers, providing anyone anywhere the opportunity to go viral like no one has ever
195360	199360	seen. Bydance tested out the formula in China first, attracting both content consumers and
199440	203920	content creators in the span of just a couple of months, and soon the app took over the entirety
203920	208400	of China, and that is when the Chinese government saw an incredible opportunity. But it's important
208400	212560	you understand who the Chinese government really is. The Chinese Communist Party, or otherwise known
212560	218000	as the CCP, has governed China since 1949, rising to power under leader Mao Zedong after a bruisedy
218000	221680	forced civil war. Their mastery over the use of propaganda tactics to capture the minds of the
221680	225600	people proved to be one of the most critical aspects of their success. With Mao Zedong,
225600	230080	heavily emphasizing the importance of controlling the culture to control the population. In his
230080	235360	great cultural revolution, Mao specifically focused his propaganda on certain idols, people who stood
235360	240240	as examples of socialist heroes. Lei Feng and Dongkang Ru were model soldiers who lived and
240240	244560	died for their devotion to the state and its leader. Alongside these idols came mass censorship,
244560	248640	state-controlled media and the creation of imperialist enemies in the west. And since Mao,
248640	252800	the CCP has always cracked down on liberalization, returning to the traditional ways of thought
252800	257440	control and censorship. And with that the CCP employed a variety of propaganda techniques
257440	261280	including control of the media, and more specifically the construction of role models
261280	265520	to be emulated by the Chinese youth. Now it's very important to remember this point later on.
266080	269520	Anyway, fast forward to the current day, where the CCP has become one of the most successful
269520	273120	dictatorships the world has ever seen, standing as the second largest political party in the
273120	277360	world, with more than 96 million members under current leader Xi Jinping. His totalitarian
277360	281760	government has sought to control every aspect of modern life. First they offer the carrot,
281760	285840	the impoverished masses are offered a promise they can escape poverty and hardship if they work
285840	289840	just hard enough for the state. Cut through state exams with incredibly high fail rates,
289840	293840	ensure this dream only becomes true for a few. And in return for this opportunity,
293840	297440	citizens are then expected to swallow the propaganda, accept the status quo,
297440	301920	and stay out of the way of the ruling party. Which is why every part of communist Chinese culture
301920	305920	is so strictly controlled to keep this narrative going. Social media, television, the news,
305920	309760	entertainment, all of it is passed through the CCP's great filter. If you don't swallow the
309760	314720	propaganda and play along, you end up in jail. Or in one of China's re-education camps, Mao could
314720	319120	only have dreamed of the control that the CCP now has over his country. And the total control of
319120	323600	culture that Mao's done once stressed so heavily is still so strong. With extreme surveillance
323600	328080	monitoring and data gathering to create profiles in citizens, the CCP can then assign a social
328080	332800	credit score to each individual. This allows them to do two things. It incentivises their citizens
332800	337120	to behave and effectively predicts the future in regards to those who will likely disobey.
337120	341360	The other major facet of the CCP's control is enforced legislation that limits the influence
341360	345680	of foreign media and access to the internet. Through these methods, the Chinese government
345680	350160	is creating citizens that are both more efficient economically and more obedient politically than
350160	354480	those of foreign nations, consolidating its position as the world's global superpower.
354480	358320	And this leads on to something very important. When Xi Jinping was first elected in 2012,
358320	362560	he ran on the promise of the Chinese Dream, described as the great rejuvenation of the
362560	367920	Chinese nation by the hundredth anniversary of when the CCP was founded, 2049. And this 2049
367920	372480	plan hinders on a series of five-year economic plans to ensure China will become the dominant
372480	376720	global superpower. But to achieve such heights globally, Xi Jinping and the CCP would have to
376720	381120	find a way to not only strengthen its own position, but weaken the position of competing nations.
381120	384800	And the way to do this would be to enact the same sort of cultural control they have achieved
384800	388800	within China over the rest of the world. And so with this context out of the way, it becomes
388800	393600	very clear the value of TikTok, an app that is acutely engineered for growth and popularity,
393600	397600	with one of the most advanced algorithms the world has ever seen that is constantly collecting data
397600	401920	on the global population. And so it shouldn't be surprised to find out that the Chinese government
401920	406000	always had a plan for buy-dancing TikTok. In the short term, the app would be a tool to collect
406000	409600	data on foreign citizens, building profiles around them that mirrored the existing social
409600	414400	credit scores within China. And in the long term, it would become key to infiltrating popular culture
414400	418320	around the world. But you may be thinking, well, a government making efforts to influence the culture
418320	422560	of foreign nations really isn't anything new. And to be fair, this is a relatively common practice.
422560	426000	Perhaps the most obvious examples of this are when governments with countless human rights
426000	430720	violations use investment groups to buy controlling stakes in sport. When countries like Qatar or the
430720	434800	United Arab Emirates buy their way into a European football club, they will then elevate the success
434800	439440	and status of that club through excessive spending. And by doing this, they legitimize these countries,
439440	444240	it normalizes these kingdoms, and creates a fan base that is in theory loyal to defending these
444240	449280	countries. However, this approach does backfire. It's often too obvious. By making such a public
449280	453440	splash on the world stage through investment, you're opening yourself up to widespread critique,
453440	456960	as sports is a heavily scrutinized and discussed industry around the world.
456960	461280	And the Chinese Communist Party actually knows this, which is why in 2017, coincidentally when
461280	466000	TikTok was first launched, that the CCP forced Chinese businesses to sell their ownership stakes
466000	470560	in European football clubs citing that these clubs offer nothing in return for their investment.
470640	475200	Instead, the CCP prefers a more subtle approach to foreign public relations. For years now,
475200	479120	they've been using their control over media and technology companies through things like Tencent
479120	483680	and Hawaii to get fingers in the pie of Western culture. And this is no secret, almost all world
483680	487840	governments know about this, as the Shenzhen-based company Tencent is one of the highest-grossing
487840	492480	media companies in the world, with investments in major cultural pillars such as the NBA,
492480	497200	Reddit, Spotify, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard. And the Chinese government-run Tencent
497200	500720	has used these ties to silence and limit the reach of discourse surrounding the genocide
500720	504720	being carried out by the Chinese state, censoring any information about the Muslim
504720	508960	Uyghur population being sent to concentration camps and the resulting protests in Beijing.
508960	512640	And Hawaii's know better, documents have confirmed around the world that their consumer
512640	516400	and business-facing surveillance products have been providing information to the Chinese government
516400	520400	on an unprecedented level. And this is what's so effective about Chinese propaganda,
520400	523680	because coming back to the sports example, Qatar spent hundreds of billions on their
523680	527520	propaganda World Cup, only to see some of their image abroad worse and considerably.
527520	531920	However, with China, they've been able to stay under the radar and quietly buy influence in other
531920	536400	areas, and have seen all the benefits with very few drawbacks compared to countries like Qatar,
536400	540320	and they very effectively use Tencent to suppress any foreign support for Hong Kong.
540320	544480	In fact, there's a very good reason you've probably never heard of this. For example, in 2019,
544480	549920	the president of the Philadelphia 76ers spoke out against China, and so Tencent stopped airing
549920	554080	their games. And the clubs saw a significant portion of their revenue disappear, and were
554080	557840	forced to make a public apology. And there's just so many countless incidents of this I
557840	562000	could go on forever. But all of these incidents portray a much grander plan. By buying these
562000	566480	investments in Western companies, China has suddenly gained the ability to sway public opinion,
566480	570880	censor critics abroad. The solution here seems obvious, and you may be wondering why the Western
570880	574640	world hasn't sought to limit China's ability to interfere with their media and technology
574640	578320	infrastructure. In the same way they've done for other hostile governments such as North Korea's
578320	582480	Russia's. And the answer becomes clear when you take a closer look at the relationship China has
582480	587920	cultivated with the Western world. You see, China has done a very effective job at projecting the
587920	591440	image of being a somewhat liberalized nation to the eyes of the Western world.
595440	599680	Furthermore, TikTok is reportedly willing to share more of its algorithm to avoid being banned in
599680	603920	US states. According to this article published by the Wushi Journal, TikTok tries to win allies in
603920	608160	the US with more transparency in response to the ban on US government-issued devices.
608320	612480	In the new proposed arrangement, US third party monitors would check for video recommendation
612480	616480	algorithms to detect whether it has been manipulated or if the Chinese government or other foreign
616480	620720	actors have had access. And speaking of propaganda or media censorship, let's take a look at how
620720	625360	this is being covered by other media outlets by using ground news, which I use to research topics
625360	629360	like this. It's interesting to see that the Wall Street Journal was the first article to pick up
629360	634000	the story, and that most of the sources reporting on it are from the US. We can see the Washington
634000	639680	Examiner headlines the story as TikTok opening nearly $1.5 billion proposal to accommodate US
639680	644640	regulators. The evening standard, as TikTok offers to share algorithm details in a bid to swerve US
644640	649680	ban and the New York Post, TikTok offers to have third party monitoring if China spies on US users.
649680	653760	It's also interesting to see that all of these sources are from right-leaning outlets, making
653760	658240	the story a huge blind spot for readers, reading left-leaning outlets, and that of these sources,
658240	663120	33% are owned by media conglomerates. And today you can check out the story at ground.news.com
664000	667920	to read more about it and subscribe to see all the features that are used to avoid bias in the
667920	671920	media. Comparing the language used in each headline, we can get an idea of how language and the media
671920	675920	can be used to shape our understanding of a story, and from this, that the Chinese company is keeping
675920	679360	in line with portraying an image of alliance to keep them from getting banned in the US.
681120	685600	Since the 70s, the CCP's leaders have maintained appearances and played nice with the leaders
685600	690640	of global superpowers, all in an effort to ensure national security and economic growth.
690640	694320	And this has allowed the public to see their leaders shaking hands with the likes of Mao Zedong
694320	699440	or sharing a drink with Xi Jinping, and it humanizes the CCP. China wasn't seen as unfavorable by a
699440	704720	majority of Americans until recently in 2018, and this is exactly the same time that TikTok
704720	709600	exploded in the US market. And whether this happened by coincidence or planning, TikTok's rise
709600	714400	perfectly coincided with the beginning of the second stage of China's foreign policy, aggression.
714400	718720	After years of making friends, China has also been making deals. Along with their companies
718720	723040	buying parts of the Western economy, China has also moved to consolidate power over global trade
723040	728160	itself. By buying out around 100 ports in 60 different countries, China has taken its grip on
728160	732800	vital global infrastructure. In fact, by this point, China's almost colonized Africa. But then
732800	737600	the trade wars began, relations severely worsened between the two global superpowers, and that's
737600	742800	when propaganda in China started to worsen towards the US, with China now framing the West as an
742800	747120	open enemy. But during this time, the West seemingly had much bigger things to worry about.
747120	750880	The Western world was focused on Russia in the Middle East, all while the Chinese government
750880	755360	was positioning itself perfectly. But then what was this for exactly? And what does the Chinese
755360	759200	government have to gain from their publicity efforts? Well, it's not just freedom to exert
759200	764480	economic or cultural influence, those are just a means to an end. So then what's the end? Well,
764480	770800	the end goal is the scariest part of all of this. The truth is that right now, China is preparing
771440	777600	China has a defence budget of over 270 billion US dollars, and that number is steadily increasing
777600	781600	with each year, with the Chinese government reportedly restructuring and ramping up their
781600	786160	recruitment, promotion and paying centres for military personnel. There's also news of the
786160	790240	Chinese military making lucrative offers to former officers of the British Air Force,
790240	795120	all in an effort to bolster training methods. And although China hasn't yet initiated conflict,
795120	798800	all signs point to it being a matter of time. I mean, you don't have to look very far into this
798800	802320	to realise that the Chinese government has set their sights on Taiwan. There's a reason the
802320	806640	Chinese government is threatening use of force if the peaceful consolidation of the two nations
806640	811040	cannot be achieved. And to demonstrate this, China has been practicing invading. They've literally
811040	816080	held combat drills in the air and sea around Taiwan two times in the past month, preparing to
816080	821040	storm the presidential building in Taiwan, which China claims this is all to resolutely counter
821040	826160	provocative actions of external forces and Taiwan independent separist forces. But again,
826240	830640	why is China doing this? What is the end goal here? Why do they want to absorb Taiwan?
830640	834960	Well, there are many reasons, but one stands out in particular, and that being trade,
834960	839840	one of the key pillars behind China's global dominance. Because Taiwan's GDP was estimated
839840	846000	to now be over $800 billion in 2022, with its two largest expo partners being China and the US.
846000	849840	This is not to mention the increasing global demand for advanced semiconductors,
849840	854160	one of the most vital parts of the whole world's technology industry. Without this,
854160	858640	you won't have your laptops, phones, all of the world's technological infrastructure relies on this.
858640	863600	And it turns out that Taiwan is home to 90% of semiconductors. And not to mention it's been
863600	868240	reported that nearly half the demand for these semiconductors is from the United States. Not
868240	873280	only this, but Taiwan was always a part of China's 2049 plan. They were never supposed to break away
873280	878400	from China. It's been a stain on the CCP's rule since their independence. All Chinese leaders have
878400	882880	set their eyes on reunifying with Taiwan, and it's just a matter of time until this happens.
882960	887920	China is also facing a crisis in the country. People are protesting the CCP's authoritarian
887920	891920	regime. They're sick of the lockdowns, they're sick of the surveillance, and China needs a
891920	896240	distraction right now. And what better time than when the West is distracted by Ukraine?
896240	900640	And so it should be clear the very real possibility of a war between China and Taiwan,
900640	904560	which would inevitably involve the United States. And in this case, although the United
904560	909440	States has no official diplomatic duty to help Taiwan, it would very much be to their advantage.
909440	914080	In fact, this is pivotal. If they don't do this, the United States is ceding all their power to
914080	918320	China. And so with this in mind, we start to understand why the Chinese government cares
918320	923040	so much about TikTok. It's the most dominant social media platform in the United States.
923040	927840	And by having full control of TikTok, this will control the narrative behind any future tensions
927840	931840	between the two countries. Because more and more we find out that social media has the
931840	935760	ultimate power to influence political opinion. And this power has been amplified in the United
935760	940240	States during recent years. I mean, skepticism of traditional media sources has reached an all-time
940240	944720	high. And this is for a very good reason. Mainstream news has led the mass slip in recent years,
944720	948640	and it's become increasingly clear that the sources who were once most trusted by society
948640	953040	simply exist as propaganda outlets for billionaires, or to increase the profits of the investors
953040	957680	that they represent. Noam Chonsky and analyst academics have talked about this. The traditional
957680	962000	news media in America bends facts in the name of entertainment, capitalizing off of fear and
962000	965360	creating villains and strawmen amongst the population that they're meant to inform. But
965360	970160	the truth is, this is left a vacuum for truth. Misinformation is everywhere, and social media
970160	974960	simply amplifies it and makes it more difficult to pass through. And this turns into people blindly
974960	979520	trusting and repeating this misinformation, which can make it seem more credible and result in online
979520	984000	echo chambers, which increase division, create siege mentality, and heightens the toxic culture
984000	988240	we've been stuck in. And these social media echo chambers lead to what we saw in 2020,
988240	992960	with massive black lives matter protests ravaging America, and the US capital rights that threaten
992960	997040	American democracy as we know it. But it's in the search for truth that we realize that we've
997040	1001840	been taken advantage of. Foreign agents all around the world are busy licking their lips,
1001840	1006480	through their direct interference in democracy and by perishing agendas in the online space,
1006480	1011040	with foreign dictators and autocracies banning all these social media sites and using them against
1011040	1015120	the West. And whilst the summit might have seemed like Russia was the first regime to take advantage
1015120	1020000	of this, China has been perfecting social media and into their manipulation for years, and the
1020000	1024880	sinister taxes they've used to control their own segregated internet can easily be used abroad.
1024880	1029600	All they needed was control of an online platform. And with its insane growth, TikTok is uniquely
1029600	1034480	positioned to be the most powerful social media platform in the United States, and across the
1034480	1038880	world for the foreseeable future. And not only because of its growth either, TikTok's algorithm
1038880	1043040	is powerfully designed to have these snowballing effects I mentioned. TikTok platforms certain
1043040	1048000	people with ideas deem popular enough and allows them to gain momentum very quickly. We trust TikTok
1048000	1052240	to feel as content that is similar to our interests, even though there's no authority making sure it
1052240	1056800	does so. I mean any TikTok user knows by now that the app is designed to fill hours upon hours of
1056800	1061200	people's daily lives, which inevitably causes them to conflate what they see with their actual
1061200	1065760	environment. And with this in mind, the capacity for users to be psychologically manipulated
1065760	1071200	and ideologically driven on TikTok seems to be a feature and not a bug. And the alarming fact is
1071200	1076480	that by dance and by proxy the Chinese government controls this algorithm entirely, they can create
1076480	1081040	inputs that promote certain videos and limit the reach of others. And these algorithm changes can
1081040	1085520	be subtle, happening overnight and without any sort of official notice. And everybody outside of
1085520	1089680	bite dance, even creators who have seemingly mastered this platform, are then in the dark about how
1089680	1094400	exactly this algorithm works. And this gives the company free license to steer users down certain
1094400	1098640	paths that benefit them and their associates. And let's not forget a point made earlier in the
1098640	1104080	video. TikTok is particularly appealing to a younger or impressionable audience. You may be
1104080	1108400	thinking a possible negative effect on children and teenagers is a flaw of the internet in general
1108400	1113200	and not really specific to TikTok. But TikTok is designed with a pillar of the CCP's original
1113200	1117680	propaganda philosophy in mind, the construction of role models. There's a reason why China's
1117680	1122080	version of TikTok, Douyin, is so different from the version they send to the rest of the world.
1122080	1126880	If you're a child under the age of 14 in China, Douyin shows you the educational videos like
1126880	1131440	science experiments and museum exhibits. With the rest of Chinese TikTok showing hard-working
1131440	1135920	everyday civilians helping their country and sacrificing for the greater communist good.
1135920	1139440	And yet if you're that same child in the United States, TikTok shows you sex,
1139440	1144080	vandalism, crime, social disruption and other Douyin satisfying degenerate clips.
1144080	1148240	And when preteens in the US and China were surveyed, asking what is the most aspirational career
1148240	1153280	they hope to achieve, the number one answer in the US was to be a social media influencer.
1153280	1157520	While in China, it was to be an astronaut, which is why it's clear that Mao's old method of
1157600	1160880	creating idols has been turned on his head and used as a weapon.
1160880	1165120	And they make their domestic version a spinach version of TikTok,
1165120	1167840	while they've shipped the opium version to the rest of the world.
1167840	1172080	What China uses to unify their population culturally is now being used to sow descent
1172080	1175520	and weaken the population of the West. And it's evident that the role models that
1175520	1180000	generations he is exposed to almost always come from TikTok. But it's not just the idea that
1180000	1184160	these TikTokers have social influence that makes them so useful to the CCP, it's the idea that
1184240	1188640	they have economic influence. In just over four years since its launch in the United States,
1188640	1193280	TikTok has become its own industry. Individuals are making their entire incomes on TikTok.
1193280	1197840	Mainstream celebrities are now using TikTok to maintain relevancy and revive their careers.
1197840	1201840	Major companies are now hiring entire teams of people solely dedicated to TikTok
1201840	1206320	all in order to market their products. And the beauty of TikTok for the CCP is that when the
1206320	1210880	most powerful people in Western society are chasing views on an app that they control,
1210880	1216080	they then control these people. So if people's livelihoods depend directly or even indirectly
1216080	1220160	on how many views they mass on TikTok, they'll create whatever content the algorithm needs them
1220160	1224480	to create. And because of this, the CCP no longer has to buy social media companies,
1224480	1228320	they don't need to buy sports teams, they don't need to be so overt with their propaganda,
1228320	1232480	as they have all the world's most powerful and most influential people in their pocket.
1232480	1236160	And by doing this, they can influence discourse surrounding issues involving China,
1236160	1240560	easily turning a dull to amplify certain voices while silencing others. And those
1240560	1244640	silent voices will either have to fall in line or risk losing their incomes or career.
1253920	1257760	Scorning through a freedom real-time, it may feel like a reach to draw a conclusion that your
1257760	1262240	favorite TikTokers are currently contributing to the propaganda machine of a corrupt foreign
1262240	1267280	government. And that's because they're not, at least not yet. The videos in TikTok for the most
1267280	1271040	part are entertaining, harmless and fun. Your favorite TikTokers probably provide you with
1271040	1275600	comedy, art, knowledge, and community at no monetary cost to you. And in turn, they get a
1275600	1279920	platform and outlet in a fulfilling career. So it seems like a win-win. And on the surface,
1279920	1284240	it seems like there's very little reason to distrust the app. But this iteration of TikTok
1284240	1289200	is the before picture of the Trojan horse. The global version of TikTok being consumed outside
1289200	1294480	of China is currently operating within a single goal in mind. The CCP is playing a long-term game
1294480	1298480	and to acquire the kind of foothold that will aid them in their goals as being a dominant global
1298480	1303120	superpower, they need users, they need money, they need trust, and they need to maximize its
1303120	1309040	addictiveness. So far, it's working incredibly. In just a couple of years, over 20% of all internet
1309040	1314240	users in the world are now using TikTok on a regular basis. And this percentage is increasing
1314240	1318960	with no signs of slowing down. At this rate, TikTok has the potential to be the ultimate global
1318960	1323600	sleeper agent for the CCP. And almost no one's doing anything about this. And the concern shouldn't
1323600	1327760	be in response to what the CCP and Bite Dancer doing with TikTok at the moment. The concern should
1327760	1331280	be what they can do. You see, we've already established that in the increasingly likely
1331280	1335600	event that China invades Taiwan, the United States will be forced to take the side of Taiwan in order
1335600	1339360	to protect their own trade interests and their geopolitical positioning. But this isn't a
1339360	1342800	certainty. Whilst the war on Ukraine has definitely given China pause for thought,
1342800	1347520	they haven't reduced their aggression at all. Biden has promised that the US would defend Taiwan.
1347600	1351760	Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?
1352240	1355360	Yes. Although it still does seem like China will try their luck,
1355360	1359280	whilst the West is distracted by Ukraine, and it's also the perfect opportunity
1359280	1364320	to regain their own population's trust in the CCP. But in many ways, the war has already started.
1364320	1368000	TikTok and China's other technological expansions are the first move in a growing
1368000	1372560	technological war. Although neither side wants a full-scale physical war, the best wars are
1372560	1376720	thought through the mind. And that's why with TikTok, China might have the perfect way of getting
1376720	1381040	what they want. Using TikTok's power and influence over culture, China could very easily
1381040	1385920	push an anti-war agenda on the site. They could so doubt online about the true nature of the war.
1385920	1389840	They could money the water with misinformation, and influence high-level content creators to
1389840	1394160	speak out against US intervention. I mean, China's already done this with Tibet. They've silenced
1394160	1398560	all the outcries for Tibetan independence. They silenced all the Hong Kong protesters.
1398560	1402640	They silenced all the backlash against the Uighur genocide in China. This is why you don't hear
1402640	1407520	about these massive issues in the world that relate to China, because China controls the algorithm.
1407520	1412400	Just like everything else today, a war to defend Taiwan would become an issue along political lines.
1412400	1416560	Although one of the only issues that Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives
1416560	1421840	have been united on is the growing threat of China. Although this also could change, TikTok could be
1421840	1426080	used to interfere and delay an organized defense of Taiwan, or even stop foreign interference
1426080	1430080	completely. And this is just one of the issues that China would love to change the public's mind on.
1430080	1433520	With TikTok, the CCP will be able to sweep their atrocities under the rug,
1433520	1437120	and further expand their borders and damage the social fabric of their enemies.
1437120	1440880	This is why the United States government now sees TikTok as such a major threat,
1440880	1443680	and it's not just one side of the US political dichotomy either.
1443680	1448160	Current US President Joe Biden has declared his intention to ban TikTok in the United States for
1448160	1452000	good, and has already made headway in banning the use of the app on government devices at the
1452000	1457040	federal and state level. The Biden administration also explicitly cites the known data and security
1457040	1461200	risks surrounding Biden's, as the main driving force behind their push to eventually ban the
1461200	1465840	app on all civilian devices. And these risks surrounding personal data are very real. As
1465840	1470320	recently as June 2022, TikTok employees were cited in the report saying that quote,
1470320	1474480	everything is seen in China, while one director claimed a Beijing-based engineer,
1474480	1479040	referred to as master admin, has access to everything. And this is within their terms of
1479040	1482960	service. When you download and sign up to TikTok, you're accepting this. You're accepting that
1482960	1487280	they can see everything that you do on your phone and online, with some of the most outrageous
1487280	1493200	data collection policies of any social media site. This is from TikTok's privacy policy.
1494000	1499520	It said, we collect certain information about the device you use to access the platform,
1500400	1509040	such as your IP address, user region. This is really crazy. Your screen resolution and operating
1509840	1514960	system, app and file names and types. So all your apps and all your file names,
1514960	1520080	all the things you have filed away on your phone, keystroke patterns or rhythms. So they're monitoring
1520080	1523760	your keystrokes, which means they know every fucking thing you type. Wow. And the thing is,
1523760	1528480	we've already been down this road. Donald Trump actually tried to ban TikTok in the US back in 2019,
1528480	1532240	and yet he failed to get this through. The executive order was signed, but the move was
1532240	1536320	actually blocked. And in 2020, Trump's administration settled for a compromise,
1536320	1541600	instead forcing Bidance to sell a measly 20% ownership stake in TikTok to an American company,
1541600	1546800	with 12.5 going to the tech company Oracle and 7.5 going to department store giant Walmart.
1546800	1551840	Bidance would also have to let Oracle quote, run cloud services and security for TikTok in the US.
1551840	1556560	In response, Bidance swiftly decided to take legal action in the form of lawsuits and filed
1556560	1562480	a preliminary injunction in September 2020, which was actually approved. Bidance used American law
1562480	1566320	to further damage the American nation. And it should be telling that banning TikTok is a
1566320	1571200	priority to both Democrats and Republicans. Both sides agree on this, and yet still hasn't gone
1571200	1575280	through. But with the Biden administration's latest declaration of intent, the discourse has
1575280	1579680	already started, and those with vested interest in simply perpetuating the discourse itself.
1579680	1584720	And unfortunately, the precedent for government successfully banning TikTok is basically non-existent.
1584720	1589040	Outside of countries with strict censorship laws, only India has achieved a nationwide ban on the
1589040	1592960	app. At this point for the United States and the rest of the Western world, the question becomes
1592960	1597440	whether or not TikTok is already so entwined with our culture that its removal will be impossible.
1597440	1601520	But it should be clear to all of you who have watched so far that TikTok is one of the greatest
1601520	1614800	geopolitical weapons the world has ever seen. And thank you to Ground News for kindly sponsoring this video.
