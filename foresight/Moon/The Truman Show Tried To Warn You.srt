1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The Truman Show is one of my favourite movies.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,480
It's incredibly rare for a film to be as funny, cohesive,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,040
beautifully paced and rich in detail as The Truman Show.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,760
However, it's even rarer for a movie to go beyond this

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,640
and give accurate, prophetic insights about the world.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,440
20 years later, and The Truman Show's allegorical message

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,800
is more relevant than ever.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
But the only way we can truly understand its meaning

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,240
is by diving into the story.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
The film begins with a monologue from Kristoff,

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,320
who sets up the main premise of the movie.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,960
Truman is the unwitting star of a reality TV show

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,160
centred around his life.

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,960
Truman, a child abandoned at birth, has been brought up

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,720
to believe that he is a normal guy living

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,720
in the idyllic town of Seahaven Island.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,880
However, Truman's entire world is a lie.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
All the people he knows, including his mother,

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,600
his best friend and his wife, are all paid actors.

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,320
Seahaven Island is also fake, and is in reality

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,560
just a huge setting close by a massive dome.

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,800
This gives Kristoff, the director of The Truman Show,

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,040
almost complete control over Truman's world.

24
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,120
This ranges from the ability to control the weather

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,680
to the day-night cycle and even the stars in the sky.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,080
Truman's every moment is broadcast around the world.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
With extra funding from the show coming from product placement.

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
From the start of the film, we see a camera implanted

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
in Truman's bathroom mirror, where Truman is pretending

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
to be an explorer whilst getting ready for work.

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,080
It's as though this is just another regular day for Truman,

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
with him saying hello to his neighbors,

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
making a coffee and getting into his car.

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,040
But just as he's getting into his car,

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
a stage slide drops from the sky,

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
right onto the road outside of his house.

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,640
Truman then walks over to inspect the light

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,560
and sees that it says Sirius on it,

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
referring to the brightest star in the night sky.

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,080
But eerily, on his drive to work,

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
the radio starts to run a story about a plane wreckage

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,280
falling from the sky in order to explain the light.

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,880
Here's a news flash just then,

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
an aircraft in trouble began shitting parts

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,760
as it flew over to see him in just a few moments ago.

46
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,840
It then starts to talk about the dangers of flying,

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
which is one of the first of many subtle ways

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
that Krystal tries to influence Truman

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,120
into staying on the island through fear.

50
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,520
He is being subconsciously controlled by the radio.

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,400
This subconscious manipulation then continues throughout the film.

52
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
Like when Truman is asked by his boss

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,160
to deal with something that will require a boat trip.

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
By doing this, the boss is setting up Truman's aquaphobia

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,280
as we see he is unable to even get in the boat,

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
a phobia that's later revealed

57
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,200
to be another subconscious manipulation of Truman.

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,960
This whole day feels very strange for Truman,

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
so he hurriedly comes back to his wife, Meryl,

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,200
who then conspicuously shows off her new kitchen tool

61
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,480
that she bought at the store,

62
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,960
showing it off almost like she's advertising it.

63
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,520
It's a dicer, greater, peeler, all in one.

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,600
Never need sharpening, dishwasher safe.

65
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,960
Truman becomes suspicious

66
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
and when out with his best friend, Marlon,

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
Truman's behavior starts to be off

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,880
and he brings up his desire to leave and go to Fiji.

69
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,120
Marlon catches that Truman is starting to wake up,

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
so he quickly shoots down the idea.

71
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,160
He doesn't want Truman escaping.

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,520
That would break the whole game.

73
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,960
In the next scene, we see Truman go off

74
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,240
to spend some time on the beach,

75
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,080
where he remembers the tragic boat accident

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,880
that seemingly killed his father and gave him his aquaphobia.

77
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,960
Kristoff then even hides in Truman's misery

78
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,680
by adding a specific path of rain to follow Truman.

79
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,440
And with Truman's breakdown growing,

80
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
we see the audience's engrossed reactions.

81
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,600
It's all these early scenes that serve to illustrate

82
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,760
that the fictional Truman show can only function

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
when Truman buys into this false reality.

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The Truman show therefore has to make sure

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
that Truman can't escape his cage,

86
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,600
or even see that he's in a cage

87
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,640
if he knows that he's in a cage the whole game collapses.

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
The ways that Kristoff keeps Truman deluded

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
are the most striking aspects of the allegory.

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,400
The most obvious and egregious of these

91
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,240
is how Truman is kept complacent

92
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
by exploiting his deepest fears.

93
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
For example, Truman's aquaphobia

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,160
works perfectly to keep Truman on the island.

95
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,560
Kristoff even risks Truman overcoming this fear

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,120
when he sends Truman to unsuccessfully board the boat.

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
The fact that Truman can't overcome his phobia

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
only reinforces this.

99
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
Truman is also constantly barraged by propaganda

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,680
and subliminal messages to induce a fear of flying.

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
There are constant reminders of the dangers of flying.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
It takes this rampant fear mongering

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
to keep Truman's delusion alive.

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680
However, this time the propaganda sluts to weaken.

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
Truman still fantasizes about taking a flight to Fiji.

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
His aquaphobia is still strong,

107
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,680
but it's revealed that this is most likely

108
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,600
because it originates from the undressed guilt

109
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,960
over Truman's father's death.

110
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,880
But it's not just the fear that influences Truman.

111
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
The control that Kristoff has over his world

112
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,440
is total.

113
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,600
Everything Truman takes in on a daily basis

114
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,360
is designed with a secret purpose.

115
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
The TV he watches reinforces the message.

116
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
The media always has headlines

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,520
directly promoting whatever they want Truman to believe.

118
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
Even the people that Truman talks to

119
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,520
on a daily basis spout the same canned lines

120
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,120
and positive affirmations.

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,280
Propaganda is seeping into every aspect

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,880
of Truman's life and society.

123
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
You think I'm flying somewhere?

124
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,520
Nope. Oh, good.

125
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,840
A lot like its infiltration of our society.

126
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Just like Truman, we're always bombarded

127
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,000
with propaganda just to keep us complacently

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,560
unaware of the delusions of modern ideology.

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,480
Every day society tells us who we are,

130
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,480
what we ought to do, and who our enemies are.

131
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,400
Just like Truman, we're encouraged to ignore

132
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
the clues that we're living in a lie,

133
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,320
where we're made to still become wages in the matrix.

134
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
And then everyone who buys into the societal delusion

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,160
helps perpetuate it.

136
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
This means that lots of well-meaning rational people

137
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,520
are swept up to become mouthpieces of a failing system.

138
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
The cracks are present in both reality and fiction.

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
They just exist solely on the personal level for Truman

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,800
rather than the societal level that we're starting to see.

141
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
But what is the society-wide delusion?

142
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
Well, in the Truman Show, it's obvious and literal.

143
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
It's the premise of the movie.

144
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,440
The Truman Show is a reality show.

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
But how does this translate into our real world?

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
Well, this is where it gets interesting.

147
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,200
The Habitus is a tool used by sociologists

148
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,240
for describing the ways in which a society's culture functions.

149
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,320
Society rests upon an enormous amount

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
of unsaid rules and expectations.

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
These are often performed without thinking about them.

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,640
It's more like a learned skill than a conscious decision.

153
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,000
What would do the French intellectual

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
who brought the term to prominence

155
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
often compared it to sports?

156
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
People tend to know the rules of the game.

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,920
For example, it's generally accepted

158
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,600
that when you're finished at the supermarket,

159
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
you return your shopping cart.

160
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
There's no personal reward or egotistic incentive.

161
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
It's just a learned polite expectation.

162
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,320
In the context of the supermarket, though, it's very important.

163
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
The whole system would collapse without it.

164
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
Some abstracts of the Habitus are nearly invisible

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
because they seem so natural to us.

166
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
Even your taste in musical food are influenced by the Habitus.

167
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,760
This is because the cultural expectations

168
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,000
that the Habitus instills go so deep.

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
They're established from the moment you're born,

170
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,920
reinforced throughout your childhood by your family

171
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,720
and then further built upon by your education and work.

172
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,760
This then makes the Habitus a self-perpetuating structure.

173
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
Those brought up in certain Habitus

174
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,600
will nurture its specific values in their children,

175
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,240
for example, making sure the cycle continues.

176
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
The Truman Show gives a literal picture

177
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,440
of what a Habitus can look like.

178
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
We can see all the actors in the fictional Truman Show

179
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,880
is being sucked into this.

180
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
The actors act in certain learned ways

181
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,440
in order to perpetuate the essence of the Truman Show.

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,920
Now, the key difference between fiction and reality

183
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,960
is the incentive.

184
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,040
Literally, the actors in the fictional Truman Show

185
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,560
are being paid to play their parts.

186
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
But in the real world, people play their parts in the Habitus

187
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
because the Habitus itself has conditioned them into it.

188
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
Everyone is one of the actors.

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Everyone makes the Delusion real.

190
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,200
And what the Truman Show goes on to tell us

191
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,120
is that when the Habitus has been altered

192
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,840
into something too detached from an authentic society,

193
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,480
cracks start to show when lies start to perpetuate,

194
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,120
when the ego gets in the way, when power corrupts,

195
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,640
the Habitus starts to break

196
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,280
and this ripples throughout entire civilizations.

197
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,720
See, throughout the movie's progression,

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,200
we see Truman gradually wake up to the Delusion

199
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,720
that has consumed his life,

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,760
which inevitably causes a breakdown of the entire Habitus.

201
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,600
The further Truman moves towards truth,

202
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,520
the faster the Delusion collapses

203
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
and thus the more resistance he faces.

204
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
The Habitus of our world is just as deluded

205
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
as the one in the Truman Show.

206
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,200
This is because what's valuable culturally

207
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,480
has been drastically changed by reality TV and social media.

208
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,000
The Truman Show almost predicted this

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,920
with its commentary on reality TV.

210
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,040
The vapid values of reality TV expanded to shape

211
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,320
the entire Habitus.

212
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,920
Now, limited to reality TV,

213
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,440
and this doesn't seem too harmful,

214
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,480
but it gets so much worse

215
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,320
when you consider this in our own reality,

216
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,440
especially with the effects of social media on our values.

217
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,480
Nowadays, everyone's the star of their own reality TV show.

218
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,880
People project vapid and unattainable standards

219
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,040
by advertising a fake life on social media.

220
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,440
That 14-year-old girls who use social media

221
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
more than five hours a day

222
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,400
saw a 50% spike in depression symptoms.

223
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
This feeds into people's values.

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
They see other people's fake lives

225
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,360
and hold their own up to the same standard.

226
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,280
These people then perpetuate the cycle,

227
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
which then brings the Habitus

228
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
further and further away from authenticity and truth.

229
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
Corporatization of societies then also reflected

230
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,520
in the Habitus of both the Truman Show

231
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
and in our own society.

232
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,640
In the Truman Show, the effects are obvious.

233
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Truman's wife is constantly advertising and shitting brands.

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,880
It's almost a learned response

235
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,640
that has been ingrained into her.

236
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,400
You really ought to throw out that mower.

237
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,040
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

238
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,160
Which is why at this point,

239
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
Truman is actively interrogating her

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,280
on the lie that they've been living.

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
In response, Truman's wife defaults

242
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
to an almost robotic speech about a coffee brand.

243
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,320
This is the Habitus failing.

244
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,080
Truman's wife is so deeply submerged

245
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,280
in the Truman Show delusion

246
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
that she has no other response.

247
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
She just keeps reading the same script,

248
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,320
but it's so much worse in our own society

249
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,640
where our Habitus is so heavily corporatized,

250
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,200
with corporate values being held in such a high regard

251
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,160
that we value our careers more than our families.

252
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,000
Never before in history has this happened.

253
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Truman's suspicions of reality are then brought up again

254
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,640
when his father, who he assumes is dead,

255
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
shows up on his way to work dressed as a beggar.

256
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,680
Dead?

257
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,080
Truman's father is then quickly whisked away on a bus,

258
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
but not before Truman sees his face.

259
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,360
He realizes something is up,

260
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
so he goes to talk to his mother

261
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
who tries to explain away his father's reappearance

262
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,280
by suggesting that he's just crazy and hallucinated it.

263
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,880
This time, it doesn't convince Truman,

264
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,920
who also notices how often his wife name drops brands.

265
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,680
As Truman starts to go through his old things,

266
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,840
the movie flashes back to Truman's collages

267
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,160
and a chance encounter he had with a woman named Lauren.

268
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
Lauren's meant to be a background character,

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
but the two sides meet across the room.

270
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,240
They share a conversation in a romantic moment on the beach.

271
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,920
Lauren then goes out of character

272
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,800
to try to reveal to Truman that his whole reality is fake.

273
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
Lauren, who reveals her real name as Sylvia,

274
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
tries to explain that Truman's world is a lie,

275
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,520
but then again, she stops short by a man saying he is her father

276
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,280
and that she's just talking nonsense.

277
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,120
As Truman starts to think back to this,

278
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,280
it's revealed that he still longs to see Sylvia,

279
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,080
with him even recreating her face from fashion magazines,

280
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,040
because Sylvia is the only thing that's real in this fake world.

281
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,520
It's then later revealed that Truman is obsessed with Fiji

282
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
as Sylvia is reported to be moving there.

283
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,000
Truman then starts to see more and more suspicious things.

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,640
His radio specifically describes his every move

285
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,920
in an apparent malfunction.

286
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,480
Truman's also seeing every part of the background set,

287
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
but he's always escorted away from it.

288
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
This sequence of events brings his suspicions to a breaking point,

289
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
as Truman concludes that it seems that his entire world

290
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
revolves around him in some weird way.

291
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
Fearing that he's going crazy,

292
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
he brings up these questions to Marlon, his best friend,

293
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,360
who then just tries to brush it all off.

294
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
And in response to his increased suspicion,

295
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Truman's then further barraged by suggestions

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,680
that everything is just fine, that he's just being weird.

297
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,160
His mother then shows fake pictures of him at Mount Rushmore,

298
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,920
and even the TV runs a program about the benefits of a small town life.

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,080
But by now, things don't work like they used to.

300
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,480
He's seen the society that he lives in starts to crack.

301
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,400
It's also laughable and ridiculous.

302
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,920
This whole thing is a facade.

303
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,000
And now that Truman is waking up to this reality,

304
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,800
the lullabies of deception can't draw him back to sleep.

305
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,000
After noticing that his wife is crossing her fingers in his wedding pictures,

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,280
Truman follows her to work.

307
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,240
Despite multiple attempts by extras to delay and stop Truman

308
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
from seeing the surgery that his wife is helping with,

309
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,960
Truman breaks into the hospital and sees the fake surgery

310
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,760
being played out by actors who have no idea what they're doing.

311
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Determined to leave, Truman then visits a travel agency.

312
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
By this point, Truman's had enough.

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,120
He's determined to leave.

314
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,880
He wants to escape this sick society.

315
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
So he tries to book a flight to Fiji,

316
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
but the clerk says they're all sold out for at least a month.

317
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
So then Truman tries to get a bus out,

318
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,720
but it conveniently breaks down just before leaving.

319
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Truman then sitting in a car at home,

320
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
waits for his wife to come back from work.

321
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
When she does, she gets in the car with him

322
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
as he points out the clockwork regularity

323
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,400
of the people who go past their road.

324
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Unsatisfied with her unrealistic reaction to this,

325
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,000
Truman then locks the car and takes Meryl on an impromptu road trip.

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
To everyone around him, he seems like he's having a breakdown.

327
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,240
He's breaking the rotten habit of surrounding him.

328
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,760
But then instantly traffic jam starts stopping Truman in his tracks.

329
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
Truman then pretends to go back home,

330
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
which disperses the traffic completely.

331
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
But then turns right around

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
and makes his way out of the suburbs and onto the road.

333
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,280
Once they reach the bridge,

334
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,960
which stands between Truman and the mainland,

335
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,000
it seems that his conditioned aquaphobia will stop his escape plan.

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
All the conditioning and propaganda is the only barrier to his freedom.

337
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
However, Truman overcomes his fears

338
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,440
by closing his eyes and forcing Meryl to steer the car

339
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
while he holds down the accelerator.

340
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
Once they're over the bridge,

341
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,000
other obstacles are set up by Christoff

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
to try and stop Truman from leaving.

343
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,280
Truman even drives through wildfire,

344
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,840
but is stopped by a roadblock due to a convenient leak

345
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
at the nearby power plant.

346
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,600
In desperation, Truman tries to get through on foot,

347
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,080
but is tackled and subdued by men in hazmat suits,

348
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,200
who take him back home.

349
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
The implausibility of all these events

350
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
cement Truman's skepticism of the world around him,

351
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,640
which brings up the question,

352
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,280
how many so-called emergency events in our own world

353
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,880
could be equally implausible?

354
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,200
All the lies told by our media,

355
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
all the false narratives pushed onto us,

356
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,840
all the divisions sowed by algorithms in the news,

357
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,400
all these layers of fallacy that have been embedded

358
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
into every aspect of society.

359
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,640
We all have the means to stop this nonsensical

360
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,400
fictional reality that we abide by,

361
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,320
and yet we choose not to confront it.

362
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
When anyone does,

363
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,280
they are breaking the habit of surrounding them,

364
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,960
which threatens the whole house of cars

365
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
the society is built on,

366
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,400
which is why true authentic reality

367
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,320
is always outrunning our apprehension.

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
So then how can we ever know the truth

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,120
when the lens we look through

370
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,200
is tainted by a corrupted habitus,

371
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
tainted by all the models and distractions

372
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,640
that we don't even acknowledge?

373
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,480
If we can't comprehend true reality,

374
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
we no longer know what truth is.

375
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,040
We don't have a grasp on what our values really are,

376
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
and it's this flattening of our values,

377
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,640
of our society, of our culture

378
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
that dampens our outrage and emotion.

379
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,360
Everything becomes muted by a post-modern reality.

380
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,240
In the Truman Show,

381
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
Truman's deserved outrage

382
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,280
at the cage he has been trapped in

383
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
is never tapped into.

384
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,520
He's never angry,

385
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,600
instead he's always left in a state of confusion

386
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,400
and distraction.

387
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,960
He's meant to feel crazy by searching for the truth.

388
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
This is because for the show to be successful,

389
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,800
it relies on Truman and his belief

390
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,080
in the society around him.

391
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
If he starts questioning this,

392
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,960
since society goes down with him,

393
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,040
so society has to prevent him from questioning

394
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
the habitus he is surrounded by.

395
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,840
And aren't we any different?

396
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,320
Is this why we live in a culture without soul or value?

397
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
Where everything we think and do

398
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
is shrink down by reductionism.

399
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,520
Where the phenomena of nature, personality,

400
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,640
the essence of life,

401
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,360
is just reduced to statistics and banal labels.

402
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,280
Our world is filled with mystery and wonder.

403
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,400
It's filled with adventure,

404
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,760
but our world is being reduced

405
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
to nothing more than a banal monotonous cage,

406
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,520
numbing us into this bored, flaccid, apathetic state,

407
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
which is what the Truman Show tries to show us.

408
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Once home, Truman is now feeling like an animal in a cage.

409
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,080
His wife, unable to come down,

410
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,120
offers him some coffee

411
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,960
with a less than subtle product placement.

412
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,480
Truman immediately senses out the fact

413
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
that she is performing for someone,

414
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,520
and so he confronts her about it.

415
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
He's starting to reject this ridiculous reality

416
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,560
he is surrounded by,

417
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,320
and because of this, he seems crazy,

418
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,480
which is why then the actor of Truman's wife

419
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,680
begins to break character

420
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,080
and pulls out a sharpened kitchen utensil

421
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,280
to defend herself.

422
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,640
It's these sorts of cracks in the show

423
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,280
that only happen when Truman stops believing in it.

424
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,920
Like in our world,

425
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,320
we're now starting to see the rise of political outsiders.

426
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
We're seeing the rise of extremism

427
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,520
and a general apathy of all the people

428
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,360
who refuse to believe in our current system.

429
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,800
With our government starting to collapse

430
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
with war imminent,

431
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
no one trusts our broken society.

432
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,200
And in the case of the Truman Show,

433
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,560
it's this unravelling madness

434
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
that almost ends with Truman's wife

435
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,360
revealing her acted role.

436
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,520
Only until Truman's lifelong friend, Marlon,

437
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,640
bursts in at the last minute

438
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,120
and whisks Truman away to have a heart-to-heart conversation.

439
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,840
But at this point,

440
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,000
it's like putting a bandaid on a gaping wound.

441
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,280
The floodgates are now open,

442
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,880
and Truman's belief is dwindling.

443
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
In this scene, the two are sitting near the river

444
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
and begin reminiscing.

445
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
Christoph through Marlon reassures Truman

446
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
that Truman's life has meaning and is normal.

447
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
He comforts Truman by assuring him

448
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,120
that if what Truman believed was real,

449
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
then everyone would have to be in on it, including him.

450
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
Though this isn't possible as Marlon would never lie.

451
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,200
On the surface, Truman seemingly takes this into heart.

452
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,640
But deep down, he knows that Marlon

453
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
is just a victim of the game.

454
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,560
And so he deliberately shows to him that he bought the ruse.

455
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,400
He knows that Marlon isn't a bad person,

456
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,080
but that he's not a real person.

457
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,800
Morning arrives and Truman seems to be back to his old self.

458
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
He draws with a bar of soap on in the morning.

459
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,200
He has the usual conversations with his neighbours and co-workers,

460
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,160
and seems interested in a new office mate he will have next to him.

461
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,640
Evening rolls around and everything seems business as usual

462
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,920
with Truman fast asleep.

463
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,000
However, Christoph senses something is off.

464
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,040
Truman fell asleep in the basement rather than his bed.

465
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
So Marlon is again sent over with a six-pack

466
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,520
to investigate and talk Truman back to sense.

467
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,000
However, this time he finds that Truman isn't there

468
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
and has escaped from the house.

469
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
Christoph calls for all actors to search for Truman,

470
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
and for the first time in the show's history, cuts the transmission.

471
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,840
However, even with all the actors searching the entire set,

472
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,120
Truman cannot be found.

473
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,800
At his wit's end, Christoph has the set illuminated into daylight mode early.

474
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
And, on a hunch, has the team begin looking through the cameras

475
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,200
near the harbour and on the boat.

476
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
After cycling through a few cameras,

477
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,560
the team finds Truman aboard a sailboat,

478
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,960
and Christoph gives the call to resume transmission.

479
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,560
After a few moments of peace sailing,

480
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,160
Christoph is then faced with a dilemma.

481
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
He either continues the transmission at risk of Truman finding the truth,

482
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
or he gets rid of Truman entirely.

483
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,320
So, he decides to send a violent storm above Truman's boat.

484
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,080
Christoph increases the violence of the weather,

485
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,160
but after a few long minutes, relents.

486
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,720
Amidst this, Truman shows his willingness to die for the truth.

487
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,840
By shouting to the sky,

488
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,040
is this the best you've got?

489
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,400
Christoph, in Godlike stupid,

490
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,960
descends to send the most violent bout of weather yet.

491
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,880
All to the dismay of his crew and producer.

492
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
Truman, however, holds on, but is knocked unconscious.

493
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
But at the last minute, Christoph rescues the weather and removes the storm,

494
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,080
resuming the tranquil waters.

495
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,880
Truman regains consciousness and begins sailing his boat again.

496
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,520
He has beaten the storm and the sea seems to be in his favor.

497
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,800
However, after a few minutes,

498
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,440
the bow of Truman's boat launches through the side of the set,

499
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
leaving a big hole in the skydome.

500
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,600
By now, all of Truman's suspicions have been confirmed,

501
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,760
and in an ecstasy, begins punching the wall.

502
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,640
However, the reality of Truman's situation begins to dawn on him,

503
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
as he sees the ramp at the end of the water.

504
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,880
Truman walks across this ramp, walking on the water.

505
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
The audience is gripped.

506
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,840
The culmination of his 30 years in the Truman show seems to be at its finale.

507
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,200
Truman locates a staircase and slowly ascends to the side of the set.

508
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,080
At the top, he locates the door labeled exit and opens it,

509
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,600
revealing the abyss beyond his realm.

510
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,680
The gold-like voice then thunders through the sky,

511
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,000
as Christoph reveals that Truman was the star of the TV show with the whole world watching.

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
Truman asks, was nothing real?

513
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,240
And in response, Christoph responds that Truman is real,

514
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,560
and that's what made him so enjoyable for millions.

515
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Christoph then tries to keep Truman in the set,

516
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,360
by indicating that there was no more truth out in the real world,

517
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,920
and that in the world he created for him, he had nothing to fear.

518
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,280
The ignorance was bliss.

519
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,720
After a few moments of silence,

520
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Truman looks up at the camera and says his final words before leaving the show.

521
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
Good afternoon, good evening, and good night.

522
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
It's Truman's overriding impulse to return to what is real,

523
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
that makes the entire show fall apart.

524
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
His drive to understand true reality is enough to bring down the false reality he'd been living in.

525
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
As he goes through the door, this symbolizes Truman taking back control,

526
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,160
and turning back on a sterile, hollowed-out reality.

527
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,000
And today, we're in the same process.

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
The increasingly ridiculousness of our society,

529
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,360
and the habitus that we're serviled to, is beginning to crack.

530
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
With our world, economy, and culture crumbling into the ground,

531
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,560
we're seeing a rejection of this tired system.

532
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,840
We're seeing new waves of younger generations dropping out of the workforce,

533
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,600
rejecting the habitus imposed on them, and millions taking the untrodden path,

534
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
which is causing society to reach a crossroads.

535
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,560
We're faced with a new path, because those in control of our reality are now making a new one.

536
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,040
A path of metaverse is in virtual AI reality to take us astray from our current world,

537
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,920
and the other path is a reversion back to what is truly felt.

538
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,520
But whichever path we take, our belief in society is falling apart.

539
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
The cracks are starting to show everywhere you look,

540
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
and the game is collapsing in on itself.

541
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
So the question is, where does it go from here?

542
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,440
I have a quick, important announcement to make.

543
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,200
I'm sick of being demonetized on YouTube.

544
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
I'm sick of censoring these videos for the YouTube algorithm.

545
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,040
So this is going to change.

546
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,680
Every month, I'm going to be releasing unfiltered, raw, controversial videos for YouTube members.

547
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
Videos about the darkest corners of the internet, TikTok, the CIA,

548
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,680
China Rothschilds, and Mr. Robot's series review.

549
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
And by the end of the month slash early August,

550
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,280
I'll be releasing a video on Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unibomber,

551
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,320
where we'll talk about his story, going from a mathematical prodigy

552
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
to living in the wild, sending bombs in the mail,

553
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
and having his manifesto on the front page of the New York Times.

554
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
Not only that, but by becoming a member of the channel,

555
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
you'll have access to my Discord server to talk with other like-minded people,

556
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,920
where every month I'll be doing a Q&A for all your questions.

557
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,560
And if you're still not happy with your membership in the first month,

558
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,000
I will personally refund you.

559
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
All you have to do is email me.

560
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,520
So if you want to watch exclusive, unfiltered,

561
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
controversial videos that I can't release to the public,

562
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,320
which includes access to my server and a monthly Q&A,

563
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
join my channel for only £5.99 a month.

564
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,360
This will also help us out a ton too in making these videos.

565
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,200
And if you want to support the channel even more,

566
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
I will hard code your name into my videos for only £3 more.

567
