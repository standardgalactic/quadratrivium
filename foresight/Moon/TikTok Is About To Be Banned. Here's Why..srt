1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Charlie D'Amelio, Alison Rae, Zach King, Bella Porch and MrBeast.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,600
Right now, these social media stars are the most popular celebrities in the world.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,000
They use TikTok to provide us endless hours of seemingly harmless, bite-sized entertainment,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
and they're making an insane living doing so.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
But what if I told you that these people were unknowingly involved

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
in one of the most sinister geopolitical conspiracies the world has ever seen?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,720
Let me explain.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,800
It's no secret that TikTok is currently the driving force behind popular culture in the West.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
Every popularized song, meme, style, trend, development and slang can be traced back to

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
TikTok in some shape or form, because everyone you know is consuming its content.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,920
With all other social media platforms that were once the cusp of every trend and development

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,240
in internet culture have now seemingly fallen behind the curve, and TikTok has taken the mantle,

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,360
amassing over 1 billion current active users around the world,

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,600
80 million of which are in the United States alone,

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
and with its growing hold over Generation Z in particular,

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,280
it might be obvious why TikTok is growing to be a trendsetting powerhouse.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
And when you think about it, the youth are really the arbiters of popular culture,

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,560
and so by providing a platform in which the youth can dictate content rapidly and instantaneously,

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,960
means the set platform now dictates popular culture.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
And although it's just one country, popular culture in the United States is extremely

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
important. It's a pay-setter for the Western world,

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,160
what becomes popular in the United States quickly becomes popular everywhere else.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,480
And this is what makes TikTok and its most followed individuals extremely powerful,

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,760
with the app mixing and homogenizing the world's entire culture.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,320
This process will only accelerate as the average TikTok user spends over an hour and a half on

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,440
the app every single day, and 60% of TikTok users are from Generation Z.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,920
And as I'm sure you're all aware, TikTok has bled into everyday life on such an unprecedented

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,800
scale, meaning that by now, it has an immeasurable impact on people's culture and their personal

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,920
lives. Now at first glance, popular TikTokers like MrBeast, Alison Rae, Zach King are just simply

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,080
the youth driving cultures they always have, making fun and entertaining videos to be consumed

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,080
and shared by the masses, creating trends that attract existing celebrities and people of order

32
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,080
generations who fear being left out or left behind. However, what if I told you that it's

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,560
not exactly Gen C or influencers who are at the wheel driving popular culture at all,

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
and maybe instead the wheel is being tightly gripped by the white-knockled hands of a fascist

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,560
government in a country that is one of the greatest threats to the United States.

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,800
To understand what I mean by this, we first need to understand how TikTok came to be.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,680
Q Bydance, founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, the Beijing tech company Bydance began working on

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
an algorithm that would change the world, and this algorithm was perfectly designed to

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,600
predict its users by feeding them short-form content rapidly, analyzing their viewing habits

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,600
and carefully creating their intake to keep them consuming for as long as possible. After all,

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,520
in the modern world, attention equals currency, but how is this seemingly random Chinese company

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,120
going to implement the world's most advanced algorithm that the world has ever seen?

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
Well, the start in 2017, when Bydance acquired the Shanghai-based social media startup Musically.

44
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
Through Musically's app, users could create 15-second to one-minute music videos with their

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,440
lips synced to popular songs and interacted with their communities, and Bydance saw the

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,600
value in combining this with the score-focused interface of their existing property Flippagram

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,360
to create what we now know as TikTok. Bydance had already seen the success of Vine, and they

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
understood the power of these bite-sized videos, and by mixing all of these apps together, Bydance

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,160
was developing the perfect algorithm, and with its user-generated content now being rapidly fed

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,400
in scottable bite-sized pieces to the masses, TikTok became the perfect avenue for aspiring

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,360
creators and influencers, providing anyone anywhere the opportunity to go viral like no one has ever

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
seen. Bydance tested out the formula in China first, attracting both content consumers and

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,920
content creators in the span of just a couple of months, and soon the app took over the entirety

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
of China, and that is when the Chinese government saw an incredible opportunity. But it's important

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,560
you understand who the Chinese government really is. The Chinese Communist Party, or otherwise known

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,000
as the CCP, has governed China since 1949, rising to power under leader Mao Zedong after a bruisedy

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
forced civil war. Their mastery over the use of propaganda tactics to capture the minds of the

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,600
people proved to be one of the most critical aspects of their success. With Mao Zedong,

59
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,080
heavily emphasizing the importance of controlling the culture to control the population. In his

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,360
great cultural revolution, Mao specifically focused his propaganda on certain idols, people who stood

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,240
as examples of socialist heroes. Lei Feng and Dongkang Ru were model soldiers who lived and

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,560
died for their devotion to the state and its leader. Alongside these idols came mass censorship,

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,640
state-controlled media and the creation of imperialist enemies in the west. And since Mao,

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,800
the CCP has always cracked down on liberalization, returning to the traditional ways of thought

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,440
control and censorship. And with that the CCP employed a variety of propaganda techniques

66
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,280
including control of the media, and more specifically the construction of role models

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,520
to be emulated by the Chinese youth. Now it's very important to remember this point later on.

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,520
Anyway, fast forward to the current day, where the CCP has become one of the most successful

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,120
dictatorships the world has ever seen, standing as the second largest political party in the

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,360
world, with more than 96 million members under current leader Xi Jinping. His totalitarian

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,760
government has sought to control every aspect of modern life. First they offer the carrot,

72
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,840
the impoverished masses are offered a promise they can escape poverty and hardship if they work

73
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,840
just hard enough for the state. Cut through state exams with incredibly high fail rates,

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,840
ensure this dream only becomes true for a few. And in return for this opportunity,

75
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,440
citizens are then expected to swallow the propaganda, accept the status quo,

76
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,920
and stay out of the way of the ruling party. Which is why every part of communist Chinese culture

77
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,920
is so strictly controlled to keep this narrative going. Social media, television, the news,

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,760
entertainment, all of it is passed through the CCP's great filter. If you don't swallow the

79
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,720
propaganda and play along, you end up in jail. Or in one of China's re-education camps, Mao could

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,120
only have dreamed of the control that the CCP now has over his country. And the total control of

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
culture that Mao's done once stressed so heavily is still so strong. With extreme surveillance

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
monitoring and data gathering to create profiles in citizens, the CCP can then assign a social

83
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,800
credit score to each individual. This allows them to do two things. It incentivises their citizens

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,120
to behave and effectively predicts the future in regards to those who will likely disobey.

85
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
The other major facet of the CCP's control is enforced legislation that limits the influence

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680
of foreign media and access to the internet. Through these methods, the Chinese government

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,160
is creating citizens that are both more efficient economically and more obedient politically than

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,480
those of foreign nations, consolidating its position as the world's global superpower.

89
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,320
And this leads on to something very important. When Xi Jinping was first elected in 2012,

90
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,560
he ran on the promise of the Chinese Dream, described as the great rejuvenation of the

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,920
Chinese nation by the hundredth anniversary of when the CCP was founded, 2049. And this 2049

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,480
plan hinders on a series of five-year economic plans to ensure China will become the dominant

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,720
global superpower. But to achieve such heights globally, Xi Jinping and the CCP would have to

94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,120
find a way to not only strengthen its own position, but weaken the position of competing nations.

95
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,800
And the way to do this would be to enact the same sort of cultural control they have achieved

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
within China over the rest of the world. And so with this context out of the way, it becomes

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
very clear the value of TikTok, an app that is acutely engineered for growth and popularity,

98
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,600
with one of the most advanced algorithms the world has ever seen that is constantly collecting data

99
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,920
on the global population. And so it shouldn't be surprised to find out that the Chinese government

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,000
always had a plan for buy-dancing TikTok. In the short term, the app would be a tool to collect

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,600
data on foreign citizens, building profiles around them that mirrored the existing social

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,400
credit scores within China. And in the long term, it would become key to infiltrating popular culture

103
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,320
around the world. But you may be thinking, well, a government making efforts to influence the culture

104
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,560
of foreign nations really isn't anything new. And to be fair, this is a relatively common practice.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
Perhaps the most obvious examples of this are when governments with countless human rights

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
violations use investment groups to buy controlling stakes in sport. When countries like Qatar or the

107
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,800
United Arab Emirates buy their way into a European football club, they will then elevate the success

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,440
and status of that club through excessive spending. And by doing this, they legitimize these countries,

109
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
it normalizes these kingdoms, and creates a fan base that is in theory loyal to defending these

110
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,280
countries. However, this approach does backfire. It's often too obvious. By making such a public

111
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,440
splash on the world stage through investment, you're opening yourself up to widespread critique,

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
as sports is a heavily scrutinized and discussed industry around the world.

113
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
And the Chinese Communist Party actually knows this, which is why in 2017, coincidentally when

114
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,000
TikTok was first launched, that the CCP forced Chinese businesses to sell their ownership stakes

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,560
in European football clubs citing that these clubs offer nothing in return for their investment.

116
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,200
Instead, the CCP prefers a more subtle approach to foreign public relations. For years now,

117
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,120
they've been using their control over media and technology companies through things like Tencent

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
and Hawaii to get fingers in the pie of Western culture. And this is no secret, almost all world

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,840
governments know about this, as the Shenzhen-based company Tencent is one of the highest-grossing

120
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,480
media companies in the world, with investments in major cultural pillars such as the NBA,

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,200
Reddit, Spotify, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard. And the Chinese government-run Tencent

122
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,720
has used these ties to silence and limit the reach of discourse surrounding the genocide

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,720
being carried out by the Chinese state, censoring any information about the Muslim

124
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
Uyghur population being sent to concentration camps and the resulting protests in Beijing.

125
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,640
And Hawaii's know better, documents have confirmed around the world that their consumer

126
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,400
and business-facing surveillance products have been providing information to the Chinese government

127
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,400
on an unprecedented level. And this is what's so effective about Chinese propaganda,

128
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,680
because coming back to the sports example, Qatar spent hundreds of billions on their

129
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,520
propaganda World Cup, only to see some of their image abroad worse and considerably.

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,920
However, with China, they've been able to stay under the radar and quietly buy influence in other

131
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,400
areas, and have seen all the benefits with very few drawbacks compared to countries like Qatar,

132
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,320
and they very effectively use Tencent to suppress any foreign support for Hong Kong.

133
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,480
In fact, there's a very good reason you've probably never heard of this. For example, in 2019,

134
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,920
the president of the Philadelphia 76ers spoke out against China, and so Tencent stopped airing

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,080
their games. And the clubs saw a significant portion of their revenue disappear, and were

136
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,840
forced to make a public apology. And there's just so many countless incidents of this I

137
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,000
could go on forever. But all of these incidents portray a much grander plan. By buying these

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,480
investments in Western companies, China has suddenly gained the ability to sway public opinion,

139
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,880
censor critics abroad. The solution here seems obvious, and you may be wondering why the Western

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,640
world hasn't sought to limit China's ability to interfere with their media and technology

141
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
infrastructure. In the same way they've done for other hostile governments such as North Korea's

142
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,480
Russia's. And the answer becomes clear when you take a closer look at the relationship China has

143
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,920
cultivated with the Western world. You see, China has done a very effective job at projecting the

144
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,440
image of being a somewhat liberalized nation to the eyes of the Western world.

145
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Furthermore, TikTok is reportedly willing to share more of its algorithm to avoid being banned in

146
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,920
US states. According to this article published by the Wushi Journal, TikTok tries to win allies in

147
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,160
the US with more transparency in response to the ban on US government-issued devices.

148
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,480
In the new proposed arrangement, US third party monitors would check for video recommendation

149
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
algorithms to detect whether it has been manipulated or if the Chinese government or other foreign

150
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,720
actors have had access. And speaking of propaganda or media censorship, let's take a look at how

151
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,360
this is being covered by other media outlets by using ground news, which I use to research topics

152
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
like this. It's interesting to see that the Wall Street Journal was the first article to pick up

153
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
the story, and that most of the sources reporting on it are from the US. We can see the Washington

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,680
Examiner headlines the story as TikTok opening nearly $1.5 billion proposal to accommodate US

155
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,640
regulators. The evening standard, as TikTok offers to share algorithm details in a bid to swerve US

156
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,680
ban and the New York Post, TikTok offers to have third party monitoring if China spies on US users.

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,760
It's also interesting to see that all of these sources are from right-leaning outlets, making

158
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,240
the story a huge blind spot for readers, reading left-leaning outlets, and that of these sources,

159
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,120
33% are owned by media conglomerates. And today you can check out the story at ground.news.com

160
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,920
to read more about it and subscribe to see all the features that are used to avoid bias in the

161
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,920
media. Comparing the language used in each headline, we can get an idea of how language and the media

162
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,920
can be used to shape our understanding of a story, and from this, that the Chinese company is keeping

163
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,360
in line with portraying an image of alliance to keep them from getting banned in the US.

164
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,600
Since the 70s, the CCP's leaders have maintained appearances and played nice with the leaders

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,640
of global superpowers, all in an effort to ensure national security and economic growth.

166
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
And this has allowed the public to see their leaders shaking hands with the likes of Mao Zedong

167
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,440
or sharing a drink with Xi Jinping, and it humanizes the CCP. China wasn't seen as unfavorable by a

168
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,720
majority of Americans until recently in 2018, and this is exactly the same time that TikTok

169
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,600
exploded in the US market. And whether this happened by coincidence or planning, TikTok's rise

170
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,400
perfectly coincided with the beginning of the second stage of China's foreign policy, aggression.

171
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,720
After years of making friends, China has also been making deals. Along with their companies

172
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,040
buying parts of the Western economy, China has also moved to consolidate power over global trade

173
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,160
itself. By buying out around 100 ports in 60 different countries, China has taken its grip on

174
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
vital global infrastructure. In fact, by this point, China's almost colonized Africa. But then

175
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,600
the trade wars began, relations severely worsened between the two global superpowers, and that's

176
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,800
when propaganda in China started to worsen towards the US, with China now framing the West as an

177
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
open enemy. But during this time, the West seemingly had much bigger things to worry about.

178
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,880
The Western world was focused on Russia in the Middle East, all while the Chinese government

179
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,360
was positioning itself perfectly. But then what was this for exactly? And what does the Chinese

180
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
government have to gain from their publicity efforts? Well, it's not just freedom to exert

181
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,480
economic or cultural influence, those are just a means to an end. So then what's the end? Well,

182
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,800
the end goal is the scariest part of all of this. The truth is that right now, China is preparing

183
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,600
China has a defence budget of over 270 billion US dollars, and that number is steadily increasing

184
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
with each year, with the Chinese government reportedly restructuring and ramping up their

185
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,160
recruitment, promotion and paying centres for military personnel. There's also news of the

186
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,240
Chinese military making lucrative offers to former officers of the British Air Force,

187
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,120
all in an effort to bolster training methods. And although China hasn't yet initiated conflict,

188
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,800
all signs point to it being a matter of time. I mean, you don't have to look very far into this

189
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,320
to realise that the Chinese government has set their sights on Taiwan. There's a reason the

190
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,640
Chinese government is threatening use of force if the peaceful consolidation of the two nations

191
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,040
cannot be achieved. And to demonstrate this, China has been practicing invading. They've literally

192
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,080
held combat drills in the air and sea around Taiwan two times in the past month, preparing to

193
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,040
storm the presidential building in Taiwan, which China claims this is all to resolutely counter

194
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
provocative actions of external forces and Taiwan independent separist forces. But again,

195
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,640
why is China doing this? What is the end goal here? Why do they want to absorb Taiwan?

196
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,960
Well, there are many reasons, but one stands out in particular, and that being trade,

197
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,840
one of the key pillars behind China's global dominance. Because Taiwan's GDP was estimated

198
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,000
to now be over $800 billion in 2022, with its two largest expo partners being China and the US.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,840
This is not to mention the increasing global demand for advanced semiconductors,

200
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,160
one of the most vital parts of the whole world's technology industry. Without this,

201
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,640
you won't have your laptops, phones, all of the world's technological infrastructure relies on this.

202
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,600
And it turns out that Taiwan is home to 90% of semiconductors. And not to mention it's been

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,240
reported that nearly half the demand for these semiconductors is from the United States. Not

204
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,280
only this, but Taiwan was always a part of China's 2049 plan. They were never supposed to break away

205
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,400
from China. It's been a stain on the CCP's rule since their independence. All Chinese leaders have

206
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,880
set their eyes on reunifying with Taiwan, and it's just a matter of time until this happens.

207
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,920
China is also facing a crisis in the country. People are protesting the CCP's authoritarian

208
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,920
regime. They're sick of the lockdowns, they're sick of the surveillance, and China needs a

209
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,240
distraction right now. And what better time than when the West is distracted by Ukraine?

210
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,640
And so it should be clear the very real possibility of a war between China and Taiwan,

211
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,560
which would inevitably involve the United States. And in this case, although the United

212
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,440
States has no official diplomatic duty to help Taiwan, it would very much be to their advantage.

213
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,080
In fact, this is pivotal. If they don't do this, the United States is ceding all their power to

214
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,320
China. And so with this in mind, we start to understand why the Chinese government cares

215
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
so much about TikTok. It's the most dominant social media platform in the United States.

216
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,840
And by having full control of TikTok, this will control the narrative behind any future tensions

217
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,840
between the two countries. Because more and more we find out that social media has the

218
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,760
ultimate power to influence political opinion. And this power has been amplified in the United

219
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,240
States during recent years. I mean, skepticism of traditional media sources has reached an all-time

220
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,720
high. And this is for a very good reason. Mainstream news has led the mass slip in recent years,

221
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,640
and it's become increasingly clear that the sources who were once most trusted by society

222
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,040
simply exist as propaganda outlets for billionaires, or to increase the profits of the investors

223
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,680
that they represent. Noam Chonsky and analyst academics have talked about this. The traditional

224
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,000
news media in America bends facts in the name of entertainment, capitalizing off of fear and

225
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
creating villains and strawmen amongst the population that they're meant to inform. But

226
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,160
the truth is, this is left a vacuum for truth. Misinformation is everywhere, and social media

227
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,960
simply amplifies it and makes it more difficult to pass through. And this turns into people blindly

228
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,520
trusting and repeating this misinformation, which can make it seem more credible and result in online

229
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,000
echo chambers, which increase division, create siege mentality, and heightens the toxic culture

230
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,240
we've been stuck in. And these social media echo chambers lead to what we saw in 2020,

231
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,960
with massive black lives matter protests ravaging America, and the US capital rights that threaten

232
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,040
American democracy as we know it. But it's in the search for truth that we realize that we've

233
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,840
been taken advantage of. Foreign agents all around the world are busy licking their lips,

234
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,480
through their direct interference in democracy and by perishing agendas in the online space,

235
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,040
with foreign dictators and autocracies banning all these social media sites and using them against

236
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
the West. And whilst the summit might have seemed like Russia was the first regime to take advantage

237
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,000
of this, China has been perfecting social media and into their manipulation for years, and the

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,880
sinister taxes they've used to control their own segregated internet can easily be used abroad.

239
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,600
All they needed was control of an online platform. And with its insane growth, TikTok is uniquely

240
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,480
positioned to be the most powerful social media platform in the United States, and across the

241
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,880
world for the foreseeable future. And not only because of its growth either, TikTok's algorithm

242
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,040
is powerfully designed to have these snowballing effects I mentioned. TikTok platforms certain

243
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,000
people with ideas deem popular enough and allows them to gain momentum very quickly. We trust TikTok

244
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
to feel as content that is similar to our interests, even though there's no authority making sure it

245
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,800
does so. I mean any TikTok user knows by now that the app is designed to fill hours upon hours of

246
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,200
people's daily lives, which inevitably causes them to conflate what they see with their actual

247
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,760
environment. And with this in mind, the capacity for users to be psychologically manipulated

248
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,200
and ideologically driven on TikTok seems to be a feature and not a bug. And the alarming fact is

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,480
that by dance and by proxy the Chinese government controls this algorithm entirely, they can create

250
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,040
inputs that promote certain videos and limit the reach of others. And these algorithm changes can

251
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,520
be subtle, happening overnight and without any sort of official notice. And everybody outside of

252
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,680
bite dance, even creators who have seemingly mastered this platform, are then in the dark about how

253
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,400
exactly this algorithm works. And this gives the company free license to steer users down certain

254
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,640
paths that benefit them and their associates. And let's not forget a point made earlier in the

255
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,080
video. TikTok is particularly appealing to a younger or impressionable audience. You may be

256
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,400
thinking a possible negative effect on children and teenagers is a flaw of the internet in general

257
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,200
and not really specific to TikTok. But TikTok is designed with a pillar of the CCP's original

258
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,680
propaganda philosophy in mind, the construction of role models. There's a reason why China's

259
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,080
version of TikTok, Douyin, is so different from the version they send to the rest of the world.

260
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,880
If you're a child under the age of 14 in China, Douyin shows you the educational videos like

261
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,440
science experiments and museum exhibits. With the rest of Chinese TikTok showing hard-working

262
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,920
everyday civilians helping their country and sacrificing for the greater communist good.

263
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,440
And yet if you're that same child in the United States, TikTok shows you sex,

264
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,080
vandalism, crime, social disruption and other Douyin satisfying degenerate clips.

265
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,240
And when preteens in the US and China were surveyed, asking what is the most aspirational career

266
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,280
they hope to achieve, the number one answer in the US was to be a social media influencer.

267
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,520
While in China, it was to be an astronaut, which is why it's clear that Mao's old method of

268
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
creating idols has been turned on his head and used as a weapon.

269
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,120
And they make their domestic version a spinach version of TikTok,

270
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,840
while they've shipped the opium version to the rest of the world.

271
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,080
What China uses to unify their population culturally is now being used to sow descent

272
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
and weaken the population of the West. And it's evident that the role models that

273
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,000
generations he is exposed to almost always come from TikTok. But it's not just the idea that

274
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,160
these TikTokers have social influence that makes them so useful to the CCP, it's the idea that

275
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
they have economic influence. In just over four years since its launch in the United States,

276
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,280
TikTok has become its own industry. Individuals are making their entire incomes on TikTok.

277
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,840
Mainstream celebrities are now using TikTok to maintain relevancy and revive their careers.

278
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Major companies are now hiring entire teams of people solely dedicated to TikTok

279
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,320
all in order to market their products. And the beauty of TikTok for the CCP is that when the

280
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,880
most powerful people in Western society are chasing views on an app that they control,

281
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,080
they then control these people. So if people's livelihoods depend directly or even indirectly

282
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,160
on how many views they mass on TikTok, they'll create whatever content the algorithm needs them

283
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,480
to create. And because of this, the CCP no longer has to buy social media companies,

284
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
they don't need to buy sports teams, they don't need to be so overt with their propaganda,

285
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,480
as they have all the world's most powerful and most influential people in their pocket.

286
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,160
And by doing this, they can influence discourse surrounding issues involving China,

287
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,560
easily turning a dull to amplify certain voices while silencing others. And those

288
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,640
silent voices will either have to fall in line or risk losing their incomes or career.

289
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,760
Scorning through a freedom real-time, it may feel like a reach to draw a conclusion that your

290
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,240
favorite TikTokers are currently contributing to the propaganda machine of a corrupt foreign

291
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,280
government. And that's because they're not, at least not yet. The videos in TikTok for the most

292
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,040
part are entertaining, harmless and fun. Your favorite TikTokers probably provide you with

293
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,600
comedy, art, knowledge, and community at no monetary cost to you. And in turn, they get a

294
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,920
platform and outlet in a fulfilling career. So it seems like a win-win. And on the surface,

295
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,240
it seems like there's very little reason to distrust the app. But this iteration of TikTok

296
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,200
is the before picture of the Trojan horse. The global version of TikTok being consumed outside

297
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,480
of China is currently operating within a single goal in mind. The CCP is playing a long-term game

298
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
and to acquire the kind of foothold that will aid them in their goals as being a dominant global

299
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,120
superpower, they need users, they need money, they need trust, and they need to maximize its

300
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,040
addictiveness. So far, it's working incredibly. In just a couple of years, over 20% of all internet

301
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,240
users in the world are now using TikTok on a regular basis. And this percentage is increasing

302
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,960
with no signs of slowing down. At this rate, TikTok has the potential to be the ultimate global

303
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,600
sleeper agent for the CCP. And almost no one's doing anything about this. And the concern shouldn't

304
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,760
be in response to what the CCP and Bite Dancer doing with TikTok at the moment. The concern should

305
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,280
be what they can do. You see, we've already established that in the increasingly likely

306
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,600
event that China invades Taiwan, the United States will be forced to take the side of Taiwan in order

307
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,360
to protect their own trade interests and their geopolitical positioning. But this isn't a

308
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,800
certainty. Whilst the war on Ukraine has definitely given China pause for thought,

309
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,520
they haven't reduced their aggression at all. Biden has promised that the US would defend Taiwan.

310
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,760
Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?

311
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,360
Yes. Although it still does seem like China will try their luck,

312
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,280
whilst the West is distracted by Ukraine, and it's also the perfect opportunity

313
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,320
to regain their own population's trust in the CCP. But in many ways, the war has already started.

314
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,000
TikTok and China's other technological expansions are the first move in a growing

315
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,560
technological war. Although neither side wants a full-scale physical war, the best wars are

316
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,720
thought through the mind. And that's why with TikTok, China might have the perfect way of getting

317
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,040
what they want. Using TikTok's power and influence over culture, China could very easily

318
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,920
push an anti-war agenda on the site. They could so doubt online about the true nature of the war.

319
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,840
They could money the water with misinformation, and influence high-level content creators to

320
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,160
speak out against US intervention. I mean, China's already done this with Tibet. They've silenced

321
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,560
all the outcries for Tibetan independence. They silenced all the Hong Kong protesters.

322
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,640
They silenced all the backlash against the Uighur genocide in China. This is why you don't hear

323
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,520
about these massive issues in the world that relate to China, because China controls the algorithm.

324
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,400
Just like everything else today, a war to defend Taiwan would become an issue along political lines.

325
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,560
Although one of the only issues that Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives

326
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,840
have been united on is the growing threat of China. Although this also could change, TikTok could be

327
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,080
used to interfere and delay an organized defense of Taiwan, or even stop foreign interference

328
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
completely. And this is just one of the issues that China would love to change the public's mind on.

329
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,520
With TikTok, the CCP will be able to sweep their atrocities under the rug,

330
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,120
and further expand their borders and damage the social fabric of their enemies.

331
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,880
This is why the United States government now sees TikTok as such a major threat,

332
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,680
and it's not just one side of the US political dichotomy either.

333
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,160
Current US President Joe Biden has declared his intention to ban TikTok in the United States for

334
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,000
good, and has already made headway in banning the use of the app on government devices at the

335
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,040
federal and state level. The Biden administration also explicitly cites the known data and security

336
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,200
risks surrounding Biden's, as the main driving force behind their push to eventually ban the

337
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,840
app on all civilian devices. And these risks surrounding personal data are very real. As

338
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,320
recently as June 2022, TikTok employees were cited in the report saying that quote,

339
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,480
everything is seen in China, while one director claimed a Beijing-based engineer,

340
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,040
referred to as master admin, has access to everything. And this is within their terms of

341
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,960
service. When you download and sign up to TikTok, you're accepting this. You're accepting that

342
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,280
they can see everything that you do on your phone and online, with some of the most outrageous

343
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,200
data collection policies of any social media site. This is from TikTok's privacy policy.

344
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,520
It said, we collect certain information about the device you use to access the platform,

345
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:09,040
such as your IP address, user region. This is really crazy. Your screen resolution and operating

346
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,960
system, app and file names and types. So all your apps and all your file names,

347
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,080
all the things you have filed away on your phone, keystroke patterns or rhythms. So they're monitoring

348
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,760
your keystrokes, which means they know every fucking thing you type. Wow. And the thing is,

349
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,480
we've already been down this road. Donald Trump actually tried to ban TikTok in the US back in 2019,

350
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,240
and yet he failed to get this through. The executive order was signed, but the move was

351
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
actually blocked. And in 2020, Trump's administration settled for a compromise,

352
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,600
instead forcing Bidance to sell a measly 20% ownership stake in TikTok to an American company,

353
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,800
with 12.5 going to the tech company Oracle and 7.5 going to department store giant Walmart.

354
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,840
Bidance would also have to let Oracle quote, run cloud services and security for TikTok in the US.

355
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,560
In response, Bidance swiftly decided to take legal action in the form of lawsuits and filed

356
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,480
a preliminary injunction in September 2020, which was actually approved. Bidance used American law

357
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
to further damage the American nation. And it should be telling that banning TikTok is a

358
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,200
priority to both Democrats and Republicans. Both sides agree on this, and yet still hasn't gone

359
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,280
through. But with the Biden administration's latest declaration of intent, the discourse has

360
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,680
already started, and those with vested interest in simply perpetuating the discourse itself.

361
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,720
And unfortunately, the precedent for government successfully banning TikTok is basically non-existent.

362
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,040
Outside of countries with strict censorship laws, only India has achieved a nationwide ban on the

363
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,960
app. At this point for the United States and the rest of the Western world, the question becomes

364
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,440
whether or not TikTok is already so entwined with our culture that its removal will be impossible.

365
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,520
But it should be clear to all of you who have watched so far that TikTok is one of the greatest

366
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:54,800
geopolitical weapons the world has ever seen. And thank you to Ground News for kindly sponsoring this video.
