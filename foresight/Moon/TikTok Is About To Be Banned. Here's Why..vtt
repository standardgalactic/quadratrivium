00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
Charlie D'Amelio, Alison Rae, Zach King, Bella Porch and MrBeast.

00:03.920 --> 00:07.600
Right now, these social media stars are the most popular celebrities in the world.

00:07.600 --> 00:12.000
They use TikTok to provide us endless hours of seemingly harmless, bite-sized entertainment,

00:12.000 --> 00:13.920
and they're making an insane living doing so.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.440
But what if I told you that these people were unknowingly involved

00:17.440 --> 00:21.920
in one of the most sinister geopolitical conspiracies the world has ever seen?

00:21.920 --> 00:22.720
Let me explain.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.800
It's no secret that TikTok is currently the driving force behind popular culture in the West.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.640
Every popularized song, meme, style, trend, development and slang can be traced back to

00:30.640 --> 00:34.480
TikTok in some shape or form, because everyone you know is consuming its content.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.920
With all other social media platforms that were once the cusp of every trend and development

00:37.920 --> 00:42.240
in internet culture have now seemingly fallen behind the curve, and TikTok has taken the mantle,

00:42.240 --> 00:45.360
amassing over 1 billion current active users around the world,

00:45.360 --> 00:47.600
80 million of which are in the United States alone,

00:47.600 --> 00:50.000
and with its growing hold over Generation Z in particular,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.280
it might be obvious why TikTok is growing to be a trendsetting powerhouse.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.160
And when you think about it, the youth are really the arbiters of popular culture,

00:56.160 --> 01:00.560
and so by providing a platform in which the youth can dictate content rapidly and instantaneously,

01:00.560 --> 01:02.960
means the set platform now dictates popular culture.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.320
And although it's just one country, popular culture in the United States is extremely

01:06.320 --> 01:08.640
important. It's a pay-setter for the Western world,

01:08.640 --> 01:12.160
what becomes popular in the United States quickly becomes popular everywhere else.

01:12.160 --> 01:16.480
And this is what makes TikTok and its most followed individuals extremely powerful,

01:16.480 --> 01:19.760
with the app mixing and homogenizing the world's entire culture.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.320
This process will only accelerate as the average TikTok user spends over an hour and a half on

01:24.320 --> 01:29.440
the app every single day, and 60% of TikTok users are from Generation Z.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.920
And as I'm sure you're all aware, TikTok has bled into everyday life on such an unprecedented

01:33.920 --> 01:38.800
scale, meaning that by now, it has an immeasurable impact on people's culture and their personal

01:38.800 --> 01:43.920
lives. Now at first glance, popular TikTokers like MrBeast, Alison Rae, Zach King are just simply

01:43.920 --> 01:48.080
the youth driving cultures they always have, making fun and entertaining videos to be consumed

01:48.080 --> 01:52.080
and shared by the masses, creating trends that attract existing celebrities and people of order

01:52.080 --> 01:56.080
generations who fear being left out or left behind. However, what if I told you that it's

01:56.080 --> 02:00.560
not exactly Gen C or influencers who are at the wheel driving popular culture at all,

02:00.560 --> 02:05.040
and maybe instead the wheel is being tightly gripped by the white-knockled hands of a fascist

02:05.040 --> 02:08.560
government in a country that is one of the greatest threats to the United States.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.800
To understand what I mean by this, we first need to understand how TikTok came to be.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.680
Q Bydance, founded in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, the Beijing tech company Bydance began working on

02:17.680 --> 02:21.280
an algorithm that would change the world, and this algorithm was perfectly designed to

02:21.280 --> 02:25.600
predict its users by feeding them short-form content rapidly, analyzing their viewing habits

02:25.600 --> 02:29.600
and carefully creating their intake to keep them consuming for as long as possible. After all,

02:29.600 --> 02:33.520
in the modern world, attention equals currency, but how is this seemingly random Chinese company

02:33.520 --> 02:37.120
going to implement the world's most advanced algorithm that the world has ever seen?

02:37.120 --> 02:42.080
Well, the start in 2017, when Bydance acquired the Shanghai-based social media startup Musically.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.760
Through Musically's app, users could create 15-second to one-minute music videos with their

02:45.760 --> 02:49.440
lips synced to popular songs and interacted with their communities, and Bydance saw the

02:49.440 --> 02:53.600
value in combining this with the score-focused interface of their existing property Flippagram

02:53.600 --> 02:57.360
to create what we now know as TikTok. Bydance had already seen the success of Vine, and they

02:57.360 --> 03:01.760
understood the power of these bite-sized videos, and by mixing all of these apps together, Bydance

03:01.760 --> 03:06.160
was developing the perfect algorithm, and with its user-generated content now being rapidly fed

03:06.160 --> 03:10.400
in scottable bite-sized pieces to the masses, TikTok became the perfect avenue for aspiring

03:10.400 --> 03:15.360
creators and influencers, providing anyone anywhere the opportunity to go viral like no one has ever

03:15.360 --> 03:19.360
seen. Bydance tested out the formula in China first, attracting both content consumers and

03:19.440 --> 03:23.920
content creators in the span of just a couple of months, and soon the app took over the entirety

03:23.920 --> 03:28.400
of China, and that is when the Chinese government saw an incredible opportunity. But it's important

03:28.400 --> 03:32.560
you understand who the Chinese government really is. The Chinese Communist Party, or otherwise known

03:32.560 --> 03:38.000
as the CCP, has governed China since 1949, rising to power under leader Mao Zedong after a bruisedy

03:38.000 --> 03:41.680
forced civil war. Their mastery over the use of propaganda tactics to capture the minds of the

03:41.680 --> 03:45.600
people proved to be one of the most critical aspects of their success. With Mao Zedong,

03:45.600 --> 03:50.080
heavily emphasizing the importance of controlling the culture to control the population. In his

03:50.080 --> 03:55.360
great cultural revolution, Mao specifically focused his propaganda on certain idols, people who stood

03:55.360 --> 04:00.240
as examples of socialist heroes. Lei Feng and Dongkang Ru were model soldiers who lived and

04:00.240 --> 04:04.560
died for their devotion to the state and its leader. Alongside these idols came mass censorship,

04:04.560 --> 04:08.640
state-controlled media and the creation of imperialist enemies in the west. And since Mao,

04:08.640 --> 04:12.800
the CCP has always cracked down on liberalization, returning to the traditional ways of thought

04:12.800 --> 04:17.440
control and censorship. And with that the CCP employed a variety of propaganda techniques

04:17.440 --> 04:21.280
including control of the media, and more specifically the construction of role models

04:21.280 --> 04:25.520
to be emulated by the Chinese youth. Now it's very important to remember this point later on.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.520
Anyway, fast forward to the current day, where the CCP has become one of the most successful

04:29.520 --> 04:33.120
dictatorships the world has ever seen, standing as the second largest political party in the

04:33.120 --> 04:37.360
world, with more than 96 million members under current leader Xi Jinping. His totalitarian

04:37.360 --> 04:41.760
government has sought to control every aspect of modern life. First they offer the carrot,

04:41.760 --> 04:45.840
the impoverished masses are offered a promise they can escape poverty and hardship if they work

04:45.840 --> 04:49.840
just hard enough for the state. Cut through state exams with incredibly high fail rates,

04:49.840 --> 04:53.840
ensure this dream only becomes true for a few. And in return for this opportunity,

04:53.840 --> 04:57.440
citizens are then expected to swallow the propaganda, accept the status quo,

04:57.440 --> 05:01.920
and stay out of the way of the ruling party. Which is why every part of communist Chinese culture

05:01.920 --> 05:05.920
is so strictly controlled to keep this narrative going. Social media, television, the news,

05:05.920 --> 05:09.760
entertainment, all of it is passed through the CCP's great filter. If you don't swallow the

05:09.760 --> 05:14.720
propaganda and play along, you end up in jail. Or in one of China's re-education camps, Mao could

05:14.720 --> 05:19.120
only have dreamed of the control that the CCP now has over his country. And the total control of

05:19.120 --> 05:23.600
culture that Mao's done once stressed so heavily is still so strong. With extreme surveillance

05:23.600 --> 05:28.080
monitoring and data gathering to create profiles in citizens, the CCP can then assign a social

05:28.080 --> 05:32.800
credit score to each individual. This allows them to do two things. It incentivises their citizens

05:32.800 --> 05:37.120
to behave and effectively predicts the future in regards to those who will likely disobey.

05:37.120 --> 05:41.360
The other major facet of the CCP's control is enforced legislation that limits the influence

05:41.360 --> 05:45.680
of foreign media and access to the internet. Through these methods, the Chinese government

05:45.680 --> 05:50.160
is creating citizens that are both more efficient economically and more obedient politically than

05:50.160 --> 05:54.480
those of foreign nations, consolidating its position as the world's global superpower.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.320
And this leads on to something very important. When Xi Jinping was first elected in 2012,

05:58.320 --> 06:02.560
he ran on the promise of the Chinese Dream, described as the great rejuvenation of the

06:02.560 --> 06:07.920
Chinese nation by the hundredth anniversary of when the CCP was founded, 2049. And this 2049

06:07.920 --> 06:12.480
plan hinders on a series of five-year economic plans to ensure China will become the dominant

06:12.480 --> 06:16.720
global superpower. But to achieve such heights globally, Xi Jinping and the CCP would have to

06:16.720 --> 06:21.120
find a way to not only strengthen its own position, but weaken the position of competing nations.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.800
And the way to do this would be to enact the same sort of cultural control they have achieved

06:24.800 --> 06:28.800
within China over the rest of the world. And so with this context out of the way, it becomes

06:28.800 --> 06:33.600
very clear the value of TikTok, an app that is acutely engineered for growth and popularity,

06:33.600 --> 06:37.600
with one of the most advanced algorithms the world has ever seen that is constantly collecting data

06:37.600 --> 06:41.920
on the global population. And so it shouldn't be surprised to find out that the Chinese government

06:41.920 --> 06:46.000
always had a plan for buy-dancing TikTok. In the short term, the app would be a tool to collect

06:46.000 --> 06:49.600
data on foreign citizens, building profiles around them that mirrored the existing social

06:49.600 --> 06:54.400
credit scores within China. And in the long term, it would become key to infiltrating popular culture

06:54.400 --> 06:58.320
around the world. But you may be thinking, well, a government making efforts to influence the culture

06:58.320 --> 07:02.560
of foreign nations really isn't anything new. And to be fair, this is a relatively common practice.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.000
Perhaps the most obvious examples of this are when governments with countless human rights

07:06.000 --> 07:10.720
violations use investment groups to buy controlling stakes in sport. When countries like Qatar or the

07:10.720 --> 07:14.800
United Arab Emirates buy their way into a European football club, they will then elevate the success

07:14.800 --> 07:19.440
and status of that club through excessive spending. And by doing this, they legitimize these countries,

07:19.440 --> 07:24.240
it normalizes these kingdoms, and creates a fan base that is in theory loyal to defending these

07:24.240 --> 07:29.280
countries. However, this approach does backfire. It's often too obvious. By making such a public

07:29.280 --> 07:33.440
splash on the world stage through investment, you're opening yourself up to widespread critique,

07:33.440 --> 07:36.960
as sports is a heavily scrutinized and discussed industry around the world.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.280
And the Chinese Communist Party actually knows this, which is why in 2017, coincidentally when

07:41.280 --> 07:46.000
TikTok was first launched, that the CCP forced Chinese businesses to sell their ownership stakes

07:46.000 --> 07:50.560
in European football clubs citing that these clubs offer nothing in return for their investment.

07:50.640 --> 07:55.200
Instead, the CCP prefers a more subtle approach to foreign public relations. For years now,

07:55.200 --> 07:59.120
they've been using their control over media and technology companies through things like Tencent

07:59.120 --> 08:03.680
and Hawaii to get fingers in the pie of Western culture. And this is no secret, almost all world

08:03.680 --> 08:07.840
governments know about this, as the Shenzhen-based company Tencent is one of the highest-grossing

08:07.840 --> 08:12.480
media companies in the world, with investments in major cultural pillars such as the NBA,

08:12.480 --> 08:17.200
Reddit, Spotify, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard. And the Chinese government-run Tencent

08:17.200 --> 08:20.720
has used these ties to silence and limit the reach of discourse surrounding the genocide

08:20.720 --> 08:24.720
being carried out by the Chinese state, censoring any information about the Muslim

08:24.720 --> 08:28.960
Uyghur population being sent to concentration camps and the resulting protests in Beijing.

08:28.960 --> 08:32.640
And Hawaii's know better, documents have confirmed around the world that their consumer

08:32.640 --> 08:36.400
and business-facing surveillance products have been providing information to the Chinese government

08:36.400 --> 08:40.400
on an unprecedented level. And this is what's so effective about Chinese propaganda,

08:40.400 --> 08:43.680
because coming back to the sports example, Qatar spent hundreds of billions on their

08:43.680 --> 08:47.520
propaganda World Cup, only to see some of their image abroad worse and considerably.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.920
However, with China, they've been able to stay under the radar and quietly buy influence in other

08:51.920 --> 08:56.400
areas, and have seen all the benefits with very few drawbacks compared to countries like Qatar,

08:56.400 --> 09:00.320
and they very effectively use Tencent to suppress any foreign support for Hong Kong.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.480
In fact, there's a very good reason you've probably never heard of this. For example, in 2019,

09:04.480 --> 09:09.920
the president of the Philadelphia 76ers spoke out against China, and so Tencent stopped airing

09:09.920 --> 09:14.080
their games. And the clubs saw a significant portion of their revenue disappear, and were

09:14.080 --> 09:17.840
forced to make a public apology. And there's just so many countless incidents of this I

09:17.840 --> 09:22.000
could go on forever. But all of these incidents portray a much grander plan. By buying these

09:22.000 --> 09:26.480
investments in Western companies, China has suddenly gained the ability to sway public opinion,

09:26.480 --> 09:30.880
censor critics abroad. The solution here seems obvious, and you may be wondering why the Western

09:30.880 --> 09:34.640
world hasn't sought to limit China's ability to interfere with their media and technology

09:34.640 --> 09:38.320
infrastructure. In the same way they've done for other hostile governments such as North Korea's

09:38.320 --> 09:42.480
Russia's. And the answer becomes clear when you take a closer look at the relationship China has

09:42.480 --> 09:47.920
cultivated with the Western world. You see, China has done a very effective job at projecting the

09:47.920 --> 09:51.440
image of being a somewhat liberalized nation to the eyes of the Western world.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.680
Furthermore, TikTok is reportedly willing to share more of its algorithm to avoid being banned in

09:59.680 --> 10:03.920
US states. According to this article published by the Wushi Journal, TikTok tries to win allies in

10:03.920 --> 10:08.160
the US with more transparency in response to the ban on US government-issued devices.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.480
In the new proposed arrangement, US third party monitors would check for video recommendation

10:12.480 --> 10:16.480
algorithms to detect whether it has been manipulated or if the Chinese government or other foreign

10:16.480 --> 10:20.720
actors have had access. And speaking of propaganda or media censorship, let's take a look at how

10:20.720 --> 10:25.360
this is being covered by other media outlets by using ground news, which I use to research topics

10:25.360 --> 10:29.360
like this. It's interesting to see that the Wall Street Journal was the first article to pick up

10:29.360 --> 10:34.000
the story, and that most of the sources reporting on it are from the US. We can see the Washington

10:34.000 --> 10:39.680
Examiner headlines the story as TikTok opening nearly $1.5 billion proposal to accommodate US

10:39.680 --> 10:44.640
regulators. The evening standard, as TikTok offers to share algorithm details in a bid to swerve US

10:44.640 --> 10:49.680
ban and the New York Post, TikTok offers to have third party monitoring if China spies on US users.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.760
It's also interesting to see that all of these sources are from right-leaning outlets, making

10:53.760 --> 10:58.240
the story a huge blind spot for readers, reading left-leaning outlets, and that of these sources,

10:58.240 --> 11:03.120
33% are owned by media conglomerates. And today you can check out the story at ground.news.com

11:04.000 --> 11:07.920
to read more about it and subscribe to see all the features that are used to avoid bias in the

11:07.920 --> 11:11.920
media. Comparing the language used in each headline, we can get an idea of how language and the media

11:11.920 --> 11:15.920
can be used to shape our understanding of a story, and from this, that the Chinese company is keeping

11:15.920 --> 11:19.360
in line with portraying an image of alliance to keep them from getting banned in the US.

11:21.120 --> 11:25.600
Since the 70s, the CCP's leaders have maintained appearances and played nice with the leaders

11:25.600 --> 11:30.640
of global superpowers, all in an effort to ensure national security and economic growth.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.320
And this has allowed the public to see their leaders shaking hands with the likes of Mao Zedong

11:34.320 --> 11:39.440
or sharing a drink with Xi Jinping, and it humanizes the CCP. China wasn't seen as unfavorable by a

11:39.440 --> 11:44.720
majority of Americans until recently in 2018, and this is exactly the same time that TikTok

11:44.720 --> 11:49.600
exploded in the US market. And whether this happened by coincidence or planning, TikTok's rise

11:49.600 --> 11:54.400
perfectly coincided with the beginning of the second stage of China's foreign policy, aggression.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.720
After years of making friends, China has also been making deals. Along with their companies

11:58.720 --> 12:03.040
buying parts of the Western economy, China has also moved to consolidate power over global trade

12:03.040 --> 12:08.160
itself. By buying out around 100 ports in 60 different countries, China has taken its grip on

12:08.160 --> 12:12.800
vital global infrastructure. In fact, by this point, China's almost colonized Africa. But then

12:12.800 --> 12:17.600
the trade wars began, relations severely worsened between the two global superpowers, and that's

12:17.600 --> 12:22.800
when propaganda in China started to worsen towards the US, with China now framing the West as an

12:22.800 --> 12:27.120
open enemy. But during this time, the West seemingly had much bigger things to worry about.

12:27.120 --> 12:30.880
The Western world was focused on Russia in the Middle East, all while the Chinese government

12:30.880 --> 12:35.360
was positioning itself perfectly. But then what was this for exactly? And what does the Chinese

12:35.360 --> 12:39.200
government have to gain from their publicity efforts? Well, it's not just freedom to exert

12:39.200 --> 12:44.480
economic or cultural influence, those are just a means to an end. So then what's the end? Well,

12:44.480 --> 12:50.800
the end goal is the scariest part of all of this. The truth is that right now, China is preparing

12:51.440 --> 12:57.600
China has a defence budget of over 270 billion US dollars, and that number is steadily increasing

12:57.600 --> 13:01.600
with each year, with the Chinese government reportedly restructuring and ramping up their

13:01.600 --> 13:06.160
recruitment, promotion and paying centres for military personnel. There's also news of the

13:06.160 --> 13:10.240
Chinese military making lucrative offers to former officers of the British Air Force,

13:10.240 --> 13:15.120
all in an effort to bolster training methods. And although China hasn't yet initiated conflict,

13:15.120 --> 13:18.800
all signs point to it being a matter of time. I mean, you don't have to look very far into this

13:18.800 --> 13:22.320
to realise that the Chinese government has set their sights on Taiwan. There's a reason the

13:22.320 --> 13:26.640
Chinese government is threatening use of force if the peaceful consolidation of the two nations

13:26.640 --> 13:31.040
cannot be achieved. And to demonstrate this, China has been practicing invading. They've literally

13:31.040 --> 13:36.080
held combat drills in the air and sea around Taiwan two times in the past month, preparing to

13:36.080 --> 13:41.040
storm the presidential building in Taiwan, which China claims this is all to resolutely counter

13:41.040 --> 13:46.160
provocative actions of external forces and Taiwan independent separist forces. But again,

13:46.240 --> 13:50.640
why is China doing this? What is the end goal here? Why do they want to absorb Taiwan?

13:50.640 --> 13:54.960
Well, there are many reasons, but one stands out in particular, and that being trade,

13:54.960 --> 13:59.840
one of the key pillars behind China's global dominance. Because Taiwan's GDP was estimated

13:59.840 --> 14:06.000
to now be over $800 billion in 2022, with its two largest expo partners being China and the US.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.840
This is not to mention the increasing global demand for advanced semiconductors,

14:09.840 --> 14:14.160
one of the most vital parts of the whole world's technology industry. Without this,

14:14.160 --> 14:18.640
you won't have your laptops, phones, all of the world's technological infrastructure relies on this.

14:18.640 --> 14:23.600
And it turns out that Taiwan is home to 90% of semiconductors. And not to mention it's been

14:23.600 --> 14:28.240
reported that nearly half the demand for these semiconductors is from the United States. Not

14:28.240 --> 14:33.280
only this, but Taiwan was always a part of China's 2049 plan. They were never supposed to break away

14:33.280 --> 14:38.400
from China. It's been a stain on the CCP's rule since their independence. All Chinese leaders have

14:38.400 --> 14:42.880
set their eyes on reunifying with Taiwan, and it's just a matter of time until this happens.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.920
China is also facing a crisis in the country. People are protesting the CCP's authoritarian

14:47.920 --> 14:51.920
regime. They're sick of the lockdowns, they're sick of the surveillance, and China needs a

14:51.920 --> 14:56.240
distraction right now. And what better time than when the West is distracted by Ukraine?

14:56.240 --> 15:00.640
And so it should be clear the very real possibility of a war between China and Taiwan,

15:00.640 --> 15:04.560
which would inevitably involve the United States. And in this case, although the United

15:04.560 --> 15:09.440
States has no official diplomatic duty to help Taiwan, it would very much be to their advantage.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.080
In fact, this is pivotal. If they don't do this, the United States is ceding all their power to

15:14.080 --> 15:18.320
China. And so with this in mind, we start to understand why the Chinese government cares

15:18.320 --> 15:23.040
so much about TikTok. It's the most dominant social media platform in the United States.

15:23.040 --> 15:27.840
And by having full control of TikTok, this will control the narrative behind any future tensions

15:27.840 --> 15:31.840
between the two countries. Because more and more we find out that social media has the

15:31.840 --> 15:35.760
ultimate power to influence political opinion. And this power has been amplified in the United

15:35.760 --> 15:40.240
States during recent years. I mean, skepticism of traditional media sources has reached an all-time

15:40.240 --> 15:44.720
high. And this is for a very good reason. Mainstream news has led the mass slip in recent years,

15:44.720 --> 15:48.640
and it's become increasingly clear that the sources who were once most trusted by society

15:48.640 --> 15:53.040
simply exist as propaganda outlets for billionaires, or to increase the profits of the investors

15:53.040 --> 15:57.680
that they represent. Noam Chonsky and analyst academics have talked about this. The traditional

15:57.680 --> 16:02.000
news media in America bends facts in the name of entertainment, capitalizing off of fear and

16:02.000 --> 16:05.360
creating villains and strawmen amongst the population that they're meant to inform. But

16:05.360 --> 16:10.160
the truth is, this is left a vacuum for truth. Misinformation is everywhere, and social media

16:10.160 --> 16:14.960
simply amplifies it and makes it more difficult to pass through. And this turns into people blindly

16:14.960 --> 16:19.520
trusting and repeating this misinformation, which can make it seem more credible and result in online

16:19.520 --> 16:24.000
echo chambers, which increase division, create siege mentality, and heightens the toxic culture

16:24.000 --> 16:28.240
we've been stuck in. And these social media echo chambers lead to what we saw in 2020,

16:28.240 --> 16:32.960
with massive black lives matter protests ravaging America, and the US capital rights that threaten

16:32.960 --> 16:37.040
American democracy as we know it. But it's in the search for truth that we realize that we've

16:37.040 --> 16:41.840
been taken advantage of. Foreign agents all around the world are busy licking their lips,

16:41.840 --> 16:46.480
through their direct interference in democracy and by perishing agendas in the online space,

16:46.480 --> 16:51.040
with foreign dictators and autocracies banning all these social media sites and using them against

16:51.040 --> 16:55.120
the West. And whilst the summit might have seemed like Russia was the first regime to take advantage

16:55.120 --> 17:00.000
of this, China has been perfecting social media and into their manipulation for years, and the

17:00.000 --> 17:04.880
sinister taxes they've used to control their own segregated internet can easily be used abroad.

17:04.880 --> 17:09.600
All they needed was control of an online platform. And with its insane growth, TikTok is uniquely

17:09.600 --> 17:14.480
positioned to be the most powerful social media platform in the United States, and across the

17:14.480 --> 17:18.880
world for the foreseeable future. And not only because of its growth either, TikTok's algorithm

17:18.880 --> 17:23.040
is powerfully designed to have these snowballing effects I mentioned. TikTok platforms certain

17:23.040 --> 17:28.000
people with ideas deem popular enough and allows them to gain momentum very quickly. We trust TikTok

17:28.000 --> 17:32.240
to feel as content that is similar to our interests, even though there's no authority making sure it

17:32.240 --> 17:36.800
does so. I mean any TikTok user knows by now that the app is designed to fill hours upon hours of

17:36.800 --> 17:41.200
people's daily lives, which inevitably causes them to conflate what they see with their actual

17:41.200 --> 17:45.760
environment. And with this in mind, the capacity for users to be psychologically manipulated

17:45.760 --> 17:51.200
and ideologically driven on TikTok seems to be a feature and not a bug. And the alarming fact is

17:51.200 --> 17:56.480
that by dance and by proxy the Chinese government controls this algorithm entirely, they can create

17:56.480 --> 18:01.040
inputs that promote certain videos and limit the reach of others. And these algorithm changes can

18:01.040 --> 18:05.520
be subtle, happening overnight and without any sort of official notice. And everybody outside of

18:05.520 --> 18:09.680
bite dance, even creators who have seemingly mastered this platform, are then in the dark about how

18:09.680 --> 18:14.400
exactly this algorithm works. And this gives the company free license to steer users down certain

18:14.400 --> 18:18.640
paths that benefit them and their associates. And let's not forget a point made earlier in the

18:18.640 --> 18:24.080
video. TikTok is particularly appealing to a younger or impressionable audience. You may be

18:24.080 --> 18:28.400
thinking a possible negative effect on children and teenagers is a flaw of the internet in general

18:28.400 --> 18:33.200
and not really specific to TikTok. But TikTok is designed with a pillar of the CCP's original

18:33.200 --> 18:37.680
propaganda philosophy in mind, the construction of role models. There's a reason why China's

18:37.680 --> 18:42.080
version of TikTok, Douyin, is so different from the version they send to the rest of the world.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.880
If you're a child under the age of 14 in China, Douyin shows you the educational videos like

18:46.880 --> 18:51.440
science experiments and museum exhibits. With the rest of Chinese TikTok showing hard-working

18:51.440 --> 18:55.920
everyday civilians helping their country and sacrificing for the greater communist good.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.440
And yet if you're that same child in the United States, TikTok shows you sex,

18:59.440 --> 19:04.080
vandalism, crime, social disruption and other Douyin satisfying degenerate clips.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.240
And when preteens in the US and China were surveyed, asking what is the most aspirational career

19:08.240 --> 19:13.280
they hope to achieve, the number one answer in the US was to be a social media influencer.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.520
While in China, it was to be an astronaut, which is why it's clear that Mao's old method of

19:17.600 --> 19:20.880
creating idols has been turned on his head and used as a weapon.

19:20.880 --> 19:25.120
And they make their domestic version a spinach version of TikTok,

19:25.120 --> 19:27.840
while they've shipped the opium version to the rest of the world.

19:27.840 --> 19:32.080
What China uses to unify their population culturally is now being used to sow descent

19:32.080 --> 19:35.520
and weaken the population of the West. And it's evident that the role models that

19:35.520 --> 19:40.000
generations he is exposed to almost always come from TikTok. But it's not just the idea that

19:40.000 --> 19:44.160
these TikTokers have social influence that makes them so useful to the CCP, it's the idea that

19:44.240 --> 19:48.640
they have economic influence. In just over four years since its launch in the United States,

19:48.640 --> 19:53.280
TikTok has become its own industry. Individuals are making their entire incomes on TikTok.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.840
Mainstream celebrities are now using TikTok to maintain relevancy and revive their careers.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.840
Major companies are now hiring entire teams of people solely dedicated to TikTok

20:01.840 --> 20:06.320
all in order to market their products. And the beauty of TikTok for the CCP is that when the

20:06.320 --> 20:10.880
most powerful people in Western society are chasing views on an app that they control,

20:10.880 --> 20:16.080
they then control these people. So if people's livelihoods depend directly or even indirectly

20:16.080 --> 20:20.160
on how many views they mass on TikTok, they'll create whatever content the algorithm needs them

20:20.160 --> 20:24.480
to create. And because of this, the CCP no longer has to buy social media companies,

20:24.480 --> 20:28.320
they don't need to buy sports teams, they don't need to be so overt with their propaganda,

20:28.320 --> 20:32.480
as they have all the world's most powerful and most influential people in their pocket.

20:32.480 --> 20:36.160
And by doing this, they can influence discourse surrounding issues involving China,

20:36.160 --> 20:40.560
easily turning a dull to amplify certain voices while silencing others. And those

20:40.560 --> 20:44.640
silent voices will either have to fall in line or risk losing their incomes or career.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.760
Scorning through a freedom real-time, it may feel like a reach to draw a conclusion that your

20:57.760 --> 21:02.240
favorite TikTokers are currently contributing to the propaganda machine of a corrupt foreign

21:02.240 --> 21:07.280
government. And that's because they're not, at least not yet. The videos in TikTok for the most

21:07.280 --> 21:11.040
part are entertaining, harmless and fun. Your favorite TikTokers probably provide you with

21:11.040 --> 21:15.600
comedy, art, knowledge, and community at no monetary cost to you. And in turn, they get a

21:15.600 --> 21:19.920
platform and outlet in a fulfilling career. So it seems like a win-win. And on the surface,

21:19.920 --> 21:24.240
it seems like there's very little reason to distrust the app. But this iteration of TikTok

21:24.240 --> 21:29.200
is the before picture of the Trojan horse. The global version of TikTok being consumed outside

21:29.200 --> 21:34.480
of China is currently operating within a single goal in mind. The CCP is playing a long-term game

21:34.480 --> 21:38.480
and to acquire the kind of foothold that will aid them in their goals as being a dominant global

21:38.480 --> 21:43.120
superpower, they need users, they need money, they need trust, and they need to maximize its

21:43.120 --> 21:49.040
addictiveness. So far, it's working incredibly. In just a couple of years, over 20% of all internet

21:49.040 --> 21:54.240
users in the world are now using TikTok on a regular basis. And this percentage is increasing

21:54.240 --> 21:58.960
with no signs of slowing down. At this rate, TikTok has the potential to be the ultimate global

21:58.960 --> 22:03.600
sleeper agent for the CCP. And almost no one's doing anything about this. And the concern shouldn't

22:03.600 --> 22:07.760
be in response to what the CCP and Bite Dancer doing with TikTok at the moment. The concern should

22:07.760 --> 22:11.280
be what they can do. You see, we've already established that in the increasingly likely

22:11.280 --> 22:15.600
event that China invades Taiwan, the United States will be forced to take the side of Taiwan in order

22:15.600 --> 22:19.360
to protect their own trade interests and their geopolitical positioning. But this isn't a

22:19.360 --> 22:22.800
certainty. Whilst the war on Ukraine has definitely given China pause for thought,

22:22.800 --> 22:27.520
they haven't reduced their aggression at all. Biden has promised that the US would defend Taiwan.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.760
Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?

22:32.240 --> 22:35.360
Yes. Although it still does seem like China will try their luck,

22:35.360 --> 22:39.280
whilst the West is distracted by Ukraine, and it's also the perfect opportunity

22:39.280 --> 22:44.320
to regain their own population's trust in the CCP. But in many ways, the war has already started.

22:44.320 --> 22:48.000
TikTok and China's other technological expansions are the first move in a growing

22:48.000 --> 22:52.560
technological war. Although neither side wants a full-scale physical war, the best wars are

22:52.560 --> 22:56.720
thought through the mind. And that's why with TikTok, China might have the perfect way of getting

22:56.720 --> 23:01.040
what they want. Using TikTok's power and influence over culture, China could very easily

23:01.040 --> 23:05.920
push an anti-war agenda on the site. They could so doubt online about the true nature of the war.

23:05.920 --> 23:09.840
They could money the water with misinformation, and influence high-level content creators to

23:09.840 --> 23:14.160
speak out against US intervention. I mean, China's already done this with Tibet. They've silenced

23:14.160 --> 23:18.560
all the outcries for Tibetan independence. They silenced all the Hong Kong protesters.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.640
They silenced all the backlash against the Uighur genocide in China. This is why you don't hear

23:22.640 --> 23:27.520
about these massive issues in the world that relate to China, because China controls the algorithm.

23:27.520 --> 23:32.400
Just like everything else today, a war to defend Taiwan would become an issue along political lines.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.560
Although one of the only issues that Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives

23:36.560 --> 23:41.840
have been united on is the growing threat of China. Although this also could change, TikTok could be

23:41.840 --> 23:46.080
used to interfere and delay an organized defense of Taiwan, or even stop foreign interference

23:46.080 --> 23:50.080
completely. And this is just one of the issues that China would love to change the public's mind on.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.520
With TikTok, the CCP will be able to sweep their atrocities under the rug,

23:53.520 --> 23:57.120
and further expand their borders and damage the social fabric of their enemies.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.880
This is why the United States government now sees TikTok as such a major threat,

24:00.880 --> 24:03.680
and it's not just one side of the US political dichotomy either.

24:03.680 --> 24:08.160
Current US President Joe Biden has declared his intention to ban TikTok in the United States for

24:08.160 --> 24:12.000
good, and has already made headway in banning the use of the app on government devices at the

24:12.000 --> 24:17.040
federal and state level. The Biden administration also explicitly cites the known data and security

24:17.040 --> 24:21.200
risks surrounding Biden's, as the main driving force behind their push to eventually ban the

24:21.200 --> 24:25.840
app on all civilian devices. And these risks surrounding personal data are very real. As

24:25.840 --> 24:30.320
recently as June 2022, TikTok employees were cited in the report saying that quote,

24:30.320 --> 24:34.480
everything is seen in China, while one director claimed a Beijing-based engineer,

24:34.480 --> 24:39.040
referred to as master admin, has access to everything. And this is within their terms of

24:39.040 --> 24:42.960
service. When you download and sign up to TikTok, you're accepting this. You're accepting that

24:42.960 --> 24:47.280
they can see everything that you do on your phone and online, with some of the most outrageous

24:47.280 --> 24:53.200
data collection policies of any social media site. This is from TikTok's privacy policy.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.520
It said, we collect certain information about the device you use to access the platform,

25:00.400 --> 25:09.040
such as your IP address, user region. This is really crazy. Your screen resolution and operating

25:09.840 --> 25:14.960
system, app and file names and types. So all your apps and all your file names,

25:14.960 --> 25:20.080
all the things you have filed away on your phone, keystroke patterns or rhythms. So they're monitoring

25:20.080 --> 25:23.760
your keystrokes, which means they know every fucking thing you type. Wow. And the thing is,

25:23.760 --> 25:28.480
we've already been down this road. Donald Trump actually tried to ban TikTok in the US back in 2019,

25:28.480 --> 25:32.240
and yet he failed to get this through. The executive order was signed, but the move was

25:32.240 --> 25:36.320
actually blocked. And in 2020, Trump's administration settled for a compromise,

25:36.320 --> 25:41.600
instead forcing Bidance to sell a measly 20% ownership stake in TikTok to an American company,

25:41.600 --> 25:46.800
with 12.5 going to the tech company Oracle and 7.5 going to department store giant Walmart.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.840
Bidance would also have to let Oracle quote, run cloud services and security for TikTok in the US.

25:51.840 --> 25:56.560
In response, Bidance swiftly decided to take legal action in the form of lawsuits and filed

25:56.560 --> 26:02.480
a preliminary injunction in September 2020, which was actually approved. Bidance used American law

26:02.480 --> 26:06.320
to further damage the American nation. And it should be telling that banning TikTok is a

26:06.320 --> 26:11.200
priority to both Democrats and Republicans. Both sides agree on this, and yet still hasn't gone

26:11.200 --> 26:15.280
through. But with the Biden administration's latest declaration of intent, the discourse has

26:15.280 --> 26:19.680
already started, and those with vested interest in simply perpetuating the discourse itself.

26:19.680 --> 26:24.720
And unfortunately, the precedent for government successfully banning TikTok is basically non-existent.

26:24.720 --> 26:29.040
Outside of countries with strict censorship laws, only India has achieved a nationwide ban on the

26:29.040 --> 26:32.960
app. At this point for the United States and the rest of the Western world, the question becomes

26:32.960 --> 26:37.440
whether or not TikTok is already so entwined with our culture that its removal will be impossible.

26:37.440 --> 26:41.520
But it should be clear to all of you who have watched so far that TikTok is one of the greatest

26:41.520 --> 26:54.800
geopolitical weapons the world has ever seen. And thank you to Ground News for kindly sponsoring this video.
