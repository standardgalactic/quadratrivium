Processing Overview for Wendover Productions
============================
Checking Wendover Productions/The Art Market is a Scam (And Rich People Run It).txt
 The art market is rife with legal and illegal exploitation due to its lack of regulation, allowing wealthy individuals to engage in various forms of financial manipulation such as tax avoidance, money laundering, and price fixing. This creates an exclusive market that favors the rich and powerful, who can use artwork for branding and investment purposes while artists are often sidelined unless they align with the preferences of gallery owners and market influencers. The art market's lack of transparency makes it nearly impossible to track ownership or prove malpractice, which contributes to its lawless nature. Only those with significant financial resources can participate in this market, effectively excluding the average person from its benefits and subjecting it to exploitation for illicit activities like money laundering and forgery.
