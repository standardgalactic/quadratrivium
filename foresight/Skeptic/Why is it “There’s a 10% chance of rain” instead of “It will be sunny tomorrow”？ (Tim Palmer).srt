00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Hello everyone, it's Michael Schirmer and it's time for another episode of the Michael

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,740
Schirmer Show.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,220
This one is brought to you by Wondrium, a series of college-level audio and video courses and

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,740
documentary films and series produced and distributed by The Teaching Company.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,020
Wondrium brings you engaging educational content through short-form videos, long-form courses,

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,060
my favorites, tutorials, how-to lessons, travelogues, documentaries, and more covering every topic

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:34,380
you've ever wondered about, and many, many more you've never even thought you'd wonder

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,380
about.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,500
For example, here's one I'm going to take this week.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,980
Again, the app is right on the phone, you just tap it, open it up, and they give you

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,860
a whole series of courses and tutorials and films and things you can watch or listen to.

12
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,980
This one's called The U.S. Constitution Through History.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,860
This is 24 30-minute lectures, which I always listen to at 1.2 or 1.3 speed, depending on

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:10,500
the lecture, America's founding ideas, failures of early American governments, dilemma, dilemmas

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,420
of the Constitutional Convention, ratification of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,700
first federalist power, first federal powers, Hamilton's Bank, and this goes on and I'm

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,660
not going to read all 24 of these, but you get the idea.

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,020
Nice thing about these, you start a lecture and it remembers where you're located in the

19
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,660
lecture, such that if you stop and come back, it's right there, or if you skip into another

20
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:41,820
lecture, maybe you even change courses, literally, and then you come back to this course, it

21
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,020
picks up right where you left off.

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:52,340

It's a great way to spend your time.

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:25,020
All right, this one is brought to you by Wren, W-R-E-N, Wren, Wren is a startup that's making

30
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,980
it easy for all of us to work toward making a difference in the coming climate crisis.

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,660
I don't think it's an existential crisis, as you've heard me say here, I think it's

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,900
the kind of problem that we can solve in the long run if we all do just a little bit of

33
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,780
changes in our actions.

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,860
And here with Wren, they're not talking about, you should use less carbon, make a lower carbon

35
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,860
footprint.

36
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,060
No, they will calculate for you what your carbon footprint is, information you give them,

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,380
obviously, and then they will plant trees.

38
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,460
And in your name, to counter, well, you get involved in all this, but they plant the trees

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:10,420
for you and do other things that help sequester CO2 gases and in the long run, lower the average

40
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,860
global temperature.

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,660
In the long run, again, not, no, there's a collective action problem, no one of us can

42
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,220
make a difference, much of a difference at all, but collectively, if enough of us do

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,540
it, and particularly if we get momentum, then we can make a change.

44
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,100
And again, I think in the coming years, decades, centuries, it'll be fine.

45
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,300
We will recover from this.

46
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,820
We will solve this problem just like we did the ozone, hole in the ozone problem.

47
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,260
And we did that through collective action against that, and that's what Wren wants you

48
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,260
to do.

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,500
So, here's the deal.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:53,780
If you go to Wren.co slash Shermer, W-R-E-N dot CO slash Shermer, they will plant 10 extra

51
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,020
trees in your name.

52
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,020
That's pretty cool.

53
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
I did it.

54
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
I think it's cool.

55
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,540
I calculated my carbon footprint and so on.

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,460
And if enough of us do it, it will make a difference.

57
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
So check it out.

58
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,980
That's W-R-E-N dot CO slash Shermer, Wren.co slash Shermer, and you'll be on your way.

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,980
It's a cool thing.

60
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,980
Check it out.

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,140
Thank you to that company for supporting this podcast.

62
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,700
As you know, we don't have a lot of advertisers on here, and I would only have people that

63
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,780
are doing something that we support and that I personally support.

64
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Thanks for listening.

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,940
Here's our episode.

66
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,420
My guest today is Tim Palmer.

67
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,660
He is a Royal Society Research Professor in the Department of Physics at the University

68
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
of Oxford.

69
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,540
He pioneered the development of operational ensemble weather and climate forecasting,

70
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,540
and in 2007, he was formally recognized as having contributed to the Intergovernmental

71
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,660
Panel on Climate Changes Nobel Peace Prize.

72
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,340
Palmer is a commander of the British Empire, a CBE, which is pretty cool, and a fellow

73
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,980
of the Royal Society, FRS, and the National Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the

74
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,620
Institute of Physics, Dirac Gold Medal.

75
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,220
He lives near Oxford.

76
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,740
Tim, nice to see you.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,220
Thanks for coming on the show.

78
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
Hi.

79
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Thank you.

80
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Great pleasure.

81
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,020
You can imagine, I love the title of your book.

82
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,420
This is the book we're discussing today, The Primacy of Doubt, given in as much as that

83
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:23,980
I publish a magazine called Skeptic, and might as well be called Doubt.

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,860
The subtitle is From Quantum Physics to Climate Change, How the Science of Uncertainty Can

85
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,340
Help Us Understand Our Chaotic World.

86
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,660
We'll be releasing this conversation the week this book comes out, so congratulations.

87
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
I love the book.

88
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,420
It was a really fun, interesting read, well-written.

89
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,420
Anybody can understand it, even though there's some technical science in it, but that's a

90
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,060
sign of good science writing, in my opinion.

91
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,260
Let me just open with the epigrams here you have from Richard Feynman, in which you write

92
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,500
quoting him, our freedom to doubt was born of a struggle against authority in the early

93
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,700
days of science.

94
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,100
It was a very deep and strong struggle.

95
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,300
Permit us to question, to doubt.

96
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,340
That's all, not to be sure.

97
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,980
So I'd gathered Feynman as something of a role model for you, or hero, or just somebody

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,780
to admire.

99
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,280
Absolutely.

100
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,980
I mean, Feynman's a role model, I think, for pretty much any physicist.

101
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,540
My background was in physics and theoretical physics, so he figured very strongly in my

102
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,940
education.

103
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,940
Maybe I could add the second quote in that thing, which is that the actual phrase, the

104
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,460
primacy of doubt, came from a quote by James Glick, who did a wonderful biography of Feynman.

105
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,500
And Glick says, yeah, he believed in the prime, he, Feynman, believed in the primacy

106
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,180
of doubt, not as a blemish on our ability to know, but as the essence of knowing.

107
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,180
And I kind of find that a very kind of profound statement that, you know, what characterizes

108
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,460
us humans and our knowledge and our ability to think and reason and so on, is intimately

109
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,940
connected to the fact that we are infallible, we make mistakes, you know, we're not computers

110
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,820
that just run the same old programs over and over again, getting the same answers.

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,060
So there's something profound about the human condition and the notion of uncertainty or

112
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,860
doubt.

113
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,900
I want to spend some time on that, but first I'm going to do a slight detour from your

114
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,300
first page of your author's note to give some biographical background, and then I'm going

115
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,860
to segue into how you ended up doing what you're doing as an example of chance and contingency

116
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,260
in how lives turn out, so you'll see where I'm going with this.

117
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,820
So here's a quote from you, I studied for a PhD in the 1970s researching Einstein's theory

118
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,940
of general relativity, Einstein had become a hero of mine by the time I was a teenager.

119
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,700
I was lucky, the 1970s were considered have been a golden age for general relativity theory.

120
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,500
At the first scientific conference I ever attended in 1974, I literally heard Stephen

121
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,220
Hawking, he hadn't lost his voice, announced his most important and famous result that

122
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,500
black holes aren't truly black, but radiate quantum particles.

123
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,980
That's Hawking radiation, right?

124
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,340
Well first of all, what was that, what was that, well let me continue because you end

125
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,180
up with a great story here.

126
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,380
My research supervisor Dennis Siamma, Hawking's PhD supervisor some years earlier was ecstatic

127
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
about this result.

128
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,020
Siamma was optimistic that we were on the verge of understanding how to unify Einstein's

129
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,300
theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the theory that successfully describes

130
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,820
atoms and elementary particles.

131
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,820
There were problems however, one problem which frustrated Siamma was that Hawking's calculations

132
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,740
were a little arcane, Siamma was convinced that there must be a more physically transparent

133
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
way of deriving such an important result.

134
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,260
He started to look at alternative ideas based on concepts from a field of physics called

135
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

136
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,900
Siamma asked me to look at what is called the principle of maximum entropy production,

137
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,380
something I hadn't heard at the time.

138
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,860
Toward the end of my PhD research I had become an expert on black holes and was successful

139
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,780
in securing a postdoctoral position in Hawking's group at Cambridge.

140
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,500
All seems set for a career as a theoretical gravitational physicist.

141
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,380
Indeed, why would you want to do anything else?

142
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,020
I mean you're at the peak there and yet you ended up doing something completely different.

143
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Yeah, it's a good question and I often, well actually I don't often but people often

144
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:36,540
say to me, what would your career have been like had you stayed?

145
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,820
I think there were two things.

146
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:50,900
One is that, let me tell you a story, I used to very frequently, parties and Oxford people

147
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,420
would ask me, some really attractive young lady would come up and ask me what I would

148
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,780
do and I would say black holes and she'd go, wow that's fantastic, wow that's incredible,

149
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,580
black holes, wow that's incredible.

150
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,820
Just tell me a bit more about what you do.

151
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,620
So okay, so you want to know a bit more detail, well I research into gravitational energy

152
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,980
momentum from black holes and how I'm looking for mathematical solutions for the quasi-locality

153
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,100
problem which involves looking at tenses over the tangent bundle to phase space and mappings

154
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
down onto space.

155
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:36,900
Anyway, so I've got half of these sentences and you can see starting to lose, very rapidly

156
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,620
lose interest.

157
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,460
So the point is that when you're doing research you're really doing kind of nitty gritty mathematical

158
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,620
details on probably kind of really infinitesimally small parts of a theory and at some stage

159
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:01,860
you ask yourself, well am I going to crack the really big problem with what I'm doing?

160
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:10,420
Because after all what I'm doing affects nobody, it's not really of any great service to humankind,

161
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,020
I'm doing this just for the sort of hell of it if you like to, I mean some sense advanced

162
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,140
physics, so I bet advanced physics in a pretty fundamental way I guess was my thinking and

163
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,900
the more I thought about what I was doing at a very, very detailed technical level I

164
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:32,700
was kind of decided, I was just making small inroads into a very big problem that I wasn't

165
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,660
likely to solve and the big problem which is actually still a problem to this day is

166
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,860
how to reconcile quantum mechanics and gravitation.

167
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:50,100
It sounds fascinating but unless you have some very specific ideas, you're either going

168
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,060
following along dotting eyes and crossing T's from some other person's work or you have

169
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,060
your own idea about how to make progress and at the time I didn't have any great ideas

170
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,180
so I got more and more thinking well maybe I should spend most of my career at least

171
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,260
doing stuff that is more relevant and hopefully useful to my fellow human beings and that

172
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,020
kind of led me ultimately to my, I have to say my parents dismay, I mean they obviously

173
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:23,020
wanted me to go to Cambridge and work with Hawking and so on but in the end I decided

174
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,820
to do something different and all I could say is it's worked out really well.

175
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:34,660
I actually continue to kind of, you know in the what spare time I have I continue to probe

176
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,180
some of these issues about quantum mechanics but fundamentally most of my kind of active

177
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,380
career has been much more in the climate and weather science which I, you know, I believe

178
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:52,540
I have made some impacts on how we perceive weather and climate so I think it's been a

179
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:58,020
good decision but of course it's a counterfactual to know what the alternative would have been

180
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,820
like but my gut feeling is it wouldn't have been as good.

181
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
Interesting, yeah.

182
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:09,780
So give us some sense of before we dive into all that research, what was it like to work

183
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,820
with Stephen Hawking?

184
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,140
What was he like as a person and how did you work as his condition worsened?

185
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:24,180
Well, no, I mean Stephen, Stephen was in Cambridge and my, my Dennis Sharma who, who

186
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,980
supervised me with, with Stephen's supervisor was based in Oxford.

187
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:34,380
Dennis had been in Cambridge so when he supervised Stephen as a PhD student he was in Cambridge

188
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,100
but he moved to Oxford in the early 70s.

189
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:47,260
So my biggest two influences were Dennis Sharma himself but also Roger Penrose who, who had

190
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,620
moved again fairly very recently from Birkbeck College in London to Oxford to the Mathematics

191
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:01,220
Institute in Oxford in the early 70s and I mean Roger was a phenomenal person, well still

192
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,300
is of course, he's won a Nobel Prize a couple of years ago and still very active in his

193
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:13,220
90s but he was, you know, he was a kind of Richard Feynman of general relativity.

194
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,020
So as, as Richard Feynman is to high energy particle physics, so Roger Penrose is to and

195
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:24,220
certainly was in those days to general relativity and in particular black hole physics and

196
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,500
all that sort of stuff.

197
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,580
And I have to say I, I kind of probably, you know, some of my skepticism about traditional

198
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,700
quantum mechanics and quantum field theory and stuff like that which goes into standard

199
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:44,180
particle physics probably came from interacting with Roger Penrose in those days, Roger, Roger.

200
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,260
Roger's carried on the, I guess Roger's carried on the tradition from Einstein if you like

201
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,060
of being somewhat skeptical about quantum mechanics even though experimentally it seems

202
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,820
to be a very accurate theory.

203
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:05,180
So I didn't have much interaction with Stephen during my PhD, I met him a few times.

204
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:12,740
Of course, you know, soon after I heard him speak, I mean he was, it was difficult, you

205
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,180
know, he'd already almost lost his voice when he gave that talk in the conference I went

206
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,740
to but he hadn't quite lost it but he was, you know, it was difficult to, you know, his

207
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,260
speaking was difficult so it was difficult to understand him and it became increasingly

208
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,700
difficult to communicate with him.

209
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,780
So I would say my, you know, the communications I had with Stephen were pretty limited, unfortunately.

210
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,820
But you know, if I had gone to Cambridge they would have obviously improved but that didn't

211
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
happen.

212
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Yeah.

213
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,220
Yeah, just, just because I'm curious, what's the problem to be solved?

214
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,380
Why does quantum physics need to be righted with general relativity, why can't there just

215
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,580
be two different physics for two different levels and just leave it at that?

216
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:07,660
Well, because we think there is a domain where the two will overlap.

217
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:16,260
So for example, we can currently send, I mean the sort of iconic experiment that demonstrates

218
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,220
the quantum nature of particles is what's called the two slit experiment.

219
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:27,780
So the two slit experiment, you know, was originally done for light, you know, beams

220
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,260
of light in the, in the 19th century by Thomas Young.

221
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,660
So you take a beam of light and you pass it through two slits and you get this kind of

222
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:43,060
funny, what's called diffraction pattern in a screen behind the two slits where you get

223
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,180
regions of the screen which are very light and then other regions which are dark.

224
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,260
And the explanation is when you have light waves, the waves are kind of interfering to

225
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,980
create, to create regions of darkness.

226
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,140
Now the extraordinary thing is that if you, if you, so in the 20th century it was realized

227
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,300
you could send particles of light through one at a time, these are photons.

228
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:16,380
And again, the pattern, you send them through these two slits and this pattern of light and

229
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,900
dark kind of emerges even though the particles go through this one slit or the other, you

230
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
know, one at a time.

231
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,340
So it's a real mystery to know how, even to this day, it's still a mystery as to why

232
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,500
this interference pattern builds up.

233
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,020
But that's a quantum phenomenon.

234
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Now over the years people have sent heavier and heavier particles.

235
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:43,700
So photons, yes, do that, do it with electrons, then you can do it with individual atoms.

236
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,780
And now people even talking about, you know, sending little sort of bacteria through slits

237
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,060
and getting interference patterns.

238
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:57,220
So then the question arises, what happens when you send particles that are so massive

239
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,140
that you can detect their gravitation, their own self gravitation?

240
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:09,700
And this is something we can't quite do yet experimentally, but we'll soon be able to,

241
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,180
I think, in a matter of years.

242
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:18,180
And it's really an important question as to whether sort of particles whose gravity you

243
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,820
can detect will still show this interference phenomenon or not.

244
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:30,700
So whether it does or it doesn't means that, you know, for what it's worth, my betting

245
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,460
is that once you detect the gravitation of a particle, you won't see this interference

246
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
effect.

247
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,100
But, you know, other people will say otherwise.

248
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:47,500
But basically that is testing a kind of a regime in physics where both quantum mechanics

249
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,180
and gravity are simultaneously important.

250
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,500
And so we kind of, we need a theory to describe that situation.

251
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,740
What the theory is, as I say, is open for grabs.

252
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,860
And then, you know, in the whole kind of nature in a more esoteric way, the nature of the

253
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,740
say the big bang, the beginning of the universe, and what goes on in the center of black holes

254
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,980
is, you know, it will be impossible to properly understand without having this combined understanding

255
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,540
of gravity and quantum mechanics in a single theory together.

256
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,980
So there are good reasons why we need this, but, you know, it's been, it is absolutely

257
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,780
the holy grail in theoretical physics.

258
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,420
And as I say, my supervisor, when Hawking announced his result, he thought, oh, well,

259
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,580
we'll solve this problem within two or three years.

260
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,260
But, you know, over, well, 50 years later, basically, we're still struggling.

261
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,740
And the solutions, and still I don't think in sight, either.

262
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,460
I'm not sure if this is applicable, but jumping ahead to your chapter on consciousness, you

263
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,500
discussed Roger Enrose and Stuart Hameroff's theory of consciousness.

264
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,140
And I should note, parenthetically, there's like 27 different theories that are floating

265
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,820
around out there.

266
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,060
So I think we're a long ways from any one of them being obviously right.

267
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,540
But there, you know, their idea that inside neurons are these little microtubules that

268
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,580
are like scaffolding that hold the cell together.

269
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,220
And inside the microtubules, there is these little quantum effects that can be measured

270
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:26,860
and that their idea is that if I get this straight, there's kind of a correlation between

271
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:33,500
the neurons in a brain that the wave function is collapsing in some kind of synchronized

272
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,380
way and out of that, you will get this kind of consciousness, whatever we mean by that,

273
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,460
you know, sort of aware of being aware of being aware in some level, something like that.

274
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:49,580
But then the counter to that when that first came out was that, well, those quantum effects

275
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,700
apply at the subatomic level, but neurons fire it at a molecular size level.

276
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,580
These are, you know, massive, you know, chemical molecules going between these neurons and

277
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,100
these synaptic gaps and operating like a lock and key molecules and so on, and that that

278
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,260
would wash out that.

279
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,660
Now, last time I talked to Stuart about this, he said, no, no, there's quantum effects at

280
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,060
the macro level now and so on.

281
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,260
And I haven't followed closely that research, but so kind of walk us through some of that.

282
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:25,420
Well, I mean, I think you're right to say that this is still a very uncertain area of

283
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,180
science, both from, you know, physically, exactly how quantum mechanics operates in

284
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
the brain.

285
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:40,980
And secondly, whether quantum processes are fundamental for consciousness, I personally,

286
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:48,500
well, personally, I do think quantum processes are important in the brain.

287
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,860
I'll give you an example of this in just a second.

288
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:58,900
But I also do, I'm inclined to Penrose's view, you know, because his ideas about

289
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:05,060
consciousness were very much motivated by the question of whether computers, you know,

290
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,100
can understand things, really understand things in the way we understand things.

291
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,900
And I still think, you know, the example he used in his, his original book, The Emperor's

292
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,140
New Mind, of what's called Gerdl's theorem, which basically says there are aspects of

293
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,740
mathematics that, you know, can't be described with algorithms.

294
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,420
So, you know, there are truth, there are things that are true, but are not provably true

295
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,580
with a with an algorithm.

296
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,620
Now, a computer by definition is something that works using an algorithm.

297
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:47,620
So a computer by definition cannot understand this, this kind of notion of Gerdl's theorem.

298
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,620
Whereas we humans can understand it.

299
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,700
I mean, if you read, you know, if you read through it, you can follow each step and you

300
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,100
say, OK, yeah, I get, I get all that.

301
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,660
So his, so Penrose's point is to say, well, if that's true, there must be something that

302
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,740
the human brain is doing, which is not like just an algorithm that a computer runs on.

303
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,420
So I find that actually, all those, I know some people are not convinced, but I find

304
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,300
that a fairly sort of powerful, generic kind of idea.

305
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:28,260
Now, I've, I was, I mean, one of, one of the things which has interested me over the years,

306
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,620
because I use in my professional climate work, I use computers a lot and really, really

307
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,460
big computers, like the biggest computers that there are in the world.

308
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:45,260
And in fact, I, I, you know, I, I, I spent a lot of my time advocating for the fact that

309
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,260
in climate science, we need even bigger computers than when we can get at the moment.

310
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,900
If we really want to get down to the nitty gritty of climate change, we need much bigger

311
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,660
computers or access to much bigger computers.

312
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:03,020
But there's a really interesting kind of anomaly between the human brain and, and a

313
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,500
computer, which is that computers are unbelievably energy intensive.

314
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:16,420
So these computers, you know, which do all these calculations are consuming tens of megawatts

315
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,100
of power.

316
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,420
And most of that power is actually used to move data around from one bit of a computer

317
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:22,940
to another.

318
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,940
Now, in the human brain, we actually, I mean, the optical, you know, the optical nerves

319
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,820
are actually transporting pretty much as much data into the brain as a big supercomputer

320
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,780
moves around.

321
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,300
And it processes all that data from the outside world, you know, tries to make sense of, of

322
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,820
what we perceive and so on.

323
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,700
But it does it all on 20 watts.

324
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,260
So six orders of magnitude less than a, than a computer does.

325
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,060
So supercomputer.

326
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:58,380
So I think that's a kind of, I mean, I, you know, I'm totally convinced that, you know,

327
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:04,060
there are some big clues in that, that, you know, trying to just emulate the brain on a

328
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:09,420
supercomputer is kind of missing the point, which is that it does it on 20 watts on a light bulb,

329
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,260
what a light bulb takes to, to light.

330
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:18,500
Now, so I've been certainly interested in trying to understand why the brain does what it

331
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,820
does on such a low amount of, of energy.

332
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:27,500
And I came across a really interesting paper by some physicists and neuroscientists from

333
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,700
Austria.

334
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Gustav Bernreider is one of them, who's somebody I've met a couple of times now.

335
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:43,340
And what they have realized is that to, you talk about new neurons and sending signals

336
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,860
along these axons of neurons.

337
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,260
So these long sort of wires, if you like.

338
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,220
Now, the point is that the signals have to be boosted every, every short distance, because

339
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,500
otherwise they would just dissipate in the sort of noisy environment.

340
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,660
And they do that with kind of what you might call protein transistors.

341
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,540
You know, that's the analogy of a transistor amplifying a signal, but it's done with these,

342
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:21,220
with these, well, what are basically ion channels, so electrically charged atoms or yes, are fed

343
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:29,100
through the walls of neurons in a controlled way, which boosts the signal that propagates

344
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,780
along the neuron.

345
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:37,820
Now, what these scientists have realized is that if you did this, if you, if these protein

346
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:44,140
transistors were acting purely in a classical way, so non quantum way, the amount of energy

347
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:50,740
you would need to, to do the signal boosting would just be more than is available by, by

348
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,300
a long way.

349
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,820
And what they have realized is that it's actually a very quantum mechanical process, which allows

350
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,540
these protein transistors to operate.

351
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:07,820
So here, quantum mechanics is acting in a way to reduce the energy demand on the brain.

352
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,700
So it's one of the, and there may well be other examples of how quantum mechanics allows

353
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,740
the brain to do things which at a classical level would be impossible or just take too

354
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,460
much energy.

355
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,100
Now, I don't know whether, you know, Stuart Hammerhoff and Roger Penrose's microtubules

356
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,820
would actually come under that category that they're from an energetic point of view, they're

357
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,940
something where quantum physics can do things much more energetically efficiently than classical

358
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,300
physics.

359
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,980
But certainly this whole area of neuron propagation, I think, is a great example of where quantum

360
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,580
mechanics can step in and say, I can do this much cheaper than you could ever do with classical

361
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,180
physics.

362
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,220
And this has got to be surely a kind of an important message for, you know, building

363
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:02,660
computers which make much more efficient use of energy, which at the moment we don't, we

364
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,180
don't do.

365
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,580
So, so yeah, so there's lots of uncertainties here, but I do think, you know, that's an example

366
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,540
of where quantum mechanics probably does play a really important role in the brain.

367
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:20,420
And, and I think, I mean, this is another issue, but I do think the whole, I mean, it's

368
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,980
something I discuss in the book, you may not, we may not want to go into details now, but

369
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:30,420
the whole question of free will and consciousness, I think it actually is bound up with the role

370
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,420
that quantum mechanics plays in the brain.

371
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,460
Well, we can get into it because this is super interesting stuff.

372
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,180
I've had most of the big consciousness people on the show, Matthew Cobb and Christoph

373
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:47,100
Koch and Neil Seth and Jeffrey Goff and John Joe McThadden, you know, they've all, you know,

374
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,260
presented their ideas.

375
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,380
I guess my one beef I have is that this often turns on language.

376
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:59,660
My favorite science cartoon is Sydney Harris's cartoon with the two mathematicians at the

377
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,260
chalkboard and with the complex equations and then in the middle, he says, and then a

378
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,140
miracle happens.

379
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,660
And the other one says, I think you need to be more explicit here in step two, often feel

380
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,580
like, you know, right, you know, and then and then the microtubules and the wave function

381
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:20,300
and then consciousness or and then, you know, the the the waves, the kind of electromagnetic

382
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,860
waves that the EEG is picking up and then consciousness to me, it often feels like and

383
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,740
then a miracle or emergence, you know, complexity theory, emergence and then emergence happens

384
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,820
and consciousness to me, it often feels like and then a miracle happened.

385
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,260
Right, right, right.

386
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,420
Well, I understand that.

387
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:46,460
And well, OK, so, I mean, I discuss consciousness a little bit, and I'll give you my definition

388
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,220
of consciousness in a second.

389
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:54,060
But let me precede it with saying something about free will.

390
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:04,300
And I I've got interest, I mean, I'm interested in free will because it appears

391
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:11,980
I say appears because there's some controversy about this.

392
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,820
But in in standard, so so I need to backtrack.

393
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:27,980
So in the book, I discuss a lot about whether the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics,

394
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:34,060
you know, which anyone who knows anything about quantum mechanics knows this thing called

395
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:41,140
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is really, really difficult to understand.

396
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:48,460
Because normally, when we think about uncertainty, for example, in weather forecasting, as an

397
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:55,180
example of, you know, of a chaotic system, and a chaotic system is one where, you know,

398
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:01,460
very small uncertainties in the initial conditions for a weather forecast can can lead to a very

399
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,820
different prediction of weather.

400
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,780
So, you know, you we could say that we are uncertain about what the weather's going to

401
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:16,860
be like in a couple of weeks time, because we humans don't have perfect knowledge of

402
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,460
today's weather, we can't like measure it absolutely everywhere, all the little worlds

403
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,580
and eddies and so on.

404
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:30,580
So uncertainty is in those in that context, and in most context in which people use the

405
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:37,380
word kind of reflects what would be called a kind of epistemic uncertainty, in other

406
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:45,180
words, an uncertainty that that we have about the system we're trying to predict or understand.

407
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:53,300
The problem is in quantum mechanics, and I have to say Heisenberg himself, when he wrote

408
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:00,540
some of his first kind of expository articles about the uncertainty principle, he actually

409
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:07,020
tried to explain it in those terms, it's sort of we can't kind of measure stuff arbitrary

410
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
accurately.

411
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,540
And Niels Bohr, who was the, you know, one of the great grandfathers pioneers of quantum

412
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,620
mechanics, you know, took Heisenberg to task, he said, No, this is not right.

413
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,900
Whatever uncertainty is in quantum mechanics is different.

414
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,540
It's, it's, you know, the word philosophers would use is ontological.

415
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,900
There's something inherently uncertain in the equations of quantum mechanics.

416
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:41,540
So that's the standard, that's the standard view, which personally, I, I don't actually

417
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,620
believe, but that's a very controversial view.

418
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,660
So yeah, yeah, so I go into quite a lot in, in the book about, so what, what is the, you

419
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:58,980
know, if you had to say one reason why people don't think that uncertainty is epistemic and

420
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,860
is more ontological, they would probably cite something called Bell's theorem, Bell's inequality,

421
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,660
which is a kind of an experimental test, which seems to suggest that there is no kind of

422
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:17,740
definite, that quantum reality is not definite, it's something sort of indeterministic and

423
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,620
sort of, I don't know, it's difficult to use words actually here because it, it doesn't kind

424
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,500
of, it doesn't match with anything that we sort of understand.

425
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,380
So in the book, in my book, I go into Bell's theorem quite a bit.

426
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,820
Now Bell's theorem, as it's usually phrased, so I'm coming around to your question, Bell's

427
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:43,820
theorem as it's usually phrased involves the issue of free will.

428
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:52,260
So in Bell's theorem, you imagine experimenters who measure, you know, they just do simple

429
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,100
measurements on particles, like measuring their spin.

430
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:03,780
But an important ingredient in Bell's theorem is that although an experimenter actually

431
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,940
measured the spin of a particle in a certain direction or with the apparatus oriented in

432
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:15,700
a certain way, they could have measured the spin in a different way.

433
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,660
So in other words, the standard way in which Bell's theorem, which seems to suggest quantum

434
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:28,900
uncertainty is, is ontological, requires this notion of, well, it requires this notion of

435
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,420
counterfactual worlds, where the experimenter did other than what they actually did.

436
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:46,620
And I have been using ideas from chaos theory, and in particular, the mathematics of the

437
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,140
geometry of chaos.

438
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:54,620
So underpinning chaos is this wonderful, wonderfully beautiful, fantastically, just incredible

439
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,780
fractal geometry.

440
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,780
And fractals have gaps.

441
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,860
So if you look at a fractal, it's always got little gaps.

442
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,180
And the gaps, you know, you zoom in, and there are gaps within the gaps and the gaps and so on,

443
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,980
they get smaller and smaller, but they're always there.

444
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:19,380
And my claim is that some of these crucial counterfactual experiments correspond to points

445
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,260
that lie in the gaps in these fractals.

446
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:27,140
So in your, if your theory is based on these fractals, then these, these counterfactual

447
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:35,620
experiments would actually be disallowed by, by this theory.

448
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,820
And so this, this actually provides a way of getting around this, this Bell's theorem.

449
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,260
However, so we're coming to your point now, the point people say, well, yeah, but you know, I do

450
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,860
have free will, I could have done this experiment, you know, that's what was a typical kind of

451
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,580
reaction.

452
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,580
And so, you know, if it raises the question, well, first of all, raises the question, what is free

453
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:04,860
will, but a question which people don't ask very much, and there's something I've kind of

454
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:15,660
dwelt on in my book, is why do we, why do we humans feel so very viscerally, and kind of almost,

455
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,500
you know, will thump our fists on the table to assert this point that we have free will, what

456
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,060
is it that actually makes it such a, you know, I'm sure a computer doesn't have this feeling

457
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:31,740
of free will. So what is it that makes us feel we have free will. So this is where I think,

458
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,020
again, quantum mechanics in the brain could be playing a role. So this is my hypothesis that

459
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:48,780
see, because I, I do actually believe that ultimately, the laws of physics are deterministic.

460
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,220
So there are no, there's no kind of randomness in the, in the equations of physics, ultimately,

461
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:02,780
that things are deterministic. But you see, so the question is what distinguishes

462
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:08,380
quantum mechanics from ordinary classical mechanics. And this is where this idea of,

463
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:15,660
this is going to be sound a little bit, a little bit kind of weird, perhaps, but I can assure you

464
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,620
there is mathematics that will pin that will sort of back this up, that we don't want to go into it

465
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:27,740
now. But the idea is that these, the, I mentioned these kind of fractal attractors. The idea is

466
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:39,740
that quantum mechanics feels so it, you see, we can think of our world as the world evolving

467
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,860
that we perceive to be a particular sort of solution of the equations of physics.

468
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,620
But there are nearby solutions in some kind of more abstract solution space, if you like,

469
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:01,420
with slightly different initial conditions. And quantum mechanics kind of feels these

470
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:08,700
neighboring solutions in a way which classical physics doesn't. It kind of feels the geometry

471
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,660
of this fractal attractor, if you can sense, if you like, little neighborhoods of this geometry.

472
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:23,260
And my, my feeling is that what we think of as free will is a very sort of weak and imprecise

473
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:32,940
perception of these neighboring solutions, which we would interpret as worlds where we did otherwise.

474
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,060
So my belief is our really strong visceral feeling about free will comes from

475
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,300
this notion of sort of alternative solutions in this abstract solution space.

476
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:49,900
All right, so then I got thinking about, so I got to come to consciousness because that links to

477
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,500
consciousness. Okay, but Tim, let's, let's, let's halt for just a second, because there's a lot

478
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,540
of jargon on there I want to unpack. And this could be the core question for the entire book,

479
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:04,380
that that is to what extent is uncertainty built into the system itself, and is not just

480
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,380
a limitation of our knowledge. So the latter would be epistemic, the former would be ontological.

481
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:18,540
So here I have, from my coin collection in 1883, silver dollar, 18, yeah, 1883 silver dollar,

482
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:24,220
says in God we trust on there. So they've been putting that on the coins since the 1800s.

483
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:30,220
So if I flip the coin, and just do my little flip here, and, and okay, it's tails, all right,

484
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:35,820
so I flip it again, boom. And this time it's tails, so two in a row, and so I do this 10 times or 100

485
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,380
times. And so we know that I would, I would say, well, I got a 5050 chance because it's not a

486
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:48,300
rig coin. But that, that's only because I just don't know all the, all the particles and the wind

487
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,460
currents in my room here or whatever. Are you saying that if, if Laplace's demon was real,

488
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,580
or it was the equivalent of a magician that is doing a trick and so knows 100% what the outcome

489
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:06,220
is going to be, or, or God is, you know, knows his omniscient and tell, or is it that even with

490
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,260
the best all the knowledge we have, you would still cannot predict with 100% certainty the

491
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,380
flip of the coin because of something built into the physical system itself?

492
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:29,100
Well, okay, so what, if I, if I wear my, like, conventional physics hat, you know, if I, if you,

493
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:36,140
if you ask me that question, to me, a physicist, and I'm a representative of the,

494
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,780
you know, the conventional physics community, so I'm giving you the kind of conventional

495
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:52,220
answer, then I would say that in quantum mechanics, so if you were flipping, if you like an atom,

496
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,220
if you like or an electron or something, if you're doing the equivalent of this coin flip

497
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:03,500
to a quantum mechanical system, like an electron or an atom, then the uncertainty would not be

498
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:13,980
because you didn't know something about the atom. It, it, it, it, it would be because there is

499
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:25,420
something inherently uncertain and undeterministic about the equations for, for the quantum system.

500
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,820
So I have to be slightly technical, because when you, you, you, when you, you do two things,

501
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:36,940
when you do the equivalent of a coin flip to an atom, you flip the atom in some sense,

502
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,140
but then you have to look at it to measure, you actually have to see

503
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,300
whether it's kind of up or down, if you like heads or tails, quantum heads or quantum tails.

504
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:54,300
And the traditional view is that the actual process of looking to see whether it's up or down,

505
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,420
which is called measurement, introduces some inherently uncertain, indeterministic

506
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,540
kind of physics. So that's, that's the standard. So that is different to the epistemic uncertainty,

507
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:12,220
where it's just something about the coin that you don't know. Now Einstein famously

508
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,220
thought that was bunk, because he, his, his very famous statement, God does not play dice,

509
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:26,300
was exactly, you know, making the point that that's ridiculous. I mean, how can it be that

510
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,980
nature has indeterministic equations doesn't make sense to him. And of course, Schrodinger

511
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,060
thought it was nonsense as well. Schrodinger was with Heisenberg was one of the two founding

512
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:42,700
fathers for the basic laws of quantum mechanics that we now use every day in many different

513
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:50,220
areas of physics. And his famous cat is, is, is an example of that. So the cat, you know,

514
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:57,260
the cat's in the box, you have a little atom, which may or may not decay has a probability of

515
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:05,020
decaying. And again, quantum mechanically, you have to say, after say 10 minutes, there's

516
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:12,220
the, the atom is like half decayed and half not decayed in some weird sense. But the idea is if

517
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:18,940
the, if it has decayed, it breaks a capsule cyanide and kills the cat. So then you say, well,

518
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:27,500
what states the cat in? And the state of the cat is not just that you don't know whether the cat's

519
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,820
alive or dead, you open a box and you can see whether it's alive or dead. But quantum mechanics

520
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:37,900
says inside that box before you've looked at it, the cat is neither alive nor dead. There's some

521
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:44,060
inherent uncertainty about the aliveness or deadness of the cat. Now Schrodinger introduced

522
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:49,740
that example, not to say that cats are both alive and dead at the same time, but because

523
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,980
that's a completely daft idea. It's just stupid. And he wanted to really to make the point that

524
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,300
there's something wrong with quantum mechanics, even though he was one of the fathers of quantum

525
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:07,900
mechanics, he realized there was something wrong with it. And so in the book, I try to

526
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:17,420
develop ideas which might take us back. And I'm not in any way claiming I have a complete

527
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:24,220
theory. I have, I mean, I have, I have a theory to the extent that I have papers published in the

528
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,620
peer reviewed literature, and I certainly don't go into any technical details in the book.

529
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:34,700
But it's, I'm trying to show a path, if you like, where, which might take us back

530
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:44,940
towards a more kind of sensible, I suppose, theory of, of quantum physics where uncertainty

531
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:50,380
is again, epistemic. So the fact that we don't know whether the cat is alive or dead

532
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,660
is just because we don't know all the details about how that atom decayed. But sure enough,

533
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:01,660
inside the box, the cat would be alive or would be dead. So that's, that's, so that I'm just,

534
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:07,260
you know, I try to go and, and so it, you know, so that, and then that leads to the free will.

535
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,820
And then if we have a minute, we'll talk about consciousness. Yeah, let's stay on free will

536
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:17,660
for a minute, because it first, as you know, Dan Dennett argued that quantum uncertainty doesn't

537
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,180
give you free will because it just throws an element of randomness into the machine.

538
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:27,100
Absolutely, absolutely. So if you just add, that's a really important point. If you just say,

539
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,900
oh, you know, there's something indeterministic about quantum mechanics,

540
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,860
then it just, all that will do for you is that, you know, every time you're making a decision,

541
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,660
it's like, you know, just something random goes into your head. And that's what causes you to

542
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,540
make a decision. But that's clearly not how we make decisions most of the time. We think through

543
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:53,260
things and, you know, analyze things carefully. And free will is not, that's not what free will

544
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:58,860
is. So I totally agree with the Dennett on that point. It seems to turn very much on the question,

545
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,500
could you have done otherwise? So if we have these thought experiments, like, you know,

546
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,860
you rewound the tape and played it again. Well, if it's a read only memory tape, and everything

547
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,740
is just rerun exactly as it was, well, yeah, you'd have to do exactly what you did, because

548
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,380
it's just basically a movie of what happened. But so the question then seems to be,

549
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:26,940
if you could emulate the tape, say tomorrow, where it's pretty close to what happened yesterday,

550
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,660
could you have done otherwise? And so if I'm following you, I think you're saying you could,

551
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:38,380
because you, if you know, particularly if you know the causal factors operating on you, and you know

552
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:45,020
that yesterday this happened. And so tomorrow, I'm going to avoid going there or stepping left,

553
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,660
and I'll go right instead of left, or whatever, because you're aware of what happened. And the

554
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,300
universe can never be completely perfectly replicated from one day to the next. And last,

555
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,060
so here's a key question, the universe is predetermined. So this block universe idea, or there's a

556
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:05,500
God outside of it that knows every particle, and already knows what happened took next week,

557
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,700
just that we don't know. So take it from there.

558
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:19,340
Right. Well, I think you've absolutely hit the nail on the head by saying this whole thing hinges

559
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:25,660
around, you know, could we have done otherwise? So let's just, let's just, let's just analyze that

560
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:34,300
a little bit more carefully. So as you say, you know, you come out of a shop, and, you know,

561
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:41,100
there's a cyclist on the pavement, and the cyclist collides with you and, you know, you're

562
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,780
carted off to hospital with a broken leg or something. And you, you know, that that ruins

563
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,740
your life for the next year or so. And you say to yourself, Oh, if only I had looked,

564
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:59,100
you know, round, I would have seen that bicycle and I would have avoided it. So what you have to

565
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:07,020
do then is you go back to that moment, you're leaving the shop. And you're imagining a world

566
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:14,620
in which everything is the same, the bicycle is still, you know, the cyclist is just right

567
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,140
riding on the, did I use the word pavement, I have to be careful about British English here,

568
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,180
pavement means sidewalk, I think in America. So the cyclists on this on the sidewalk, yeah.

569
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,620
What we would call the pavement, which I think you shouldn't be there. First of all,

570
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:35,900
he shouldn't be there. That's the main point. He shouldn't have been there. But so anyway,

571
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:41,340
but the point is you wind the, you're lying in bed in hospital, and you're winding the

572
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,620
clock back to that moment, you left the shop, and you say, Okay, I'm going to keep everything in the

573
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:53,260
universe fixed. You know, the moons of Jupiter are where they are, the moon is where it is.

574
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:59,500
The cyclist is where he is. And everybody else is where he is. But I do still one small thing

575
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:08,780
differently. I look to my right, let's say. Now, what you're doing is clearly that isn't the real

576
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,340
world. That's not the real world. It's a hypothetical, what we call counterfactual world.

577
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:21,100
So the question to ask is, is that hypothetical world where everything is basically the same,

578
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:28,380
except for one small thing where you've moved your head to the right? Is that new hypothetical

579
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:34,700
world allowed by the laws of physics? Because if it's allowed by the laws of physics,

580
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:42,300
then you can, you know, you can, in principle, imagine then winding time forward again from

581
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:49,260
this slightly altered initial state. And you can, you know, rightly infer that you would have

582
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,580
avoided the cyclist, and therefore you wouldn't be in hospital and all the rest of it.

583
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:03,580
So, so the crucial question is, can we kind of fairly, let's say arbitrarily change

584
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:11,500
initial conditions, and still have states of the world which are consistent with the laws of physics?

585
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,500
Now, in my book, I give this, now you see, sorry, just before I come on to that point,

586
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:28,300
I just want to say in most kind of, in most examples in physics, that is possible. So a good

587
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,580
example is, you know, weather forecasting. We have, we use what are called classical laws of physics

588
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:39,340
for doing weather forecasting. And by classical laws, I mean like Newton's laws of motion

589
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:45,900
applied to fluids like the atmosphere, the atmosphere is the gas and the oceans are,

590
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:55,020
you know, liquids and so on. And according to those equations, we can change initial conditions

591
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:01,580
very slightly. And the equations don't care, actually, the equations will be quite happy

592
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:10,220
with that slightly altered initial condition. But in the book, I talk about how, and I mentioned

593
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:21,500
it just now, certain models of chaos can exhibit this fractal geometry in a kind of abstract

594
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:27,660
space of solutions, which may not be worth going, describing in too much detail here.

595
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:36,460
But if you take the view that this geometry is something sort of fundamental, then

596
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:45,580
actually, it can tell you that there are certain of these counterfactual states which

597
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:54,060
actually aren't consistent with the underlying laws. So in particular, if you have a state of

598
00:51:54,060 --> 00:52:00,780
the world and you add a little, you change it very slightly, but that change takes you into one of

599
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,940
the gaps in the fractal, you know, places where there aren't any, where the fractal is doesn't

600
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:12,780
exist, if you like, a little gap. If we had a diagram I could show you, but people can look up,

601
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:18,300
you know, Cantor sets or Mandelbrot sets and they, they see, they can see these little gaps,

602
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,660
you know, there's always gaps. So if this counterfactual world takes you into a gap,

603
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:33,020
then you're no longer allowed to infer that that, you know, is an allowable state of, of the world.

604
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:43,500
Now, this may or may not happen at the level of, you know, of looking, of looking for bicycles on,

605
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:52,940
on, on, on pavements or sidewalks. But, but I do think it's relevant in asking questions

606
00:52:52,940 --> 00:53:00,220
about measurements on quantum systems. If, if I measure, you know, if I measure the

607
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:09,340
position of a particle, could I also have measured the momentum of a particle and here,

608
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:16,460
you know, this idea of kind of gaps in solution space where you can't do these perturbations

609
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:25,660
arbitrarily. So, so in short, I'm not saying that all counterfactual worlds are impossible,

610
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:32,860
I'm not saying that, but I'm saying certainly in quantum mechanical situations, there may well be

611
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:42,060
counterfactual measurements on, on quantum systems, which actually are forbidden by the,

612
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:49,580
or at least they're forbidden by my, by my approach to quantum mechanics. And that's a way of getting

613
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:54,860
round this Bell's theorem, which is so important in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. So

614
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,500
counterfactuals, we shouldn't, so in other words, we shouldn't be, we shouldn't just take

615
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:07,260
counterfactual definiteness for, you know, as a given that things that we might have done,

616
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,300
but we didn't do are automatically allowed by the laws of physics. Some are allowed,

617
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:18,140
but some definitely aren't allowed. That's, that's my view. Okay, I want to talk more about

618
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:24,780
free will, but first on the weather. So when, when you guys make predictions like there's a 70%

619
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:32,220
chance of rain tomorrow, what you mean is if you ran tomorrow 100 times in your computer models,

620
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:37,900
70 days, it would rain. Now, what if the models were better, like decade from now or a hundred

621
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,420
years from now, and you could say, you know, it's 90% chance of rain. Isn't that still just a

622
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,100
measurement problem? It's an epistemic uncertainty. Or are you saying at some level, it'll never be,

623
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:56,460
you know, 100% predictable because of chaos theory and, and, you know, the butterfly effect and

624
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:05,020
things like that? Well, first of all, you're right that basically in that situation, the

625
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:16,700
uncertainty is, is epistemic. And you're, you're also right to say that as models improve, you

626
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:23,340
know, computers get bigger, we can, we can make our models more realistic. They can include

627
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,780
cloud systems, for example, which current global models can't, can't, can't describe.

628
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,700
Then, then the, the forecast will get more accuracy, more accurate. And, and as you say,

629
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:45,980
that will mean that today, when we say there's a 70% chance of rain, for exactly what the reason

630
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:52,060
sorry, the reason you said that we run an ensemble of say 100 forecasts and in 70 of them it rains

631
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,060
and in 30 it doesn't. So that gives us our probability. But you're right to say that it

632
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:02,380
could well be in, you know, in a decade or two, we'll have got that to 90% rather than 70% by,

633
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:11,420
by improving the models. And just the whole initial conditions will be more accurate. But

634
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:19,180
but I do go into the book in the book a bit that there's a kind of an interesting,

635
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,300
actually even non quantum systems have some strange

636
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:36,620
properties. And I describe quite a lot the, in one chapter, the uncertainty associated with

637
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:44,060
turbulence in fluids and the weather is kind of, you know, like a manifestation of turbulence in,

638
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:53,420
in the whole atmosphere as a fluid. And, and in particular, I talk about the work of, of, of a

639
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,900
meteorologist, American meteorologist called Ed Lorenz, who's, who's pretty much the father of,

640
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:06,540
of a lot of chaos theory. But he actually wrote a paper in 1969 that's actually less well known

641
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:16,540
than his 19 famous 1963 paper, which was the origin of chaos, which is the, how does uncertainty grow

642
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:27,820
in a, a turbulent, so I should say a turbulent fluid. You see, if you look at a turbulent fluid,

643
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:33,820
it's got eddies and whirls, but you can kind of zoom into one of those eddies, and you see smaller

644
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:39,820
eddies, and you can zoom into one of those smaller eddies and see yet smaller eddies. So it's actually

645
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:46,380
got a bit of a kind of self, what we call self similar structure like fractals have. So, you know,

646
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:52,220
you, if you look at a weather, a weather system from a satellite, and then you zoom in to a bit

647
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:56,860
of the weather system, you see clouds. And if you zoom into the clouds, you'd see turbulence

648
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,820
within the clouds. And if you zoomed into the turbulence, you'd see smaller turbulence. Anyway,

649
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:09,340
so Lorentz asked the question, how long would it take for small scale turbulence to, to start to

650
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:15,900
affect uncertainty in the very largest weather scales? And there's a, there's a really kind of,

651
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,980
from a conceptual point of view, there's something very interesting, which he uncovered,

652
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:25,820
which we haven't yet been able to prove mathematically, whether this is actually true or not,

653
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:34,380
which is that the time for uncertainty in a small scale piece of turbulence to affect a large scale

654
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:44,060
piece of turbulence has a fixed time scale. And it doesn't matter how small that uncertainty is in

655
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:50,540
scale, it will take a fixed time, let's say a couple of weeks to affect the uncertainty in the

656
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:56,540
the uncertainty in the very largest scale weather system. And this is actually a little bit different,

657
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:01,100
or this is, in fact, is quite different to normal chaos theory, because in normal chaos theory,

658
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:08,380
the idea is that if you could actually reduce the uncertainty to like an infinitesimally small

659
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,780
amplitude, you could predict as far ahead as you'd like, because you'd kind of suppress the chaos

660
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,460
for as long as you wanted by making the initial uncertainty sufficiently small.

661
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:27,420
But Lorentz conjectured, and you know, with pretty, I would say pretty strong mathematical

662
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:33,260
arguments, but they weren't 100% rigorous, that there is a finite time for uncertainty

663
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:39,420
in a turbulent system to grow to larger scales, no matter how small the uncertainty is.

664
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:45,580
Now, if that's correct, it means that although we'll be able to get that, like as you said,

665
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:53,980
70% to 90% for a weather forecast for, you know, the next few days, we'll probably never be able to

666
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,980
predict in detail the weather beyond two or three weeks, you know, that that's just going to be

667
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:08,540
hopeless. Now, the interesting thing is that this Lorentz's conjecture relates to a

668
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:19,340
problem which appeared at the turn of the millennium. So in 2000, the Clay Mathematics

669
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:28,300
Institute published a list of unsolved mathematical problems to kind of parallel what the famous

670
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:35,740
mathematician David Hilbert announced in 1900. You know, he famously gave an address where he

671
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:43,420
said, these are the most important unsolved problems in mathematics in 1900. And the Clay

672
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,500
Mathematics Institute, you know, with advice from mathematicians around the world,

673
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:53,580
announced a similar list of problems at 2000. And one of them was essentially this problem

674
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:58,940
of turbulence, solving this uncertainty about how uncertainty in turbulence grows.

675
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:07,740
And I could go on about this. I mean, this is this is what actually Lorentz meant by the butterfly

676
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:14,620
effect. It's this notion that a tiny scale disturbance could affect something very large

677
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:21,740
in a finite amount of time. So the butterfly effect actually has been slightly misused over the years.

678
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:29,020
And that's what it really means. So there's a lot of fascinating stuff, you know,

679
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:37,260
even in classical physics about uncertainty. Yeah, so but the butterfly effect,

680
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:43,420
I mean, the flap of a butterfly's wings in the middle of a hurricane isn't going to have any

681
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:50,780
effect at all. It has to be in the very early conditions or when the system is teetering on

682
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:58,220
shifting kind of a change, what they call a change transition point of criticality. I think,

683
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:04,700
yes, there is use that like the, you know, drop grains of sand and you get a little pile going

684
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:09,740
all of a sudden it collapses. And at that moment, the one little grain matters, but most of the

685
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:14,140
time the little one little grain doesn't matter. So it depends on the conditions either early

686
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:19,180
initial conditions or when it's teetering in the balance. So the horseshoe nail doesn't matter

687
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,820
for most of the battle only either early on or if the battle is hanging in the balance.

688
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,860
That's that's that's absolutely right. And you know, I

689
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:42,380
I mean, we talked about my decision to switch fields. Yeah. I mean, one of the things which

690
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:49,580
I like to think, and people may curse, curse me for it possibly, that I have done which has

691
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:54,140
sort of had an impact on people's lives is that I've introduced this notion of probabilistic

692
01:02:55,020 --> 01:03:02,700
forecasting using these ensembles, so running models multiple times with slightly different

693
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:13,660
initial conditions and so on. And, you know, initially, it wasn't so much people, it's not

694
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:20,860
like, I mean, my colleagues were trying to think of the right words sort of skeptical about it.

695
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:29,580
Because, you know, if you if you have to run a weather model 50 times, each for each

696
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:36,220
forecast start date, you know, that takes up a lot of computer time. And, you know, what

697
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:44,460
what they perhaps didn't like was that they had other ideas on how to use that computer time,

698
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:50,780
you know, they'd rather improve the resolution of the model and so on. And they would say, well,

699
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:58,460
you know, most of the time, you know, we, we can forecast a few days out pretty well.

700
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:08,860
But I used to show them, I used to show them results from Lorenz's model of chaos. And I said,

701
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:17,740
look, this is a very sort of generic situation that that you can have within a single chaotic model,

702
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:22,940
a chaotic model, you can have initial conditions that are very predictable, which actually aren't

703
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,740
chaotic at all, or they're not for a long time, you have to integrate them out many, many, many,

704
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:32,460
you know, long period of time before they start showing evidence of unpredictability.

705
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:39,180
And in the very same model, you can find initial conditions where the uncertainty absolutely

706
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:46,460
explodes from the very start date. And, you know, I said, there's no reason why this

707
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:53,820
can't happen for, you know, the real weather. And the problem is, if you, if you, you know,

708
01:04:53,820 --> 01:05:01,100
if you make blatantly wrong forecasts, people lose confidence in you. And around this time,

709
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:08,700
there was just the most, for me, wonderful example of this, which people of my age who

710
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:15,660
are British will know this, because it's kind of, it's kind of etched in our national psyche,

711
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:25,500
if you like, that in 1979, sorry, 1987, the weather forecaster came on the BBC TV,

712
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,540
a guy called Michael Fish, everyone knows this, Michael Fish, everyone British knows it, came on

713
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:37,340
TV and said, it's a kind of interesting story, actually, somebody apparently from France had

714
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:43,180
phoned up to say, they heard somewhere there's a hurricane on the way, is it true? And he just kind

715
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,100
of, he just laughed it off, he said, don't be stupid, you know, we don't have hurricanes in

716
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,660
Britain, there'll be no hurricane, don't worry about that. And then the next morning, there was

717
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:57,900
literally hurricane force winds, hurricane force gusts and, you know, caused, I guess in today's

718
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:04,940
money would be many billions of pounds of damage and people lost their lives and all sorts of chaos

719
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:12,700
ensued. And, you know, the head of the Met Office, they were called for him to resign,

720
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:18,300
the government, you know, had did an inquiry, what, you know, what was, how could, how, you know,

721
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,140
we spend all this money on the weather forecast service, how could they get it so hopelessly

722
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:30,060
wrong, just 12 hours before they weren't, they didn't know about this thing. So, we took a look

723
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:39,100
at this case, and it just is a spectacular example of, of just kind of explosive unpredictability

724
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:46,300
by introducing tiny, tiny flaps of butterflies wings, if you like, or computer types of flaps

725
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:53,020
of butterflies wings. We showed that just within a day or so, the solutions would completely diverge

726
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:59,740
from the most horrendous storms to completely benign weather. And it just, it just made it

727
01:06:59,740 --> 01:07:07,020
completely clear then, there was, I mean, you know, that the only way to sensibly address this issue

728
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:13,180
is to, you know, is to develop an ensemble approach to forecasting where you, you introduce

729
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:19,180
these small uncertainties. By the way, not only in the initial conditions, but also in the model

730
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:24,540
equations. So we introduce noise, and I have a lot of a big chapter in the book about the,

731
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:32,780
the benefit of adding noise into, into certain nonlinear systems. And that leads to more

732
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:37,980
reliable, much more reliable forecasts. And you know when you can trust them, when you can trust

733
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:43,260
the forecast, and when, you know, you've got to be careful. And the really exciting thing about all

734
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:51,500
this is that now humanitarian organizations are using this type of information for deciding when

735
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:59,100
they can be proactive in sending aid and medicine and shelter and water and food and so on, to areas

736
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:05,980
that are potentially, you know, at risk of some extreme weather event. Whereas in the past, in

737
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:11,340
the past, with the old fashioned deterministic forecasts, so where you didn't have any estimate

738
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:16,940
of uncertainty, it was just too risky. They'd run out of money very quickly. If every time there was

739
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:22,940
a, a forecast of an event, you know, they sent, they sent aid out and they just run out of resources

740
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:28,700
immediately. Now what they do is they have a, they know they have a threshold, a probability

741
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:33,340
threshold. And they'd say, if the probability, the forecast probability exceeds this threshold,

742
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:40,220
then we take precautionary proactive action. And they've done a proper, you could, because now you

743
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:46,620
could do a proper cost loss analysis of whether the uncertainty is, is large enough. If it's too

744
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:50,940
large, then obviously all you can do is sit and wait and see what happens. But if the uncertainty

745
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:56,700
of this extreme event is sufficiently small, so that the probability of it exceeds the

746
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:03,820
predetermined threshold, then you know, you know, you have a logical and objective reason for going

747
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:09,180
in and helping people ahead of time. And that's always going to be more effective. But it means

748
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:15,580
they make use of their limited resources in a, in a much more, yeah, kind of objective and

749
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:23,420
way. So, so I, you know, I know people curse probability of rain on their apps and so on.

750
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,860
And I can understand that, you know, why don't they just tell us what it's going to be like.

751
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:34,620
But, you know, this is a case where actually for, you know, really serious extreme weather,

752
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:42,540
this probabilistic approach really is the way to, to, to make informed and logical and objective

753
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:47,980
decisions about whether it's sending aid into a region or evacuating a region or whatever it is.

754
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,860
And really that's, that's where weather forecasting is important.

755
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,140
Yeah, I wonder if you could comment on climate change models related to this. You'll often hear

756
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:00,620
from the climate skeptics. Well, look, you know, the limitations of these computer models, these

757
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:05,580
guys are running out a couple of days or a week. And then it, you know, after that, it's, you know,

758
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:10,460
it's, it's random. So how can you say a century from now, this is where we're going to be. Therefore,

759
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:15,100
we have to take drastic action to cut CO2 gases and so on. What's the difference between those

760
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,260
kind of models and how confident are you that they can make long term predictions?

761
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,220
Right. Well, there's a number of, a number of points there.

762
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:34,220
I think the first point to make is that one shouldn't conflate the weather forecast problem

763
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:42,620
with the climate change problem. And I'll give you a very simple example of what I mean.

764
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:53,340
So I'm, you know, I'm, I'm in my study in, in Southern England. I'm about 20 miles south of

765
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:59,260
Oxford. And we've had a, actually, we've had quite a remarkably warm for Britain anyway,

766
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:05,180
we've had a remarkably warm and dry summer. And today is a, is just another example. I mean,

767
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:12,540
outside the temperatures, probably in the high 20s, which is, we actually hit 40 Celsius,

768
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:16,060
which I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit, well, well over 100, 110 maybe.

769
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:23,100
But look, I can say with complete certainty, I think,

770
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:28,700
99.999% certainly, that in six months time,

771
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:40,460
so in January, it will not be 29 degrees Celsius. Right. And that's because every day the sun,

772
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:48,700
you know, spends a little bit less time in the sky. And, you know, we have an annual cycle.

773
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:54,140
So in other words, there's a kind of a predictable astronomical forcing,

774
01:11:54,860 --> 01:12:00,860
which affects the statistics of weather. Now, I can't say in six months time whether it'll be

775
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:06,300
rainy or dry, but I can say pretty clearly it's going to be colder than it is today.

776
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:14,620
And climate change is, is like that with the, the predictable atmospheric forcing

777
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:23,260
of the annual cycle is now replaced with a predictable increase in,

778
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:32,220
in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere caused by our emissions. So we can say, I think,

779
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:37,180
you know, with pretty much certainty that because most of the governments of the world have said,

780
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:43,660
we will not be reducing our emissions to zero until at least mid century. So we can say that we

781
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:49,180
will continue to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for at least another, say 50 years,

782
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:55,820
possibly more. And as a result of that, carbon dioxide concentrations will increase a year on

783
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:03,420
year for at least the next 50 years, possibly more. And that has a predictable effect on the

784
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:09,980
statistics of weather, just as the seasonal cycle has a predictable effect on the statistics of

785
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:15,100
weather. So it's just a kind of a class error to say, oh, well, because we can't forecast the

786
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,700
detailed evolution of weather beyond a couple of weeks or so, it's hopeless saying anything about

787
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:24,220
climate change a hundred years from now, you're just conflating two completely different types

788
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:28,540
of problem. One is an initial condition problem, the initial weather forecasting. And the other is

789
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:35,740
where you're adding a kind of an external forcing. So what can we say? Well, so,

790
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:42,940
you know, there is there is no doubt whatsoever that as a result of this increase in CO2, the

791
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:49,660
global temperatures will continue to increase. Now, as I discuss in my book, how much they will

792
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:57,980
increase depends on factors, which actually are uncertain. And perhaps the biggest uncertainty

793
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:09,660
of all is due to clouds. Clouds have different effects on the climate depend, well, they have

794
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,260
multiple, they have many effects on climate, but they have different effects on temp, the surface

795
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:20,940
temperature of the earth, depending on what type of cloud they are. So when you have this kind of

796
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,820
what I call stratus clouds, very low level, sort of thick clouds, which just block the sun,

797
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:33,100
then that cools. I mean, then the atmosphere is typically colder than if the clouds weren't there,

798
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:39,020
because basically, the sun is reflected, the sunlight's reflected back to space. So the clouds

799
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:46,380
just block the sun, cool the surface. On the other hand, when you have very thin cirrus clouds, which

800
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:53,740
are way up in the high atmosphere, you know, 10 kilometers or more up, and they tend to be

801
01:14:54,220 --> 01:15:00,460
much thinner clouds and often just made of little ice crystals. They actually play a much more

802
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:07,900
of a role in trapping the heat from the surface of the earth and stopping it radiating out to space,

803
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:14,860
which is why quite often, certainly in Britain, you know, when you think there's going to be an

804
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:23,420
overnight frost, and then a layer of cirrus cloud comes along during the night, that can often stop

805
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:28,700
frost from forming, because you actually end up warming the planet. Well, you know, in the sense

806
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:34,460
of that the atmosphere loses less heat to space. So this would be the greenhouse. So the critical

807
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:39,660
question, I mean, a really big sort of like zero thought of question for climate change is what

808
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:46,940
are clouds going to do? Because if cirrus clouds increase and stratus clouds decrease, then this

809
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:53,100
will amplify the climate change signal. It'll make it warmer, potentially by quite a lot.

810
01:15:54,380 --> 01:16:00,460
That's actually, you know, that's that then you're into catastrophe, like, you know,

811
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:07,340
catastrophic changes in climate change. If stratus clouds low level kind of stratus

812
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:13,980
cumulus clouds dissipate, and the higher level clouds either stay the same or increase. If

813
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:19,260
it's the other way around, then actually clouds will help us. It will be won't be quite as bad.

814
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:26,780
Unfortunately, the models are tending towards the wrong in the wrong way, they're making the

815
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:34,860
low level clouds less, less of them, and that's amplifying the warming. But I would say because

816
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:39,820
we can't represent clouds explicitly in models, they're done with very simplified formulae. This

817
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:47,340
is the biggest area of uncertainty. Now, the other area of uncertainty is is local is what happens

818
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:53,740
at a regional level. So are we going to get more droughts? I mean, like here in the UK,

819
01:16:53,740 --> 01:17:01,180
we've had a drought this summer. And the question is, I mean, this drought may well

820
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:08,300
continue into the autumn and winter. And that's a really big question for infrastructure,

821
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:13,100
how much more reservoir capacity do we need is based around this question of how

822
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:18,460
are long lived droughts of, you know, multi season droughts becoming more

823
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:24,460
commonplace or not under climate change? And current generation models just can't answer

824
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:29,420
that question because they're not good enough at simulating these long lived droughts. And that's

825
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:35,340
because we can't put enough resolution into the models. And that's because the computer's

826
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:40,940
resources we have are not big enough. So I I've been advocating for a like a CERN for climate

827
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:47,740
change where we pool our resources. And just, you know, by the biggest, you know, we now can

828
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:53,340
buy what's called exascale computers 10 to the 18 floating point operations per second,

829
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,660
that's a million, million, million calculations per second, that will make a big change in

830
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:02,220
our ability to simulate climate change accurately. We could have one of these centers in a place

831
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:08,140
where the energy comes from renewable could be solar wind or geothermal or something. We don't

832
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:12,940
want to burn coal to run the power to run a computer, that's for sure. But we can do it with

833
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:18,780
renewables. And if we if we form a new international institute, this could make a big

834
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:23,260
advance in our ability to understand and again, reduce these uncertainties in future climate

835
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:29,340
change. Would that be a good solution also for predicting pandemics and economic recessions?

836
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,900
Then you mentioned those and you have chapters on them. Well, it's it's yeah, I mean, it's it's an

837
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:46,780
interesting, you know, just coming back to my story about Michael Fish. See, you know, here was

838
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:55,340
the situation where the weather actually most of 1987, I don't think the weather was especially

839
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:00,700
sort of unpredictable or something, but suddenly in October 87, along this came this kind of a

840
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:12,620
massively unpredictable storm. And what it what it demonstrates is that what I said about the

841
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:20,060
Lorentz chaos model that the model itself is chaos, but the degree of chaos is not the same

842
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:27,100
day in day out. Different initial conditions have different degrees of chaos. And there are

843
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:32,460
some initial conditions that are exceptionally unpredictable. And other initial conditions

844
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:40,060
are reasonably predictable. And in fact, you could say most of the time, for these chaotic models,

845
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:43,900
the initial conditions are reasonably predictable, but just as a small region where they're

846
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:50,460
exceptionally unpredictable. Now, you know, you look at other systems like, like the economy,

847
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:57,500
or, you know, global health, or indeed, you know, the state of conflict in the world,

848
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:01,660
where you could say for a lot of the time things we sort of bump along

849
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:11,260
in a reasonably kind of predictable and sort of stable way. But occasionally we get these,

850
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:17,180
you know, like the 2008 financial crash. And then of course, in terms of public health,

851
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:27,420
the COVID pandemic. And now we have, you know, the Putin's invasion of Ukraine has kind of triggered

852
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:36,060
a global crisis. So, you know, it does seem that there are clearly parallels with other

853
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:42,940
types of systems, perhaps more involved in social sciences. So I do discuss in the book, because

854
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:51,740
I did a bit of research contacting economists and epidemiologists and conflict modelers

855
01:20:51,740 --> 01:21:00,620
to see to what extent ensemble based forecasting is being used in these other fields. And I think

856
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:09,980
the answer is they're much less well developed than in, in, in, in sort of weather and climate.

857
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:15,980
But perhaps the one where I did find the most kind of traction was actually in COVID modeling. And

858
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:21,660
in particular in the United States, where a number of university groups have developed their own

859
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:29,580
individual COVID models. But there was a central facility which, which, you know, took in all of

860
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:36,620
the data from all these different models and synthesized it in a kind of probabilistic way

861
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:42,620
and showed actually that, you know, the ensemble forecast information of COVID, you know,

862
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:48,220
things like COVID incidents and COVID hospitalizations and so on, was actually much more

863
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:57,900
skillful from the ensemble as a whole than from any one of the models. And that got me thinking,

864
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:05,500
by the way, that just as the world meteorological organization WMO has been sort of leading the

865
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:12,300
development of climate change prediction ensembles, which go into these IPCC assessment reports,

866
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:17,980
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, you know, so the WHO World Health Organization

867
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:25,500
could maybe mastermind some of these ensembles for doing much more kind of coordinated

868
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:31,100
disease prediction in, I mean, not only COVID, but all the other types of

869
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:35,660
important diseases around the world. I mean, I think they're probably are starting to do this,

870
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:41,420
but I think there's a lot that they can learn, as indeed the economists, I think, and the

871
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,460
conflict models from what we have been through in weather and climate prediction in the last

872
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:53,580
few decades. Yeah, I think one of the problems with the divisiveness politically,

873
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:01,180
particularly around climate change, endemics, economic recessions, is the amount of doubt

874
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:07,660
that arises amongst people who just kind of watch the daily news go by and,

875
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:13,660
you know, Dr. Fauci says this, now he says that, the CDC recommended this, now they recommend that,

876
01:23:14,220 --> 01:23:18,380
you know, they can't keep their story straight, you know, I should just be skeptical across the

877
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:22,540
board. This is kind of a larger question, you know, what is the skeptic, you know, are you a

878
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:27,100
climate change skeptic or are you skeptical of the climate change skeptics, which would make you

879
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:32,780
a believer, whatever that would mean in science. You see what I'm getting at, why should people trust

880
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:41,260
what health experts say about the coming pandemic or what we should do, wear a mask,

881
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:45,180
don't wear a mask, get the vaccine, don't, whatever. How do you think about it on that

882
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,940
larger scale and what would you recommend to people who bring these kinds of things up,

883
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:53,580
which sound reasonable, like they keep changing their mind and they've been wrong so many times,

884
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:07,340
why should I listen to the experts now? Well, I would say in my, if I could take climate change

885
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:14,620
as an example about which I know the most, so let me stick to that because I know

886
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,460
I think what I'm talking about.

887
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:27,900
You see, you have to realize that there are two sides to the issue. There's a scientific,

888
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:34,140
there's a scientific question. And then there's, and then because we're talking about policy

889
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:40,860
relevant science, there is a, there is a political, if you like, analysis and decision that has to be

890
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:51,580
made using as input the scientific evidence. So, in the case of climate change, I, you know,

891
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:57,500
and I think this is true of most, not necessarily all, but most of my colleagues,

892
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:07,580
they have tried to address this question of climate change from a science point of view.

893
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:13,740
So, what does that mean? It means if you ask the question, you know, are humans

894
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:21,740
emitting, you know, by burning fossil fuels, are we emitting carbon into the atmosphere,

895
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:25,660
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? Yes, there's no question scientifically, there's no question

896
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:31,260
about it. Is that warming the planet? Yes, there's no question about that.

897
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:38,780
Will the planet continue to warm by our ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide?

898
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:47,580
Yes, there's no doubt about that. Are we increasing the risk of, you know, severe

899
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:52,140
or extreme weather events by these emissions of carbon dioxide? Yes, there's no doubt about that.

900
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:58,700
Should we therefore cut our emissions of carbon dioxide? Now, once you ask that question,

901
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:05,260
you're no longer asking a science question, you're asking a policy question. And,

902
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:13,740
I mean, my, as I say, I think I speak for a lot of my colleagues, they would just say, well,

903
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:19,500
you know, that, I can give you my personal view as a human being on the planet,

904
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:27,580
but if you ask me from a science point of view, should you cut emissions, then I can't tell you,

905
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:34,540
because that involves value judgments. You know, there is a cost to cutting our emissions. We do,

906
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:42,380
you know, I mean, everything in daily life, hospitals and, you know, social welfare, everything,

907
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:48,700
you know, is currently geared around fossil fuel energy. Everything, you know, in our lives

908
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:56,540
currently is based around fossil fuel energy. So converting to zero carbon energy is a difficult

909
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:02,780
and involves a cost. And you could argue, for example, and I have some sympathy with this argument,

910
01:27:02,780 --> 01:27:10,460
that in the developing world, where we want people's standards of living to get, you know,

911
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:16,860
close to our own in the rich world, if we suddenly say stop burning fossil fuels and only use solar

912
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:25,740
panels, we're going to hinder their economic growth. So if you try to make that final step of

913
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:31,020
should we cut our emissions, you're going, you know, into politics. And I think it's important

914
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:39,980
to realize that that is where scientists have no big bigger or better insights than anybody else.

915
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:46,380
You know, I know pretty well what a molecule of carbon dioxide does in the atmosphere,

916
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:54,060
but trying to, you know, estimate way up on the one side, the benefits, and on the other side,

917
01:27:54,060 --> 01:28:05,180
the costs of moving to zero carbon involves, you know, economic social assessments that I'm not

918
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:14,220
an expert in. I mean, in the book, I try to give an approach to that based on what's called an

919
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:21,340
estimate of a value of a human life. But, you know, I don't have any, I don't consider myself

920
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:31,980
an expert in that. So what I'm trying to say here is that perhaps COVID is, if we take COVID as an

921
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:41,180
example, the politicians, you know, that the scientists would have gone to meetings with

922
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:47,260
the politicians and said, well, these are what the model, these are what the models show. And

923
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:53,420
maybe not at the beginning of COVID, but certainly towards the end, they were able to show

924
01:28:54,300 --> 01:29:01,420
their results in a probabilistic way. So this is the probability that there will be x deaths per

925
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:07,900
thousand people or something like that. Then the politicians have to decide, is that risk high enough

926
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:14,300
to take action to shut down an economy or to, you know, stop people moving around? And when people

927
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:24,140
say, oh, well, they got that wrong. It wasn't, I mean, the decisions may or may not have been

928
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:31,100
wrong, but it wasn't the science that was wrong. It was maybe in hindsight, the decision that was

929
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:35,900
made wasn't the right decision. I don't know. But actually, at the time, maybe it was the right

930
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:41,500
decision given given the evidence. But I just want to emphasize that point that there are,

931
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:46,060
you know, saying, oh, they got it wrong, you may actually, or the people making that, so it may

932
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:51,100
be more referring to the decisions that were made on the basis of the evidence that there was at the

933
01:29:51,100 --> 01:30:00,860
time. You know, it's like if I say to you, there's a 70% chance of it raining tomorrow, you might say,

934
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:06,780
well, in that case, I'll take my umbrella to work or to wherever I'm going. And then, of course,

935
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:13,100
it may not rain. So does that mean you were wrong in deciding to take your umbrella to work? I mean,

936
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:18,460
the fact of the matter is, at the time, the best available evidence was that there was a 70% chance

937
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:27,020
it would rain. So you have to recognize that when you make decisions under uncertainty, I don't think

938
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:32,060
actually calling them wrong is the right way to describe such a decision. But the answer, you know,

939
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:36,940
in hindsight, it may be that a different decision would have cost you less. But this is just an

940
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:43,420
inevitable consequence of uncertainty. And it's better than just tossing a coin in the air when

941
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:47,100
you're making a decision where that's an important, I mean, taking an umbrella is not an important

942
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:52,940
decision. But if it's whether to evacuate somewhere or something like that, then having the

943
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:58,140
scientific, the best scientific available evidence is better than just, you know, tossing a coin.

944
01:30:58,780 --> 01:31:03,420
Yeah. Yeah, people get confused about that. Like with the 2016 election of Trump and Clinton,

945
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:08,620
you know, that Hillary had a 70% chance of winning. Well, then how did Trump win? Well,

946
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:13,420
if you ran the election 100 times, Hillary wins 70 of them. So this was one of the 30.

947
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:19,820
And that's how it happens. Right. So, all right, so let's go back to... And I think it's important

948
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:26,060
for, you know, scientists to be honest. I mean, I tell you what the hardest thing is for me,

949
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:32,140
and I'm sure it's true of when you get interviewed by a journalist who's writing a story for,

950
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:37,740
you know, tomorrow's edition, you could tell that he wants you, he or she wants you to be

951
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:42,380
more definite than you are, because it's not a great story if it's couched in the language of

952
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:47,900
uncertainty. So you kind of feeling under pressure the whole time to be more certain than you are.

953
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:55,420
But I think it is important for scientists to tell, you know, to be honest about uncertainty.

954
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:00,780
And ultimately, you know, that's the politician's jobs to make decisions under uncertainty. That's

955
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:05,980
why we vote for them. It's not for scientists, you know, to make those decisions for them.

956
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:10,700
So we shouldn't, you know, let them off the hook. They have to make, it's tough. You know,

957
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:14,380
sometimes it's tough making decisions under uncertainty, but the scientist's job is to

958
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:22,540
tell them the evidence fairly and dispassionately. And that's what I certainly try to do. And that's

959
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:27,820
the kind of philosophy in the book, if you like. Yeah. Carl Sagan had a funny story about that,

960
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:34,460
how he would give some rough estimate, like, oh, I don't know, it's about 150,000 kilometers to

961
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:39,660
whatever. And then, and then the journalist would translate that into the Archaic American

962
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:46,220
Standard System, and it would come out, you know, at some exact number, you know, like 0.67. How

963
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:50,220
did he know that it's exactly that? It's like, he doesn't. It was just the rough estimate the

964
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:57,020
first place. Right. Yeah. So, all right, Tim, let's just kind of wrap up here by going to your

965
01:32:57,020 --> 01:33:03,020
last chapter and again, return to free will consciousness and then God, which I love all

966
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:07,820
that stuff. So just one final point on the free will issue. I'm a compatibilist. I liked your

967
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:14,860
approach. It gels with mine very much. I think we can do otherwise. The universe is not, it's not

968
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:19,580
predetermined. You know, we are part of the causal net determining things ourselves,

969
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:24,620
as well as aware of the factors that we can at least try to control. Now here, the determinists

970
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:30,620
would say, no, no, no, no, you're just confusing different levels of causality. So here, I'll use

971
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:37,500
Adrian Reigns examples from his book, The Anatomy of Violence, about Mr. OFT off, they don't use his

972
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:42,380
real name, but he was this school teacher who had a, turned out he had an orbital frontal cortex

973
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:52,060
tumor and he, at mid-age, so like 40-something, became kind of a pedophile. He started acting

974
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:57,500
inappropriately with his wife's daughter, his stepdaughter, and kiddie porn on his computer

975
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:02,300
and all this stuff. So she turns him into protective services and, you know, he's going to go to jail

976
01:34:02,300 --> 01:34:07,980
and then the psychiatrist scans his brain and, oh my God, he's got a tumor there. And then, so the way

977
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:12,860
Reigns presents this, it's like, you kind of feel sorry for him, like, oh, oh, he's not a pedophile,

978
01:34:12,860 --> 01:34:18,380
he's a medical patient, he has this tumor and, you know, they took the tumor out and his, those

979
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:22,700
feelings go away, he's back to normal and then six months later, the wife finds more porn, kiddie

980
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:29,340
porn on his computer, oh, so brain scan, it's back. So, you know, there it's obvious. And then,

981
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:35,420
Reigns second example is this African-American young man named Dante Page, who was convicted

982
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:42,300
for raping and murdering a college-age woman in Colorado. And he was up for the death penalty

983
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:49,180
and Reigns was on the defense attorneys, defense teams attempt to get him life in prison rather

984
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:54,300
than the death penalty. So he wrote extensively about this guy's background, which is the most

985
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:59,420
horrible background you could possibly imagine. You know, single mom was addicted to drugs,

986
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:05,260
beaten constantly by the men in her life, dropped on his head a dozen times, many trips to the

987
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:10,300
ER for brain damage and so on. By the time he's 18, he's had like the worst life anybody could

988
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:16,700
have in America. Just horrible environment and gangs, terrible diet, you name it, he's got it.

989
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:21,820
Now, Reigns point is that there's nothing on the brain scan really quite like a tumor,

990
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:28,060
you know, but it's tumors all the way down. It's the equivalent of you just don't see

991
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:33,500
what the neural changes are because of that horrible background, but it's the same thing.

992
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:39,340
So why is the Dante Page different from the pedophile guy with the tumor? And the determinists

993
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:45,260
would say it's all the same. They're all just physical causes. The brain is a physical mechanism

994
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:50,380
that obeys the laws of physics and everything else. And so how would you respond to kind of a

995
01:35:50,380 --> 01:36:01,420
deterministic argument like that? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I certainly accept that, you know, there

996
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:09,500
are situations where the moral culpability of somebody is borderline because of medical conditions.

997
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:16,220
But look, let's just take Hitler. I mean, surely we can all agree that Hitler was evil, you know,

998
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:22,380
he exterminated or attempted to exterminate, you know, large sections of society.

999
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:33,580
What word can you use an evil? So the argument that, you know, and I understand, you know,

1000
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:42,540
the reason why people don't like determinism is that they say, oh, well, you know,

1001
01:36:44,460 --> 01:36:50,060
it was all conditioned by whatever the cosmological, you know, Big Bang initial conditions were.

1002
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:56,940
That that sort of set the clock ticking and then everything after that was inevitable. So we can't,

1003
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:02,220
we can't kind of blame Hitler for what he did because it was all determined by the

1004
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:10,060
initial conditions. So that that's, I think, probably the most common type of argument that

1005
01:37:10,060 --> 01:37:21,900
people who don't like determinism bring up. And I actually find that a powerful argument.

1006
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:28,380
You see, so it's kind of, you know, at the level of physics, theoretical physics,

1007
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:36,780
determinism, I think, is quite an attractive concept because the alternative, which is

1008
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:42,060
indeterminism and God playing dice and things is just such kind of nonsense, it seems to me.

1009
01:37:43,180 --> 01:37:48,460
But when you phrase it in this moral way, moral capability, it's a dilemma because,

1010
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:53,500
you know, nobody wants to let Hitler off the hook for what he did to the Jews and the Gypsies

1011
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:00,700
and everything else. So how do we square that? And I tried to address that again in the last

1012
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:09,260
chapter by coming back to this notion of a fractal attractor. This idea that, which in some sense

1013
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:14,380
borrows a lot of ideas from Einstein that the laws of physics are geometric. So his idea about

1014
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:21,740
general relativity was that the laws of laws of gravitation are ultimately caused or due to the

1015
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:31,340
fact that space-time has a sort of non-trivial geometry. And these fractal geometries in the

1016
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:39,340
space of solutions of the equations is another kind of geometric approach. And what it does

1017
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:47,020
is if you take that view, then actually the initial conditions, the cosmological initial

1018
01:38:47,020 --> 01:38:55,100
conditions are no longer somehow fundamental and sort of the moment that everything takes off from.

1019
01:38:55,100 --> 01:39:01,900
In some sense, all of the states of the world from the cosmological state to the present day and in

1020
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:09,260
the future and so on, sort of have equal ontological status as points on this geometry.

1021
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:19,820
And what that does then is to tell you that there's a kind of a, it's almost like a self-referential

1022
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:31,340
picture that you have. The geometry is sort of telling us how we evolve from one day to the

1023
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:37,660
next. But equally what we do is determining the structure of this geometry. There's a kind of

1024
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:46,780
duality here, which is kind of a little bit difficult to say exactly. I mean, I don't have a

1025
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:53,340
precise way of defining it, but there's a sort of duality here between the geometry. It's a little

1026
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:57,580
bit like in general relativity, there's, I think, John Wheeler, the famous theoretical physicist,

1027
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:08,460
kind of said, the geometry tells matter how to move and the matter tells spacetime how to curve.

1028
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:14,540
So this is kind of duality in terms of spacetime geometry. And I think there's something in

1029
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:19,740
parallel going on here that the spacetime, that the diffractal geometry is in some sense telling us

1030
01:40:20,460 --> 01:40:27,340
how the atoms in our body are going to evolve from one day to the next. But our actions are

1031
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:33,340
equally, in some sense, determining the structure of this geometry. Again, there's a sort of duality.

1032
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:39,420
I'm shaking my head because I don't have a clear enough picture to kind of really nail down what

1033
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:46,140
I'm saying here, but I feel it intuitively that, as with the Wheeler duality for spacetime, there's

1034
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:53,180
something here. But what that would mean is that that then will not let Hitler off the hook,

1035
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:59,740
because it does put some onus on what we do as, you know, means we have to take responsibility

1036
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:08,060
for what we do. I throw this out in the last chapter. Look, I mean, the book,

1037
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:15,580
it's important to make this point that the book starts very, very in very, very, very solid

1038
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,500
the maths and physics of chaos. It goes through things like weather and climate,

1039
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:29,660
which again, pretty damn solid, I would say, talks a bit about economics, COVID and something,

1040
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:34,460
perhaps a little bit more uncertain there. The last section of the book is all about consciousness,

1041
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:42,940
free will, moral responsibility, and then as you say, right at the end, God. And I think I try to

1042
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:47,580
say right at the beginning of that section, this is much more speculative. So I'm not going to,

1043
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:54,300
I can't sort of absolutely nail everything to the mast and say I've completely picked this. But

1044
01:41:54,300 --> 01:42:00,460
there's something I think important here about taking away the Big Bang as something where,

1045
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,860
you know, everything was set in stone at the moment of the Big Bang and nothing could change,

1046
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:11,740
to something much more fluid, I suppose in some sense, where we do actually have some role in

1047
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:17,660
determining this geometry, just as the geometry has a role in influencing us. So I think this,

1048
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:25,420
at the very least, let's say this, it provides a new ingredient, I suppose, into the debate about

1049
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:32,380
determinism and moral responsibility and so on. And I hope at least that will get people thinking.

1050
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:37,020
Yeah, no, I like that very much. All right, last page here, you talk about, for example,

1051
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:43,180
in the cosmological invariant set model, there is an afterlife, we and our loved ones will be

1052
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:48,780
coming back in future epochs of the universe on trajectories in state space, close to the

1053
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:53,500
present one, but none precisely the same as the present one. What in the world are you talking

1054
01:42:53,500 --> 01:43:06,300
about there? Well, yeah, so if you take something like the Lorentz model,

1055
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:13,820
the states and the Lorentz model, they evolve on this fractal geometry, and

1056
01:43:15,660 --> 01:43:21,100
they can go round and round and round and then come back, they never come back exactly

1057
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:28,300
to where they were, but they come back very close. There's a point in the future

1058
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:35,580
of a trajectory in this solution space, I call it state space. I try to explain what I mean by

1059
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:41,180
state space in the book, but there's no time here to go into detail. But let's say it's space of

1060
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:49,420
solutions, where the solution comes round, it never exactly comes back to the point you started,

1061
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:59,180
but it comes as close as you like. And at that moment, that state is like within the flap of

1062
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:06,540
a butterfly's wings away from that original state. So if this is how the universe works,

1063
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:14,060
and that's my belief actually, and it links in with a lot of Roger Penrose's latest ideas about

1064
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:21,980
what he calls cyclic cosmology. But with this difference, that the universe is never

1065
01:44:21,980 --> 01:44:28,140
cyclic in a precise way, it doesn't actually repeat itself, but it gets back to a state

1066
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:36,540
which is very close to where it was in a previous Eon. And so what that means is that we,

1067
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:42,460
it's a bit like actually the example we had earlier of me walking out of the shop

1068
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:49,340
and being hit by a bicycle. In a future Eon, I will walk out of that shop and see the bicycle

1069
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:54,700
and avoid it, and I won't end up in hospital. So certain things will be better, but maybe some

1070
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:58,780
good decisions, you know, that I made, I'll make lousy decisions. And so in other respects,

1071
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:04,540
it'll be worse. But that's what seems to be, you know, if I mean, I'm being speculative,

1072
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:08,140
I understand all that. But if you take this model of the universe as a

1073
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:13,580
chaotic system evolving on one of its fractal attractors, as they're called,

1074
01:45:14,860 --> 01:45:20,860
this is where it leads you to a universe where, in some sense, you do come back,

1075
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:27,500
but things are slightly different. And I find that quite, so as I say, loved ones,

1076
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,860
you'll meet loved ones again, if that's right. But you'll have a different life with them,

1077
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:34,940
things will be different. This would make God something of a computer modeler

1078
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:39,980
who is replicating our loved ones in some sort of virtual reality.

1079
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:44,300
Or am I missing that? It's something different in the future.

1080
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:53,180
Well, it wouldn't be a computer, actually, because the thing about computers is because they're,

1081
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:00,780
you know, one of the things about, if you have a model of chaos,

1082
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:08,700
and you represent it on a computer, then actually, the state does eventually return to

1083
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:15,260
exactly its starting point, because the numbers inside a computer can only be represented with

1084
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:22,860
a finite number of bits. So God isn't a computer, but certainly God is mathematical, in some sense.

1085
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:28,380
And, well, I just finish, I don't know whether this is giving too much away,

1086
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:35,580
but I finish with this conjecture, well, suppose God just is this geometry, in some sense, this

1087
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:41,660
fractal. I mean, that is God. It's kind of a Spinozian philosophy of God, but sort of on steroids,

1088
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:47,420
because it's not just our universe, but it's like the sum totality of all of the eons and stuff put

1089
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:55,420
together. You know, and I kind of, it just amuses me that Lorenz, who invented the butterfly effect

1090
01:46:55,420 --> 01:47:01,900
which we spoke about, he also invented this model of chaos. And if you look at the attractor of the

1091
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:07,340
Lorenz model, it actually looks like a butterfly. A bit of the wing of that butterfly is on the

1092
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:13,580
front cover of the book. It looks like a butterfly. Now that is a complete, yeah, I mean, you've got

1093
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:18,140
you've got the sort of two wings of the butterfly there sort of thing. But that's a complete coincidence.

1094
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:23,900
It's totally, you know, it's just fortuitous. But it just got me thinking maybe the geometry

1095
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:28,700
of this cosmological attractor is a picture of God. I mean, who knows?

1096
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:39,020
But this isn't a personal guy. I just feel it's it's worth exploring, but I, you know, who knows.

1097
01:47:39,020 --> 01:47:44,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, at this point, that's all you can do, because I do think we kind of hit

1098
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:49,900
an epistemological wall when we talk about things like that, or why is there something rather than

1099
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:54,460
nothing? Well, what do you mean by nothing? And then you get into the physics metaphysics

1100
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:58,460
of nothingness. And, and then it's just like, words, I do have.

1101
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:10,620
Yeah, I do. I'm not somebody that dismisses religion and God out of hand, which of course,

1102
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:19,500
a lot of scientists do. And I think, you know, we need to look for ways of reconciling science

1103
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:32,060
and religion in ways which are not, you know, as confrontational as they often are. And I mean,

1104
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:39,340
this is just my attempt to, you know, to raise a concept which might possibly bring people together

1105
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:45,100
in a way. You mean as a strategy for, you know, can't we all just get along? Yes, that would be good.

1106
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:51,020
Versus an actual epistemological attempt to understand the natural reality. We need religious

1107
01:48:51,020 --> 01:49:05,100
people in their views as well as scientists. Well, I'm not sure what I'm saying. I mean, you need,

1108
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:16,220
can I say, I think to make progress in fundamental science, you do, you know, it's not, I mean,

1109
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:24,300
science is not a kind of a logical process. You need insights of imagination, leaps of imagination,

1110
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:32,940
which often you don't get from just staring at equations, you know, it's having some more

1111
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:39,580
kind of liberating philosophy which can take you to places that you just don't get by looking at

1112
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:47,660
equations. I think often that is important in science. You know, progress is kind of inductive,

1113
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:56,300
it's not deductive. And yeah, I mean, people with religious feelings and backgrounds, I think there

1114
01:49:56,300 --> 01:50:03,340
are useful, they have insights that could be useful. I mean, I can't say categorically that

1115
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:09,420
they are needed. But on the other hand, I would feel science would be the poorer if we somehow

1116
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:16,620
excluded such people. I think it would limit us in our ability to think outside the box, which we

1117
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:24,780
do need questionably. And in this area of quantum gravity, we need question. So I, you know, I'm

1118
01:50:24,780 --> 01:50:37,340
trying to say that in physics, at least, being cognizant of different religious, philosophical

1119
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:44,300
traditions, I think is can be useful. Yeah. That's right. Because you had a discussion on the

1120
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:51,100
relationship of noise in the brain and creativity, if I'm remembering that right. So this would be

1121
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:56,140
an example of we need as many people as possible who have thought about these big questions,

1122
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:59,660
because who knows what noise goes on in their head and they come up with some ideas

1123
01:50:59,660 --> 01:51:02,460
related to spiritual traditions or whatever that are useful.

1124
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:08,620
Right. That's right. I mean, I, as you say, I mean, it comes back to this question of

1125
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:16,860
what's so special about 20 watts of power that will run the brain. And what's what one of the

1126
01:51:16,860 --> 01:51:25,420
things that's special about it is that there likely are situations where the the the signals in the

1127
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:33,900
neurons are affected by noise, thermal noise, maybe actually even quantum mechanical noise.

1128
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:39,180
Now, what manifestations would that take? Well, it could be that that's what helps us

1129
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:46,860
bring ideas together from what would be in a purely sort of logical deductive way,

1130
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:57,740
you know, unlikely connections. And so you need two ingredients to make to make the connections,

1131
01:51:57,740 --> 01:52:04,300
you need two ingredients, you need to have those ideas, you need to have, you know, the ideas don't

1132
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:10,300
come out of nowhere, but you need to have had those ideas. And then the noise, which by the way,

1133
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:18,380
happens mostly susceptibility to noise is probably happens mostly when you're in a very relaxed

1134
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:26,140
mode, not thinking about anything in particular. That's when the brain can make connections between

1135
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:32,380
really quite different ideas. And I discuss in my book how the eureka moments that some of our

1136
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:36,700
top, you know, Nobel Prize winners have had, these have all occurred when they're just relaxing,

1137
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:42,380
doing nothing. And I tell my students, you know, don't spend the whole day in front of the computer

1138
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:48,380
and night in front of the computer, because you're just, you know, you're you're preventing these

1139
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:54,220
the eureka moments from happening. So yeah, so the brain, I think,

1140
01:52:54,540 --> 01:53:01,820
so having a diverse kind of multi, multi dimensional view of, of the world from different

1141
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:07,180
perspectives, and then that ability to relax and allow the noise in the brain to make the connections

1142
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:12,860
that that's the kind of my view of the secret to creativity and inventiveness.

1143
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:19,740
So here we'd probably say no noise favors the prepared mind. Because if I have a dream about

1144
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:27,420
writing on a beam of light or falling down an elevator shaft, I'm not coming up with the theory

1145
01:53:27,420 --> 01:53:33,420
of relativity, because I'm a nobody in physics, right? You got to have the mind ready to solve the

1146
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:41,020
problem. You have to have a certain amount of I mean, you have to remember, Einstein was not

1147
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:47,740
a mathematical genius. His knowledge of mathematics was actually somewhat limited. I mean, by the

1148
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:52,140
standards of mathematicians, you know, people wouldn't have called him a mathematician, but he

1149
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:57,500
knew enough mathematics to realize when he'd had that idea about writing a beam of light,

1150
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:03,900
that that had mathematical implications. And then he went to his, you know, his friends Minkowski

1151
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:09,820
and so on, and, and then formulated things mathematically. So you don't need to be like

1152
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:15,020
super expert, you know, in different areas, but you do have to have a general broad,

1153
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:20,060
I think knowledge of different things. I think that is important. At least that's what,

1154
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:26,540
and that's squares with my own experience. I've tried to, you know, know a little about a lot

1155
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:33,260
of things. And sometimes that's, that can be useful. Yeah, one of my favorite Steve Gould essays

1156
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:38,060
was talking about since we started with Feynman, we can end with Feynman, where he was going to

1157
01:54:38,060 --> 01:54:43,980
Caltech to give a public talk and he was contacted by Feynman's office. We'd like to have lunch.

1158
01:54:43,980 --> 01:54:49,900
Yeah, okay, wow, the great Feynman. Yeah, that'd be great. So Feynman proceeds to bounce some ideas

1159
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:55,980
he had about evolution with Gould, which essentially turned out to be sexual selection,

1160
01:54:55,980 --> 01:55:01,260
which Darwin had figured out by the 1870, that it wasn't just natural selection, there was

1161
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:05,260
natural selection of female select emails, for example, but they're competing and they have

1162
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:10,460
different kinds of camouflage or whatever colors that would not be camouflaged if it was natural

1163
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:15,980
selection. So anyway, Gould finally said, well, yeah, we worked all that out like a century ago.

1164
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:22,860
And Feynman said, I didn't, I never read anything about a subject like that, because I want to come

1165
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:28,700
to it fresh with a clear mind. Anyway, Gould's point of his essay was, yeah, except it's good

1166
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:33,020
to know what's already been done in case, you know, the errors that you're about to make have

1167
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:43,260
already been made and we figured those out. That's right. I agree. So, all right, Tim, well,

1168
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:47,900
you've been very patient. We've got almost two hours here and I appreciate you entertaining

1169
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:51,900
all my questions here. Standing in for our listeners who don't know much about this stuff.

1170
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:56,860
I think your book is super clear. I hope everybody reads it because it's just a masterful example

1171
01:55:56,860 --> 01:56:01,260
of clear science writing on some of the biggest, most interesting, important topics of our time.

1172
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:04,940
So thank you for doing that. What's next on your writing or research plate?

1173
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:15,820
I'm writing a paper whose title is Quantum Physics from Number Theory. So I'm a great

1174
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:23,820
believer that, you know, Newton discovered the calculus and the calculus is used in pretty

1175
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:30,780
much all of modern physics from, you know, throwing a throwing a stone in the air, forecasting the

1176
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:36,620
weather, even the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics is based on the calculus. The problem

1177
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:44,300
with the calculus is that it assumes variables are infinitely, you know, variable. Whereas

1178
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:50,860
number theory is about the properties of whole numbers, one, two, three, four, five, six.

1179
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:58,220
At very little is made use of number theory in physics and certainly in fundamental physics.

1180
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:06,860
So my project at the moment is writing a technical paper on how some very interesting kind of number

1181
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:10,780
theorems about properties of whole numbers, the relationship of whole numbers and what are

1182
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:17,820
called trigonometric functions, like the sine and cosine of an angle could provide some really

1183
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:22,300
big insights into the nature of quantum physics. So we'll see how that goes.

1184
01:57:22,300 --> 01:57:27,100
And do you get those insights from playing the banjo and guitar, if I can comment on your backdrop?

1185
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:33,260
Is that one of your creative outlets? Einstein had the violin, you have the guitar.

1186
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:44,460
Yeah, I play in a village rock and roll band. And I've been like a folk musician since I was

1187
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:51,580
about 12 or so, inspired by the Beatles, I have to say originally. I don't find much connection

1188
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:57,660
between science and playing musical instruments. I'm not somebody that loves Bach because of its

1189
01:57:57,740 --> 01:58:03,820
mathematical intricacies. I like playing fairly simple music just as an emotional release. There's

1190
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:11,260
nothing better than playing Johnny B. Good on a Gibson EF 335 in front of 100 people who are

1191
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:16,220
dancing like mad. There's just nothing to compare with it. It's fantastic. It's almost as good as

1192
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:23,100
doing science. I was watching a YouTube video of Queen performing, I don't know where it was,

1193
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:28,380
but there must have been 100,000 people. And there was Brian May. Doesn't he have a PhD

1194
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:34,060
in astrophysics or something like that? Anyway, I just can only imagine. I have a story about Brian

1195
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:44,620
May. He finished his PhD at Imperial College after Freddie Mercury had died and the group had

1196
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:50,620
sort of gone into abeyance. And he finished his PhD and he had to give a seminar in the physics

1197
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:57,340
department on his PhD work. And I wasn't there, but apparently he said, I thought this was great.

1198
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:03,980
He said, you know, I've given concerts in front of 100,000 people in stadiums.

1199
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:09,500
I've played on the roof of Buckingham Palace in front of royalty and things.

1200
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:15,340
I've never been as nervous as I am now giving a seminar in front of 20 people in the physics

1201
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:24,860
department. That's a great story. Every guy wants to be a rock star and so what are rock stars

1202
01:59:24,860 --> 01:59:30,780
want to be? I don't know, I guess astrophysicists or something. That's really funny. All right, Tim,

1203
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:31,580
thank you so much.
