0	6160	Hello everyone, it's Michael Schirmer. This is my friendly reminder to sign up for our December 1st
6160	11360	through 3rd weekend conference here and event at the Skeptic Society, open house Friday night here
11360	14960	at the offices, as well as Sunday afternoon for those of you who can't make it Friday night,
15600	19760	Saturday night fundraising dinner for the Skeptic Society. If you support us, it would be great
19760	25920	to see you there. But most interestingly, we're doing a couple of podcast live recorded episodes.
26560	30880	I'll be in conversation with not only Jared Diamond Sunday morning, but Michael Schellenberger
30880	36640	on Saturday. Now, he's an interesting figure, very controversial. I've already gotten some
36640	40400	mail from people saying, how could you have this guy? Because he's one of the most interesting
40400	46400	people working out there today. He's worked in environmentalism, on nuclear power, on homelessness.
46400	52560	He lives in San Francisco area, so he knows that well. Drug addiction, what we can do about it.
52560	60880	And especially journalism, independent journalism versus mainstream media, alternative media,
62880	69360	what we should trust as truth, which is the theme of the conference. In journalism, when you read
69360	74000	something, should you believe it or not? This is what Michael has been not only studying, but also
74000	80240	working in. So we'll be having a nice long podcast conversation on Saturday, which is recorded live
80240	86400	in the hotel at the Hilton, Santa Barbara Hilton there, in which you will participate. That is
86400	91440	to say, he and I will talk for a little while, and then when it's time, we'll go to you. And you
91440	96240	can ask questions, you can even dialogue with him. I mean, it's going to be one of those kind of
96960	102800	interesting podcast episodes, which we'll then post on my show afterwards. Alright, so check it out.
102800	108160	Go to skeptic.com and just click on the banner for the conference. And I hope to see you there.
108160	115280	Thanks for your support. So it's good to see you again, Robert. I think the last time we saw
115280	119840	each other maybe was at that City of Ideas conference in Pueblo, Mexico.
121200	127440	Like in the hallway behind the lecture hall or whatever. But what a totally weird place that
127440	132080	was. It certainly was. Yeah. You know, I've noticed a lot of people have tried to do the TED
133040	137680	model. And, you know, it's hard to replicate that. It's one of those things that happens maybe
137680	142640	only once. I just did this conference in England called How the Light Gets In, which was very popular.
142640	148400	It was great. And it was a little bit like Ted and Burning Man. It was outdoors, intense and music
148400	154400	and, you know, food trucks and stuff like that, but also lectures by professional, whatever. Anyway,
154400	161040	so. Well, food trucks are always good, but were there billionaires helicoptering in to get into
161280	166160	there? No, not like that. No. Not like that. Yeah. Robert, let me give you a proper introduction
166160	169840	here, my guest today. If you haven't figured it out already is Robert Sapulski, the author of
169840	174800	several works of nonfiction, including A Primate's Memoir, The Trouble with Testosterone,
174800	180240	and Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, his most recent book before. The new one here is Behave,
180240	184560	New York Times bestseller, which was named Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post and
184560	188480	The Wall Street Journal. He's a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University
188480	193440	and the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant. He and his wife live in San Francisco.
193440	201200	Here's the new book Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will. All right. Robert,
201200	205040	this is my favorite book of yours. I've read everything you've written. And let me tell you
205040	210160	why. Wow. Well, it's technically just as good as, you know, your other books in terms of presenting
210160	213440	the science, but there's something different about this one. Tell me if I get this right.
214080	218000	I was just trying to think like on my bike ride today is like, what is it? I feel like
218000	224400	he's having a conversation with me informally. And then I realize, no, that's not it. It's like,
224400	228400	you're having a conversation with yourself and I get to listen in on this.
230400	236880	It's, well, I think a punchline that goes throughout the whole book is I'm like so far out
237920	242240	in left field or right field in terms of lunatic fringe opinions about this.
242800	248160	But the majority of the time, I can't follow through on the way I think the world should work.
248160	256960	So no one said it's easy, blah, blah. So I think a lot of the book is exactly that. What do you do
256960	264240	when you turn out to be unable to follow through with your prescription for what is like intellectually
264240	269280	legit? Yes. In other words, you're wrestling with yourself about a very difficult
270000	274720	issue, free will and determinism. It's one of these things. Here's how I think about it,
274720	279840	that we've had, I don't know, what 3,000 years of the greatest minds of all time arguing about this.
280560	285360	And if we still don't have a consensus, then there's something different about this than some other
286320	291440	theory. If we were still arguing about the steady state theory versus the big bang theory and there
291440	296720	was no clear consensus, I would think, okay, after 50 years, come on, these guys, they got to try
296720	303120	something new, like maybe string theories like that or something like that. Maybe conceptually,
303120	306880	it's just the language or not thinking about it right or I don't know what it is. I mean,
306880	316240	you wrestle with this throughout the book. Well, it's a moving target. It's one of those where
317200	324480	everyone has a very, very strong folk intuition about what free will is. What I discovered when
324480	330320	having to read philosophers for the first time in my life when preparing for the book is an awful
330320	337680	lot of philosophers between the lines of the philosophizing have very, very strong folk
337680	345840	intuitions about what free will is. And it's hard to get at. And what I'm also convinced is a major
345840	352320	fault line in that is, what are the implications of there being no free will when we're thinking
352320	357280	about criminality and all that? And what are the implications when we're talking about somebody's
357280	366080	amazing resume? Psychologically, there's a big fault line between those two categories of wrestling
366080	370880	with it. Yeah, I like to cite that study. Let me see if I have those numbers. I think it was
370880	378640	David Chalmers actually conducted this study in 2009 of what philosophers, it was like their
378640	385360	position. Yeah, here it is. A 2009 survey of 3226 philosophy professors and grad students
386000	390560	were asked to weigh in on 30 different subjects of concern in their field from a priori knowledge,
390560	396320	aesthetic value, God, knowledge, mind, moral realism, and then this one, free will,
396320	402400	compatibilism, libertarianism, or no free will. The survey found the following results,
402400	412480	59% compatibilism at 15% other, 13.7% libertarianism and 12.2% no free will. So that's you,
412480	420560	you're in the 12%. Yes, I'm actually surprised it's that high. I've been spouting 90 to 95% of
421680	427280	free will acceptance. I don't know about the 13% libertarianism because that,
428000	430480	just for our listeners, that's nothing to do with the political party,
431200	436480	that there's something like a little homunculus in your head, a mini-me that's making the decisions.
437600	447120	But somehow, yes, it's completely, well, it's somehow fitting in. You kind of admit the world
447120	452480	is made of like material things, but then you grant yourself a homunculus and give it complete
452480	459760	power over the material things. I decided early on in trying to do this book that I wasn't going
459760	466960	anywhere near the libertarian philosophers because it's just a little bit too squishy for
466960	471360	me to make sense of. So I mostly ignore them and just deal with the compatibilists.
472560	478400	Yeah, it seems like a resurrection of dualism. There's a ghost in the machine up there still
479360	483120	floating around, but that doesn't solve anything because if there's a mini-me,
483120	488320	then who's inside mini-me? They have to be a mini-me. All the way in.
490400	494480	Yeah, one more thing before we get into the meat of that. I want to read a passage from your book
494480	499440	to us again. I like how you're writing this so beautiful, but because I think there's
499440	504960	something else going on in this book. So this is your discussing on page 16 and 17,
504960	512880	what you mean by determinism. Imagine a university graduation ceremony, almost always moving despite
512880	518160	the platitudes, the boilerplate, the kish, the happiness, the pride, the families who sacrifices
518160	523440	now all seem worth it, the graduates who were the first in their family to finish high school,
523440	529120	the ones whose immigrant parents sit there glowing, their saris, the sheikahs, our aongs,
529120	533840	broadcasting their pride in the present isn't at the cost of pride in their past.
535280	541680	And then you notice someone amid the family clusters post-ceremony, the new graduates posing
541680	546960	for pictures with grandma in her wheelchair, the burst of hugs and laughter. You see the person
547680	553040	way in the back, the person who is part of the grounds crew, collecting the garbage from the
553040	559680	cans on the perimeter of the event. Randomly pick any of the graduates, do some magic so this
559680	564960	that this garbage collector started life with the graduate's genes. Likewise for getting the womb
564960	569040	in which nine months were spent and the lifelong epigenetic consequences of that,
569680	574560	get the graduate's childhood as well, one filled with say piano lessons and family game nights
574560	579680	instead of say threats of going to bed hungry, becoming homeless, or being deported for lack
579680	585680	of papers. Let's go all the way so that in addition to the garbage collector having gotten all of that,
585680	589200	the graduates passed, the graduate would have gotten the garbage collectors passed.
589760	596400	Trade every factor over which they had no control and you will switch who would be in the graduation
596400	602560	robe and who would still be hauling garbage cans. This is what I mean by determinism. Okay.
603440	609280	Evolutionary theories have this distinction between proximate and ultimate causes.
610080	613600	I'm going to say, go out in the lame here and say this book is not really about determinism
613600	617840	and free will and your beef with Dan Dennett or anything like that. This book is about the garbage
617840	629200	collector. Yeah. This was my son's Stanford graduation of just seeing this guy and
629920	633440	what the hell is he thinking and how did this and knowing,
634560	639040	you know, all these graduates worked incredibly hard and they're great kids and they care about
639040	646800	the planet with almost no exceptions and all that. But nonetheless, wow, that's this world that
646800	654640	things turn out that way. And we all know it. We all if you really pin somebody down, they'll say
654640	666800	they would have switched. Yeah, that's very interesting that you honed in on that. Yeah,
666800	672560	this book is about that. I mean, life is not fair. How do lives turn out? It's mostly luck.
672560	679840	It's mostly stuff you don't control. And so what you're after here is why is it not fair
680480	684720	like that? And what can we do about it? I mean, we have been trying to do things about it,
684720	688560	you know, the civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and animal rights and
689120	692160	children's rights and workers rights and all the stuff that we've been working at,
692160	698080	abolition of slavery and torture and whatnot. And we've made made progress, but it's still not fair.
698800	702800	And what can we do to level the playing field as it were?
702880	713040	Yeah, that's that's our problem. And hooray, redistribution of wealth and getting over all
713040	720640	these biases and implicit biases and the that whole song and dance. But for me, and what's at
720640	726960	the heart of the book is kind of the starting point is this is a world that runs on the myth
727440	733600	that some people deserve the praise and rewards they receive, and some people deserve the blame
733600	740880	and punishment, and that that is rational and even more so ethically acceptable.
741920	749840	And where that makes no sense whatsoever. And in a in a bizarre way, just kind of given my
749840	756160	training or whatever, this is a book that's mostly about neurons and hormones and gene
756240	762160	environment interactions and all that stuff. But it's, you know, ultimately, a book about
762160	767920	social justice. It's a very screwed world that runs on a myth that things are just
769040	772960	when they're not and they're not because it is a deterministic world.
774880	781520	Could it ever be a just world, given the variation, the natural variation in genes and
781520	787200	epigenetics and social environments and so forth? Or are we just going to just aim for an
787200	794000	approximate not utopia, but protopia, protopia, just a little bit. But that's Kevin, Kevin Kelly's
794000	798400	phrase, by which he means just trying to make tomorrow a little bit better than today.
800000	808320	Well, you know, I come from my my my sociopolitical rants are along the lines of all reform,
808320	814800	undercut revolution, blah, blah, that sort of thing. And this book is obviously an extreme,
814800	819200	extreme stance, because it's not about how there's less free will than we think it's about how there's
819200	824480	no free will whatsoever. What do we do about it? Though you ask, and like the pathetic thing that
824480	831200	I come up with is like a gradual list, little incremental reformist thing of like, try every
831200	836400	day to like, deal with this concept when you interact with somebody or feel like pleased with
836400	843040	yourself, you know, do a little bit at a time. Just because a big theme of the book is, oh my
843040	848160	God, how are we supposed to function if people actually believe there's no free will? We've been
848160	855280	spending centuries crawling in that direction, at point after point, you know, getting enlightened
855280	861840	about how the world actually works and where we subtract responsibility out of domains where we
861840	870080	previously meted out major punishments and major rewards. And you know, it's a good thing that 400
870080	875920	years ago or so, most people figured out that hailstorms are not caused by witches. They're not
875920	881440	caused by the old woman with no teeth who has no family living alone at the edge of the hamlet.
881440	888000	Oh, it doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way that someone who has an epileptic seizure
888000	893520	is possessed by Satan, let alone that they chose to sort of mess around with him. And here's what
893520	900000	he got now. All of this are cases where we've slowly learned there's not free will there.
900720	905840	So, you know, all I do is sit out way out there saying there's none whatsoever, but
906720	913520	you know, we got to do it stepwise to get less and less of that attribution because, you know,
913520	918800	a huge amount of the world's misery is due to the fact that people who had bad luck
919440	924800	are treated as if they had something to do with it. And that we all then congratulates ourselves
924800	930880	on the notion that the world is just in that regard, because we can be the agents of our own
930880	939280	actions when we're not. Yeah. Yeah, so this even has a name, just world theory, largely supported
939360	945360	more by conservatives than liberals. That is to say, yeah, the world used to be unjust,
945360	950880	but we've fixed most of that now. Still have a little ways to go, but, you know, if you're rich,
950880	956800	you probably got there because you're hardworking and smart and creative. And if you're poor, well,
956800	961360	you know, you just, you should have gotten up earlier, you should have worked harder.
961360	968160	It's like that Seinfeld episode where he has to go back into coach and the flight attendant closes
968160	972320	the curtain and looks at you like, I'm sorry, you didn't work harder. You don't get to come into
972320	981680	class. There you have it. There you have it. Somehow I propose that there's a wonderful study
981680	988880	some years ago on not road rage, but airline passenger rage during flights of like unruly
988880	995120	hostile behavior, looking for what the variables were that predicted it. And the study had two
995120	1001680	killer findings, which is the more likely or if it's one of those flights where when you're
1001680	1008800	getting into coach, you've got to walk through first class, that increases the odds of air flight.
1009360	1016080	But, but even more interestingly, if it's one of those flights where the Hoy Paloy coach passengers
1016080	1021600	have to walk through first class, there's even more of a boost of anti social behavior among
1021600	1024800	the first class passengers. Oh really? We don't want to see these people.
1025520	1031200	Exactly. One is about resentment, but the other is about like reification of entitlement.
1031840	1037680	God, it's bad enough they had to walk through here. Now what? I've got to wait a few minutes for
1037680	1046320	my drink. So that's some sort of metaphor for everything out there. But wow, what a great finding.
1046400	1050240	Yeah, that's incredible. Okay, another passage from your book.
1050800	1055600	One compatibilist philosopher after another reassuringly proclaims their belief in material
1055600	1061120	deterministic modernity, yet somehow there's still room for free will. As might be kind of clear by
1061120	1066640	now, I think that this doesn't work. See chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, etc. I suspect
1066640	1071600	that most of them know this as well. When you read between the lines or sometimes even the lines
1071600	1076320	themselves and they're writing, a lot of these compatibilists, and I know you're speaking about
1076320	1080720	Diane Dennett along with others who's been on this show, are actually saying that there has to be
1080720	1085600	free will because it would be a total downer otherwise doing contortions to make an emotional
1085600	1090320	stance seem like an intellectual one. Humans descended from the apes, let us hope it's not
1090320	1094960	true, but if it is, let us pray that it not become generally known. Said the wife of an Anglican bishop
1094960	1101440	in 1860 when told about Darwin's novel theory of evolution. 156 years later, Stephen Cave titled a
1101440	1106720	much-discussed June 2016 article in The Atlantic. There's no such thing as free will, but we're
1106720	1113680	better off believing in it anyway. I think that's a lot of what's happening.
1114560	1119200	But I was going to counter that with a quote from Noam Chomsky who I listened to periodically on
1119200	1122960	various podcasts because he's always interesting to listen to even if I don't agree with him.
1123840	1126960	He basically said when asked about free will and determinism, he said,
1126960	1131680	no one really believes in determinism, nor do they act like it, not even determinists.
1131680	1140560	So why bother to even talk about it? Great. And what I wrestle with is I'm a total determinist and
1140560	1144480	just a little bit of the time I'm able to actually function as if that's the case.
1145120	1152800	It's hard. It's hard because we're people of our place and time. I've got no trouble at all
1152800	1158080	with the notion that there's no such thing as witches, but no matter how much I believe in this
1158080	1164240	stuff, it's still kind of nice when someone says to me, good job about something that I've done,
1164240	1170320	or when I'm appalled or irritated or pissed off at someone who's getting on my nerves to really,
1170320	1178960	truly step out from some notion of agency going on there. It's really hard, but we got to do it
1179040	1183280	because it's a much more humane world each time we get a little bit closer to that.
1184240	1188960	Okay. So you define one of your definitions of determinism, the shorter one.
1189600	1194880	We are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck
1194880	1200800	over which we had no control that has brought us to any moment. And then I'll quote from Sam
1200800	1205680	Harris in his book titled Free Will. Interesting. You both had the exact same position. His book
1205680	1211680	is called Free Will and your book is called Determined. Let's see who gets more sales.
1214000	1218640	So here's what Sam writes. Our wills are simply not of our own making. Thoughts and intentions
1218640	1223840	emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious
1223840	1229440	control. We do not have the freedom we think we have. Okay. Now, remember the exact wording of
1229440	1233920	both of those definitions. I'm going to give you a thought experiment here because as you know,
1233920	1240160	philosophers love thought experiments. Okay. I'll use John Doe and Jane Doe, but it could
1240160	1244400	be you and your wife. Okay. John Doe is an exceptionally moral person who's happily married
1244400	1249120	to Jane. The chances of John ever cheating on Jane is close to zero, but the odds are not zero
1249120	1253040	because John is human. So let's say for the sake of argument that John has a one-night
1253040	1259280	stand while on the road and Jane finds out, how does John account for his actions? Does he
1259280	1263360	pace the standard deterministic explanation for human behavior as in
1263360	1269120	Sapolsky's and Harris's descriptors above? Say something like this to Jane. Honey,
1269840	1274240	my will is simply not of my own making. My thoughts and intentions emerge from background
1274240	1279760	causes of which I'm unaware, over which I exert no conscious control. I do not have the freedom
1279760	1284960	you think I have. I could not have done otherwise because I'm nothing more or less than the cumulative
1284960	1289600	biological and environmental luck over which I had no control that brought me to that moment of
1289600	1294160	infidelity. Could you even finish the thought before your wife would just slap you across the face?
1297280	1305680	Well, I think what we have here is a very, very pointed and effective thought experiment showing
1305680	1314160	the gigantic gap between like accepting the reality about how both the little itty-bitty parts of
1314160	1320800	the universe work and how when they get put together into us work and actually being able to
1320800	1332320	live each day because pain hurts. And that is a very painful discovery. And we've got a major
1332320	1340160	problem in there, which it's very hard to hold on to our machineness. And I sure be infuriated in
1340160	1345600	that circumstance, no matter how many like damn time times I read this book that I wrote and
1345600	1352000	actually began to believe some of it. This is very difficult because we're going against very deep
1352000	1361120	intuitions of agency. And it's not for nothing that an awful lot about what makes for psychological
1361120	1371040	stress are circumstances that rob you of a sense of agency. And it's pretty appalling in many ways.
1371840	1377600	Insofar as we are functioning on self-deception most of the time, one of the wisest definitions
1377600	1383360	I've heard out there of what major depression is, it's a pathological failure of the ability to
1383360	1390000	rationalize away reality. So yeah, we got an uphill battle in doing this sort of thing and our
1390000	1399840	well-being really hinges a lot of the time on a sense of agency and ability to wave away the evidence
1400800	1408560	that it isn't there. But nonetheless, this is how the world works. And there's some domains where
1408560	1412720	we should do the hard lifting to really work through that in our heads.
1412720	1420080	Okay, it's often defined as the question turns on, could you have done otherwise?
1420640	1426080	Okay, now in my little thought experiment, I assuming your wife would say, you got damn well
1426080	1432320	better never do that again if you find yourself in similar circumstances. Now, let's take Steve
1432320	1438640	Gould's metaphor of the rewinding the tape. As he said, if you rewound the tape of life and played
1438640	1442880	it back, something like Homo sapiens would not appear again because of all the contingent steps
1442880	1448960	and billions of years of evolution. Okay, as Dan Dennett pointed out, if it's a read-only memory
1448960	1455440	tape, you'd get exactly what we have because it's just a replay of what happened, like if you had
1455440	1461440	a recording of everything that happened, that would be fixed. The question is, is that the
1461440	1466560	universe we live in? Is it something like the, what's that called, the block universe where
1466640	1472080	everything that can happen has happened already past, present, future, and we're just in the
1472080	1478080	middle of the movie. We don't know how it turns out, but it does have a fixed outcome. Or are we
1478080	1484320	in a universe that is not predetermined in that sense? The past is determined, so determinism is
1484320	1489760	true. But this idea that could you have done otherwise? So let's say you're on the road,
1490640	1496640	again, your wife lets you go travel still and says you better, okay, I promise. And you find
1496640	1502160	yourself in similar circumstances, but not exactly the same. It's not a recording of what you did.
1503040	1508480	And you think, well, you know, I did that the last time. I really shouldn't do that again. I've
1508480	1518000	learned from my past. I'm not going to do that in the future. In other words, when the person says,
1518080	1523760	should you find yourself in that circumstance again? It's not going to be the same circumstance again.
1523760	1532400	Okay, let me see if I can reason with the dog for a moment. Sorry to resume when she says,
1532400	1537840	if you find yourself in that circumstance again, but it's not going to be the same circumstance,
1537840	1543600	you have just had at least one moment's worth and hopefully a whole lot of moments worth of
1543680	1551520	remorse of empathy of feeling a loved one's pain. You have hopefully had moments in there
1551520	1556240	where you have reflected on why am I so damn unself-disciplined to junctures like,
1557280	1561360	it's not the same. But going back to sort of the rewinding the tape deal,
1562000	1568720	will it be the exact same world? From our perspective, absolutely not because it's
1568720	1573600	unpredictable, which sort of leads us into the grass on some of these free will questions.
1574480	1581120	Wait, what about chaoticism? What about sort of the fundamental unpredictability of the universe
1581120	1586080	as soon as you're getting, you know, three body problems happening and things of that sort?
1586800	1593760	Hey, maybe that's where we can find free will. And I devote two chapters in there to saying,
1593760	1600240	here's what chaoticism is about. And this coolest thing ever. And it is so exciting. And I love it
1600240	1606240	and not just for the great fractal calendars, but it's not the basis of free will for a very simple
1606240	1613600	reason, because they make the same mistake every time, which is confusing, unpredictable with
1613600	1620720	undetermined. Chaoticism guarantees this is an unpredictable world. And that's why we're never
1620720	1626800	going to have like Tom Cruise sort of pre crime insights into sort of things. But
1627360	1633840	it's unpredictable. It's still deterministic. You take an incredibly complex like cellular
1633840	1640560	automata, and you start off at the beginning, and it could be mathematically proven that you
1640560	1645920	cannot predict what it is going to look like. Nobody can do that. It is the only way to figure
1646160	1651440	out what, you know, you started a what Z is going to look like is you got to first see what B looks
1651440	1656880	like. And then C and then D, you've got to march through, there's no ability to extract. But you
1656880	1662640	start with the exact same condition again, and you will get the exact same outcome, which like
1663520	1670160	was just as a priori unpredictable, unpredictability is not the same thing as undetermined. And the
1670160	1675360	non linearities in the universe mean that it's unpredictable in all sorts of interesting ways.
1675360	1679200	But that sure doesn't mean that we had any control over those steps.
1680320	1684720	Sure. That's just a kind of randomness, I guess, that you don't control either.
1685760	1692240	So that's not giving you volition. But in my scenario there, you've learned something new
1692240	1697120	about yourself and how to engage with your environment. It's not going to be quite the
1697120	1702720	same. And you're not the same. And even though all that learning that happened, you grew new
1703360	1708080	neural synaptic connections and all that stuff, that's determined. But
1709760	1714480	you are self determining the future as you go into the future from the past,
1714480	1720560	you're part of the causal net of the universe. And by learning, you can change what your future
1720560	1726960	behavior does. Maybe this turns on what you mean by determined, and what I mean by self determined.
1727920	1733360	I guess I'm looking for what is it you think happens when you learn something and change
1733360	1741920	your future behaviors based on your past? You have now changed the way you were going to process
1741920	1747840	new experiences. You were going to change the way that you retrospectively evaluate things in the
1747840	1755360	past. And as a result of what you found out, on this ridiculously mechanistic level, your brain
1755360	1764560	is going to respond differently to it. An example I use in the book is you see the movie Hotel Rwanda
1765840	1774480	which was about like one little spot of hope and heroism amid the Rwandan genocide in the early
1774480	1782320	90s. And you watch it and you come away with both the sense of the horror and also inspiration that
1782320	1788320	one guy appeared to have made a difference saving about a thousand people. It's been controversial
1788320	1795840	since then, but you come away and you say that was incredibly inspiring. What does that sentence
1795840	1802560	mean neurobiologically? The circuits in your brain that mediate senses of helplessness
1803200	1808880	were just weakened. They were weakened and there's even like fancy terms for it. Your synapses
1808880	1815120	underwent long-term depression there. They became less excitable and synapses having to do with
1815120	1822720	efficacy and maybe even a sense of self-efficacy got strengthened there. And somehow your basic
1822720	1828480	temperament as to whether or not this is a world in which we are helpless got pushed a little bit
1828480	1834000	of the other direction and realizing it was one person who had absolutely no prior history of
1834000	1841600	heroism makes you think, well, you know, I'm not Mother Teresa. I'm not special. Like I put my
1841600	1848240	pants on one leg at a time like it. Wow. Maybe I could be that and you ever so slightly that
1848240	1855920	knowledge has tilted aspects of your brain. So the next time you're at a position where that might
1855920	1860960	be called upon for you to be a little bit more in that way, you're a little bit more that way.
1861920	1866320	So that's great. That's identifiable in a mechanistic way. And then you take somebody
1866320	1874000	who sees Hotel Rwanda and it does absolutely nothing to them along those lines. Why is it?
1874000	1883920	Because they have a level of skepticism that got sort of pounded into them from their early
1883920	1890160	environment or whatever so that they are irritated and feel emotionally manipulated by the movie.
1890160	1895040	And thus the last thing they're going to do is feel inspired by it and instead is going to say,
1895040	1902320	yeah, well, that was pretty trickly and manipulative. And okay, it wasn't quite like the blind side or
1902320	1906880	whatever in terms of like feel good. But okay, so screw that. But yeah, they had some good
1906880	1912480	cinematography. It's not by chance that that would have been your response. Or all you have to do
1912480	1918480	is look at every single person who decides, yeah, the drinking is getting a little bit out of control.
1919200	1926480	And only some of them will order ginger ale the next time. Where did that come from? How
1926480	1931440	did they turn out to be that sort of person? And the way you turned out to be that sort of person
1932080	1939520	is going to determine what this new piece of information in there is going to do to your
1939520	1945600	subsequent behaviors. And that in turn is going to determine what other people's behaviors changed
1945600	1951040	by the fact that you come out and now you talk about like how great the cinematography was.
1951040	1957200	But damn, that was manipulative versus whoa, you should hear about this guy. That's going to have
1957200	1966400	ripples of effects there as well. And on this like ridiculously like narrow view, like somebody
1966400	1972240	next to you belches, and there's one and a half neurons that are going to work differently as a
1972240	1978000	result. The odds are they're going to work differently only for about 35 seconds. But
1978000	1984960	every one of these things causes a mechanistic trace in the biology of what makes us us.
1986000	1992960	Okay, let's take something like addiction. Now, in my personal case, my father was an alcoholic.
1992960	1997520	His father was an alcoholic. One of his two brothers were one of my two half sisters is I'm
1997520	2001920	not I can have a few drinks. I don't really care. I don't need to have more or whatever.
2002640	2006000	And I don't feel like I have super willpower. I don't think it has anything to do with that at
2006000	2010800	all. I just feel lucky. I didn't get whatever the physiology is that leads to alcoholism.
2012000	2018000	But how would you then describe the difference between me and say my father? He just really
2018000	2025040	had little control. So what he's more determined and I'm less determined or I have more degrees
2025040	2032160	of freedom or how would you even describe it? Just in different ways. Somebody influenced you
2032160	2039680	at some point along the way so that you got more of a sense of efficacy. The genes that helped
2039680	2044640	construct your frontal cortex gave you one that's better at doing the harder thing when it's the
2044640	2050720	right thing to do. Maybe amid that family proclivity, whatever it is that makes alcohol
2051600	2058240	taste good or something. I don't drink, but some alcohol receptors. I know they don't exist,
2058240	2063040	but whatever it is that makes for a good experience. You have a biology where that was
2063040	2073920	a little bit less irresistible. You know, someone on a diet, like I desperately need to I've got
2073920	2080560	diabetes. The doctor is saying if I don't etc. But here I am eating ice cream again.
2081200	2087760	Part of it is the genetic makeup of my gustatory receptors in my tongue and just how good it's
2087760	2096080	going to be. Part of it is my upbringing and just how much my Mesolympic dopamine system in my brain
2096080	2102720	releases dopamine in this circumstance versus in other circumstances. All of that has come from
2102720	2109440	somewhere and you're not your father. And among other things, perhaps you had the makeup where
2109440	2117680	you watched him doing that and instead of saying, well, I love him and he's like a good guy. So
2117680	2122480	maybe this is not so bad. Maybe somewhere in there, there was a switch that went in the opposite
2122480	2129520	direction. But God damn it, I am not going to be like him in that regard. And that's a funny,
2129600	2135600	if you grow up and you're just like your parents, you know, that's kind of a deterministic
2135600	2141520	picture. If you grow up and you're exactly the opposite of your parents because you're so horrified
2141520	2147120	by that, that's equally deterministic. Or if you grow up and you're a lot like them,
2147120	2152880	but you're different in this way because that influential teacher or because the crowd you're
2152880	2160240	that's just as deterministic as well. Those are not examples of like breaking your destiny. It's
2160240	2166800	just another version of how you wound up being who you are. And yours was a different route clearly
2166800	2175120	and and very consequentially. Yes, but when I'm become self aware of these impinging influences,
2175120	2182080	let's say my case, ice cream and chocolate chip cookies. I know I just shouldn't go to the store
2182080	2188160	or this particular store that has this like plate size chocolate chip cookie with the almonds and
2188160	2193280	the cashews and oh my God, it's like 1000 calories. It's just the best. You know, I just make sure I
2193280	2198080	don't go near there when I'm hungry or I don't have ice cream in the house because I know between
2198080	2202480	six and eight o'clock after dinner, I'm going to want ice cream. So what what's happening there
2202480	2207760	when I'm self aware and I'm saying, you know what, you know, my future self doesn't want to have this
2207760	2213360	issue of a little extra weight tomorrow. So today I'm going to set up the conditions in my home. So
2213360	2218880	I'm not tempted later when this happens. Isn't that me kind of self determining my future?
2219440	2226880	No, we're at the self we're at the self awareness come from. Where did where did the ability to
2226880	2235840	reflect on your behaviors? I love dogs. But yes, they can be a big presence. You know,
2236800	2240960	once I was like lecturing about our lack of free will to one of the most like
2242000	2247360	implicitly unreceptive audiences on earth out there, a bunch of judges who like wanted to
2247360	2255120	learn what's new with the brain. And I went through all these studies that are out there
2255120	2262560	about extraneous factors that influence judicial decisions. And one that's very sort of well
2262560	2268800	known and much debated. But I believe in fully because of the rebuttals the authors have come up
2268800	2276480	with, which is as judges get hungrier, they become less open to giving a an understanding
2276480	2282000	decision with respect to a defendant. But then there's studies showing that if you're very hungry,
2282000	2289280	you become much nicer to defendants. If you're Muslim, and it's Ramadan, because you're hungry
2289280	2294960	because you're fasting, then there's another one that shows that judges are slightly less punitive
2294960	2301360	if they find out it's the defendant's birthday. Whoa, how cool is that? Because that's some sort of
2301360	2307360	like compromise between two principles. Dangerous people in society should pay for what they've done.
2307360	2313920	And like, wow, we should be nice to people on their birthdays. So like judges unconsciously
2313920	2319440	on the average balance it out. So you know, half a year less on the sentencing kind of thing.
2319440	2325200	So I'm going through that. And this judge says, you know, that's fascinating. But let me tell you
2325200	2332080	last week I had a case where like it seemed cut and dried. It's obvious what I was going to decide
2332080	2338160	the next day and it was totally clear. And it's funny that night, I wondered if I'm getting a
2338160	2343760	little bit sort of stuck in my ways. And wow, I used to be very different when I was younger. And
2343760	2350320	like, maybe I'm not as on solid ground as I think. And I really stopped and and thought about it and
2350320	2356000	thought through. I thought about how this guy wound up the way he was. And and I also thought
2356000	2360720	about the circumstance. And, you know, I kind of surprised myself, I made a different decision
2360720	2367040	the next day. Are you telling me? And I say, where the hell did you get that self reflection?
2367520	2373280	Where did you get a view of your younger self, where some of your flexibility then is something
2373280	2378960	you might feel nostalgic about? Where did you get the ability to view changing your opinion as a good
2378960	2384240	thing rather than as a challenge? Where did you get the sense that if everybody the next day
2384240	2389760	starting with a bailiff is expecting you to do the usual thing, and you come and you say the opposite,
2389760	2394560	they're going to say, oh, God, what's happened with him is he but where did all of those things come
2394560	2400080	from? And why would like maybe the judge sitting next to you in the seminar room not have done
2400080	2407040	the same thing? That didn't happen by chance. Most people would not have been self reflective at that
2407040	2413280	point. Most people would that didn't happen by chance that that's who you wound up being.
2414480	2420080	Right. Let me give you I had a Christian list on the show a couple years ago with his book.
2420800	2427920	Was it called self? I think self determined. Anyway, he lists three capacities for free will.
2427920	2434240	One, the capacity to consider several possibilities for action. Two, the capacity to form an intention
2434240	2438160	to pursue one of those possibilities. And three, the capacity to take action to move
2438160	2443600	toward that possibility. What's wrong with that as a definition of freedom or volition or whatever
2443600	2449120	the right word is? Oh, I'm going to try to be sort of polite and a good house guest here and
2449120	2455120	merely say that that that's 100 percent wrong. Okay, it's totally wrong. Okay. And, you know,
2455120	2461920	he's a very influential thinker. His is writing about free will, all of that. But here's where we
2461920	2469680	run into sort of the fuzzy squishy domain of we all mean something different when we say free will.
2470240	2477760	And what he is falling into is the most everyday conventional sense. And it is a very proximal
2478400	2484400	notion of free will. It's one, for example, that plays out every single day in a courtroom,
2484400	2490320	where essentially it's the same three questions that are asked. Did the person intend to do what
2490320	2497120	they did? Did they understand what the consequences had a good chance of being? And did they realize
2497120	2502880	they were alternative behaviors? And the way every court works is if the answer is yes to all three
2502880	2509200	of those, the person can now be held culpable for what they did. And, you know, that's responsibility
2509200	2516480	because they exert free will. And this is where I have apoplexy, because this is completely missing
2516480	2524800	the point. This is metaphorically what I say in the book. This is writing a movie review based on
2524800	2530800	only seeing the last three minutes of the movie. Because none of this involves asking the only
2530880	2536640	possible question at this point, which is, yeah, so where did that intent come from?
2537600	2542720	Because if you're not asking that, and if you don't have insights into that, you have zero
2542720	2548960	notion as to how this wound up being this person's actions. And when you ask instead,
2548960	2555600	where did the intent come from? It's from what happened a second before and a minute before
2555680	2561680	and a year before and a million years before. And, you know, that sounds like philosophically
2562640	2569280	great. So we're back at the Big Bang. And I guess it kind of, but biologically, what went on in that
2569280	2575120	person one second before had something to do with informing that intent. And what went on with that
2575120	2580240	morning's hormone levels had something to do with it. And what went on, whether in the previous
2580240	2586080	year they underwent horrible trauma or found love or found their God would have caused structural
2586080	2593600	changes in their brain and their childhood and their fetal life and their genes and the culture
2593600	2599840	their ancestors came up with because that influenced how mom was raising them within minutes of birth
2599840	2604320	and what ecology had to do with what sort of culture those ancestors came up with.
2604880	2611920	And if you're not asking, where did that intent come from? Like the proximal notion of,
2612480	2615680	did they intend to do that they knew they could have done something else and they knew that
2615680	2621680	something bad might happen if they were to go and do that is beyond irrelevant because the only
2621680	2630400	question is, where did that intent come from? Did you read Adrian Reigns book, The Anatomy of
2630400	2636800	Violence? This was a real eye-opener for me. Here I'm going to recount two stories he tells that
2636800	2642480	will support your position. One is Mr. Offt, OFT, is a guy who had an oral frontal cortex
2643280	2649680	who one day all of a sudden finds himself attracted to children and approaches his step
2649680	2654560	daughter inappropriately and the wife turns him in to child protection services and he's in big
2654560	2660080	trouble and then he's talking to a psychiatrist in the hallway, wherever at court or something and
2660080	2664640	he pees his pants and the psychiatrist is like, there's something wrong with this guy, let's get
2664640	2669040	a brain scan. So they do and he's got a tumor, they take the tumor out, his impulses are gone,
2669040	2673680	he doesn't have these desires anymore and then six months later the wife finds some kitty porn on
2673680	2679200	his computer, up then take him back in, scan the brain, the tumor's back and Adrian makes the point,
2679200	2684720	well we don't think of him as a criminal, he's a pedophile, he's a medical patient, he's got a
2684720	2690000	tumor, he's got a problem here, we got to fix it and then he contrasts that with a young man named
2690000	2695280	Dante Page, an African-American man who raped and murdered a woman, this was in Colorado, Adrian
2695280	2701600	was on the defense attorney, the defense side to argue for life sentence rather than the death
2701600	2708560	penalty and basically he recounts then this young man's history, this Dante Page and this goes off
2708560	2713360	for like three pages, this is like the worst background you can possibly imagine, you know,
2713360	2719040	the mother was a crack cocaine addict and no father in the home and you know, multiple
2719040	2722720	boyfriends in and out of the house who would beat little Dante Page when he was a child,
2722720	2729520	dropped him on his head, multiple emergency room visits due to, you know, just being beaten
2729520	2735440	and so forth and you know, just horrible environment, the neighborhood, you know,
2735440	2741120	the running with gangs, horrible schools, food, the air, everything, you know, this is like the
2741120	2746640	worst background you can possibly imagine and then by the time you finish this you kind of feel
2746640	2751840	sorry for this guy and then he says, but I should remind you of what he did to this woman and then
2751840	2757840	you go, oh god, it's just terrible what he did to her and it's like, oh, you know, so what's the
2757840	2763760	difference between Mr. Off, who we think, well, poor guy, he's got a tumor and Dante Page, you
2763760	2769120	just don't see it in the brain scan where there's like obviously a tumor, there's just, you don't
2769120	2777120	see anything and so you don't know that background. So, but what, so then let me then give my
2777120	2782080	response, which is Dan Dennett's degrees of freedom. You and I don't have the tumor or that horrible
2782080	2785840	background. What's the difference between Dante Page and Mr. Off and me and you that don't have that
2786400	2790160	and so Dan would say degrees of freedom, they have fewer degrees of freedom, we have more
2790160	2794480	degrees of freedom, the court accounts for this, oh, he's got a tumor, okay, then we're going to
2794480	2801760	give him a lesser sentence or whatever. Yeah, there's nothing different between the two of them.
2801760	2807280	All that differs is we have trouble thinking in terms of distributed causality.
2808400	2813440	Somebody comes in and they get a whopping great tumor and yeah, we're pretty good at saying,
2813440	2820400	oh, that's the cause. Somebody comes in and I've done a lot of the same song and dance working
2820400	2825280	with defense teams. Somebody comes in and they had a major concussive head trauma when they were
2825280	2834240	little and it took out half of their frontal cortex and in my experience, about 20% of juries
2834240	2841840	are capable of seeing that as causative and mitigating and as one of those greatest sides
2841840	2847520	that should stop one in their tracks, depending on the study, 25 to 75% of men on death row in
2847520	2851680	this country have a history of concussive head trauma to their frontal cortexes.
2852240	2857680	Okay, so we're getting there and we've got an edge case, which is yeah, if the guy comes in with a
2857680	2863280	massive tumor and if you've lucked out and it's a liberal jury and a nice sort of middle-class
2863280	2868160	place, if the guy had a bad head injury somewhere along the way, that's going to count also of,
2868880	2874400	yeah, there's, there's involitional components and enough that that's going to change how we
2874400	2882640	assess him. But then you get the guy growing up in sheer hell and what you see is he is just as
2883200	2889360	mechanistically prone towards antisocial behavior as the guy with the brain tumor.
2890000	2896560	It's just hard to see that it's due to every little baby step of misfortune that he had
2896560	2902880	along the way because we have a lot of trouble with like statistical guilt. Oh, if the mom had
2902880	2908800	not been a crack addict, would he have done the same thing? I don't know. If he had not been stabbed
2908800	2913200	in the schoolyard when he was in middle school, would he have done the same thing? Would he have,
2913200	2921280	could you have predicted just from that? No, absolutely not. And what you see is like in
2921280	2926720	this incrementalism, people who, who study this, there's even a jargony term for it. What is your
2927440	2934800	your ACE score? ACE, your adverse childhood experiences, which is a way of formalizing
2934800	2942320	just how much of a hellhole or a privileged like land of opportunity, your childhood wasn't. There's
2942320	2948560	like even a checklist, you can get your ACE score from zero to 10. Were you witness to physical
2948560	2954320	abuse, to psychological abuse, to sexual abuse? Were you a victim of A, B or C? Was there somebody
2954320	2960960	incarcerated in the family? Was there unstable finance? And you get your score and people study
2960960	2969520	ACE scores, but you could just as readily do it with your, your RLCE score, your ridiculously lucky
2969520	2975840	childhood experience score. And what you see with ACE scores is for every additional step you get,
2975840	2982000	there's an approximately 35% increase likelihood that you will have been involved in anti-social
2982000	2987520	violence by the time you are a young adult. If you are a woman down the line that you will have
2987520	2992960	had an unplanned pregnancy as a teenager, that you will have issues of substance abuse, that you
2992960	3000960	will have issues with mood disorders for every step 35% increase. And what you get is, you know,
3000960	3006000	not all brain tumors in the orbital frontal cortex would have produced that. Some of that would
3006000	3014640	produce somebody who would be outrageously inappropriate during somebody's eulogy. It would
3014640	3021520	have produced, you know, there's other contingent mediating factors, but it's a whole lot easier
3021520	3027360	to see where you get wildly shocking behavior from this middle class accountant who all of a
3027360	3036480	sudden is doing this. It's because of a brain tumor, rather than why is this well prenatal
3036480	3042240	alcohol exposure. And you know, when they were a child and exactly the long list of things you see,
3043120	3049360	and no single one of them, but anytime you can look across a million kids and see that for every
3049360	3056560	step higher in this index, there's a 35% increased chance. And every time you can do the inverse
3056560	3062240	and see every step higher in your, did your parents read books to you? Did you have hobbies
3062240	3067120	that they encouraged all of that? With every step higher, there's a 35% increased chance
3067120	3073360	that they're going to be a student of mine at Stanford University. Like, all we're seeing there
3073360	3081040	is it takes more work to figure out that there were 11 different causes that combined here,
3081040	3087360	instead of one big whopping one. And it's much easier for us to deal with singular causality.
3087360	3092480	And very rarely are we the end products of anything as dramatic as a single cause.
3093520	3101520	So you would say that my background, which was much better than Dante Pages, is not due to
3101520	3107280	anything I did. That's just luck. It's all luck. It's it's tumors all the way down. I just didn't
3107280	3114720	happen to have one. Yeah, yours were more subtle. And in your case, all versions of good luck,
3114720	3120320	because look at how you turned out, your mother must be so proud of you, and you're not sitting
3120320	3127040	in prison. And you were not a, you know, all of these things. I mean, here's here's one study
3127040	3133840	that should stop you in your tracks, or so that should stop a a radical compatibilist in their
3133840	3140800	tracks. You know, there's a whole literature by now on how stress has atrophying effects on
3140800	3146160	the frontal cortex. If you don't know about the frontal cortex, it's the coolest part of the brain.
3146160	3151280	It is so interesting. I so regret having wasted 30 years of my life studying a different part of
3151280	3156480	the brain. Frontal cortex, we've got more of it than any other species. It's the most recently
3156480	3161680	evolved. It's the last part of our brain that fully matures. The frontal cortex is about
3161680	3168560	self control and impulse control and gratification, postponement and doing the harder thing when it's
3168560	3173120	the right thing to do. And what does stress do? Stress and stress hormones on a very nuts and
3173120	3179520	bolts level cause neurons in the frontal cortex to atrophy. And what do you know? Afterward,
3179520	3184320	you're not very good at that emotional regulation stuff. This is why during periods of enormous
3184320	3190080	stress, we make terrible and pulsive decisions because your frontal cortex doesn't work very well
3190080	3196240	with that. And it turns out chronic stress does the same thing to your frontal cortex,
3196240	3202400	but even more permanently. And it turns out childhood chronic stress does it even more
3202400	3207520	dramatically because that's when they're still like laying the foundations of your frontal cortex
3207520	3212960	in terms of brain development. But then this newest study, all of these are neuroimaging studies.
3212960	3220000	So by the time you look at kindergartners, their resting stress hormone levels are significantly
3220000	3228480	influenced by their mother's socioeconomic status. Already by age five, if you are growing up poor,
3228480	3232800	on the average, you have higher levels of stress hormones when you show up for kindergarten each
3232800	3240880	morning. And on the average, your frontal cortex is already developing to be thinner, thinner layers,
3240880	3247040	a lower metabolic rate and less capacity to do the sort of self control stuff as a five-year-old
3247040	3251680	that takes a good frontal cortex. And this is already a predictor of what you're going to
3251680	3257680	look like as a six-year-old. Okay, that's outrageous. But then here's this newest study,
3257680	3263120	because brain imaging techniques have gotten good enough that you can start brain imaging fetuses.
3264320	3272160	Already in a fetus, the rate of brain development is influenced significantly by the mother's
3272160	3278400	socioeconomic status, because that's influencing how stressed she is and her stress hormone levels,
3278400	3284480	which get across the placenta and get into the brain. You're a fetus, and already this stuff
3284480	3291840	is beginning to act out. Go tell me this guy sitting there at the defendant's table had control
3291840	3298080	over it if that was his first step. And every step after that just added to his stunningly
3298080	3306640	awful A score, but it's hard to see. Wait, when they were a fetus, that had something to do with it?
3306640	3312480	Wait, their hormone levels this morning? Wait, that they were stabbed when they were there?
3312480	3318400	Wait, all of those things had something? Yeah, collectively. And you'll find somebody who went
3318400	3322560	through all of those things and didn't turn out that way. In the same way that this guy with his
3322560	3329680	orbital frontal tumor, his disambition could have taken a completely different form, and you could
3329680	3335040	work through that. Oh, it's because it was this upbringing or because of that, and that's why it
3335040	3342080	took that form in him. But in all those cases, there's just this little control, but it's way
3342080	3349440	easier to see it when it's a single sledgehammer of a cause. Yeah, Rain talks about those portable
3349520	3354640	MRI machines they take to these prisons where they scan the brains of these serial killers and
3354640	3359040	rapists and so on. Basically, to a man, and they're pretty much all men, they just have no
3359040	3364960	frontal cortex, or it's just what we as it. They just have no self-control. So the urge is bubbling
3364960	3372160	up from beneath the amygdala or whatever, just have no break on them. But you know, I was thinking
3372160	3378160	about this. I don't have these urges bubbling up that I need a break. Why did they have the urges
3378160	3383840	to be violent and rape or whatever that most of us don't have, that they need a break and we don't
3383840	3388000	need a break? What's the frontal cortex doing there? I guess you would probably say they just
3388000	3393600	had a different background that led to those impulses in the first place. Yeah, and sort of
3393600	3400320	a great example of this, like I've done some of the same court work that Rain has done,
3400880	3405360	and I get put up in front of a jury, and I teach them about the brain, and I teach them about
3405440	3412560	stress and early life adversity and regulation or behavior, and finish with this whole song
3412560	3417520	and dance, that if this had been what you had gone through starting with when you were a second
3417520	3424800	trimester fetus as this guy, you would have done the exact same thing. And then as is the case,
3424800	3432000	the prosecuting attorney gets to cross-examine me, and if the person's good, they shred me in the
3432000	3438560	first minute because they say, okay, so are you saying that any person on earth who had had the
3438560	3443440	same concussive head trauma that this guy had when he was eight along with everything else,
3443440	3449760	that if they had had the same, they would have done the exact same thing? And I say, of course not,
3450320	3455520	of course not, this guy had frontal damage, and as a result, he like remorselessly killed nine
3455520	3461760	people, and some other guy has the same amount of frontal damage, and what he does at family holiday
3461760	3468960	get-togethers is he plays the piano way longer than anybody wants to listen to because, hey,
3468960	3474720	the turkey's ready, come on everyone, let's say, whoa, they are both unconstrained by the rules
3474720	3481040	of society with slightly different versions of unconstrained. And I say, no, we can't predict
3481040	3488160	that, but comparing those two people, I'd be willing to bet some money that the one playing
3488160	3494880	the piano for too long grew up in a loving middle-class household, and this guy did not. I'd be
3494880	3500720	willing to bet that there's four or five genes that this guy has this variant and that guy doesn't.
3500720	3506720	I'm willing to bet that circumstances early in childhood gave this guy a bigger amygdala
3506720	3512880	than that guy and more reactive to perceive threat. Yeah, give me enough pieces there, and
3513520	3518720	we're going to get some mileage here as to figuring out why this guy did what he did,
3518720	3524080	and for the same damage that guy did that. And 50 years ago, we couldn't have told you a word
3524080	3530240	about this. Now, we can list the first few things, stable middle-class upbringing versus
3530240	3537520	childhood abuse, a few other factors, history of alcoholism. Okay, so we've gone up to 50%
3537520	3545360	predictability from 25% just from knowing about the brain damage. Yeah, with each individual piece.
3545360	3551680	But if you carried that out, I mean, you were kind of critical of the minority report idea.
3552640	3556800	But if you carry out what you just said for another century or two, could we not get to,
3556800	3561680	say, account for 99% of the variants in people that have these, I don't know,
3561760	3569600	25 different factors in their background? Probably not 99% because, again, all those
3569600	3578560	like chaotic non-linearities in there. And every time you get the, like, Wilmer Rudolph,
3578560	3584000	Wilmer Rudolph in 1960, she was the fastest woman alive. She got gold medals all over the place,
3584000	3590000	and she was totally amazing and totally amazing because she grew up in a sharecropper shack,
3590000	3597120	one of 22 kids, and she had polio as a kid. She grew up with leg braces, and at some point decided
3597120	3604080	I say, oh my God, the degrees of freedom that lurk in us. I don't know why she wound up being
3604080	3610320	the fastest, what gave her the tenacity to just go back over and over and over again and work
3610320	3617120	against the pain or who knows what. Mario Capecci got the Nobel Prize University of Utah some years
3617120	3623840	ago for working out this technique called site-directed mutagenesis, and he was a homeless kid
3623840	3629680	in Italy after the end of World War II before he got brought in by the right family and like,
3629680	3635680	yeah, these were these amazing, none of those happened by chance either. And a lot of those
3635680	3642720	things that, like, caused that to happen was some random non-linear fluke of the chaotic world.
3642800	3648320	Yeah, we're not going to have complete predictability, but we've got statistical predictability.
3648960	3656080	We know which kids are statistically far more likely to be in trouble with the law,
3656080	3661120	and which ones are going to be going to law school. So we won't have the individual predictability,
3661120	3668000	but I don't know, there's a fair degree of predictability in those cases, and one then says at
3668000	3672320	that point, okay, okay, so you've just said we're never going to have complete predictability.
3672320	3677120	You're not going to be able to tell which of those street kids is going to turn out to be,
3677120	3682480	and all that stuff. Yeah, we don't have predictability on the individual level,
3682480	3689440	we've got to statistically with populations, but any time, populationally, with each additional
3689440	3696320	piece of crappy luck during childhood, you're 35% more likely to be a violent, dangerous adult,
3696320	3701360	we know enough already. We know enough already to know that a system that will then convict
3701440	3709760	this guy on a premise of culpability and free will isn't right, and isn't right intellectually or
3709760	3714320	morally. Okay, here at this point, you'll hear compatibilists say something like,
3714320	3720480	I agree with everything you just said, but free will or volition is not to be found down at the
3720480	3725600	neuronal level or molecular DNA or anything, you're going the wrong direction, it's a higher order
3725600	3732480	emergent phenomenon, it's emergent property of all these convergent neural networks and everything
3732480	3738000	else that's going on there. And by higher order, I mean, again, back to my self-determination. So
3738000	3743840	you teach somebody, here are all the things that are influencing you, and this is what you can do
3743840	3748320	about it. So there are clinical psychologists that deal with people with addiction or violence,
3749200	3757520	issues or whatever. And okay, here is your crappy background, you have a 35% chance of being violent
3757520	3764960	because of these and so, what are you going to do about it? So you cite Roy Bymeister in your book,
3764960	3770880	he has that book called Willpower, he and John Tierney wrote about all the different things you
3770880	3777520	can do to overcome these various factors. And this is at this higher level where like, yeah, yeah,
3777520	3782080	okay, I don't want to do that. I was just watching that movie the other night, The Big George Foreman
3782080	3786400	about the history, you know, is a drama, you know, but they show, you know, one of these contingent
3786400	3790560	turns where, you know, he was had this violent youth in Houston, just horrible background.
3791120	3796400	And at some point, he just randomly by luck ran into this boxing, you know, a little coach or
3796400	3802880	trainer or whatever and said, okay, we're going to channel your violence into sports. Okay, so and
3802880	3808080	then he kind of makes that transition. It's like, okay, so there's a little bit of luck there,
3808080	3812640	but also at some point, he's making that decision, yeah, I'm going to do this instead of this other
3812640	3817600	thing. And then, you know, he gets beat by Muhammad Ali and his life kind of spirals down.
3817600	3822160	And then at some point, he's like 150 pounds overweight, and he's out of money. And, you
3822160	3826080	know, he's just like, what am I going to do? I'm going to make a comeback. And he calls the trainer,
3826080	3830480	I want to make my comeback. And we know what happens. Exactly. Yeah. And then after that,
3830480	3837920	he discovers barbecuing for a whole new chapter of his career. Right. And it's so inspirational,
3837920	3841440	because it's like, you know, can you change personality? Yeah. I mean, he went from this
3841440	3846400	kind of badass motherfucker, mean guy to just sitting next to Johnny Carson, yucking it up,
3846400	3850160	talking about, you know, this guy he's going to fight is any good. I hope not.
3851520	3854640	Where do they get these boxes? You're funny. Oh, they find them in bars.
3855600	3862720	It's just hilarious. So how is it that he did that? And why is that not some form of higher
3862720	3867280	order volition? I am going to turn my horrible life around and become something different.
3868560	3874400	Because lots and lots of people at some juncture will say the exact same thing. And they don't.
3875840	3882880	How come? Well, let's start dissecting how they got there. And none of that happened by chance,
3882880	3888400	that sort of thing. Ironically, Baumeister and I are scheduled to have a debate a month
3888400	3893520	from now on NPR about exactly this stuff, which is going to be total fun because he's like an
3893520	3900560	amazing scientist. And we disagree on that one. But, you know, you bring up something like a
3900560	3907920	merchant complexity, which like chaoticism is the coolest thing in the entire world. Like one aunt
3907920	3913280	makes no sense and you put a thousand of them together. And they all they make societies that
3913280	3920320	do these incredible things. And you like all of this emergent, incredible stuff like aunts through
3920320	3926800	this very simple algorithm can solve the traveling salesman problem in terms of minimizing how much
3926800	3931520	they have to walk going from one food source to another. And then you look in the developing
3931520	3937440	cortex and it solves the traveling salesman problem, the exact same way of minimizing the
3937440	3942880	amount of axons you have to grow to hook up these stuff. Whoa, because of emergent stuff. And
3943520	3950400	exactly as with chaos, that turns into like this irresistible playground to say, ah,
3951280	3957440	free will is an emergent thing. Of course, you can't find it in individual neurons because
3957440	3962720	it's emergent. It's a property that and what you get there is there's a very fundamental
3962720	3969120	mistake there as well, which is the thing that's amazing about emergent systems is you have these
3969120	3978720	stupid simple little building blocks, one aunt, one cell, one person in a marching band or whatever
3978720	3984320	that has very simple rules as to how you interact with the world immediately around you.
3984960	3991200	And you put all of them together and out comes a brain. And not only that, you out comes a brain
3991200	3997120	where everybody has roughly the same brain anatomy, but nobody has identical because
3997120	4003360	emergence meets chaoticism and unpredictability there. This is so amazing. And every single
4003360	4009920	person who at that point decides that there's free will that can now be pulled out of this
4009920	4017280	makes the same mistake, which is they decide that somehow little bitty building blocks are working
4017280	4024160	differently now. They've gotten smarter. They've got more degrees of freedom in their actions.
4024160	4029840	They're doing something differently. And the really sort of, you know, Hail Mary desperate
4029840	4035440	versions of pulling free will out of it is that somehow when the upper level emergent property
4035440	4042800	comes out there, it allows you to reach down and now futz with those little building blocks and
4042800	4047680	manipulate them so that they work differently. And they don't. And the whole point of what's
4047680	4053200	amazing about it is when like all of your neurons are together and they're inventing aesthetics,
4053200	4057360	the building blocks are just as simple and stupid and have the same number of small
4057360	4064240	number of limited rules. And like saying this is where free will comes from is like saying,
4064240	4071360	okay, great emergent thing, one water molecule cannot have the property of wetness. Wetness
4071440	4078080	is an emergent property. But it's like saying what comes with wetness is as enough water
4078640	4083680	molecules come together. We all know, you know, water molecule is made of two hydrogens and one
4083680	4090320	oxygen and when enough of them come together, it's suddenly two oxygens and one hydrogen.
4090320	4096640	And that's where the wetness comes from. That's not how it works. All of the theories about
4096640	4101840	emergence, it's so I love emergence. I torture my students teaching them about this,
4101840	4109360	but it's not will where free will comes from. And it's something like, you know,
4110080	4117760	if you gave chimps as many neurons as we have, it is an emergent inevitability that they would
4117760	4123200	come up with religion. But they would come up with a religion like nothing we have ever seen
4123200	4129600	before on earth, because the chaoticism that and somehow theirs is going to be
4129600	4135280	featuring much more about, you know, bananas, even though real chimps in the wild don't readily
4135280	4141440	eat bananas, I say as a primatologist. Yeah, emergent stuff is amazing, but you can't get free
4141440	4148240	will by saying that in chaotic systems, unpredictable equals indeterministic, and you
4148240	4153760	can't get free will out of emergent systems, because every single version of like how that
4153760	4160880	happens requires the building parts to suddenly get a lot fancier. And it can't work that way.
4160880	4165760	So you're saying like that Sidney Harris cartoon with the two mathematicians at the chalkboard
4165760	4170480	and in the middle, it says America and then a miracle happens. I think you need to be more
4170480	4174800	explicit here in step two. Is that what you're saying by saying, oh, free well is an emergent
4174880	4182640	property. It's like saying and then magic happens. Yeah, exactly. Magic can't happen there. And it
4182640	4188560	doesn't happen spontaneously. The water molecules suddenly don't get a new image of what they want
4188560	4195600	to be in their lives. And they two oxygens now team up kind of thing. And it can't work that way
4195600	4202640	in terms of having like this emergent macro level ability to reach down and make neurons
4202640	4209200	suddenly like have action potentials go in the opposite direction. Doesn't work that way.
4209760	4216320	All of those models depend on somewhere in the middle. The and then magic happens every single
4216320	4226800	one of them. Then what is the self? Is that an illusion too? Well, damned if I really understand
4226880	4232160	that let alone consciousness and please let's not go in that direction because that just
4232880	4238080	I'm just thinking because that's what we think of as volition. It's me making this decision. I am
4238080	4243440	myself. But you know, in the reductionist model you're presenting, I'm just a bundle of I'm just
4243440	4250080	a bunch of neurons and chemicals and just electric meat. Yeah. And all you have to do to see that
4250080	4257040	and to like validate what Sam Harris is saying, who by the way is like the kindred soul for me
4257040	4263120	in terms of just how extreme we are. And he is brilliant at arguing for there being no free
4263120	4270240	will whatsoever. But to come back to his notion, we have consciousness. We have self awareness,
4270240	4275840	all of that. And we have fallen for this notion that that's where our decisions come from. And
4275840	4282400	all you have to do is do an experiment where you sit down somebody at a table, someone who is dieting,
4282400	4288400	and you put a big bowl of M&Ms in front of them. And if you have stressed the hell out of them for
4288400	4296480	10 minutes before with unsolvable math problems, they are now about 80% likely to eat more M&Ms.
4296480	4302800	Because when we get stressed, the frontal cortex is still trying to deal with those consequences.
4302800	4308640	And it's that much less capable of saying, believe me, it's only like eight months till
4308640	4314000	bathing suit season, you really don't want to eat those M&Ms. Self control goes out there.
4314000	4319120	If you could do that to somebody, and you can reliably see this often enough that like you can
4319120	4326240	get a PhD out of your thesis of this, it's so reliable. You're showing self consciousness and
4326240	4331920	awareness and all of that. That's like such a small part of what's going on. By the way,
4331920	4336560	parenthetically, I'm told that I forget who was telling me this, that the blood sugar level
4337600	4342800	self control thing is did not replicate. And this is I think Bob Meisters actually responded to that
4342800	4349600	criticism. There's some debate going on there. Yeah, that one is highly embroiled. It makes
4349600	4354320	tremendous sense to me not because I'm a psychologist, but I spend a lot of time thinking
4354320	4360000	about neuronal energetics and how some parts of the brain are more expensive than other parts.
4360000	4365120	What do you know? The frontal cortex is incredibly expensive. I think I've read the
4365120	4371680	backs and forths with it and I'm in zero position to be evaluating any of the details.
4371680	4379200	I think what the punchline is going to be is that that is a legitimate effect, but it's nowhere
4379200	4385440	near as strong as a lot of the original enthusiasm suggested it was. And does that make it less
4385520	4392480	interesting? Nah, not in the slightest. It's just a smaller voice in that whole picture of
4392480	4398320	distributed causality. Okay, let's pay a little bit less attention to that one, but that's still
4398320	4404560	part of the story. And that's happened with a lot of these. The hungry judges finding has
4404560	4409520	been challenged by all sorts of people. Some of it on statistical grounds and the authors have
4409520	4414640	responded, and I think they have absolutely answered those complaints. But there's other ones,
4414640	4420080	and there's been a couple of non-replications, but they did it in very different ways. And the
4420080	4425520	usual thing in science, which is at the end of the day, probably the answer there as well is,
4425520	4431440	yeah, it's for real, but it's not quite as strong of an effect, or maybe it's a lot less strong of
4431440	4437360	an effect. But that's part of how it turns out we work as biological machines. How cool is that?
4438240	4444240	Very cool. Well, but when I bring up the self, or since you mentioned consciousness, these might be
4444880	4451200	something like these, if they're illusions, they're, or fictions, they're useful fictions. I mean,
4451200	4458720	they work in terms of living a life that I feel like I have choices, and it's good that I feel
4458720	4464080	that way because I need to make choices, that I'm a self, I'm not just a bundle of neural networks,
4464960	4469600	I'm an actual entity. I am sentient, and I'm conscious. And even though there's this
4469600	4475200	hard problem of consciousness, and we'll never solve it, I see Christoph Koch just paid David
4475200	4482720	Chalmers a case of wine for their bet that this would be solved in 25 years. Okay. Of course.
4482720	4488640	Another 25 years. But what I'm thinking is, I'm wondering if it's not going to happen in 25 years
4488720	4493120	more, or 50 years more. It's the wrong question, or the concepts. That's why I mentioned
4493120	4497760	Wittgenstein and her email. We're just going about it the wrong way. We're using the wrong words.
4498320	4503120	I mean, it's not possible to know what it's like to be a bat. I can put on some sonar stuff and
4503120	4507840	pretend like I can get in the closet, we're in yell. I can tell which direction it sounds coming
4507840	4511440	from because of the walls. And I wonder if this is what it's like to be a bat. But at some point,
4511440	4515680	if I had all the apparatus in the neural networks, I would just be a bat, and I wouldn't know that
4515680	4524320	I'm even asking the question. It's almost a dualistic thing as if my little mini-me homunculus
4524320	4528880	can tiptoe into your skull and see what the red looks like to you, and then go back and go,
4528880	4533120	oh yeah, it looks the same as for us. It's a weird idea.
4534080	4541680	It's a very weird one because we're a totally weird species. We are just as mechanistic as a sea
4541760	4549840	slug. And I have one endlessly long chapter on how a sea slug learns to do different things,
4549840	4556640	learns. And this resulted in amazing Nobel Prize for Eric Cantell, one of the greatest pieces,
4556640	4562560	and then show it works the exact same way in us. Some of the same exact molecules.
4562560	4568560	That's just a more complicated process. So in that regard, we're just like every other species
4568560	4574320	out there, but then we're a weird one exactly along the lines you bring up of not only are we
4574320	4582000	biological machines, but we're the only species that could recognize our machineness. Maybe not
4582000	4587280	all the time, maybe never for some people, maybe only in periods of crisis, maybe only when things
4587280	4593920	are going great, maybe intellectually like all the time with me. But as soon as you're dealing with
4593920	4601280	that sort of recursive meta stuff there, we're in very complicated terrain. Because as soon as
4601280	4610160	we know our machineness, we have to wrestle with the fact that while our feelings are not real,
4610160	4617600	and are more mere material outcomes of our reductive universe, our feelings feel like feelings.
4618080	4623040	And somebody else's terrible pained feeling
4624640	4630560	like carries some legitimacy, even though it's an emergent property of their nuts and bolts,
4630560	4636000	you know, atoms. So we're a screwed up species in that regard. And one of the things that happens
4636000	4641440	when we recognize our machineness is we get totally depressed and traumatized because
4641440	4645840	machineness involves knowing we're going to die someday. And while there's nice molecules,
4645840	4653200	you're going to get necrotic on us. But another one is being able to look at the fact that maybe
4653200	4660880	some of the traits we're proud of, we had nothing to do with. And that's exactly where like you
4660880	4670240	and I make it freaked out, because we both are like, we have jobs, we like bring money home,
4670240	4675040	we could put meat and potatoes on the table, neither of us are like mass murderers,
4675040	4682000	both of us have fairly like clear social skills, we both like can like get all of that,
4682800	4687760	both have like college educations, and we've even published damn books and all of that.
4687760	4694640	And a totally mechanistic deterministic world, all you and I can do is sit there and say, wow,
4694640	4700160	so maybe I didn't really earn it. Yeah, all those times my roommate was out partying,
4700160	4705680	I studied instead, and I've always felt like that had it. But maybe I have nothing to do with any of
4705680	4711680	this bummer. And there's a big problem with this book of mine, which is anybody who's going to
4711680	4717760	like spend their time reading a book like this, or anybody who's going to listen to a podcast like
4717760	4724400	this is someone who by definition is going to be biased to go in the direction of finding out that
4724400	4730080	the things that have gone well for them in life, they may not have had really any entitlement to
4730640	4737200	bummer. But what the punchline and the whole thing is, is that for the majority of people out there,
4737200	4743040	the injustice is not that they are getting rewards for things they actually had no control over,
4743040	4749360	it is they are getting punished or deprived or ignored or viewed as irrelevant, because of
4749360	4755760	things they had no control over. For most people, like the finding that like there's no free will,
4756320	4763600	that's liberating. All you have to do is look at somebody who is wildly obese and whose family
4763600	4768640	has always been, and they really have tried and they and nonetheless, everybody kind of thinks
4768640	4773920	either implicitly or even says to each other, wow, what kind of they just have no self control.
4774480	4780080	And it's going to impact their likelihood of getting a job, of finding love in their life,
4780080	4785280	of all these things because of the implicit biases about body, blah, blah, blah, etc.
4785280	4791840	And then one day they find out there's this hormone called leptin, which has something to do with
4791840	4798400	satiation and the hypothalamus, and there's a leptin receptor, and their family has a screwy
4798400	4805120	version of that receptor gene, and that's why satiation doesn't work in there. And you can read
4805120	4812720	these accounts of that's the day my life, that's the day I stopped hating myself. That's the day I
4812720	4822400	stopped, that's the day I was freed from a totally false corrosive, viciously self-righteous domain
4822400	4827520	of deciding that's something we have control over. You and I had some some control over our
4827520	4835680	college degrees, so yeah, we should feel a little bit good about ourselves, and no. And at the end
4835680	4841840	of the day, rather than this being, you know, suck it up, and maybe you didn't deserve your high
4841840	4847680	salary in your corner office, at the end of the day, what this mostly is about is a huge percentage
4847680	4857200	of human misery is caused by the fact that we met out punishment and neglect and all those things
4857280	4862240	for things that people are not responsible for. I like the idea of feeling good about
4862880	4867360	things you're doing in your life, so maybe it's just the wrong words, instead of feeling pride,
4868000	4874800	maybe gratitude, maybe gratitude's a better word. Yeah, because gratitude is the most logical thing
4874800	4883760	to, like, come up within the face of sheer random unearned good luck. That's exactly what it should
4883760	4890320	be. Yeah, yeah, I'm finally making the point about, you know, if you wake up in the morning feeling
4890320	4898240	all motivated to get out in the world, make your mark. What's the Hamilton line, you know, get out
4898240	4904320	there and, you know, was it make my mark or make my, I forget, I forget what it was now, but...
4904880	4911520	I'm not going to waste my shot. Yes, take my shot, yeah. Take my shot, yes. But we know this is a
4911520	4915840	personality and temperament. We know from behavior genetics that at least 50% of the variance on that
4915840	4920560	is accountable by genes. You didn't choose to feel like you have a high need of achievement.
4921680	4930880	And so, yeah, so gratitude about that is important. That capacity to then
4931440	4940800	generalize that to what it means for those who didn't have that. Yes, and so somebody that chooses
4940800	4944880	not to work 80 hours a week. I mean, I've thought about this a lot, what does it take to be 60?
4944880	4951360	You know, why aren't there more people or, you know, women CEOs? You know, to me, it's like,
4951360	4956480	who would want to be a CEO anyway? I mean, who wants to work 80 hours a week and lead this
4956480	4961520	restricted life and you got no family life and no joy? I don't know, I'm probably overgeneralizing,
4961520	4967920	but... And less what does it for you is that you've got a 20,000 square foot house just north of
4967920	4974400	Silicon Valley up in the hills, because those are the folks that like are foraging all over the
4974400	4981760	bushes here out where I live in Silicon Valley. Yeah, that's it's not by chance that that's like
4982400	4988400	how that turned out. You know, there's got to be an explanation not only for Mother Teresa,
4988400	4994160	but for Elon Musk as well. And Vladimir Putin as long as we're at it. But yeah,
4994960	5000960	the pieces just came together differently. And that's not where their source of meaning in life
5000960	5006000	comes from. Or unless when they like get older and it suddenly strikes them that they've been
5006000	5012320	running after the totally wrong source of meaning in life and then they but not not all of them are
5012320	5017040	going to do that. Most of them were just going to fun startups that study had are like freeze your
5017040	5024720	head after your die so you could live forever. Cryogenics is the crackpot growth research industry
5024720	5029200	in Silicon Valley right now, because all of them have conquered the world except for death. So
5029200	5035920	that's what they're funding now. Yeah, that's how it turns out. Right. Okay, let's talk about
5038000	5043520	punishment, retributive versus restorative justice, you know, capital punishment and all that stuff.
5043600	5051200	I'm reminded of the 1988 presidential debate, Michael Dukakis and George H.W. Bush,
5051840	5056960	and Dukakis is anti capital punishment. What if your wife Kitty had been raped and murdered?
5056960	5062000	Wouldn't you, you know, want to put this guy away? And, you know, he rambled off on some intellectual
5063200	5068960	little lecture about capital punishment, which he should have said, yeah, I would be pissed off.
5068960	5073920	And if it was just up to me, I'd want to strap this motherfucker to ol' Sparky and fry until his
5073920	5078160	head count on fire. That's how I feel about it. And then you say, but of course we can't run a
5078160	5083600	criminal justice system based on how angry somebody is, you know, and that's why I shouldn't be on the
5083600	5091200	jury. Yeah, right. Yeah. And it said, Oh, what was what was the guy, the paroled guy in Massachusetts?
5091200	5097360	Oh, right. Yes. Yes. Willie Horton, as it was. Yeah, Willie Horton. Yes. Yes. When when George
5097360	5103840	Bush, Willie Horton, Michael Dukakis, in that debate, which was almost as destructive as the
5103840	5108720	silly picture of Michael Dukakis with his head sticking out of the tank there, trying to look
5108720	5115520	militaristic. Yeah, of course, that's what you're going to do. I, you know, a couple of years ago,
5115520	5121920	there was one of those horrors of some white supremacist guy burst into a place of worship
5121920	5126880	with an automatic weapon and mowed down a bunch of people. And it was horrifying. And I was
5126880	5132960	totally disturbed by that. And like Monday morning, NPR is saying the guy's being arraigned today.
5132960	5137920	And it looks like he's going to get federal hate crime charges as well, which will make him
5137920	5144480	eligible for the death penalty. And my thought was, yeah, fry the bastard, all of that. And two
5144480	5150400	seconds later, I stop and think, wait, I'm working on a death penalty case right now, try to.
5151360	5160640	Yeah, this is, we are run by very visceral emotions. Jonathan Hyde at NYU has done wonderful work
5160640	5165760	showing how much of the time when we are supposedly reasoning our way towards a moral decision,
5165760	5171840	we're doing post hoc rationalization for our emotional decisions, all of that. But yeah,
5171840	5178640	we're also self reflective. And we begin to learn how is it that I wound up this way and probably
5178640	5185280	much more importantly, how is it that that person wound up being different for me before I decide
5185280	5191440	I'm in a position to understand what made them do what they just did. I like the discussion in
5191440	5200800	your book on this idea that it helps the victims families come to closure when the guy is finally
5200800	5205440	put away. And that in fact, the research shows that doesn't close the door for them. Because
5205440	5209280	that's what you think of like, well, yeah, well, maybe we don't want to stay killing people,
5209280	5212400	but at least it makes the close the door for the families.
5213200	5218400	Yeah, and it's very mixed. It's very mixed. It depends on what part of the country you're in
5218400	5225120	and thus what part of regional culture. Yeah, closure is much more of a myth than lots of
5225120	5232160	people in criminology sort of think of people have different responses. And, you know, there's a
5232240	5238480	whole world of people whose immune systems work better after they are able to let go of their
5238480	5246160	hatred and forgive someone. I probably couldn't do that. And that's one of the outcomes also.
5246160	5251760	There's ones who write letters to the authorities saying yes, yes, yes, this person did this to my
5251760	5257520	loved one, but you're going to accomplish nothing by killing them. That's part of the picture as
5257520	5264640	well. They align themselves. Yeah. So the notion that that is where you get closure from,
5265360	5268720	separate of the fact that you probably don't get closure by most reports,
5269600	5276320	yeah, that one's a criminology myth. Yeah, but there is a kind of a game theory logic to why we
5276320	5280400	feel that way. Those emotions, you know, Christopher Baum talks about this in his book,
5280400	5285360	Moral Origins, about, you know, these hunter-gatherer groups that have a whole series of
5286160	5290960	steps they take to control bullies and free riders and people that don't play nice
5290960	5295040	and follow the rules, you know, from gossip all the way up to capital punishment where they, you
5295040	5303280	know, they take Aug out for a hunt and they come back without him. And how everybody has to
5303280	5308320	participate in the killing of this guy so that no one feels individually responsible. And also,
5308400	5314800	it helps attenuate some of the kind of fight back against, from that guy's families, you know,
5315360	5322160	what's a retribution against the killer and so forth. But if you don't have something like that,
5322720	5328080	then free riding and bullying can take over a group. It can propagate. So you need to have
5328080	5333200	some way of dealing with bullies and free riders. Now, why didn't evolution get us to where we get
5333200	5339680	rid of all the bullies and the free riders? And the answer appears to be a social group can tolerate
5339680	5345600	maybe one to three percent of psychopaths, which is the number, and still function pretty well.
5345600	5350400	And we don't want to have, allocate even more resources to give him every last one of them.
5352240	5359280	Yeah. And also, because when you have like nothing but an ocean of cooperators in a game
5359280	5366480	theory setting, the first wolf that shows up does fabulously. And so does the second.
5366480	5371440	And so does the umpteenth, but maybe not quite as much as the first wolf. And eventually,
5371440	5376400	you're getting to a tipping point in this frequency dependent selection sort of thing,
5376400	5382160	where now get one altruist, they're going to fail because all these wolves are just going to laugh
5382160	5387920	at what a like naive bastard they are, but get two altruists and they're going to out compete the
5387920	5392400	wolves because the wolves are not cooperating. And thus, you start getting more and more altruists.
5392400	5399440	There's this cycle of frequency dependent selection for in a world of nothing but nice people,
5399440	5405280	wolves get away with an awful lot. And in a world of nothing but backstabbing cheaters,
5405280	5410480	two cooperators who trust each other and who can interact on a regular basis,
5410480	5415040	they're going to drive everybody else out of business and force them to start cooperating.
5415120	5422960	So it's a it's a funny landscape in that regard. But in terms of so what do we do with societies
5422960	5428880	like lone wolves? And here where you get like, here's where people is going to like throw down
5428880	5436480	their their their their iPhones or whatever right now and saying this guy is such a ridiculous
5436480	5442480	bleeding heart liberal. No, hopefully I've convinced by now that I am so far beyond that.
5442480	5451200	But you know, one of the dictums of public health research is you figure out like what the
5451200	5458960	disease is and how to contain it. And you do it in a way where you contain the medically dangerous
5458960	5464880	person, but you don't do one smidgen more than that. And you do all that good stuff. But the other
5464880	5470720	thing that comes with it is you put at least as much effort into figuring out how did this person
5470720	5477840	get sick in the first place? Where did this disease come from? The the preventative sort of
5477840	5484240	stuff. And that's like at the heart of every public health person and every public health model of
5484240	5490160	what you do with violent damaging people, where you don't blame them and it's not retribution,
5490160	5496400	but it's a quarantine model so that they don't get people damaged. But like you don't do anything
5496400	5500560	more than what's needed to keep them from being dangerous and you don't preach to them about
5500560	5507200	how they have a rotten soul. And then in the same public health model, you need to at least put
5507200	5514000	as much effort into and how did they get this way in the first place and how we can do things so
5514000	5521200	that we wind up with fewer bullies and fewer lone wolves and fewer free riders and all of that.
5521840	5528000	And you see countries that do things that have far less bullying like the Scandinavian countries
5528000	5531760	and what's one of the good predictors of that having a lot of social capital.
5531760	5538080	People trust each other and they feel like they have efficacy. Whoa, a preventative measure. And
5538080	5544800	if you're doing any of this stuff, it's not just, oh, let's not let's not tell murderers that they're
5544800	5551360	terrible mean people and just like, figure out why growing up in this sort of neighborhood
5551920	5558560	quadruples the likelihood that that's who you turn out to be. Figure out why this prenatal stress
5558560	5565360	or figure out, do the preventative stuff. And that's where you're going to make a world with
5565360	5574320	fewer free riders and like, you know, roll your eyes if you will. But you got to keep coming back
5574320	5581120	to the Scandinavian social support models, like they are doing the preventative stuff and not
5581120	5587040	only do they have less problems with recidivism, with their violent people, they have fewer violent
5587040	5591760	people, they have fewer bullies, they have less spousal abuse, they have fewer less of all that
5591760	5597920	stuff. And yeah, root causes, because if I'm sitting there saying why that person do that,
5597920	5601760	where did the intent come from because of one second before one hour before one century.
5602400	5609360	All that is is this like, brand blowout of root causes. So yeah, do that.
5609360	5614960	The death penalty has been outlawed in pretty much every country except democracy, except ours.
5615600	5618560	I don't know, what is it? Half the states don't have capital punishment anymore,
5618560	5624400	but but have to. And then the half that do only a few states, Texas, Ohio, I guess,
5625120	5633440	Mississippi, Florida, you others actually practice it. I mean, most don't. In my book, Heavens on
5633440	5638240	Earth, I got to thinking about what people think about facing death because I was thinking about
5638240	5643760	terror management theory. And then I got, I discovered this literature on what people say
5643760	5649760	just before they're going to be executed. To my utter astonishment, the state of Texas actually
5649760	5654560	records their final statements. They the microphone, you know, you're strapped in, the microphone comes
5654560	5660080	down. What would you like to say? And almost to a man. And they're all men. You know, they thought,
5660080	5664880	I love my mother, I want my mommy, I can't, I love Jesus, I can't wait to see my Lord on the other
5664880	5669440	side. And it's all love, love, love, love. And once in a while they go, and I'm sorry, I killed
5669440	5677360	your because the families are there. Wow. I know it's astonishing. I know. I know there's all
5677360	5682080	sorts of websites that supposedly have accurate information on what these people's final meal
5682080	5689680	requests were. Yes, yes. But final words, that's much cooler. Yeah. Yeah. It's totally wild. Yeah.
5689680	5694640	So, I mean, I guess the capital punishment for two reasons. I don't like to give the power of
5694640	5699040	life and death to the state. And also they get it wrong so often. I mean, the Innocence Project
5699040	5704640	has just been an eye-opener. It's stunning. What kind of differences there are. I think you
5704640	5709440	mentioned the criminal justice. If you have money, you can buy justice. If you don't,
5709440	5714960	you're probably screwed. Of course. And since you work in the criminal justice system as a
5715920	5718480	eyewitness or no, what is it? A consultant expert witness.
5719040	5723840	Teaching witness. Yeah. Teaching witness. Is it as bad as it seems like? I mean,
5723840	5727520	is it really that corrupt? I mean, the rich people can buy the good lawyers and the,
5728560	5734240	you know, the perp that gets the district attorney or whatever assigned person right out of
5734240	5741680	college. Law school is just not going to get as good a justice. Oh, I have no idea at all other
5741680	5746800	than like reading the news, which any of us can do and see ample evidence of that day after day.
5746800	5752480	Because I work with public defenders. I work with the people who can't afford attorneys. So,
5752480	5757920	all I'm looking at are the people who were like 99% of the way lost by the time they were third
5757920	5765040	trimester fetuses. So, I never get to see wealth buying all the justice you can afford,
5765040	5770480	kind of thing. But in this whole, oh, God, we got to come like the Scandinavians and understand
5770480	5779760	how people became the way we all the time in our society are capable of taking individuals who are
5779760	5787680	dangerous, who are dangerous to the people who are around them. And we are capable of constraining
5787680	5793840	them, keeping them from being dangerous anymore. And we could do it without responsibility, without
5793840	5798960	blame, without preaching about their rotten souls. And then we could get insights as to why it is
5798960	5805680	that they're dangerous. Your kid is sneezing and you don't send them to kindergarten that day because
5805680	5812720	they're gonna get all the other kids sick. Satan isn't involved in that. We learn how to do a
5812720	5816720	quarantine model because it's a literal quarantine model. You keep your kid home until
5816720	5821280	they're not sneezing anymore. But you don't sit at home and tell your kid they can't play with
5821280	5827680	their toys because like there's something like they did a bad thing. You don't even do that you're
5827680	5832240	not a bad person, but you did a bad thing sneezing all over your class. It's got nothing to do with
5832240	5837600	that. You just constrain them so that they're not dangerous. And you don't do it once mission
5837600	5843360	beyond that. And you try to do some research of like, okay, why do people get colds when they're
5843360	5850640	five years old? And society hasn't fallen apart. And we don't burn five year olds with
5850640	5855200	nose colds at the stake, even though who knows somewhere back when they would have thought
5855200	5860400	that was a sign of Satan or because they thought illness is God's punishments for your,
5860960	5868080	you know, fetal sins you were born sinful. So it's not that crazy and like satirical.
5868720	5872480	Yay, we can do that. And it's a more humane world.
5873120	5876560	Why aren't we doing that? Why doesn't some state governor go,
5876560	5881040	look what they're doing in Germany or wherever and go, we're going to do that in our state. We're
5881040	5888560	going to try something different. Well, if starters just look at the Republican debate
5888560	5892720	the other night and look at what all those people were bragging about what they had done in their
5892720	5899520	states, which were like as different as you could get and predicated on free will like,
5900240	5905840	like I couldn't contain how happy I was seeing some of the some of the sound by some of these
5905840	5915040	people came out with. Why can't we do that? Because punishment feels good. And seeing pain
5916000	5924480	makes us irrational and makes us irrational in our attributions and very complicated phenomena
5924480	5931360	are really hard to piece apart as to what caused them because that's hard to see and simple explanations
5931360	5937200	are much more appealing cognitively and the more frazzled and upset we are, the more emotionally
5937200	5944240	appealing they are. And that's why that's much easier. Like go sit down somebody and say like,
5944320	5950800	you know, it's a walking cliche to say they had a very tough childhood. But my God, some people
5950800	5957280	do. And that usually came after an even worse fetal life and then a subsequent and, you know,
5957280	5965760	it's hard to think that way. Yeah, multiple causality is tough. And Allah height, we feel
5965760	5971840	our weighted decisions far more often than we like to think. Yeah. But still rationality counts,
5971840	5977360	it does work sometimes. Truth and reconciliation idea has taken off in the last half century.
5977360	5983120	Some countries have employed it to move beyond the anger, which isn't going to get anybody anywhere,
5983120	5988640	to try to find a solution. Why this hasn't happened with the two state solution, you know,
5988640	5996320	in the Middle East, I don't know, just seems like a nightmare. But then Northern Ireland somehow
5996320	6004320	pulled it off. I mean, if of our generation, that grew up as looking as even more intractable
6005760	6013600	in the Middle East. And, you know, it's not perfect. But stuff happens. And somehow, like,
6013600	6019360	they begin and Sadat managed to get to Camp David. And that seemed just as, you know,
6019360	6025040	every now and then. But it sure looks pretty awful. But, you know, South Africa managed to get
6025040	6030960	independence without a war afterward of the white militias. Somehow they pulled that one off every
6030960	6037760	now and then like there's one in the wind column for this stuff. Yeah. Well, maybe it's a meme that
6037760	6042880	your book will launch once again. Let's let's let's move in this direction and apply rationality
6042880	6048880	to solving social problems rather than letting our emotions drive us even maybe even being aware
6048880	6058400	of those of those emotions and why we have them would help. Yeah. Okay, last couple points here.
6060480	6065200	This is what you write here what the what the science in this book ultimately teaches is that
6065200	6071280	there is no meaning. There's no answer to why beyond this happened because of what came just
6071280	6076480	before what which happened because of what came before that. There's nothing but an empty indifference
6077120	6081920	indifference universe in which occasionally atoms come together to temporarily form things
6081920	6088480	which we call me. Well, yeah, this is interesting because I got to thinking about what I call Al
6088480	6092320	Alvy's error, which was Alvy singer Woody Allen's character and Annie Hall,
6093920	6098320	as a child, he won't do his homework in the universe is expanding expanding. Yes,
6098320	6102800	and his mother upgrades him. What's the universe got to do that we live in Brooklyn and Brooklyn
6102800	6109120	what's wrong with him to the doctor. Yeah. Oh, I love that scene. Yeah.
6110160	6114240	Right. So the error is that well, that's not the level, you know, the ultimate meaning of the
6114240	6120880	universe does anything to do. We live here now. I wrote about this with I watched a debate with
6120880	6127760	William Lane Craig and Shelly Kagan philosopher. You know, so Craig writes this, which so here
6127840	6134080	I'm referencing your chapter discussing people who believe in determinism. The claim is that
6134080	6138240	they're not as moral or they they're not they don't feel as motivated or what it has negative
6138240	6143120	effects, which you should point out that the research on that is pretty debatable. And some of
6143120	6147680	that didn't survive the replication crisis. But the other problem is that maybe that's the wrong
6147680	6152560	level to think of it as and then you also discuss can atheists be as moral and so on. Of course,
6152560	6157680	that touches something that's close to me. But here's what Craig argues on a naturalistic world
6157680	6161680	view. Everything is ultimately destined to destruction in the heat death of the universe.
6163120	6167040	As the universe expands, it grows colder and colder as its energy is used up eventually,
6167040	6170880	all the stars are burned out, all matter will collapse and dead stars and black holes.
6171600	6176320	There's no life, no heat, no light, only the corpses of dead stars and galaxies expanding
6176320	6180800	in the endless dark. At the light at the end, it's hard for me to understand how our moral
6180800	6185920	choices have any sort of significance. There's no moral accountability. The universe is neither
6185920	6190800	better nor worse for what we do. Our moral lives become vacuous, because they don't have that kind
6190800	6194960	of cosmic significance. Then he went on about the Holocaust. What difference does it make if we do
6194960	6200640	something about it or not? And Kelly jelly Kagan says, This strikes me as an outrageous thing
6200640	6205360	to suggest. It doesn't really matter. Surely it matters to the torture victims, whether they're
6205360	6210320	being tortured. It doesn't require that this makes some cosmic difference to the internal
6210320	6215040	significance of the universe, but to matter whether a human being is tortured, it matters to them,
6215040	6223440	it matters to their family, it matters to us. That's great. Wow, he must be a fun guy to hang
6223440	6230080	out with, although people may be saying the same thing about me at this point. This brings us back
6230080	6240240	to like we're a totally weird organism in that we could know our machinists, but at the same time,
6240560	6252320	our feelings feel real. And that carries a certain kind of weight and a certain moral imperative
6252320	6257440	that no matter how irrational it is, the notion that something good or bad could happen to a
6257440	6267680	machine, it's a good thing when we decrease cumulative pain out there. I know that ultimately
6267680	6273280	doesn't make sense because it runs counter all this mechanism. But at the end of the day,
6274160	6282720	like where are the species for whom the fact that nothing good can ever really happen to a machine
6283600	6291600	has to feel sufficiently unreal that we function and that we function even with some moral guidelines
6291680	6298240	that come out of that. Yeah, I guess maybe it's different levels of analysis. If you give me
6298240	6303040	a shot of oxytocin in the nose spray, then I want to cuddle more after sex with my wife or
6303040	6309120	something, I don't know what. You go, oh, it was the oxytocin that did that. Well, yeah, but I still
6309120	6314320	have the feelings and the feelings are good. Can I just experience the feelings and not worry about
6314320	6322080	the oxytocin? And maybe the answer is, yeah, don't think about any of this stuff when it comes to
6323680	6329040	who you love. Maybe you don't think about any of this stuff and how your olfactory
6329040	6334080	receptor makeup has nothing to do with the fact that this smells like a great meal and you're
6334080	6340400	happy and anticipatory. Sure as hell do the effort to think this way when you were feeling
6340400	6348160	entitled to more care or more access or more influence or more money or more anything
6348160	6352320	than somebody else just because you've got myths in your head about how you earn it.
6352880	6358240	And sure as hell do the hard work and resist that when you're judging somebody else.
6359040	6366640	You know, go be happy, enjoy your feelings of love, go enjoy the meal, go like figure out
6367280	6373600	why you love this music and don't have to think through why you're part of this culture that
6373600	6379280	likes this type of dissonance and this type of constant chord progressions or god knows what.
6379280	6385760	Yeah, go feel happy, go feel grateful, but don't feel like you earned it and don't feel like you
6385760	6392160	earned the ability to decide that somebody else earned their worse luck than you had.
6392640	6397280	Yeah, again, gratitude. Yeah, Feynman made that point about
6399040	6404480	you know, a scientific analysis of nature. It doesn't take away anything, it just adds.
6404480	6409280	I mean, it's nice to know why a rainbow looks like the way it does. It like bounces inside each of
6409280	6415360	the little droplets of water and so on, but I can still appreciate it. Also, just like anybody else,
6415360	6420000	it just is beautiful to look at and you get an emotional feeling. And even if those emotional
6420000	6427680	feelings have neurochemistry behind them, but what? It's still a feeling. Yeah, like Bach can be
6427680	6435360	broken down into all sorts of rules of contrapunctal composition and like, yeah, that's true. That
6435360	6442240	doesn't take away for there's there's biomechanical explanations for why gazelles look amazing when
6442240	6449680	they leap. But that doesn't, you know, the fact that there is more structure than we suspect
6449680	6456320	superficially to explain things. All that should do is like increase the amazingness of it. Like,
6456320	6462320	purpose of science is not to cure us of like gratitude and being amazed by stuff. All it
6462320	6469440	does is just reinvent it for us. Right. All right, Robert, I really love the book and I love
6469440	6477840	your work. What do you hope could come of this thread of thinking about why our lives turn out?
6477840	6481840	It's a little bit of an extension of your previous book, Behave. I mean, all the different factors
6481840	6487280	that go into it. But what's the bigger picture here? Changing society in a certain direction.
6488960	6496320	Oh, I don't know, given given the world I live in full of like uber uber,
6496320	6504640	astonishingly privileged sort of inheritors of random luck. I don't know, maybe make us all
6504640	6510720	feel a little less entitled, make us feel a little bit less whiny and difficult, make us have a little
6510720	6516560	bit more empathy for someone who's very different from us. And, you know, maybe have a few more
6516560	6523760	people out there whose rotten luck could be explained by, oh, their subtype of like leptin
6523760	6531920	receptor stop hating themselves in the process. You know, I don't know, I'll settle for something
6531920	6539600	incremental just because like scientists like are so accustomed to having no impact whatsoever.
6539600	6544480	So like getting three and a half people to think a little bit differently about their privilege
6544480	6550080	or somebody else's lack thereof. I think that should count as a win for me. Yeah. Well, again,
6550080	6556880	protopia. Just make tomorrow a tiny bit better than today. The problem for utopia is then that you
6556880	6564000	can find ways to sacrifice other people who are standing in our way. Exactly. At some point,
6564000	6569520	countries in light and Scandinavian countries seem inevitable to go to war over who takes
6569520	6577200	better care of their elderly. Yeah. Like somehow that is still part of our potential destiny.
6577840	6582000	I mean, part of the theist argument, which I understand that, you know, without God,
6582000	6587120	then Hitler got away with it. I mean, that that is dissettling. But on the other hand,
6587680	6592000	you know, we that's why we want to have good justice now in the here and now.
6593440	6595520	Because no one knows for sure what happens after you're dead.
6597200	6603040	Yep. Except for those of us who suspect the answer is nothing. Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
6603120	6610160	Because we're made of stuff and stuff stops this weird emergent thing called animacy
6610160	6616400	at some point. But yeah, exactly. No, I know. And people say, well, what happens after you
6616400	6622720	die? Well, where were you before you were born? Well, I wasn't anywhere. Yeah. Right. Back you go.
6622720	6626400	But again, it's part of that kind of dualistic sense that we can't get away from. You know,
6626400	6632240	Paul Bloom even thinks we're naturalistic, natural born dualists that it just comes with the,
6632240	6639280	you know, bundled with the hardware from a very early age. And that, you know, again, back to
6639280	6644640	consciousness, you can't perceive your brain doing anything. And so it just feels like there's
6644640	6649280	thoughts floating around up there. So maybe when my brain dies, they float off into the
6649280	6655120	quantum field or wherever. Because, you know, if you say, imagine yourself dead, you can't.
6655680	6658560	You can't do it. If you're imagining anything, you're not dead.
6659120	6666960	Yeah. That's, that's it. You know, it's like Oliver Sacks talking about hallucinations that
6666960	6671840	people have. You know, they don't think they're hallucinating. You know, the audio cortex is
6671840	6677360	operating there, even though they're in the brain scan, their voices are out there. Right. So.
6677360	6683680	Yeah. Nobody comes into an emergency room saying, help, I'm hallucinating. They're saying, help,
6683680	6687600	Satan is telling me to do this. And I don't want to do it because that wouldn't be right.
6687600	6693280	Yeah. I think you're, again, the free will issue is along those lines. It feels like
6694320	6698800	something like I'm making a choice. So then you attribute to something. Well, it's that free will
6698800	6706720	thing. And then, hopefully, you see enough circumstances where that wasn't the case that
6707280	6714320	like you do a little bit of that like self reflection stuff, which is often not very
6714320	6720560	appealing and is kind of irksome and, you know, go do a little more of that. Yeah.
6721920	6725600	All right, Robert, that's a good place to end coming up on two hours here. I know you're
6725600	6728800	you're doing a lot of interviews for the book. We'll post this as soon as
6729520	6732720	let's see, what's the pub date of this book? I forget. It's coming up pretty soon, right? This
6732720	6736640	week or next week. Mid-October. Mid-October. Yeah. I think we put it. Mid-October or something. Yeah.
6736640	6740720	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you got some debates coming up. That's good. That'll be fun.
6741680	6745440	I definitely have to watch the one with Bob Meister. He's one of the most interesting
6745440	6751120	people working in psychology today. I'm looking forward to it. And he appears.
6751760	6756080	Did you read his book? You read his book, Evil, right? Where he interviewed all these
6756080	6761120	serial killers and, you know, under the theory that they have low self-esteem. Just the opposite.
6763520	6769280	Hey, a little bit of sociopathic narcissism here and there. Everything is the world's fault,
6769280	6776000	not mine. Not me, not me. I'm looking forward to it. He also appears to be a very nice guy for
6776000	6781200	more email exchanges. Yeah, I know. So this should be fun. Yeah, he is. I know him. He's a super
6781200	6786000	nice guy. All right. We can ramble on for hours more. I'll just hit the stop button there.
