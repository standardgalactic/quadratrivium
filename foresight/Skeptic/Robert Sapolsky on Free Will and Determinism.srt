00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Hello everyone, it's Michael Schirmer. This is my friendly reminder to sign up for our December 1st

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,360
through 3rd weekend conference here and event at the Skeptic Society, open house Friday night here

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,960
at the offices, as well as Sunday afternoon for those of you who can't make it Friday night,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,760
Saturday night fundraising dinner for the Skeptic Society. If you support us, it would be great

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,920
to see you there. But most interestingly, we're doing a couple of podcast live recorded episodes.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
I'll be in conversation with not only Jared Diamond Sunday morning, but Michael Schellenberger

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,640
on Saturday. Now, he's an interesting figure, very controversial. I've already gotten some

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,400
mail from people saying, how could you have this guy? Because he's one of the most interesting

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,400
people working out there today. He's worked in environmentalism, on nuclear power, on homelessness.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,560
He lives in San Francisco area, so he knows that well. Drug addiction, what we can do about it.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,880
And especially journalism, independent journalism versus mainstream media, alternative media,

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,360
what we should trust as truth, which is the theme of the conference. In journalism, when you read

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,000
something, should you believe it or not? This is what Michael has been not only studying, but also

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,240
working in. So we'll be having a nice long podcast conversation on Saturday, which is recorded live

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,400
in the hotel at the Hilton, Santa Barbara Hilton there, in which you will participate. That is

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,440
to say, he and I will talk for a little while, and then when it's time, we'll go to you. And you

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,240
can ask questions, you can even dialogue with him. I mean, it's going to be one of those kind of

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,800
interesting podcast episodes, which we'll then post on my show afterwards. Alright, so check it out.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Go to skeptic.com and just click on the banner for the conference. And I hope to see you there.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,280
Thanks for your support. So it's good to see you again, Robert. I think the last time we saw

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
each other maybe was at that City of Ideas conference in Pueblo, Mexico.

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,440
Like in the hallway behind the lecture hall or whatever. But what a totally weird place that

23
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,080
was. It certainly was. Yeah. You know, I've noticed a lot of people have tried to do the TED

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,680
model. And, you know, it's hard to replicate that. It's one of those things that happens maybe

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,640
only once. I just did this conference in England called How the Light Gets In, which was very popular.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,400
It was great. And it was a little bit like Ted and Burning Man. It was outdoors, intense and music

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,400
and, you know, food trucks and stuff like that, but also lectures by professional, whatever. Anyway,

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,040
so. Well, food trucks are always good, but were there billionaires helicoptering in to get into

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,160
there? No, not like that. No. Not like that. Yeah. Robert, let me give you a proper introduction

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
here, my guest today. If you haven't figured it out already is Robert Sapulski, the author of

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,800
several works of nonfiction, including A Primate's Memoir, The Trouble with Testosterone,

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,240
and Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers, his most recent book before. The new one here is Behave,

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,560
New York Times bestseller, which was named Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post and

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,480
The Wall Street Journal. He's a professor of biology and neurology at Stanford University

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,440
and the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant. He and his wife live in San Francisco.

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:21,200
Here's the new book Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will. All right. Robert,

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,040
this is my favorite book of yours. I've read everything you've written. And let me tell you

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,160
why. Wow. Well, it's technically just as good as, you know, your other books in terms of presenting

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,440
the science, but there's something different about this one. Tell me if I get this right.

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
I was just trying to think like on my bike ride today is like, what is it? I feel like

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,400
he's having a conversation with me informally. And then I realize, no, that's not it. It's like,

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
you're having a conversation with yourself and I get to listen in on this.

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,880
It's, well, I think a punchline that goes throughout the whole book is I'm like so far out

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,240
in left field or right field in terms of lunatic fringe opinions about this.

45
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,160
But the majority of the time, I can't follow through on the way I think the world should work.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:16,960
So no one said it's easy, blah, blah. So I think a lot of the book is exactly that. What do you do

47
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,240
when you turn out to be unable to follow through with your prescription for what is like intellectually

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
legit? Yes. In other words, you're wrestling with yourself about a very difficult

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,720
issue, free will and determinism. It's one of these things. Here's how I think about it,

50
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,840
that we've had, I don't know, what 3,000 years of the greatest minds of all time arguing about this.

51
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,360
And if we still don't have a consensus, then there's something different about this than some other

52
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,440
theory. If we were still arguing about the steady state theory versus the big bang theory and there

53
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,720
was no clear consensus, I would think, okay, after 50 years, come on, these guys, they got to try

54
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,120
something new, like maybe string theories like that or something like that. Maybe conceptually,

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
it's just the language or not thinking about it right or I don't know what it is. I mean,

56
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:16,240
you wrestle with this throughout the book. Well, it's a moving target. It's one of those where

57
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:24,480
everyone has a very, very strong folk intuition about what free will is. What I discovered when

58
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,320
having to read philosophers for the first time in my life when preparing for the book is an awful

59
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,680
lot of philosophers between the lines of the philosophizing have very, very strong folk

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,840
intuitions about what free will is. And it's hard to get at. And what I'm also convinced is a major

61
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,320
fault line in that is, what are the implications of there being no free will when we're thinking

62
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,280
about criminality and all that? And what are the implications when we're talking about somebody's

63
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:06,080
amazing resume? Psychologically, there's a big fault line between those two categories of wrestling

64
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,880
with it. Yeah, I like to cite that study. Let me see if I have those numbers. I think it was

65
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,640
David Chalmers actually conducted this study in 2009 of what philosophers, it was like their

66
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,360
position. Yeah, here it is. A 2009 survey of 3226 philosophy professors and grad students

67
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,560
were asked to weigh in on 30 different subjects of concern in their field from a priori knowledge,

68
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,320
aesthetic value, God, knowledge, mind, moral realism, and then this one, free will,

69
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,400
compatibilism, libertarianism, or no free will. The survey found the following results,

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:52,480
59% compatibilism at 15% other, 13.7% libertarianism and 12.2% no free will. So that's you,

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:00,560
you're in the 12%. Yes, I'm actually surprised it's that high. I've been spouting 90 to 95% of

72
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,280
free will acceptance. I don't know about the 13% libertarianism because that,

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
just for our listeners, that's nothing to do with the political party,

74
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,480
that there's something like a little homunculus in your head, a mini-me that's making the decisions.

75
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:27,120
But somehow, yes, it's completely, well, it's somehow fitting in. You kind of admit the world

76
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,480
is made of like material things, but then you grant yourself a homunculus and give it complete

77
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:39,760
power over the material things. I decided early on in trying to do this book that I wasn't going

78
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,960
anywhere near the libertarian philosophers because it's just a little bit too squishy for

79
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
me to make sense of. So I mostly ignore them and just deal with the compatibilists.

80
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,400
Yeah, it seems like a resurrection of dualism. There's a ghost in the machine up there still

81
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,120
floating around, but that doesn't solve anything because if there's a mini-me,

82
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,320
then who's inside mini-me? They have to be a mini-me. All the way in.

83
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,480
Yeah, one more thing before we get into the meat of that. I want to read a passage from your book

84
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,440
to us again. I like how you're writing this so beautiful, but because I think there's

85
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,960
something else going on in this book. So this is your discussing on page 16 and 17,

86
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:32,880
what you mean by determinism. Imagine a university graduation ceremony, almost always moving despite

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,160
the platitudes, the boilerplate, the kish, the happiness, the pride, the families who sacrifices

88
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,440
now all seem worth it, the graduates who were the first in their family to finish high school,

89
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,120
the ones whose immigrant parents sit there glowing, their saris, the sheikahs, our aongs,

90
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,840
broadcasting their pride in the present isn't at the cost of pride in their past.

91
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,680
And then you notice someone amid the family clusters post-ceremony, the new graduates posing

92
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,960
for pictures with grandma in her wheelchair, the burst of hugs and laughter. You see the person

93
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,040
way in the back, the person who is part of the grounds crew, collecting the garbage from the

94
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,680
cans on the perimeter of the event. Randomly pick any of the graduates, do some magic so this

95
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,960
that this garbage collector started life with the graduate's genes. Likewise for getting the womb

96
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,040
in which nine months were spent and the lifelong epigenetic consequences of that,

97
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,560
get the graduate's childhood as well, one filled with say piano lessons and family game nights

98
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,680
instead of say threats of going to bed hungry, becoming homeless, or being deported for lack

99
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,680
of papers. Let's go all the way so that in addition to the garbage collector having gotten all of that,

100
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,200
the graduates passed, the graduate would have gotten the garbage collectors passed.

101
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:56,400
Trade every factor over which they had no control and you will switch who would be in the graduation

102
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,560
robe and who would still be hauling garbage cans. This is what I mean by determinism. Okay.

103
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,280
Evolutionary theories have this distinction between proximate and ultimate causes.

104
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm going to say, go out in the lame here and say this book is not really about determinism

105
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,840
and free will and your beef with Dan Dennett or anything like that. This book is about the garbage

106
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:29,200
collector. Yeah. This was my son's Stanford graduation of just seeing this guy and

107
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,440
what the hell is he thinking and how did this and knowing,

108
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,040
you know, all these graduates worked incredibly hard and they're great kids and they care about

109
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,800
the planet with almost no exceptions and all that. But nonetheless, wow, that's this world that

110
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,640
things turn out that way. And we all know it. We all if you really pin somebody down, they'll say

111
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:06,800
they would have switched. Yeah, that's very interesting that you honed in on that. Yeah,

112
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,560
this book is about that. I mean, life is not fair. How do lives turn out? It's mostly luck.

113
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,840
It's mostly stuff you don't control. And so what you're after here is why is it not fair

114
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,720
like that? And what can we do about it? I mean, we have been trying to do things about it,

115
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
you know, the civil rights and women's rights and gay rights and animal rights and

116
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,160
children's rights and workers rights and all the stuff that we've been working at,

117
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,080
abolition of slavery and torture and whatnot. And we've made made progress, but it's still not fair.

118
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,800
And what can we do to level the playing field as it were?

119
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:53,040
Yeah, that's that's our problem. And hooray, redistribution of wealth and getting over all

120
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,640
these biases and implicit biases and the that whole song and dance. But for me, and what's at

121
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,960
the heart of the book is kind of the starting point is this is a world that runs on the myth

122
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,600
that some people deserve the praise and rewards they receive, and some people deserve the blame

123
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,880
and punishment, and that that is rational and even more so ethically acceptable.

124
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,840
And where that makes no sense whatsoever. And in a in a bizarre way, just kind of given my

125
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,160
training or whatever, this is a book that's mostly about neurons and hormones and gene

126
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,160
environment interactions and all that stuff. But it's, you know, ultimately, a book about

127
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,920
social justice. It's a very screwed world that runs on a myth that things are just

128
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,960
when they're not and they're not because it is a deterministic world.

129
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,520
Could it ever be a just world, given the variation, the natural variation in genes and

130
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,200
epigenetics and social environments and so forth? Or are we just going to just aim for an

131
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,000
approximate not utopia, but protopia, protopia, just a little bit. But that's Kevin, Kevin Kelly's

132
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,400
phrase, by which he means just trying to make tomorrow a little bit better than today.

133
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,320
Well, you know, I come from my my my sociopolitical rants are along the lines of all reform,

134
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,800
undercut revolution, blah, blah, that sort of thing. And this book is obviously an extreme,

135
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,200
extreme stance, because it's not about how there's less free will than we think it's about how there's

136
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,480
no free will whatsoever. What do we do about it? Though you ask, and like the pathetic thing that

137
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,200
I come up with is like a gradual list, little incremental reformist thing of like, try every

138
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,400
day to like, deal with this concept when you interact with somebody or feel like pleased with

139
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,040
yourself, you know, do a little bit at a time. Just because a big theme of the book is, oh my

140
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,160
God, how are we supposed to function if people actually believe there's no free will? We've been

141
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,280
spending centuries crawling in that direction, at point after point, you know, getting enlightened

142
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,840
about how the world actually works and where we subtract responsibility out of domains where we

143
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:30,080
previously meted out major punishments and major rewards. And you know, it's a good thing that 400

144
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,920
years ago or so, most people figured out that hailstorms are not caused by witches. They're not

145
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,440
caused by the old woman with no teeth who has no family living alone at the edge of the hamlet.

146
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, it doesn't work that way. It doesn't work that way that someone who has an epileptic seizure

147
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,520
is possessed by Satan, let alone that they chose to sort of mess around with him. And here's what

148
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,000
he got now. All of this are cases where we've slowly learned there's not free will there.

149
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,840
So, you know, all I do is sit out way out there saying there's none whatsoever, but

150
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,520
you know, we got to do it stepwise to get less and less of that attribution because, you know,

151
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,800
a huge amount of the world's misery is due to the fact that people who had bad luck

152
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,800
are treated as if they had something to do with it. And that we all then congratulates ourselves

153
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,880
on the notion that the world is just in that regard, because we can be the agents of our own

154
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:39,280
actions when we're not. Yeah. Yeah, so this even has a name, just world theory, largely supported

155
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,360
more by conservatives than liberals. That is to say, yeah, the world used to be unjust,

156
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,880
but we've fixed most of that now. Still have a little ways to go, but, you know, if you're rich,

157
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,800
you probably got there because you're hardworking and smart and creative. And if you're poor, well,

158
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,360
you know, you just, you should have gotten up earlier, you should have worked harder.

159
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:08,160
It's like that Seinfeld episode where he has to go back into coach and the flight attendant closes

160
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,320
the curtain and looks at you like, I'm sorry, you didn't work harder. You don't get to come into

161
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:21,680
class. There you have it. There you have it. Somehow I propose that there's a wonderful study

162
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,880
some years ago on not road rage, but airline passenger rage during flights of like unruly

163
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,120
hostile behavior, looking for what the variables were that predicted it. And the study had two

164
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,680
killer findings, which is the more likely or if it's one of those flights where when you're

165
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,800
getting into coach, you've got to walk through first class, that increases the odds of air flight.

166
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,080
But, but even more interestingly, if it's one of those flights where the Hoy Paloy coach passengers

167
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,600
have to walk through first class, there's even more of a boost of anti social behavior among

168
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,800
the first class passengers. Oh really? We don't want to see these people.

169
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,200
Exactly. One is about resentment, but the other is about like reification of entitlement.

170
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,680
God, it's bad enough they had to walk through here. Now what? I've got to wait a few minutes for

171
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:26,320
my drink. So that's some sort of metaphor for everything out there. But wow, what a great finding.

172
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,240
Yeah, that's incredible. Okay, another passage from your book.

173
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,600
One compatibilist philosopher after another reassuringly proclaims their belief in material

174
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,120
deterministic modernity, yet somehow there's still room for free will. As might be kind of clear by

175
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,640
now, I think that this doesn't work. See chapters one, two, three, four, five, six, etc. I suspect

176
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,600
that most of them know this as well. When you read between the lines or sometimes even the lines

177
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,320
themselves and they're writing, a lot of these compatibilists, and I know you're speaking about

178
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,720
Diane Dennett along with others who's been on this show, are actually saying that there has to be

179
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,600
free will because it would be a total downer otherwise doing contortions to make an emotional

180
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,320
stance seem like an intellectual one. Humans descended from the apes, let us hope it's not

181
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,960
true, but if it is, let us pray that it not become generally known. Said the wife of an Anglican bishop

182
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,440
in 1860 when told about Darwin's novel theory of evolution. 156 years later, Stephen Cave titled a

183
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
much-discussed June 2016 article in The Atlantic. There's no such thing as free will, but we're

184
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,680
better off believing in it anyway. I think that's a lot of what's happening.

185
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,200
But I was going to counter that with a quote from Noam Chomsky who I listened to periodically on

186
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,960
various podcasts because he's always interesting to listen to even if I don't agree with him.

187
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,960
He basically said when asked about free will and determinism, he said,

188
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,680
no one really believes in determinism, nor do they act like it, not even determinists.

189
00:18:51,680 --> 00:19:00,560
So why bother to even talk about it? Great. And what I wrestle with is I'm a total determinist and

190
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,480
just a little bit of the time I'm able to actually function as if that's the case.

191
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,800
It's hard. It's hard because we're people of our place and time. I've got no trouble at all

192
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,080
with the notion that there's no such thing as witches, but no matter how much I believe in this

193
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,240
stuff, it's still kind of nice when someone says to me, good job about something that I've done,

194
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,320
or when I'm appalled or irritated or pissed off at someone who's getting on my nerves to really,

195
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,960
truly step out from some notion of agency going on there. It's really hard, but we got to do it

196
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,280
because it's a much more humane world each time we get a little bit closer to that.

197
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,960
Okay. So you define one of your definitions of determinism, the shorter one.

198
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,880
We are nothing more or less than the cumulative biological and environmental luck

199
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,800
over which we had no control that has brought us to any moment. And then I'll quote from Sam

200
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,680
Harris in his book titled Free Will. Interesting. You both had the exact same position. His book

201
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,680
is called Free Will and your book is called Determined. Let's see who gets more sales.

202
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,640
So here's what Sam writes. Our wills are simply not of our own making. Thoughts and intentions

203
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,840
emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious

204
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,440
control. We do not have the freedom we think we have. Okay. Now, remember the exact wording of

205
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,920
both of those definitions. I'm going to give you a thought experiment here because as you know,

206
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:40,160
philosophers love thought experiments. Okay. I'll use John Doe and Jane Doe, but it could

207
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,400
be you and your wife. Okay. John Doe is an exceptionally moral person who's happily married

208
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,120
to Jane. The chances of John ever cheating on Jane is close to zero, but the odds are not zero

209
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,040
because John is human. So let's say for the sake of argument that John has a one-night

210
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:59,280
stand while on the road and Jane finds out, how does John account for his actions? Does he

211
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
pace the standard deterministic explanation for human behavior as in

212
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,120
Sapolsky's and Harris's descriptors above? Say something like this to Jane. Honey,

213
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,240
my will is simply not of my own making. My thoughts and intentions emerge from background

214
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,760
causes of which I'm unaware, over which I exert no conscious control. I do not have the freedom

215
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,960
you think I have. I could not have done otherwise because I'm nothing more or less than the cumulative

216
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,600
biological and environmental luck over which I had no control that brought me to that moment of

217
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,160
infidelity. Could you even finish the thought before your wife would just slap you across the face?

218
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,680
Well, I think what we have here is a very, very pointed and effective thought experiment showing

219
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:54,160
the gigantic gap between like accepting the reality about how both the little itty-bitty parts of

220
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,800
the universe work and how when they get put together into us work and actually being able to

221
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:12,320
live each day because pain hurts. And that is a very painful discovery. And we've got a major

222
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:20,160
problem in there, which it's very hard to hold on to our machineness. And I sure be infuriated in

223
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,600
that circumstance, no matter how many like damn time times I read this book that I wrote and

224
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,000
actually began to believe some of it. This is very difficult because we're going against very deep

225
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,120
intuitions of agency. And it's not for nothing that an awful lot about what makes for psychological

226
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:51,040
stress are circumstances that rob you of a sense of agency. And it's pretty appalling in many ways.

227
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,600
Insofar as we are functioning on self-deception most of the time, one of the wisest definitions

228
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,360
I've heard out there of what major depression is, it's a pathological failure of the ability to

229
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,000
rationalize away reality. So yeah, we got an uphill battle in doing this sort of thing and our

230
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,840
well-being really hinges a lot of the time on a sense of agency and ability to wave away the evidence

231
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:28,560
that it isn't there. But nonetheless, this is how the world works. And there's some domains where

232
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,720
we should do the hard lifting to really work through that in our heads.

233
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,080
Okay, it's often defined as the question turns on, could you have done otherwise?

234
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,080
Okay, now in my little thought experiment, I assuming your wife would say, you got damn well

235
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,320
better never do that again if you find yourself in similar circumstances. Now, let's take Steve

236
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,640
Gould's metaphor of the rewinding the tape. As he said, if you rewound the tape of life and played

237
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
it back, something like Homo sapiens would not appear again because of all the contingent steps

238
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,960
and billions of years of evolution. Okay, as Dan Dennett pointed out, if it's a read-only memory

239
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,440
tape, you'd get exactly what we have because it's just a replay of what happened, like if you had

240
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,440
a recording of everything that happened, that would be fixed. The question is, is that the

241
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,560
universe we live in? Is it something like the, what's that called, the block universe where

242
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,080
everything that can happen has happened already past, present, future, and we're just in the

243
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,080
middle of the movie. We don't know how it turns out, but it does have a fixed outcome. Or are we

244
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,320
in a universe that is not predetermined in that sense? The past is determined, so determinism is

245
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,760
true. But this idea that could you have done otherwise? So let's say you're on the road,

246
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,640
again, your wife lets you go travel still and says you better, okay, I promise. And you find

247
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,160
yourself in similar circumstances, but not exactly the same. It's not a recording of what you did.

248
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,480
And you think, well, you know, I did that the last time. I really shouldn't do that again. I've

249
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:18,000
learned from my past. I'm not going to do that in the future. In other words, when the person says,

250
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,760
should you find yourself in that circumstance again? It's not going to be the same circumstance again.

251
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:32,400
Okay, let me see if I can reason with the dog for a moment. Sorry to resume when she says,

252
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,840
if you find yourself in that circumstance again, but it's not going to be the same circumstance,

253
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,600
you have just had at least one moment's worth and hopefully a whole lot of moments worth of

254
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:51,520
remorse of empathy of feeling a loved one's pain. You have hopefully had moments in there

255
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,240
where you have reflected on why am I so damn unself-disciplined to junctures like,

256
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,360
it's not the same. But going back to sort of the rewinding the tape deal,

257
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,720
will it be the exact same world? From our perspective, absolutely not because it's

258
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,600
unpredictable, which sort of leads us into the grass on some of these free will questions.

259
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,120
Wait, what about chaoticism? What about sort of the fundamental unpredictability of the universe

260
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,080
as soon as you're getting, you know, three body problems happening and things of that sort?

261
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,760
Hey, maybe that's where we can find free will. And I devote two chapters in there to saying,

262
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,240
here's what chaoticism is about. And this coolest thing ever. And it is so exciting. And I love it

263
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,240
and not just for the great fractal calendars, but it's not the basis of free will for a very simple

264
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:53,600
reason, because they make the same mistake every time, which is confusing, unpredictable with

265
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,720
undetermined. Chaoticism guarantees this is an unpredictable world. And that's why we're never

266
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,800
going to have like Tom Cruise sort of pre crime insights into sort of things. But

267
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,840
it's unpredictable. It's still deterministic. You take an incredibly complex like cellular

268
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,560
automata, and you start off at the beginning, and it could be mathematically proven that you

269
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,920
cannot predict what it is going to look like. Nobody can do that. It is the only way to figure

270
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,440
out what, you know, you started a what Z is going to look like is you got to first see what B looks

271
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,880
like. And then C and then D, you've got to march through, there's no ability to extract. But you

272
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,640
start with the exact same condition again, and you will get the exact same outcome, which like

273
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,160
was just as a priori unpredictable, unpredictability is not the same thing as undetermined. And the

274
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,360
non linearities in the universe mean that it's unpredictable in all sorts of interesting ways.

275
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,200
But that sure doesn't mean that we had any control over those steps.

276
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,720
Sure. That's just a kind of randomness, I guess, that you don't control either.

277
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,240
So that's not giving you volition. But in my scenario there, you've learned something new

278
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,120
about yourself and how to engage with your environment. It's not going to be quite the

279
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,720
same. And you're not the same. And even though all that learning that happened, you grew new

280
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,080
neural synaptic connections and all that stuff, that's determined. But

281
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,480
you are self determining the future as you go into the future from the past,

282
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,560
you're part of the causal net of the universe. And by learning, you can change what your future

283
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:46,960
behavior does. Maybe this turns on what you mean by determined, and what I mean by self determined.

284
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,360
I guess I'm looking for what is it you think happens when you learn something and change

285
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:01,920
your future behaviors based on your past? You have now changed the way you were going to process

286
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:07,840
new experiences. You were going to change the way that you retrospectively evaluate things in the

287
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,360
past. And as a result of what you found out, on this ridiculously mechanistic level, your brain

288
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:24,560
is going to respond differently to it. An example I use in the book is you see the movie Hotel Rwanda

289
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:34,480
which was about like one little spot of hope and heroism amid the Rwandan genocide in the early

290
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,320
90s. And you watch it and you come away with both the sense of the horror and also inspiration that

291
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,320
one guy appeared to have made a difference saving about a thousand people. It's been controversial

292
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,840
since then, but you come away and you say that was incredibly inspiring. What does that sentence

293
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,560
mean neurobiologically? The circuits in your brain that mediate senses of helplessness

294
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,880
were just weakened. They were weakened and there's even like fancy terms for it. Your synapses

295
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,120
underwent long-term depression there. They became less excitable and synapses having to do with

296
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,720
efficacy and maybe even a sense of self-efficacy got strengthened there. And somehow your basic

297
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,480
temperament as to whether or not this is a world in which we are helpless got pushed a little bit

298
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,000
of the other direction and realizing it was one person who had absolutely no prior history of

299
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,600
heroism makes you think, well, you know, I'm not Mother Teresa. I'm not special. Like I put my

300
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,240
pants on one leg at a time like it. Wow. Maybe I could be that and you ever so slightly that

301
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,920
knowledge has tilted aspects of your brain. So the next time you're at a position where that might

302
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,960
be called upon for you to be a little bit more in that way, you're a little bit more that way.

303
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,320
So that's great. That's identifiable in a mechanistic way. And then you take somebody

304
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,000
who sees Hotel Rwanda and it does absolutely nothing to them along those lines. Why is it?

305
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:23,920
Because they have a level of skepticism that got sort of pounded into them from their early

306
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:30,160
environment or whatever so that they are irritated and feel emotionally manipulated by the movie.

307
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,040
And thus the last thing they're going to do is feel inspired by it and instead is going to say,

308
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:42,320
yeah, well, that was pretty trickly and manipulative. And okay, it wasn't quite like the blind side or

309
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,880
whatever in terms of like feel good. But okay, so screw that. But yeah, they had some good

310
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,480
cinematography. It's not by chance that that would have been your response. Or all you have to do

311
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,480
is look at every single person who decides, yeah, the drinking is getting a little bit out of control.

312
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,480
And only some of them will order ginger ale the next time. Where did that come from? How

313
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,440
did they turn out to be that sort of person? And the way you turned out to be that sort of person

314
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:19,520
is going to determine what this new piece of information in there is going to do to your

315
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,600
subsequent behaviors. And that in turn is going to determine what other people's behaviors changed

316
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,040
by the fact that you come out and now you talk about like how great the cinematography was.

317
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:37,200
But damn, that was manipulative versus whoa, you should hear about this guy. That's going to have

318
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:46,400
ripples of effects there as well. And on this like ridiculously like narrow view, like somebody

319
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,240
next to you belches, and there's one and a half neurons that are going to work differently as a

320
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,000
result. The odds are they're going to work differently only for about 35 seconds. But

321
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,960
every one of these things causes a mechanistic trace in the biology of what makes us us.

322
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,960
Okay, let's take something like addiction. Now, in my personal case, my father was an alcoholic.

323
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,520
His father was an alcoholic. One of his two brothers were one of my two half sisters is I'm

324
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,920
not I can have a few drinks. I don't really care. I don't need to have more or whatever.

325
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,000
And I don't feel like I have super willpower. I don't think it has anything to do with that at

326
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,800
all. I just feel lucky. I didn't get whatever the physiology is that leads to alcoholism.

327
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But how would you then describe the difference between me and say my father? He just really

328
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,040
had little control. So what he's more determined and I'm less determined or I have more degrees

329
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:52,160
of freedom or how would you even describe it? Just in different ways. Somebody influenced you

330
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:59,680
at some point along the way so that you got more of a sense of efficacy. The genes that helped

331
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,640
construct your frontal cortex gave you one that's better at doing the harder thing when it's the

332
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,720
right thing to do. Maybe amid that family proclivity, whatever it is that makes alcohol

333
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,240
taste good or something. I don't drink, but some alcohol receptors. I know they don't exist,

334
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,040
but whatever it is that makes for a good experience. You have a biology where that was

335
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:33,920
a little bit less irresistible. You know, someone on a diet, like I desperately need to I've got

336
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:40,560
diabetes. The doctor is saying if I don't etc. But here I am eating ice cream again.

337
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,760
Part of it is the genetic makeup of my gustatory receptors in my tongue and just how good it's

338
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:56,080
going to be. Part of it is my upbringing and just how much my Mesolympic dopamine system in my brain

339
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,720
releases dopamine in this circumstance versus in other circumstances. All of that has come from

340
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,440
somewhere and you're not your father. And among other things, perhaps you had the makeup where

341
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:17,680
you watched him doing that and instead of saying, well, I love him and he's like a good guy. So

342
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,480
maybe this is not so bad. Maybe somewhere in there, there was a switch that went in the opposite

343
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,520
direction. But God damn it, I am not going to be like him in that regard. And that's a funny,

344
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,600
if you grow up and you're just like your parents, you know, that's kind of a deterministic

345
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:41,520
picture. If you grow up and you're exactly the opposite of your parents because you're so horrified

346
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,120
by that, that's equally deterministic. Or if you grow up and you're a lot like them,

347
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:52,880
but you're different in this way because that influential teacher or because the crowd you're

348
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,240
that's just as deterministic as well. Those are not examples of like breaking your destiny. It's

349
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,800
just another version of how you wound up being who you are. And yours was a different route clearly

350
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:15,120
and and very consequentially. Yes, but when I'm become self aware of these impinging influences,

351
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:22,080
let's say my case, ice cream and chocolate chip cookies. I know I just shouldn't go to the store

352
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:28,160
or this particular store that has this like plate size chocolate chip cookie with the almonds and

353
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,280
the cashews and oh my God, it's like 1000 calories. It's just the best. You know, I just make sure I

354
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,080
don't go near there when I'm hungry or I don't have ice cream in the house because I know between

355
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,480
six and eight o'clock after dinner, I'm going to want ice cream. So what what's happening there

356
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,760
when I'm self aware and I'm saying, you know what, you know, my future self doesn't want to have this

357
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,360
issue of a little extra weight tomorrow. So today I'm going to set up the conditions in my home. So

358
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,880
I'm not tempted later when this happens. Isn't that me kind of self determining my future?

359
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,880
No, we're at the self we're at the self awareness come from. Where did where did the ability to

360
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:15,840
reflect on your behaviors? I love dogs. But yes, they can be a big presence. You know,

361
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,960
once I was like lecturing about our lack of free will to one of the most like

362
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,360
implicitly unreceptive audiences on earth out there, a bunch of judges who like wanted to

363
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:35,120
learn what's new with the brain. And I went through all these studies that are out there

364
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,560
about extraneous factors that influence judicial decisions. And one that's very sort of well

365
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,800
known and much debated. But I believe in fully because of the rebuttals the authors have come up

366
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:56,480
with, which is as judges get hungrier, they become less open to giving a an understanding

367
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,000
decision with respect to a defendant. But then there's studies showing that if you're very hungry,

368
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,280
you become much nicer to defendants. If you're Muslim, and it's Ramadan, because you're hungry

369
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,960
because you're fasting, then there's another one that shows that judges are slightly less punitive

370
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,360
if they find out it's the defendant's birthday. Whoa, how cool is that? Because that's some sort of

371
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,360
like compromise between two principles. Dangerous people in society should pay for what they've done.

372
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,920
And like, wow, we should be nice to people on their birthdays. So like judges unconsciously

373
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,440
on the average balance it out. So you know, half a year less on the sentencing kind of thing.

374
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,200
So I'm going through that. And this judge says, you know, that's fascinating. But let me tell you

375
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,080
last week I had a case where like it seemed cut and dried. It's obvious what I was going to decide

376
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:58,160
the next day and it was totally clear. And it's funny that night, I wondered if I'm getting a

377
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,760
little bit sort of stuck in my ways. And wow, I used to be very different when I was younger. And

378
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,320
like, maybe I'm not as on solid ground as I think. And I really stopped and and thought about it and

379
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,000
thought through. I thought about how this guy wound up the way he was. And and I also thought

380
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,720
about the circumstance. And, you know, I kind of surprised myself, I made a different decision

381
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,040
the next day. Are you telling me? And I say, where the hell did you get that self reflection?

382
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,280
Where did you get a view of your younger self, where some of your flexibility then is something

383
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,960
you might feel nostalgic about? Where did you get the ability to view changing your opinion as a good

384
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,240
thing rather than as a challenge? Where did you get the sense that if everybody the next day

385
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,760
starting with a bailiff is expecting you to do the usual thing, and you come and you say the opposite,

386
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,560
they're going to say, oh, God, what's happened with him is he but where did all of those things come

387
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,080
from? And why would like maybe the judge sitting next to you in the seminar room not have done

388
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,040
the same thing? That didn't happen by chance. Most people would not have been self reflective at that

389
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,280
point. Most people would that didn't happen by chance that that's who you wound up being.

390
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,080
Right. Let me give you I had a Christian list on the show a couple years ago with his book.

391
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,920
Was it called self? I think self determined. Anyway, he lists three capacities for free will.

392
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,240
One, the capacity to consider several possibilities for action. Two, the capacity to form an intention

393
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,160
to pursue one of those possibilities. And three, the capacity to take action to move

394
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,600
toward that possibility. What's wrong with that as a definition of freedom or volition or whatever

395
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:49,120
the right word is? Oh, I'm going to try to be sort of polite and a good house guest here and

396
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:55,120
merely say that that that's 100 percent wrong. Okay, it's totally wrong. Okay. And, you know,

397
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:01,920
he's a very influential thinker. His is writing about free will, all of that. But here's where we

398
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,680
run into sort of the fuzzy squishy domain of we all mean something different when we say free will.

399
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,760
And what he is falling into is the most everyday conventional sense. And it is a very proximal

400
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,400
notion of free will. It's one, for example, that plays out every single day in a courtroom,

401
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,320
where essentially it's the same three questions that are asked. Did the person intend to do what

402
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:37,120
they did? Did they understand what the consequences had a good chance of being? And did they realize

403
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:42,880
they were alternative behaviors? And the way every court works is if the answer is yes to all three

404
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,200
of those, the person can now be held culpable for what they did. And, you know, that's responsibility

405
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:56,480
because they exert free will. And this is where I have apoplexy, because this is completely missing

406
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:04,800
the point. This is metaphorically what I say in the book. This is writing a movie review based on

407
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,800
only seeing the last three minutes of the movie. Because none of this involves asking the only

408
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,640
possible question at this point, which is, yeah, so where did that intent come from?

409
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,720
Because if you're not asking that, and if you don't have insights into that, you have zero

410
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,960
notion as to how this wound up being this person's actions. And when you ask instead,

411
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,600
where did the intent come from? It's from what happened a second before and a minute before

412
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,680
and a year before and a million years before. And, you know, that sounds like philosophically

413
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,280
great. So we're back at the Big Bang. And I guess it kind of, but biologically, what went on in that

414
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,120
person one second before had something to do with informing that intent. And what went on with that

415
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,240
morning's hormone levels had something to do with it. And what went on, whether in the previous

416
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,080
year they underwent horrible trauma or found love or found their God would have caused structural

417
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:13,600
changes in their brain and their childhood and their fetal life and their genes and the culture

418
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:19,840
their ancestors came up with because that influenced how mom was raising them within minutes of birth

419
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,320
and what ecology had to do with what sort of culture those ancestors came up with.

420
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,920
And if you're not asking, where did that intent come from? Like the proximal notion of,

421
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,680
did they intend to do that they knew they could have done something else and they knew that

422
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,680
something bad might happen if they were to go and do that is beyond irrelevant because the only

423
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:50,400
question is, where did that intent come from? Did you read Adrian Reigns book, The Anatomy of

424
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,800
Violence? This was a real eye-opener for me. Here I'm going to recount two stories he tells that

425
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,480
will support your position. One is Mr. Offt, OFT, is a guy who had an oral frontal cortex

426
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,680
who one day all of a sudden finds himself attracted to children and approaches his step

427
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,560
daughter inappropriately and the wife turns him in to child protection services and he's in big

428
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,080
trouble and then he's talking to a psychiatrist in the hallway, wherever at court or something and

429
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,640
he pees his pants and the psychiatrist is like, there's something wrong with this guy, let's get

430
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,040
a brain scan. So they do and he's got a tumor, they take the tumor out, his impulses are gone,

431
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,680
he doesn't have these desires anymore and then six months later the wife finds some kitty porn on

432
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,200
his computer, up then take him back in, scan the brain, the tumor's back and Adrian makes the point,

433
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,720
well we don't think of him as a criminal, he's a pedophile, he's a medical patient, he's got a

434
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,000
tumor, he's got a problem here, we got to fix it and then he contrasts that with a young man named

435
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,280
Dante Page, an African-American man who raped and murdered a woman, this was in Colorado, Adrian

436
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,600
was on the defense attorney, the defense side to argue for life sentence rather than the death

437
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:08,560
penalty and basically he recounts then this young man's history, this Dante Page and this goes off

438
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,360
for like three pages, this is like the worst background you can possibly imagine, you know,

439
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:19,040
the mother was a crack cocaine addict and no father in the home and you know, multiple

440
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,720
boyfriends in and out of the house who would beat little Dante Page when he was a child,

441
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,520
dropped him on his head, multiple emergency room visits due to, you know, just being beaten

442
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,440
and so forth and you know, just horrible environment, the neighborhood, you know,

443
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,120
the running with gangs, horrible schools, food, the air, everything, you know, this is like the

444
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,640
worst background you can possibly imagine and then by the time you finish this you kind of feel

445
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,840
sorry for this guy and then he says, but I should remind you of what he did to this woman and then

446
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,840
you go, oh god, it's just terrible what he did to her and it's like, oh, you know, so what's the

447
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,760
difference between Mr. Off, who we think, well, poor guy, he's got a tumor and Dante Page, you

448
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,120
just don't see it in the brain scan where there's like obviously a tumor, there's just, you don't

449
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:17,120
see anything and so you don't know that background. So, but what, so then let me then give my

450
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:22,080
response, which is Dan Dennett's degrees of freedom. You and I don't have the tumor or that horrible

451
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,840
background. What's the difference between Dante Page and Mr. Off and me and you that don't have that

452
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,160
and so Dan would say degrees of freedom, they have fewer degrees of freedom, we have more

453
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,480
degrees of freedom, the court accounts for this, oh, he's got a tumor, okay, then we're going to

454
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:41,760
give him a lesser sentence or whatever. Yeah, there's nothing different between the two of them.

455
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,280
All that differs is we have trouble thinking in terms of distributed causality.

456
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,440
Somebody comes in and they get a whopping great tumor and yeah, we're pretty good at saying,

457
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,400
oh, that's the cause. Somebody comes in and I've done a lot of the same song and dance working

458
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,280
with defense teams. Somebody comes in and they had a major concussive head trauma when they were

459
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:14,240
little and it took out half of their frontal cortex and in my experience, about 20% of juries

460
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:21,840
are capable of seeing that as causative and mitigating and as one of those greatest sides

461
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,520
that should stop one in their tracks, depending on the study, 25 to 75% of men on death row in

462
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,680
this country have a history of concussive head trauma to their frontal cortexes.

463
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,680
Okay, so we're getting there and we've got an edge case, which is yeah, if the guy comes in with a

464
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,280
massive tumor and if you've lucked out and it's a liberal jury and a nice sort of middle-class

465
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,160
place, if the guy had a bad head injury somewhere along the way, that's going to count also of,

466
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,400
yeah, there's, there's involitional components and enough that that's going to change how we

467
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:02,640
assess him. But then you get the guy growing up in sheer hell and what you see is he is just as

468
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,360
mechanistically prone towards antisocial behavior as the guy with the brain tumor.

469
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,560
It's just hard to see that it's due to every little baby step of misfortune that he had

470
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,880
along the way because we have a lot of trouble with like statistical guilt. Oh, if the mom had

471
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,800
not been a crack addict, would he have done the same thing? I don't know. If he had not been stabbed

472
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,200
in the schoolyard when he was in middle school, would he have done the same thing? Would he have,

473
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:41,280
could you have predicted just from that? No, absolutely not. And what you see is like in

474
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,720
this incrementalism, people who, who study this, there's even a jargony term for it. What is your

475
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,800
your ACE score? ACE, your adverse childhood experiences, which is a way of formalizing

476
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:02,320
just how much of a hellhole or a privileged like land of opportunity, your childhood wasn't. There's

477
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:08,560
like even a checklist, you can get your ACE score from zero to 10. Were you witness to physical

478
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,320
abuse, to psychological abuse, to sexual abuse? Were you a victim of A, B or C? Was there somebody

479
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:20,960
incarcerated in the family? Was there unstable finance? And you get your score and people study

480
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:29,520
ACE scores, but you could just as readily do it with your, your RLCE score, your ridiculously lucky

481
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,840
childhood experience score. And what you see with ACE scores is for every additional step you get,

482
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:42,000
there's an approximately 35% increase likelihood that you will have been involved in anti-social

483
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,520
violence by the time you are a young adult. If you are a woman down the line that you will have

484
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,960
had an unplanned pregnancy as a teenager, that you will have issues of substance abuse, that you

485
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,960
will have issues with mood disorders for every step 35% increase. And what you get is, you know,

486
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,000
not all brain tumors in the orbital frontal cortex would have produced that. Some of that would

487
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,640
produce somebody who would be outrageously inappropriate during somebody's eulogy. It would

488
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:21,520
have produced, you know, there's other contingent mediating factors, but it's a whole lot easier

489
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,360
to see where you get wildly shocking behavior from this middle class accountant who all of a

490
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:36,480
sudden is doing this. It's because of a brain tumor, rather than why is this well prenatal

491
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,240
alcohol exposure. And you know, when they were a child and exactly the long list of things you see,

492
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:49,360
and no single one of them, but anytime you can look across a million kids and see that for every

493
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:56,560
step higher in this index, there's a 35% increased chance. And every time you can do the inverse

494
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:02,240
and see every step higher in your, did your parents read books to you? Did you have hobbies

495
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,120
that they encouraged all of that? With every step higher, there's a 35% increased chance

496
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:13,360
that they're going to be a student of mine at Stanford University. Like, all we're seeing there

497
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:21,040
is it takes more work to figure out that there were 11 different causes that combined here,

498
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:27,360
instead of one big whopping one. And it's much easier for us to deal with singular causality.

499
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:32,480
And very rarely are we the end products of anything as dramatic as a single cause.

500
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:41,520
So you would say that my background, which was much better than Dante Pages, is not due to

501
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,280
anything I did. That's just luck. It's all luck. It's it's tumors all the way down. I just didn't

502
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:54,720
happen to have one. Yeah, yours were more subtle. And in your case, all versions of good luck,

503
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:00,320
because look at how you turned out, your mother must be so proud of you, and you're not sitting

504
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:07,040
in prison. And you were not a, you know, all of these things. I mean, here's here's one study

505
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,840
that should stop you in your tracks, or so that should stop a a radical compatibilist in their

506
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:20,800
tracks. You know, there's a whole literature by now on how stress has atrophying effects on

507
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,160
the frontal cortex. If you don't know about the frontal cortex, it's the coolest part of the brain.

508
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,280
It is so interesting. I so regret having wasted 30 years of my life studying a different part of

509
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,480
the brain. Frontal cortex, we've got more of it than any other species. It's the most recently

510
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,680
evolved. It's the last part of our brain that fully matures. The frontal cortex is about

511
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,560
self control and impulse control and gratification, postponement and doing the harder thing when it's

512
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,120
the right thing to do. And what does stress do? Stress and stress hormones on a very nuts and

513
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,520
bolts level cause neurons in the frontal cortex to atrophy. And what do you know? Afterward,

514
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,320
you're not very good at that emotional regulation stuff. This is why during periods of enormous

515
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:10,080
stress, we make terrible and pulsive decisions because your frontal cortex doesn't work very well

516
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:16,240
with that. And it turns out chronic stress does the same thing to your frontal cortex,

517
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,400
but even more permanently. And it turns out childhood chronic stress does it even more

518
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,520
dramatically because that's when they're still like laying the foundations of your frontal cortex

519
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,960
in terms of brain development. But then this newest study, all of these are neuroimaging studies.

520
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,000
So by the time you look at kindergartners, their resting stress hormone levels are significantly

521
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,480
influenced by their mother's socioeconomic status. Already by age five, if you are growing up poor,

522
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,800
on the average, you have higher levels of stress hormones when you show up for kindergarten each

523
00:53:52,800 --> 00:54:00,880
morning. And on the average, your frontal cortex is already developing to be thinner, thinner layers,

524
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:07,040
a lower metabolic rate and less capacity to do the sort of self control stuff as a five-year-old

525
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,680
that takes a good frontal cortex. And this is already a predictor of what you're going to

526
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:17,680
look like as a six-year-old. Okay, that's outrageous. But then here's this newest study,

527
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:23,120
because brain imaging techniques have gotten good enough that you can start brain imaging fetuses.

528
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:32,160
Already in a fetus, the rate of brain development is influenced significantly by the mother's

529
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,400
socioeconomic status, because that's influencing how stressed she is and her stress hormone levels,

530
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,480
which get across the placenta and get into the brain. You're a fetus, and already this stuff

531
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:51,840
is beginning to act out. Go tell me this guy sitting there at the defendant's table had control

532
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:58,080
over it if that was his first step. And every step after that just added to his stunningly

533
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:06,640
awful A score, but it's hard to see. Wait, when they were a fetus, that had something to do with it?

534
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:12,480
Wait, their hormone levels this morning? Wait, that they were stabbed when they were there?

535
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,400
Wait, all of those things had something? Yeah, collectively. And you'll find somebody who went

536
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,560
through all of those things and didn't turn out that way. In the same way that this guy with his

537
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:29,680
orbital frontal tumor, his disambition could have taken a completely different form, and you could

538
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:35,040
work through that. Oh, it's because it was this upbringing or because of that, and that's why it

539
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:42,080
took that form in him. But in all those cases, there's just this little control, but it's way

540
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:49,440
easier to see it when it's a single sledgehammer of a cause. Yeah, Rain talks about those portable

541
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,640
MRI machines they take to these prisons where they scan the brains of these serial killers and

542
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,040
rapists and so on. Basically, to a man, and they're pretty much all men, they just have no

543
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,960
frontal cortex, or it's just what we as it. They just have no self-control. So the urge is bubbling

544
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:12,160
up from beneath the amygdala or whatever, just have no break on them. But you know, I was thinking

545
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,160
about this. I don't have these urges bubbling up that I need a break. Why did they have the urges

546
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,840
to be violent and rape or whatever that most of us don't have, that they need a break and we don't

547
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,000
need a break? What's the frontal cortex doing there? I guess you would probably say they just

548
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,600
had a different background that led to those impulses in the first place. Yeah, and sort of

549
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:40,320
a great example of this, like I've done some of the same court work that Rain has done,

550
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,360
and I get put up in front of a jury, and I teach them about the brain, and I teach them about

551
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,560
stress and early life adversity and regulation or behavior, and finish with this whole song

552
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:57,520
and dance, that if this had been what you had gone through starting with when you were a second

553
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:04,800
trimester fetus as this guy, you would have done the exact same thing. And then as is the case,

554
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,000
the prosecuting attorney gets to cross-examine me, and if the person's good, they shred me in the

555
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,560
first minute because they say, okay, so are you saying that any person on earth who had had the

556
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:23,440
same concussive head trauma that this guy had when he was eight along with everything else,

557
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,760
that if they had had the same, they would have done the exact same thing? And I say, of course not,

558
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,520
of course not, this guy had frontal damage, and as a result, he like remorselessly killed nine

559
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,760
people, and some other guy has the same amount of frontal damage, and what he does at family holiday

560
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:48,960
get-togethers is he plays the piano way longer than anybody wants to listen to because, hey,

561
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,720
the turkey's ready, come on everyone, let's say, whoa, they are both unconstrained by the rules

562
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:01,040
of society with slightly different versions of unconstrained. And I say, no, we can't predict

563
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:08,160
that, but comparing those two people, I'd be willing to bet some money that the one playing

564
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,880
the piano for too long grew up in a loving middle-class household, and this guy did not. I'd be

565
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,720
willing to bet that there's four or five genes that this guy has this variant and that guy doesn't.

566
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,720
I'm willing to bet that circumstances early in childhood gave this guy a bigger amygdala

567
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:32,880
than that guy and more reactive to perceive threat. Yeah, give me enough pieces there, and

568
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,720
we're going to get some mileage here as to figuring out why this guy did what he did,

569
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,080
and for the same damage that guy did that. And 50 years ago, we couldn't have told you a word

570
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:50,240
about this. Now, we can list the first few things, stable middle-class upbringing versus

571
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:57,520
childhood abuse, a few other factors, history of alcoholism. Okay, so we've gone up to 50%

572
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:05,360
predictability from 25% just from knowing about the brain damage. Yeah, with each individual piece.

573
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,680
But if you carried that out, I mean, you were kind of critical of the minority report idea.

574
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,800
But if you carry out what you just said for another century or two, could we not get to,

575
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,680
say, account for 99% of the variants in people that have these, I don't know,

576
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:29,600
25 different factors in their background? Probably not 99% because, again, all those

577
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:38,560
like chaotic non-linearities in there. And every time you get the, like, Wilmer Rudolph,

578
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:44,000
Wilmer Rudolph in 1960, she was the fastest woman alive. She got gold medals all over the place,

579
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
and she was totally amazing and totally amazing because she grew up in a sharecropper shack,

580
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,120
one of 22 kids, and she had polio as a kid. She grew up with leg braces, and at some point decided

581
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:04,080
I say, oh my God, the degrees of freedom that lurk in us. I don't know why she wound up being

582
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:10,320
the fastest, what gave her the tenacity to just go back over and over and over again and work

583
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:17,120
against the pain or who knows what. Mario Capecci got the Nobel Prize University of Utah some years

584
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:23,840
ago for working out this technique called site-directed mutagenesis, and he was a homeless kid

585
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,680
in Italy after the end of World War II before he got brought in by the right family and like,

586
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:35,680
yeah, these were these amazing, none of those happened by chance either. And a lot of those

587
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:42,720
things that, like, caused that to happen was some random non-linear fluke of the chaotic world.

588
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,320
Yeah, we're not going to have complete predictability, but we've got statistical predictability.

589
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:56,080
We know which kids are statistically far more likely to be in trouble with the law,

590
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:01,120
and which ones are going to be going to law school. So we won't have the individual predictability,

591
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:08,000
but I don't know, there's a fair degree of predictability in those cases, and one then says at

592
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,320
that point, okay, okay, so you've just said we're never going to have complete predictability.

593
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,120
You're not going to be able to tell which of those street kids is going to turn out to be,

594
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,480
and all that stuff. Yeah, we don't have predictability on the individual level,

595
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,440
we've got to statistically with populations, but any time, populationally, with each additional

596
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:36,320
piece of crappy luck during childhood, you're 35% more likely to be a violent, dangerous adult,

597
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:41,360
we know enough already. We know enough already to know that a system that will then convict

598
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:49,760
this guy on a premise of culpability and free will isn't right, and isn't right intellectually or

599
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,320
morally. Okay, here at this point, you'll hear compatibilists say something like,

600
01:01:54,320 --> 01:02:00,480
I agree with everything you just said, but free will or volition is not to be found down at the

601
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,600
neuronal level or molecular DNA or anything, you're going the wrong direction, it's a higher order

602
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:12,480
emergent phenomenon, it's emergent property of all these convergent neural networks and everything

603
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:18,000
else that's going on there. And by higher order, I mean, again, back to my self-determination. So

604
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,840
you teach somebody, here are all the things that are influencing you, and this is what you can do

605
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,320
about it. So there are clinical psychologists that deal with people with addiction or violence,

606
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:37,520
issues or whatever. And okay, here is your crappy background, you have a 35% chance of being violent

607
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:44,960
because of these and so, what are you going to do about it? So you cite Roy Bymeister in your book,

608
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:50,880
he has that book called Willpower, he and John Tierney wrote about all the different things you

609
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:57,520
can do to overcome these various factors. And this is at this higher level where like, yeah, yeah,

610
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,080
okay, I don't want to do that. I was just watching that movie the other night, The Big George Foreman

611
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,400
about the history, you know, is a drama, you know, but they show, you know, one of these contingent

612
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,560
turns where, you know, he was had this violent youth in Houston, just horrible background.

613
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:16,400
And at some point, he just randomly by luck ran into this boxing, you know, a little coach or

614
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,880
trainer or whatever and said, okay, we're going to channel your violence into sports. Okay, so and

615
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,080
then he kind of makes that transition. It's like, okay, so there's a little bit of luck there,

616
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,640
but also at some point, he's making that decision, yeah, I'm going to do this instead of this other

617
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,600
thing. And then, you know, he gets beat by Muhammad Ali and his life kind of spirals down.

618
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:42,160
And then at some point, he's like 150 pounds overweight, and he's out of money. And, you

619
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,080
know, he's just like, what am I going to do? I'm going to make a comeback. And he calls the trainer,

620
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,480
I want to make my comeback. And we know what happens. Exactly. Yeah. And then after that,

621
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:57,920
he discovers barbecuing for a whole new chapter of his career. Right. And it's so inspirational,

622
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,440
because it's like, you know, can you change personality? Yeah. I mean, he went from this

623
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,400
kind of badass motherfucker, mean guy to just sitting next to Johnny Carson, yucking it up,

624
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,160
talking about, you know, this guy he's going to fight is any good. I hope not.

625
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,640
Where do they get these boxes? You're funny. Oh, they find them in bars.

626
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:22,720
It's just hilarious. So how is it that he did that? And why is that not some form of higher

627
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,280
order volition? I am going to turn my horrible life around and become something different.

628
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:34,400
Because lots and lots of people at some juncture will say the exact same thing. And they don't.

629
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:42,880
How come? Well, let's start dissecting how they got there. And none of that happened by chance,

630
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,400
that sort of thing. Ironically, Baumeister and I are scheduled to have a debate a month

631
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,520
from now on NPR about exactly this stuff, which is going to be total fun because he's like an

632
01:04:53,520 --> 01:05:00,560
amazing scientist. And we disagree on that one. But, you know, you bring up something like a

633
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:07,920
merchant complexity, which like chaoticism is the coolest thing in the entire world. Like one aunt

634
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,280
makes no sense and you put a thousand of them together. And they all they make societies that

635
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:20,320
do these incredible things. And you like all of this emergent, incredible stuff like aunts through

636
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:26,800
this very simple algorithm can solve the traveling salesman problem in terms of minimizing how much

637
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:31,520
they have to walk going from one food source to another. And then you look in the developing

638
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:37,440
cortex and it solves the traveling salesman problem, the exact same way of minimizing the

639
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,880
amount of axons you have to grow to hook up these stuff. Whoa, because of emergent stuff. And

640
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:50,400
exactly as with chaos, that turns into like this irresistible playground to say, ah,

641
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:57,440
free will is an emergent thing. Of course, you can't find it in individual neurons because

642
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,720
it's emergent. It's a property that and what you get there is there's a very fundamental

643
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,120
mistake there as well, which is the thing that's amazing about emergent systems is you have these

644
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:18,720
stupid simple little building blocks, one aunt, one cell, one person in a marching band or whatever

645
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,320
that has very simple rules as to how you interact with the world immediately around you.

646
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,200
And you put all of them together and out comes a brain. And not only that, you out comes a brain

647
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:37,120
where everybody has roughly the same brain anatomy, but nobody has identical because

648
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:43,360
emergence meets chaoticism and unpredictability there. This is so amazing. And every single

649
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:49,920
person who at that point decides that there's free will that can now be pulled out of this

650
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:57,280
makes the same mistake, which is they decide that somehow little bitty building blocks are working

651
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:04,160
differently now. They've gotten smarter. They've got more degrees of freedom in their actions.

652
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,840
They're doing something differently. And the really sort of, you know, Hail Mary desperate

653
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:15,440
versions of pulling free will out of it is that somehow when the upper level emergent property

654
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:22,800
comes out there, it allows you to reach down and now futz with those little building blocks and

655
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:27,680
manipulate them so that they work differently. And they don't. And the whole point of what's

656
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,200
amazing about it is when like all of your neurons are together and they're inventing aesthetics,

657
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:37,360
the building blocks are just as simple and stupid and have the same number of small

658
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:44,240
number of limited rules. And like saying this is where free will comes from is like saying,

659
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:51,360
okay, great emergent thing, one water molecule cannot have the property of wetness. Wetness

660
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:58,080
is an emergent property. But it's like saying what comes with wetness is as enough water

661
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,680
molecules come together. We all know, you know, water molecule is made of two hydrogens and one

662
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,320
oxygen and when enough of them come together, it's suddenly two oxygens and one hydrogen.

663
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:16,640
And that's where the wetness comes from. That's not how it works. All of the theories about

664
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,840
emergence, it's so I love emergence. I torture my students teaching them about this,

665
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:29,360
but it's not will where free will comes from. And it's something like, you know,

666
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:37,760
if you gave chimps as many neurons as we have, it is an emergent inevitability that they would

667
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:43,200
come up with religion. But they would come up with a religion like nothing we have ever seen

668
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:49,600
before on earth, because the chaoticism that and somehow theirs is going to be

669
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,280
featuring much more about, you know, bananas, even though real chimps in the wild don't readily

670
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:01,440
eat bananas, I say as a primatologist. Yeah, emergent stuff is amazing, but you can't get free

671
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:08,240
will by saying that in chaotic systems, unpredictable equals indeterministic, and you

672
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:13,760
can't get free will out of emergent systems, because every single version of like how that

673
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:20,880
happens requires the building parts to suddenly get a lot fancier. And it can't work that way.

674
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,760
So you're saying like that Sidney Harris cartoon with the two mathematicians at the chalkboard

675
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,480
and in the middle, it says America and then a miracle happens. I think you need to be more

676
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,800
explicit here in step two. Is that what you're saying by saying, oh, free well is an emergent

677
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:42,640
property. It's like saying and then magic happens. Yeah, exactly. Magic can't happen there. And it

678
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,560
doesn't happen spontaneously. The water molecules suddenly don't get a new image of what they want

679
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:55,600
to be in their lives. And they two oxygens now team up kind of thing. And it can't work that way

680
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,640
in terms of having like this emergent macro level ability to reach down and make neurons

681
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:09,200
suddenly like have action potentials go in the opposite direction. Doesn't work that way.

682
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:16,320
All of those models depend on somewhere in the middle. The and then magic happens every single

683
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:26,800
one of them. Then what is the self? Is that an illusion too? Well, damned if I really understand

684
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,160
that let alone consciousness and please let's not go in that direction because that just

685
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,080
I'm just thinking because that's what we think of as volition. It's me making this decision. I am

686
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,440
myself. But you know, in the reductionist model you're presenting, I'm just a bundle of I'm just

687
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:50,080
a bunch of neurons and chemicals and just electric meat. Yeah. And all you have to do to see that

688
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:57,040
and to like validate what Sam Harris is saying, who by the way is like the kindred soul for me

689
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:03,120
in terms of just how extreme we are. And he is brilliant at arguing for there being no free

690
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:10,240
will whatsoever. But to come back to his notion, we have consciousness. We have self awareness,

691
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:15,840
all of that. And we have fallen for this notion that that's where our decisions come from. And

692
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:22,400
all you have to do is do an experiment where you sit down somebody at a table, someone who is dieting,

693
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:28,400
and you put a big bowl of M&Ms in front of them. And if you have stressed the hell out of them for

694
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:36,480
10 minutes before with unsolvable math problems, they are now about 80% likely to eat more M&Ms.

695
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:42,800
Because when we get stressed, the frontal cortex is still trying to deal with those consequences.

696
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:48,640
And it's that much less capable of saying, believe me, it's only like eight months till

697
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:54,000
bathing suit season, you really don't want to eat those M&Ms. Self control goes out there.

698
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,120
If you could do that to somebody, and you can reliably see this often enough that like you can

699
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:06,240
get a PhD out of your thesis of this, it's so reliable. You're showing self consciousness and

700
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:11,920
awareness and all of that. That's like such a small part of what's going on. By the way,

701
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,560
parenthetically, I'm told that I forget who was telling me this, that the blood sugar level

702
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,800
self control thing is did not replicate. And this is I think Bob Meisters actually responded to that

703
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,600
criticism. There's some debate going on there. Yeah, that one is highly embroiled. It makes

704
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,320
tremendous sense to me not because I'm a psychologist, but I spend a lot of time thinking

705
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:40,000
about neuronal energetics and how some parts of the brain are more expensive than other parts.

706
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,120
What do you know? The frontal cortex is incredibly expensive. I think I've read the

707
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:51,680
backs and forths with it and I'm in zero position to be evaluating any of the details.

708
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:59,200
I think what the punchline is going to be is that that is a legitimate effect, but it's nowhere

709
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:05,440
near as strong as a lot of the original enthusiasm suggested it was. And does that make it less

710
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:12,480
interesting? Nah, not in the slightest. It's just a smaller voice in that whole picture of

711
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:18,320
distributed causality. Okay, let's pay a little bit less attention to that one, but that's still

712
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:24,560
part of the story. And that's happened with a lot of these. The hungry judges finding has

713
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,520
been challenged by all sorts of people. Some of it on statistical grounds and the authors have

714
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,640
responded, and I think they have absolutely answered those complaints. But there's other ones,

715
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,080
and there's been a couple of non-replications, but they did it in very different ways. And the

716
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,520
usual thing in science, which is at the end of the day, probably the answer there as well is,

717
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,440
yeah, it's for real, but it's not quite as strong of an effect, or maybe it's a lot less strong of

718
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:57,360
an effect. But that's part of how it turns out we work as biological machines. How cool is that?

719
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:04,240
Very cool. Well, but when I bring up the self, or since you mentioned consciousness, these might be

720
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:11,200
something like these, if they're illusions, they're, or fictions, they're useful fictions. I mean,

721
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:18,720
they work in terms of living a life that I feel like I have choices, and it's good that I feel

722
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:24,080
that way because I need to make choices, that I'm a self, I'm not just a bundle of neural networks,

723
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,600
I'm an actual entity. I am sentient, and I'm conscious. And even though there's this

724
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,200
hard problem of consciousness, and we'll never solve it, I see Christoph Koch just paid David

725
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:42,720
Chalmers a case of wine for their bet that this would be solved in 25 years. Okay. Of course.

726
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:48,640
Another 25 years. But what I'm thinking is, I'm wondering if it's not going to happen in 25 years

727
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,120
more, or 50 years more. It's the wrong question, or the concepts. That's why I mentioned

728
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,760
Wittgenstein and her email. We're just going about it the wrong way. We're using the wrong words.

729
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:03,120
I mean, it's not possible to know what it's like to be a bat. I can put on some sonar stuff and

730
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:07,840
pretend like I can get in the closet, we're in yell. I can tell which direction it sounds coming

731
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,440
from because of the walls. And I wonder if this is what it's like to be a bat. But at some point,

732
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:15,680
if I had all the apparatus in the neural networks, I would just be a bat, and I wouldn't know that

733
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:24,320
I'm even asking the question. It's almost a dualistic thing as if my little mini-me homunculus

734
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,880
can tiptoe into your skull and see what the red looks like to you, and then go back and go,

735
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,120
oh yeah, it looks the same as for us. It's a weird idea.

736
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:41,680
It's a very weird one because we're a totally weird species. We are just as mechanistic as a sea

737
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:49,840
slug. And I have one endlessly long chapter on how a sea slug learns to do different things,

738
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,640
learns. And this resulted in amazing Nobel Prize for Eric Cantell, one of the greatest pieces,

739
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:02,560
and then show it works the exact same way in us. Some of the same exact molecules.

740
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,560
That's just a more complicated process. So in that regard, we're just like every other species

741
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:14,320
out there, but then we're a weird one exactly along the lines you bring up of not only are we

742
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:22,000
biological machines, but we're the only species that could recognize our machineness. Maybe not

743
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,280
all the time, maybe never for some people, maybe only in periods of crisis, maybe only when things

744
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:33,920
are going great, maybe intellectually like all the time with me. But as soon as you're dealing with

745
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:41,280
that sort of recursive meta stuff there, we're in very complicated terrain. Because as soon as

746
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:50,160
we know our machineness, we have to wrestle with the fact that while our feelings are not real,

747
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:57,600
and are more mere material outcomes of our reductive universe, our feelings feel like feelings.

748
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:03,040
And somebody else's terrible pained feeling

749
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,560
like carries some legitimacy, even though it's an emergent property of their nuts and bolts,

750
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:16,000
you know, atoms. So we're a screwed up species in that regard. And one of the things that happens

751
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,440
when we recognize our machineness is we get totally depressed and traumatized because

752
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:25,840
machineness involves knowing we're going to die someday. And while there's nice molecules,

753
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:33,200
you're going to get necrotic on us. But another one is being able to look at the fact that maybe

754
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:40,880
some of the traits we're proud of, we had nothing to do with. And that's exactly where like you

755
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:50,240
and I make it freaked out, because we both are like, we have jobs, we like bring money home,

756
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:55,040
we could put meat and potatoes on the table, neither of us are like mass murderers,

757
01:17:55,040 --> 01:18:02,000
both of us have fairly like clear social skills, we both like can like get all of that,

758
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,760
both have like college educations, and we've even published damn books and all of that.

759
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:14,640
And a totally mechanistic deterministic world, all you and I can do is sit there and say, wow,

760
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:20,160
so maybe I didn't really earn it. Yeah, all those times my roommate was out partying,

761
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:25,680
I studied instead, and I've always felt like that had it. But maybe I have nothing to do with any of

762
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:31,680
this bummer. And there's a big problem with this book of mine, which is anybody who's going to

763
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:37,760
like spend their time reading a book like this, or anybody who's going to listen to a podcast like

764
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:44,400
this is someone who by definition is going to be biased to go in the direction of finding out that

765
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:50,080
the things that have gone well for them in life, they may not have had really any entitlement to

766
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:57,200
bummer. But what the punchline and the whole thing is, is that for the majority of people out there,

767
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:03,040
the injustice is not that they are getting rewards for things they actually had no control over,

768
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:09,360
it is they are getting punished or deprived or ignored or viewed as irrelevant, because of

769
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:15,760
things they had no control over. For most people, like the finding that like there's no free will,

770
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:23,600
that's liberating. All you have to do is look at somebody who is wildly obese and whose family

771
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,640
has always been, and they really have tried and they and nonetheless, everybody kind of thinks

772
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,920
either implicitly or even says to each other, wow, what kind of they just have no self control.

773
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:40,080
And it's going to impact their likelihood of getting a job, of finding love in their life,

774
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:45,280
of all these things because of the implicit biases about body, blah, blah, blah, etc.

775
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:51,840
And then one day they find out there's this hormone called leptin, which has something to do with

776
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:58,400
satiation and the hypothalamus, and there's a leptin receptor, and their family has a screwy

777
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:05,120
version of that receptor gene, and that's why satiation doesn't work in there. And you can read

778
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:12,720
these accounts of that's the day my life, that's the day I stopped hating myself. That's the day I

779
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:22,400
stopped, that's the day I was freed from a totally false corrosive, viciously self-righteous domain

780
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,520
of deciding that's something we have control over. You and I had some some control over our

781
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:35,680
college degrees, so yeah, we should feel a little bit good about ourselves, and no. And at the end

782
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:41,840
of the day, rather than this being, you know, suck it up, and maybe you didn't deserve your high

783
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:47,680
salary in your corner office, at the end of the day, what this mostly is about is a huge percentage

784
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:57,200
of human misery is caused by the fact that we met out punishment and neglect and all those things

785
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:02,240
for things that people are not responsible for. I like the idea of feeling good about

786
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,360
things you're doing in your life, so maybe it's just the wrong words, instead of feeling pride,

787
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:14,800
maybe gratitude, maybe gratitude's a better word. Yeah, because gratitude is the most logical thing

788
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:23,760
to, like, come up within the face of sheer random unearned good luck. That's exactly what it should

789
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:30,320
be. Yeah, yeah, I'm finally making the point about, you know, if you wake up in the morning feeling

790
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:38,240
all motivated to get out in the world, make your mark. What's the Hamilton line, you know, get out

791
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:44,320
there and, you know, was it make my mark or make my, I forget, I forget what it was now, but...

792
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:51,520
I'm not going to waste my shot. Yes, take my shot, yeah. Take my shot, yes. But we know this is a

793
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,840
personality and temperament. We know from behavior genetics that at least 50% of the variance on that

794
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,560
is accountable by genes. You didn't choose to feel like you have a high need of achievement.

795
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:10,880
And so, yeah, so gratitude about that is important. That capacity to then

796
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:20,800
generalize that to what it means for those who didn't have that. Yes, and so somebody that chooses

797
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,880
not to work 80 hours a week. I mean, I've thought about this a lot, what does it take to be 60?

798
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:31,360
You know, why aren't there more people or, you know, women CEOs? You know, to me, it's like,

799
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:36,480
who would want to be a CEO anyway? I mean, who wants to work 80 hours a week and lead this

800
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:41,520
restricted life and you got no family life and no joy? I don't know, I'm probably overgeneralizing,

801
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:47,920
but... And less what does it for you is that you've got a 20,000 square foot house just north of

802
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:54,400
Silicon Valley up in the hills, because those are the folks that like are foraging all over the

803
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:01,760
bushes here out where I live in Silicon Valley. Yeah, that's it's not by chance that that's like

804
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:08,400
how that turned out. You know, there's got to be an explanation not only for Mother Teresa,

805
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:14,160
but for Elon Musk as well. And Vladimir Putin as long as we're at it. But yeah,

806
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:20,960
the pieces just came together differently. And that's not where their source of meaning in life

807
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:26,000
comes from. Or unless when they like get older and it suddenly strikes them that they've been

808
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:32,320
running after the totally wrong source of meaning in life and then they but not not all of them are

809
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:37,040
going to do that. Most of them were just going to fun startups that study had are like freeze your

810
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:44,720
head after your die so you could live forever. Cryogenics is the crackpot growth research industry

811
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:49,200
in Silicon Valley right now, because all of them have conquered the world except for death. So

812
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:55,920
that's what they're funding now. Yeah, that's how it turns out. Right. Okay, let's talk about

813
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:03,520
punishment, retributive versus restorative justice, you know, capital punishment and all that stuff.

814
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:11,200
I'm reminded of the 1988 presidential debate, Michael Dukakis and George H.W. Bush,

815
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,960
and Dukakis is anti capital punishment. What if your wife Kitty had been raped and murdered?

816
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:22,000
Wouldn't you, you know, want to put this guy away? And, you know, he rambled off on some intellectual

817
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:28,960
little lecture about capital punishment, which he should have said, yeah, I would be pissed off.

818
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,920
And if it was just up to me, I'd want to strap this motherfucker to ol' Sparky and fry until his

819
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,160
head count on fire. That's how I feel about it. And then you say, but of course we can't run a

820
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:43,600
criminal justice system based on how angry somebody is, you know, and that's why I shouldn't be on the

821
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:51,200
jury. Yeah, right. Yeah. And it said, Oh, what was what was the guy, the paroled guy in Massachusetts?

822
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:57,360
Oh, right. Yes. Yes. Willie Horton, as it was. Yeah, Willie Horton. Yes. Yes. When when George

823
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:03,840
Bush, Willie Horton, Michael Dukakis, in that debate, which was almost as destructive as the

824
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,720
silly picture of Michael Dukakis with his head sticking out of the tank there, trying to look

825
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:15,520
militaristic. Yeah, of course, that's what you're going to do. I, you know, a couple of years ago,

826
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:21,920
there was one of those horrors of some white supremacist guy burst into a place of worship

827
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,880
with an automatic weapon and mowed down a bunch of people. And it was horrifying. And I was

828
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:32,960
totally disturbed by that. And like Monday morning, NPR is saying the guy's being arraigned today.

829
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,920
And it looks like he's going to get federal hate crime charges as well, which will make him

830
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:44,480
eligible for the death penalty. And my thought was, yeah, fry the bastard, all of that. And two

831
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:50,400
seconds later, I stop and think, wait, I'm working on a death penalty case right now, try to.

832
01:25:51,360 --> 01:26:00,640
Yeah, this is, we are run by very visceral emotions. Jonathan Hyde at NYU has done wonderful work

833
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:05,760
showing how much of the time when we are supposedly reasoning our way towards a moral decision,

834
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,840
we're doing post hoc rationalization for our emotional decisions, all of that. But yeah,

835
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:18,640
we're also self reflective. And we begin to learn how is it that I wound up this way and probably

836
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:25,280
much more importantly, how is it that that person wound up being different for me before I decide

837
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:31,440
I'm in a position to understand what made them do what they just did. I like the discussion in

838
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:40,800
your book on this idea that it helps the victims families come to closure when the guy is finally

839
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,440
put away. And that in fact, the research shows that doesn't close the door for them. Because

840
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,280
that's what you think of like, well, yeah, well, maybe we don't want to stay killing people,

841
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,400
but at least it makes the close the door for the families.

842
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:58,400
Yeah, and it's very mixed. It's very mixed. It depends on what part of the country you're in

843
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:05,120
and thus what part of regional culture. Yeah, closure is much more of a myth than lots of

844
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:12,160
people in criminology sort of think of people have different responses. And, you know, there's a

845
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:18,480
whole world of people whose immune systems work better after they are able to let go of their

846
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:26,160
hatred and forgive someone. I probably couldn't do that. And that's one of the outcomes also.

847
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:31,760
There's ones who write letters to the authorities saying yes, yes, yes, this person did this to my

848
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:37,520
loved one, but you're going to accomplish nothing by killing them. That's part of the picture as

849
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:44,640
well. They align themselves. Yeah. So the notion that that is where you get closure from,

850
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,720
separate of the fact that you probably don't get closure by most reports,

851
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:56,320
yeah, that one's a criminology myth. Yeah, but there is a kind of a game theory logic to why we

852
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,400
feel that way. Those emotions, you know, Christopher Baum talks about this in his book,

853
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:05,360
Moral Origins, about, you know, these hunter-gatherer groups that have a whole series of

854
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:10,960
steps they take to control bullies and free riders and people that don't play nice

855
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:15,040
and follow the rules, you know, from gossip all the way up to capital punishment where they, you

856
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:23,280
know, they take Aug out for a hunt and they come back without him. And how everybody has to

857
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,320
participate in the killing of this guy so that no one feels individually responsible. And also,

858
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:34,800
it helps attenuate some of the kind of fight back against, from that guy's families, you know,

859
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:42,160
what's a retribution against the killer and so forth. But if you don't have something like that,

860
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:48,080
then free riding and bullying can take over a group. It can propagate. So you need to have

861
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:53,200
some way of dealing with bullies and free riders. Now, why didn't evolution get us to where we get

862
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:59,680
rid of all the bullies and the free riders? And the answer appears to be a social group can tolerate

863
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,600
maybe one to three percent of psychopaths, which is the number, and still function pretty well.

864
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:10,400
And we don't want to have, allocate even more resources to give him every last one of them.

865
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:19,280
Yeah. And also, because when you have like nothing but an ocean of cooperators in a game

866
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:26,480
theory setting, the first wolf that shows up does fabulously. And so does the second.

867
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:31,440
And so does the umpteenth, but maybe not quite as much as the first wolf. And eventually,

868
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,400
you're getting to a tipping point in this frequency dependent selection sort of thing,

869
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:42,160
where now get one altruist, they're going to fail because all these wolves are just going to laugh

870
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:47,920
at what a like naive bastard they are, but get two altruists and they're going to out compete the

871
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:52,400
wolves because the wolves are not cooperating. And thus, you start getting more and more altruists.

872
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:59,440
There's this cycle of frequency dependent selection for in a world of nothing but nice people,

873
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:05,280
wolves get away with an awful lot. And in a world of nothing but backstabbing cheaters,

874
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:10,480
two cooperators who trust each other and who can interact on a regular basis,

875
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:15,040
they're going to drive everybody else out of business and force them to start cooperating.

876
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:22,960
So it's a it's a funny landscape in that regard. But in terms of so what do we do with societies

877
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:28,880
like lone wolves? And here where you get like, here's where people is going to like throw down

878
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:36,480
their their their their iPhones or whatever right now and saying this guy is such a ridiculous

879
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:42,480
bleeding heart liberal. No, hopefully I've convinced by now that I am so far beyond that.

880
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:51,200
But you know, one of the dictums of public health research is you figure out like what the

881
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:58,960
disease is and how to contain it. And you do it in a way where you contain the medically dangerous

882
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,880
person, but you don't do one smidgen more than that. And you do all that good stuff. But the other

883
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:10,720
thing that comes with it is you put at least as much effort into figuring out how did this person

884
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:17,840
get sick in the first place? Where did this disease come from? The the preventative sort of

885
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:24,240
stuff. And that's like at the heart of every public health person and every public health model of

886
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:30,160
what you do with violent damaging people, where you don't blame them and it's not retribution,

887
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:36,400
but it's a quarantine model so that they don't get people damaged. But like you don't do anything

888
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:40,560
more than what's needed to keep them from being dangerous and you don't preach to them about

889
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:47,200
how they have a rotten soul. And then in the same public health model, you need to at least put

890
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:54,000
as much effort into and how did they get this way in the first place and how we can do things so

891
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:01,200
that we wind up with fewer bullies and fewer lone wolves and fewer free riders and all of that.

892
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:08,000
And you see countries that do things that have far less bullying like the Scandinavian countries

893
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,760
and what's one of the good predictors of that having a lot of social capital.

894
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:18,080
People trust each other and they feel like they have efficacy. Whoa, a preventative measure. And

895
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:24,800
if you're doing any of this stuff, it's not just, oh, let's not let's not tell murderers that they're

896
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:31,360
terrible mean people and just like, figure out why growing up in this sort of neighborhood

897
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:38,560
quadruples the likelihood that that's who you turn out to be. Figure out why this prenatal stress

898
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:45,360
or figure out, do the preventative stuff. And that's where you're going to make a world with

899
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:54,320
fewer free riders and like, you know, roll your eyes if you will. But you got to keep coming back

900
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:01,120
to the Scandinavian social support models, like they are doing the preventative stuff and not

901
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:07,040
only do they have less problems with recidivism, with their violent people, they have fewer violent

902
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,760
people, they have fewer bullies, they have less spousal abuse, they have fewer less of all that

903
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:17,920
stuff. And yeah, root causes, because if I'm sitting there saying why that person do that,

904
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,760
where did the intent come from because of one second before one hour before one century.

905
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:29,360
All that is is this like, brand blowout of root causes. So yeah, do that.

906
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:34,960
The death penalty has been outlawed in pretty much every country except democracy, except ours.

907
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,560
I don't know, what is it? Half the states don't have capital punishment anymore,

908
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:44,400
but but have to. And then the half that do only a few states, Texas, Ohio, I guess,

909
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:53,440
Mississippi, Florida, you others actually practice it. I mean, most don't. In my book, Heavens on

910
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:58,240
Earth, I got to thinking about what people think about facing death because I was thinking about

911
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:03,760
terror management theory. And then I got, I discovered this literature on what people say

912
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:09,760
just before they're going to be executed. To my utter astonishment, the state of Texas actually

913
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:14,560
records their final statements. They the microphone, you know, you're strapped in, the microphone comes

914
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:20,080
down. What would you like to say? And almost to a man. And they're all men. You know, they thought,

915
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:24,880
I love my mother, I want my mommy, I can't, I love Jesus, I can't wait to see my Lord on the other

916
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:29,440
side. And it's all love, love, love, love. And once in a while they go, and I'm sorry, I killed

917
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:37,360
your because the families are there. Wow. I know it's astonishing. I know. I know there's all

918
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,080
sorts of websites that supposedly have accurate information on what these people's final meal

919
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:49,680
requests were. Yes, yes. But final words, that's much cooler. Yeah. Yeah. It's totally wild. Yeah.

920
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:54,640
So, I mean, I guess the capital punishment for two reasons. I don't like to give the power of

921
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:59,040
life and death to the state. And also they get it wrong so often. I mean, the Innocence Project

922
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:04,640
has just been an eye-opener. It's stunning. What kind of differences there are. I think you

923
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:09,440
mentioned the criminal justice. If you have money, you can buy justice. If you don't,

924
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,960
you're probably screwed. Of course. And since you work in the criminal justice system as a

925
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,480
eyewitness or no, what is it? A consultant expert witness.

926
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,840
Teaching witness. Yeah. Teaching witness. Is it as bad as it seems like? I mean,

927
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,520
is it really that corrupt? I mean, the rich people can buy the good lawyers and the,

928
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:34,240
you know, the perp that gets the district attorney or whatever assigned person right out of

929
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:41,680
college. Law school is just not going to get as good a justice. Oh, I have no idea at all other

930
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:46,800
than like reading the news, which any of us can do and see ample evidence of that day after day.

931
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:52,480
Because I work with public defenders. I work with the people who can't afford attorneys. So,

932
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:57,920
all I'm looking at are the people who were like 99% of the way lost by the time they were third

933
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:05,040
trimester fetuses. So, I never get to see wealth buying all the justice you can afford,

934
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:10,480
kind of thing. But in this whole, oh, God, we got to come like the Scandinavians and understand

935
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:19,760
how people became the way we all the time in our society are capable of taking individuals who are

936
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:27,680
dangerous, who are dangerous to the people who are around them. And we are capable of constraining

937
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:33,840
them, keeping them from being dangerous anymore. And we could do it without responsibility, without

938
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,960
blame, without preaching about their rotten souls. And then we could get insights as to why it is

939
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:45,680
that they're dangerous. Your kid is sneezing and you don't send them to kindergarten that day because

940
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:52,720
they're gonna get all the other kids sick. Satan isn't involved in that. We learn how to do a

941
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,720
quarantine model because it's a literal quarantine model. You keep your kid home until

942
01:36:56,720 --> 01:37:01,280
they're not sneezing anymore. But you don't sit at home and tell your kid they can't play with

943
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:07,680
their toys because like there's something like they did a bad thing. You don't even do that you're

944
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,240
not a bad person, but you did a bad thing sneezing all over your class. It's got nothing to do with

945
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:17,600
that. You just constrain them so that they're not dangerous. And you don't do it once mission

946
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:23,360
beyond that. And you try to do some research of like, okay, why do people get colds when they're

947
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:30,640
five years old? And society hasn't fallen apart. And we don't burn five year olds with

948
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:35,200
nose colds at the stake, even though who knows somewhere back when they would have thought

949
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:40,400
that was a sign of Satan or because they thought illness is God's punishments for your,

950
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:48,080
you know, fetal sins you were born sinful. So it's not that crazy and like satirical.

951
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:52,480
Yay, we can do that. And it's a more humane world.

952
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:56,560
Why aren't we doing that? Why doesn't some state governor go,

953
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,040
look what they're doing in Germany or wherever and go, we're going to do that in our state. We're

954
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:08,560
going to try something different. Well, if starters just look at the Republican debate

955
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,720
the other night and look at what all those people were bragging about what they had done in their

956
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:19,520
states, which were like as different as you could get and predicated on free will like,

957
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:25,840
like I couldn't contain how happy I was seeing some of the some of the sound by some of these

958
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:35,040
people came out with. Why can't we do that? Because punishment feels good. And seeing pain

959
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:44,480
makes us irrational and makes us irrational in our attributions and very complicated phenomena

960
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:51,360
are really hard to piece apart as to what caused them because that's hard to see and simple explanations

961
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:57,200
are much more appealing cognitively and the more frazzled and upset we are, the more emotionally

962
01:38:57,200 --> 01:39:04,240
appealing they are. And that's why that's much easier. Like go sit down somebody and say like,

963
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:10,800
you know, it's a walking cliche to say they had a very tough childhood. But my God, some people

964
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:17,280
do. And that usually came after an even worse fetal life and then a subsequent and, you know,

965
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:25,760
it's hard to think that way. Yeah, multiple causality is tough. And Allah height, we feel

966
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:31,840
our weighted decisions far more often than we like to think. Yeah. But still rationality counts,

967
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:37,360
it does work sometimes. Truth and reconciliation idea has taken off in the last half century.

968
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:43,120
Some countries have employed it to move beyond the anger, which isn't going to get anybody anywhere,

969
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:48,640
to try to find a solution. Why this hasn't happened with the two state solution, you know,

970
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:56,320
in the Middle East, I don't know, just seems like a nightmare. But then Northern Ireland somehow

971
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:04,320
pulled it off. I mean, if of our generation, that grew up as looking as even more intractable

972
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:13,600
in the Middle East. And, you know, it's not perfect. But stuff happens. And somehow, like,

973
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:19,360
they begin and Sadat managed to get to Camp David. And that seemed just as, you know,

974
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:25,040
every now and then. But it sure looks pretty awful. But, you know, South Africa managed to get

975
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:30,960
independence without a war afterward of the white militias. Somehow they pulled that one off every

976
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:37,760
now and then like there's one in the wind column for this stuff. Yeah. Well, maybe it's a meme that

977
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,880
your book will launch once again. Let's let's let's move in this direction and apply rationality

978
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:48,880
to solving social problems rather than letting our emotions drive us even maybe even being aware

979
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:58,400
of those of those emotions and why we have them would help. Yeah. Okay, last couple points here.

980
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,200
This is what you write here what the what the science in this book ultimately teaches is that

981
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:11,280
there is no meaning. There's no answer to why beyond this happened because of what came just

982
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:16,480
before what which happened because of what came before that. There's nothing but an empty indifference

983
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:21,920
indifference universe in which occasionally atoms come together to temporarily form things

984
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:28,480
which we call me. Well, yeah, this is interesting because I got to thinking about what I call Al

985
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,320
Alvy's error, which was Alvy singer Woody Allen's character and Annie Hall,

986
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,320
as a child, he won't do his homework in the universe is expanding expanding. Yes,

987
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:42,800
and his mother upgrades him. What's the universe got to do that we live in Brooklyn and Brooklyn

988
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:49,120
what's wrong with him to the doctor. Yeah. Oh, I love that scene. Yeah.

989
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:54,240
Right. So the error is that well, that's not the level, you know, the ultimate meaning of the

990
01:41:54,240 --> 01:42:00,880
universe does anything to do. We live here now. I wrote about this with I watched a debate with

991
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:07,760
William Lane Craig and Shelly Kagan philosopher. You know, so Craig writes this, which so here

992
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:14,080
I'm referencing your chapter discussing people who believe in determinism. The claim is that

993
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,240
they're not as moral or they they're not they don't feel as motivated or what it has negative

994
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:23,120
effects, which you should point out that the research on that is pretty debatable. And some of

995
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:27,680
that didn't survive the replication crisis. But the other problem is that maybe that's the wrong

996
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:32,560
level to think of it as and then you also discuss can atheists be as moral and so on. Of course,

997
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:37,680
that touches something that's close to me. But here's what Craig argues on a naturalistic world

998
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:41,680
view. Everything is ultimately destined to destruction in the heat death of the universe.

999
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:47,040
As the universe expands, it grows colder and colder as its energy is used up eventually,

1000
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,880
all the stars are burned out, all matter will collapse and dead stars and black holes.

1001
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,320
There's no life, no heat, no light, only the corpses of dead stars and galaxies expanding

1002
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:00,800
in the endless dark. At the light at the end, it's hard for me to understand how our moral

1003
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,920
choices have any sort of significance. There's no moral accountability. The universe is neither

1004
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,800
better nor worse for what we do. Our moral lives become vacuous, because they don't have that kind

1005
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,960
of cosmic significance. Then he went on about the Holocaust. What difference does it make if we do

1006
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:20,640
something about it or not? And Kelly jelly Kagan says, This strikes me as an outrageous thing

1007
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:25,360
to suggest. It doesn't really matter. Surely it matters to the torture victims, whether they're

1008
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:30,320
being tortured. It doesn't require that this makes some cosmic difference to the internal

1009
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:35,040
significance of the universe, but to matter whether a human being is tortured, it matters to them,

1010
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:43,440
it matters to their family, it matters to us. That's great. Wow, he must be a fun guy to hang

1011
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:50,080
out with, although people may be saying the same thing about me at this point. This brings us back

1012
01:43:50,080 --> 01:44:00,240
to like we're a totally weird organism in that we could know our machinists, but at the same time,

1013
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:12,320
our feelings feel real. And that carries a certain kind of weight and a certain moral imperative

1014
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:17,440
that no matter how irrational it is, the notion that something good or bad could happen to a

1015
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:27,680
machine, it's a good thing when we decrease cumulative pain out there. I know that ultimately

1016
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:33,280
doesn't make sense because it runs counter all this mechanism. But at the end of the day,

1017
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:42,720
like where are the species for whom the fact that nothing good can ever really happen to a machine

1018
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:51,600
has to feel sufficiently unreal that we function and that we function even with some moral guidelines

1019
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:58,240
that come out of that. Yeah, I guess maybe it's different levels of analysis. If you give me

1020
01:44:58,240 --> 01:45:03,040
a shot of oxytocin in the nose spray, then I want to cuddle more after sex with my wife or

1021
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:09,120
something, I don't know what. You go, oh, it was the oxytocin that did that. Well, yeah, but I still

1022
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:14,320
have the feelings and the feelings are good. Can I just experience the feelings and not worry about

1023
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:22,080
the oxytocin? And maybe the answer is, yeah, don't think about any of this stuff when it comes to

1024
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:29,040
who you love. Maybe you don't think about any of this stuff and how your olfactory

1025
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:34,080
receptor makeup has nothing to do with the fact that this smells like a great meal and you're

1026
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:40,400
happy and anticipatory. Sure as hell do the effort to think this way when you were feeling

1027
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:48,160
entitled to more care or more access or more influence or more money or more anything

1028
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:52,320
than somebody else just because you've got myths in your head about how you earn it.

1029
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:58,240
And sure as hell do the hard work and resist that when you're judging somebody else.

1030
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:06,640
You know, go be happy, enjoy your feelings of love, go enjoy the meal, go like figure out

1031
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:13,600
why you love this music and don't have to think through why you're part of this culture that

1032
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:19,280
likes this type of dissonance and this type of constant chord progressions or god knows what.

1033
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:25,760
Yeah, go feel happy, go feel grateful, but don't feel like you earned it and don't feel like you

1034
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:32,160
earned the ability to decide that somebody else earned their worse luck than you had.

1035
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:37,280
Yeah, again, gratitude. Yeah, Feynman made that point about

1036
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:44,480
you know, a scientific analysis of nature. It doesn't take away anything, it just adds.

1037
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:49,280
I mean, it's nice to know why a rainbow looks like the way it does. It like bounces inside each of

1038
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:55,360
the little droplets of water and so on, but I can still appreciate it. Also, just like anybody else,

1039
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,000
it just is beautiful to look at and you get an emotional feeling. And even if those emotional

1040
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:07,680
feelings have neurochemistry behind them, but what? It's still a feeling. Yeah, like Bach can be

1041
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:15,360
broken down into all sorts of rules of contrapunctal composition and like, yeah, that's true. That

1042
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:22,240
doesn't take away for there's there's biomechanical explanations for why gazelles look amazing when

1043
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:29,680
they leap. But that doesn't, you know, the fact that there is more structure than we suspect

1044
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:36,320
superficially to explain things. All that should do is like increase the amazingness of it. Like,

1045
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:42,320
purpose of science is not to cure us of like gratitude and being amazed by stuff. All it

1046
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:49,440
does is just reinvent it for us. Right. All right, Robert, I really love the book and I love

1047
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:57,840
your work. What do you hope could come of this thread of thinking about why our lives turn out?

1048
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:01,840
It's a little bit of an extension of your previous book, Behave. I mean, all the different factors

1049
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:07,280
that go into it. But what's the bigger picture here? Changing society in a certain direction.

1050
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:16,320
Oh, I don't know, given given the world I live in full of like uber uber,

1051
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:24,640
astonishingly privileged sort of inheritors of random luck. I don't know, maybe make us all

1052
01:48:24,640 --> 01:48:30,720
feel a little less entitled, make us feel a little bit less whiny and difficult, make us have a little

1053
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:36,560
bit more empathy for someone who's very different from us. And, you know, maybe have a few more

1054
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:43,760
people out there whose rotten luck could be explained by, oh, their subtype of like leptin

1055
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:51,920
receptor stop hating themselves in the process. You know, I don't know, I'll settle for something

1056
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:59,600
incremental just because like scientists like are so accustomed to having no impact whatsoever.

1057
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:04,480
So like getting three and a half people to think a little bit differently about their privilege

1058
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:10,080
or somebody else's lack thereof. I think that should count as a win for me. Yeah. Well, again,

1059
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:16,880
protopia. Just make tomorrow a tiny bit better than today. The problem for utopia is then that you

1060
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:24,000
can find ways to sacrifice other people who are standing in our way. Exactly. At some point,

1061
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,520
countries in light and Scandinavian countries seem inevitable to go to war over who takes

1062
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:37,200
better care of their elderly. Yeah. Like somehow that is still part of our potential destiny.

1063
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,000
I mean, part of the theist argument, which I understand that, you know, without God,

1064
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,120
then Hitler got away with it. I mean, that that is dissettling. But on the other hand,

1065
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:52,000
you know, we that's why we want to have good justice now in the here and now.

1066
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,520
Because no one knows for sure what happens after you're dead.

1067
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:03,040
Yep. Except for those of us who suspect the answer is nothing. Nothing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1068
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:10,160
Because we're made of stuff and stuff stops this weird emergent thing called animacy

1069
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:16,400
at some point. But yeah, exactly. No, I know. And people say, well, what happens after you

1070
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:22,720
die? Well, where were you before you were born? Well, I wasn't anywhere. Yeah. Right. Back you go.

1071
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,400
But again, it's part of that kind of dualistic sense that we can't get away from. You know,

1072
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:32,240
Paul Bloom even thinks we're naturalistic, natural born dualists that it just comes with the,

1073
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:39,280
you know, bundled with the hardware from a very early age. And that, you know, again, back to

1074
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:44,640
consciousness, you can't perceive your brain doing anything. And so it just feels like there's

1075
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:49,280
thoughts floating around up there. So maybe when my brain dies, they float off into the

1076
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:55,120
quantum field or wherever. Because, you know, if you say, imagine yourself dead, you can't.

1077
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,560
You can't do it. If you're imagining anything, you're not dead.

1078
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:06,960
Yeah. That's, that's it. You know, it's like Oliver Sacks talking about hallucinations that

1079
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,840
people have. You know, they don't think they're hallucinating. You know, the audio cortex is

1080
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:17,360
operating there, even though they're in the brain scan, their voices are out there. Right. So.

1081
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:23,680
Yeah. Nobody comes into an emergency room saying, help, I'm hallucinating. They're saying, help,

1082
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:27,600
Satan is telling me to do this. And I don't want to do it because that wouldn't be right.

1083
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:33,280
Yeah. I think you're, again, the free will issue is along those lines. It feels like

1084
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,800
something like I'm making a choice. So then you attribute to something. Well, it's that free will

1085
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:46,720
thing. And then, hopefully, you see enough circumstances where that wasn't the case that

1086
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:54,320
like you do a little bit of that like self reflection stuff, which is often not very

1087
01:51:54,320 --> 01:52:00,560
appealing and is kind of irksome and, you know, go do a little more of that. Yeah.

1088
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,600
All right, Robert, that's a good place to end coming up on two hours here. I know you're

1089
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,800
you're doing a lot of interviews for the book. We'll post this as soon as

1090
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:12,720
let's see, what's the pub date of this book? I forget. It's coming up pretty soon, right? This

1091
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:16,640
week or next week. Mid-October. Mid-October. Yeah. I think we put it. Mid-October or something. Yeah.

1092
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:20,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you got some debates coming up. That's good. That'll be fun.

1093
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:25,440
I definitely have to watch the one with Bob Meister. He's one of the most interesting

1094
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:31,120
people working in psychology today. I'm looking forward to it. And he appears.

1095
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,080
Did you read his book? You read his book, Evil, right? Where he interviewed all these

1096
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:41,120
serial killers and, you know, under the theory that they have low self-esteem. Just the opposite.

1097
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,280
Hey, a little bit of sociopathic narcissism here and there. Everything is the world's fault,

1098
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:56,000
not mine. Not me, not me. I'm looking forward to it. He also appears to be a very nice guy for

1099
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:01,200
more email exchanges. Yeah, I know. So this should be fun. Yeah, he is. I know him. He's a super

1100
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:06,000
nice guy. All right. We can ramble on for hours more. I'll just hit the stop button there.
