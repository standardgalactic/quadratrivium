0	18000	Okay everybody, it's Michael Schirmer and it's time for another reminder to sign up for the Skeptic Society, Skeptic Magazine public event we're having this year, December 1st, 2nd and 3rd, Friday night, all day Saturday, Saturday night fundraising dinner, Sunday with Jared Diamond.
18000	25000	And so I just wanted to say just in kind of reflection, we have not had a public event in many many years.
25000	39000	The last big conference was at Caltech in back in 2015 timeframe and since then of course as you know with the pandemic that shut everything down we moved our offices from Altadena up to Santa Barbara where I now live.
39000	54000	And so we've had kind of a restructuring and I want to share all that with you by showing you the office you can just come on in we've got thousands of books in my private library here, as well as you'll be able to pick up back issues of Skeptic they're right there on the wall.
55000	67000	Most of which we keep in print copies of my books and other books by people like Richard Dawkins and Jared Diamond and and so forth it's going to be an epic weekend I'm really looking forward to it.
67000	78000	We really depend on your support. The Skeptic Society is a 501c3 nonprofit science education organization that depends on donations and fundraising events like this.
78000	87000	So much of this event much much of the money for this event goes to the Skeptic Society well none of it goes to me or anyone personally but to the Skeptic Society.
87000	90000	That's what that Saturday night fundraising dinner is all about.
90000	100000	And if you support the magazine or work in the media or pod the podcast and so on and so forth everything we've been doing for 31 years now.
100000	108000	Then you can show your support by by coming just coming and why would you not want to come to Santa Barbara in December.
108000	118000	Believe me it's gorgeous here and the hotel where we're holding it at the Hilton is right on the beach right on Cabrillo you will be you know I don't know 30 feet from the sand.
118000	119000	It's great.
119000	126000	It's a wonderful facility and I've talked them into some great low prices like half the price you'd pay to stay there.
126000	136000	If you just walked in up the street so check it out go to Skeptic.com click on the banner for our conference sign up sign up for the event sign up for the Saturday night fundraising dinner.
136000	143000	I'll see you here that Friday night or Sunday afternoon at the office where I'm sitting now and and at the events at the Hilton it's going to be epic.
143000	144000	All right.
144000	150000	See you soon.
150000	155000	Okay let's start the basics cancel culture what is it how do you define it.
155000	156000	Sure.
156000	173000	We define it we we want to kind of establish it as a historical era basically the same way people talk about other mass censorship incidents you know in history like the Red Scare or one end to we link it we basically say it's the uptick after
173000	193000	2014 of attempts of campaigns sorry to get people de-platformed punished expelled fired etc for opinions that would be otherwise protected by the First Amendment if it were happening like in a public setting and also the climate of fear and conformity that resulted from that.
193000	194000	Right.
194000	196000	Ricky you want to add anything to that.
196000	211000	Yeah I would say in terms of our definition and is a little bit technical but I would I mean at least for me it was something that I just grew up so steeped in that it was a strange exercise to even really define it in such a specific way because 2014 is
211000	226000	our cutoff point of where I think it really took on a new tone but I mean I was born in 2000 and so as far as my like contextual chronological awareness that's pretty much all I've known is this Graceless society in which any any little
226000	242000	misstep or faux pas could cost you a friendship or a college admissions letter I mean it's it's definitely it's it's strange because that cutoff point is very very much in line with when I came into political awareness myself.
242000	254000	Well what's funny about this Ricky is it makes perfect sense that you're like well I live with this my whole life and what what why did we notice it to change in 2015 or 2014 it's because Gen Z started to think college because there was a little bit
254000	261000	blip and cancel culture that that's measurable around 2011 that's kind of like the social media effect like all over like that.
261000	271000	So that's kind of like the precursors like Martin Gurrey's whole point but it you grew up with it but then it started reaching the whole country when Gen Z started hitting campus and large numbers unfortunately.
272000	283000	Yeah let me introduce you to what I call the Henny Youngman principle Henny Youngman was a 1950s comedian he used to joke around one of his lines was when he was asked how's your wife he said compared to what.
284000	289000	So cancel culture is much worse really compared to what how do you know.
290000	301000	We have a lot of data in the book and particularly you know I've been working on campuses now for 22 years and to be clear it wasn't great when I started in 2001 but for example.
301000	311000	We compared historical data on the number of professors who've been targeted and we talk about more than a thousand examples of professors being targeted since 2014.
312000	322000	You know two thirds of those have been punished in some way and about you know a fifth of those almost 200 of them have been fired and that includes like 40 tenured professors so it's a big number.
323000	336000	Now to put that in historical perspective I started it during 9-11 and there was major threats to academic freedom in the years after 9-11 and there were about over a dozen professors targeted and three of them lost their jobs
337000	346000	and that was considered really bad even though the three professors who lost their jobs you know one was War Churchill who ultimately lost it because of academic misconduct which was serious.
347000	358000	Another one for taking too much time out of class to talk about in that case the Iraq war and another one who was fired Samuel Arian because of they were like OK he does seem to actually have ties to terrorism.
359000	367000	And that was really like since the law was established between 1957 and 1973 you know there's nothing even close to the number of professors that we see.
367000	379000	We even compare it back to the Red Scare even though the law wasn't clear yet it's like people in the 50s actually thought you could fire communists because they were too politically doctrinaire not good teachers was basically the rationale.
380000	394000	And at the time there was actually a massive study going on of the Red Scare and they estimated about 62-63 professors were fired for communist beliefs about 90 professors for beliefs overall during that period which is usually rounded up to 100.
394000	400000	And we're talking about twice that number except in a time where there's almost no viewpoint diversity on campus.
401000	409000	There's a million different ways people get cancelled without anybody even be able to see it because there are literally secret hearings and you're still able to find this many heretics to burn is insane.
410000	411000	Right.
412000	418000	And I think we were so fortunate that I mean I think I speak for myself and a lot of other people where I felt like I had so much.
418000	424000	Anic data to say like oh I know a ton of people who've been torn down and attacked but we were super fortunate to have.
425000	435000	The fire team behind us and all of these amazing statistics that they were able to distill for us and they've have decades of caseloads to demonstrate that there truly is an explosion first.
436000	442000	Like around the 2016 election and then again all like unprecedented numbers in 2020 which I think.
443000	449000	Really like what one thing I keep hearing is people saying like oh isn't this kind of behind us and in the rear view mirror but it seems like.
450000	460000	I'd probably be likely to say that in 2018 not knowing that the pandemic and this next level of unrest and this next contentious point in history was right around the corner and I wouldn't be surprised.
460000	473000	If the 2024 election doesn't become another cycle of at this point in time it seems like if we have a cultural tension point our reflexive responses to just indulge in a liberalism in this in this really frightening way.
474000	475000	Yeah.
475000	479000	Yeah so anecdotal data versus actual data.
480000	482000	And I guess it just depends on what the context is.
483000	492000	The story I like to tell is you know what the toggling between CNN and Fox News and who was at Hannity or whoever had the campus craziness segment every week.
493000	497000	And you know if you watch that it just think well every college campus must be completely nuts.
498000	504000	And before COVID I was doing maybe a dozen to two dozen public talks at universities and colleges through an agency that would book me.
505000	507000	And you go to these colleges campuses and you don't say anything.
508000	517000	I mean it's just these kind of quiet buccalic places where students are mostly just hold up in their dorms or at the Starbucks and you know you don't see these you know kind of campus riots and craziness.
518000	524000	So and a Chapman where I taught for 12 years you almost never say anything like that.
524000	536000	So is it that even if the actual raw numbers are low it doesn't take that many incidences to get a spiral of silence going where everybody has to feel like they need to keep their mouth shut.
537000	540000	Well and to be clear historically speaking the numbers aren't low.
541000	546000	And when you actually ask professors whether or not they've been punished or threatened with punishment we did a big study on this 16 percent.
547000	549000	I thought it would be like 2 percent would say.
549000	551000	Because 2 percent would be really bad.
552000	560000	So we know that we're like even that the thousand which is a terrible number and we can't find any comparison in the last 50 years that that's just a tip of the iceberg.
561000	571000	But it is also really clear and I have to explain this very nicely at a presentation I did in Boston with someone being skeptical that you know it couldn't possibly be that the elite colleges are really that much worse.
571000	574000	And I'm like I almost want to be like oh no dear I'm so sorry.
575000	577000	Yes they are they are a lot worse.
578000	579000	They're a lot more professors losing their job.
580000	584000	I mean Harvard was horrified that it finished dead last in our campus free speech ranking.
585000	588000	And they were kind of like this can't be you know like basically this must be ridiculous.
589000	592000	And I'm like no no you have to understand you got a negative 10.69.
593000	600000	The next closest school was University of Pennsylvania which has been terrible for free speech also an Ivy League school that got like 11.
601000	604000	And some of the criticisms of our ranking of Harvard.
605000	610000	They got so Harvard about it like one of them was kind of like well the methodologies is not good.
611000	612000	We know the best statisticians in the world.
613000	619000	I'm like well you should know that Sam Abrams a Harvard PhD in statistics who's brilliant is one of the main people who constructed the study.
620000	630000	It's the largest survey of student attitudes ever conducted and that we base it on four databases the biggest one of professor cancellations of student cancellations of deep platforming and of speech codes.
631000	633000	It's on a bigger scale than ever has been done.
634000	643000	And one of the other arguments that Harvard was making was that some of the professors we were holding against them for firing or otherwise disciplining weren't that prestigious of professors.
644000	646000	And it's like oh dude OK that's ridiculous.
647000	648000	That's just snobbery talking.
649000	654000	But by the way even if we took away those professors which we shouldn't because they matter you would still be dead last.
655000	658000	Yeah I remember seeing Pinker posted from Harvard.
659000	660000	We're number one.
661000	662000	Pinker is great.
663000	664000	Pinker has been a real champion on his campus too.
665000	667000	He started up a whole movement to improve the environment there.
668000	683000	Just for listeners the references to your appendix here where you have the data that you actually present here of your college rankings from one to whatever it is 203 Columbia University at 9.91 University of Chicago at 77.92.
684000	693000	So these are self report data from students and professors of how they're treated on college campuses.
694000	695000	Greg you're muted.
698000	707000	We do 13 different factors and with the with the students you know we ask a number of questions you know and we evaluate them.
707000	717000	You know so if you have a school where all of the liberals think it's great for free speech and none of the conservatives do that that's a bigger penalty because it basically means that like there's there's definitely viewpoint discrimination going on there.
718000	725000	We also factor in things like whether or not they say that the faculty will have their back whether or not they think the environment is good.
726000	732000	So it's been interesting to see you know like I live in D.C. and Howard University actually came out as the best school in D.C.
733000	738000	It's still like in the 80s out of 200 and the survey you're talking about was actually last year's because we couldn't.
739000	740000	The new survey was just too new.
741000	742000	There was no way we could actually get it in the new book.
743000	753000	So we wanted people to have some perspective by seeing the previous years but they came they came off like number four four in terms of comfort expressing ideas which was really interesting to see.
754000	757000	So we evaluate the student rank the students on all different sorts of things.
758000	761000	The most disturbing stuff though is tolerance for violence.
762000	769000	And at Oberlin for example only around half of the students said violence is never OK in response to speech.
770000	780000	And we've noticed that a really weirdly high percentage of former women's colleges have populations that actually you know think blocking a speaker is OK.
780000	787000	Shouting down a speaker is OK or even violence in response to speech which is some of the most disturbing stuff I've seen in my career.
788000	789000	Yeah for sure.
790000	792000	OK so I was an undergraduate 72 to 76.
793000	798000	You must have been about 10 years behind me Greg and Ricky you are what 2010s for college.
799000	802000	I was I just showed up in 2018.
803000	804000	Yeah.
804000	805000	OK.
806000	807000	1992.
808000	809000	OK.
809000	810000	OK boy I'm really old.
810000	811000	All right.
811000	817000	Well so I do I do remember the concept of political correctness and some of my more conservative professors complaining about this.
818000	824000	Is what we're going through now qualitatively different than the political correctness movement or is it is it just more of the same.
825000	828000	It's definitely a much more intense version of it.
829000	834000	The I wrote a long piece for reason last year called the second grade age of political correctness.
835000	844000	And I talk about how you know you went from the speech code movement of 64 to the anti free speech movement of Herbert Herbert Marcus in 1965.
845000	859000	And even though free speech kind of won the day on campus or so we thought by 1985 major campuses including Wisconsin Stanford University of Michigan started passing speech codes to clamp down on racist sexes speech.
859000	863000	But then of course you know many of these schools the first people to get in trouble were actually minorities themselves.
864000	867000	So you know it worked out exactly the way a free speech person would tell you.
868000	875000	And at the time though this was kind of off campus the right and the left thought that PC was ridiculous.
876000	881000	It was worthy of being made fun of speech codes or an abomination and they were all defeated from 89 to 95.
881000	894000	But a big point of my of that article is that I started working around 2001 and it actually turns out that there were more speech codes on campus in 2001 that there were even in 1995.
895000	908000	They just kind of ignored the rulings and that even though the students were less enamored with PC and the professors were less enamored with PC the administration which kept on growing the administrators were definitely much more hostile to freedom of speech.
908000	927000	And it took a wave of students also being comparatively hostile to freedom of speech showing up around 2013 2014 to create something that is a much bigger you know calamity in terms of academic freedom conformity free speech in a university with much lower viewpoint diversity than it had back in the 80s.
927000	940000	And with things like bias related incident programs that didn't exist back then which have replaced speech codes to a large degree where you can call and report your professors or your friends for offensive speech.
941000	945000	Yeah, give us some examples of yeah give us some examples for your experience.
946000	955000	Yeah, absolutely. I this is a story that I tell often because I think it's just the first moment of me on campus that's pretty illustrative of my experience while at NYU.
955000	967000	I showed up I just moved to the city and they have you go to a like campus police building to get your ID card so that you can get into all the buildings.
968000	984000	And they hand it to you and they say this gets you into the cafeteria and here and there and then on the back you'll find all the really important phone numbers for for being an NYU student and it's of course 911s on the top the campus safety hotline is there in case there's a crime unit it's lower Manhattan.
985000	994000	The student health center there was I think there's a phone number for a like psychological help hotline which frankly is very necessary for Jen's ears.
995000	1014000	And then after that, there's the bias response hotline on the back of your ID card so I mean it can never stray from your person because just in case you need to report a transgression it's there that we had posters all over campus they were on the back of the bathroom stalls oftentimes like in the library and stuff and so
1015000	1025000	institutionalized in a way of like I had come from a boarding school where I was used to a lot of the arguments against free speech and I was aware that there was an issue in terms of self censorship.
1026000	1035000	I mean I already had experienced that in high school but then arriving in college and saying like oh yeah first day better make sure that you know there's a hotline to to report any transgressors.
1035000	1045000	I mean I was very very nervous as a more heterodox thinking person on NYU's campus and I was hiding.
1045000	1055000	This is embarrassing to say in retrospect but I'm in this dorm with randomly assigned NYU students who I just assume were hostile to my viewpoint or could be and I wanted to have friends living in the city alone.
1055000	1068000	So I had hid my Thomas Soul books and my Jordan Peterson books under my bed which is so embarrassing in retrospect and now they're on wide open display behind me as we speak but that was the kind of place that it was.
1068000	1070000	Thomas Soul books in a brown paper bag.
1070000	1077000	Exactly God forbid anyone knew that I believe that there were some economic fallacies out there in the world but.
1077000	1088000	You know on that just as a sidebar you know identity politics where identity is just everything your race is everything but Thomas Soul is black so apparently that's not enough right there's some.
1088000	1104000	It's a race trader we talk about this in the we talk about one thing that I think is cool about the book is we try to situate cancel culture as a only the most extreme way of winning arguments about winning arguments.
1104000	1115000	And we take on what we call rhetorical fortresses on the right and the left the left the right one we call the efficient because it's just very simple it's like you don't have those in the liberals experts journalists or people in like Trump.
1115000	1125000	But on the on the left it's since it grew up in academia it's like it's like it's just like level after level of ways to not ever have to address someone's argument.
1125000	1133000	And step number one that I confess and with with profound embarrassment that when I started Stanford in 97.
1133000	1143000	You know if you could if you could do the game of claiming that someone some author or thinker was conservative that very quickly did lead to a sort of like well I guess I don't have to take them that seriously.
1143000	1149000	And so I took me a long time to read Thomas soul for example who I was like oh wow like this this guy's freaking brilliant.
1149000	1158000	And he does his most controversial thing is he oftentimes will do an international comparison of problem facing the United States with other countries.
1158000	1161000	And then of course like the funniest one was Camille Paglia.
1161000	1171000	I had somehow been persuaded that she was some kind of crazy right winger when she's more of a crazy left winger but she's a bad ass and she's a totally interesting thinker.
1172000	1179000	And it's not just that the 36% of people that are actually concerned to call themselves conservatives can be dismissed.
1179000	1190000	It's like what pink pinkers point about the left pole that a higher education is so uniformly left that everything to them looks like it's to the right.
1190000	1196000	Is there a right pole for everything to the left looks everything the way he looks left far left.
1197000	1205000	I think that when it comes to some of the stuff that we point out where the problems are with the liberalism it's been in some of the state legislatures.
1205000	1217000	But given that there is that when you look at political the breakdown of the country that more densely populated places tend to be more left leaning and more sparsely populated people tend to be the right.
1217000	1228000	I think that outside of you know some very religious colleges like I'm not sure you could find like a place that would actually be as bad as having like a right pole.
1228000	1241000	I mean perhaps not like a geographical location but I mean I definitely see as someone like I'm a center right libertarian and I write for more conservative outlets and I'll get comments and feedback calling me woke often and I'm like.
1241000	1252000	I mean in my context in Lower Manhattan I'm hardly woke but I think that's one of those words that people use to just point out any sort of like if you are in a really purest area of the right wing.
1252000	1262000	Ideologically that's that's a word that you can just kind of throw at anyone to dismiss them in a similarly dismissive way which I mean I guess on the online sense that is a right pole.
1262000	1267000	Right since you mentioned Jordan Peterson actually one comment on Thomas soul.
1267000	1269000	He just has a new book out social justice.
1269000	1270000	Yes.
1270000	1271000	Yeah.
1271000	1272000	And he's right.
1272000	1276000	I know he's not doing any podcast so I didn't get them.
1276000	1278000	But he makes like one point of this.
1278000	1281000	You know compared to what my young man example.
1281000	1285000	You know that there's the black white income difference.
1285000	1293000	Largely disappears if you control for marriage and call it you know college education and so on so he makes it kind of snarky remark.
1293000	1298000	So I guess the races are just targeting single black people and uneducated black people or something.
1298000	1305000	In other words you know thinking like a social scientist where you have like a dozen variables at work that may account for some discrepancy.
1305000	1312000	And your people that you're writing about the cancer culture people they're just looking at the one variable maybe to race and gender.
1313000	1315000	Yeah race and gender.
1315000	1318000	And we do take on cancer culture from the right as well.
1318000	1319000	Yeah.
1319000	1322000	We have multiple chapters on that and we're concerned about it.
1322000	1327000	But it has been it has been interesting you know debating this in public.
1327000	1332000	And when it comes to you know I feel like there are people who want me to say it's it's all worse on the right.
1332000	1334000	I'm like that would be lying.
1334000	1336000	Like looking at what's going on in academia.
1336000	1345000	So for example even the data I just cited about one third of those cases of professors being targeted they actually initially come from the right.
1345000	1351000	But and then sometimes turning point USA sometimes Fox News and some of those professors really do get punished.
1351000	1353000	But there is a caveat there.
1353000	1356000	Almost all of those campuses are still dominated by the left.
1356000	1362000	So the ultimate person who decided to fire that professor oftentimes is someone who would be considered on the left.
1362000	1364000	And so I did a debate many years ago.
1364000	1373000	If the left and I still consider myself left of center liberal that if the left was still as good on free speech as it was in say the 1970s.
1373000	1379000	None of this stuff would be possible because even if it was a liberal or conservative professor getting in trouble they would just answer.
1379000	1383000	No we're not punishing this person for their expression or academic freedom.
1383000	1384000	That's insane.
1384000	1385000	That's funny.
1385000	1388000	Yeah Chapman University we it's pretty liberal.
1388000	1389000	The faculty is pretty liberal.
1389000	1398000	But we have statues around campus of like Ayn Rand and Margaret Thatcher and Martin Luther King and just a variety of people.
1398000	1403000	And at one point I don't know maybe two years ago there was a demand that these statues be taken down.
1403000	1404000	I mean Ayn Rand.
1404000	1405000	Oh my gosh Margaret Thatcher.
1405000	1407000	She's practically a war criminal and so on.
1407000	1410000	Anyway so but our president handled this just perfectly.
1410000	1413000	He waited a few days and then issued a statement.
1413000	1415000	You know I listened to what you said.
1415000	1416000	I respect your opinions.
1416000	1419000	But no we're not taking the statues down.
1419000	1421000	And it was like and then they just went away.
1421000	1426000	They just like oh so if you just stand up to them then they go off in search of somebody else.
1426000	1427000	You're so right.
1427000	1431000	And that's one of the things that we do do try to stress in terms of solutions.
1431000	1443000	One like if you're a corporation have a policy like you know we don't we have a we have due process in place like as long as you slow the process down the the the social media mob won't last.
1443000	1455000	And when it comes to campuses a university president who comes out early and says no how quickly that can make a incident dissolve.
1455000	1458000	And that's one of the things that the good schools actually have in common.
1458000	1464000	The ones who do well on our campus free speech ranking and including University of Chicago generally has been quite good on it.
1464000	1468000	UVA is probably are the most like the most elite.
1468000	1473000	But then a lot of technical colleges make it on the top of the list because they can fall back on.
1473000	1477000	You know some things are true and some things aren't and it's not always going to be nice.
1477000	1482000	Hey Ricky let me because I get asked about Jordan Peterson a lot since I know and I've written a little bit about him.
1482000	1485000	What is the appeal of his message.
1485000	1487000	Is he so huge.
1487000	1499000	I mean I he was appealing to me I always hear that he's the king of the incels and all all his followers are young sad pathetic men and I don't feel that that really is a descriptor of myself.
1499000	1502000	I've always found his 12 rules for life.
1502000	1505000	I think I read it like late high school.
1505000	1516000	I would say and it just it it's funny because I remember at one point I recommended it to my mom who's a very common sense thinker and she read it and she was like Ricky like this is pretty like.
1516000	1521000	I thought that I taught you this stuff like this is pretty basically pull yourself up by the bootstraps clean your room.
1521000	1533000	Get your life in order sort of thing but I think for someone in as a member of Gen Z was like it really an antidote to this pervasive message of like you are a victim and if something goes wrong.
1533000	1541000	Your locus of control is outside of you it's because you're a woman or it's because of whatever a mutable characteristic.
1541000	1559000	You might be able to clean your being targeted by that the world is working against you and I really felt that that was like the victimhood complex that a lot of Gen Zers grew up steeped in that was so pervasive on places like Tumblr and social media that all my friends and I basically grew up on and
1560000	1580000	derived our social philosophy from unfortunately in retrospect like just having a that very clear voice of wisdom saying get your get your shit together you know get get your ducks in a row and then take on the world was to me something that I just it wasn't a message that I ever really heard and it was it was funny to me when
1580000	1590000	my mom was like I thought that I taught you this I'm like I don't know Tumblr taught me that everything I want is out to get me and if someone doesn't hold the door for me it's got to be because I'm a woman or something like that.
1590000	1600000	All right maybe there's a good point to introduce Ricky the three great untruths from the previous book Kotlin in the American mind and then your new fourth great untruth that you talk about in this book.
1601000	1614000	So the great untruths come from actually the way my family tends to give advice that essentially we we recognize that you know we're independent minded the kind of people you know who would end up at the head of a free speech organization.
1614000	1622000	We like to think for ourselves but so we don't think that people often respond to positive advice saying you should do the following five things.
1623000	1628000	All we're trying to do usually is like but don't do the following don't do this dumb thing can we all agree on that.
1629000	1635000	So we the setup for Kotlin of the American mind the book that actually is why Ricky and I know each other in the first place.
1635000	1644000	We had three great untruths which is what doesn't kill you makes you weaker to always trust your feelings and life is a battle between good people and evil people.
1644000	1649000	And we make the point that if you believe these things your life will not be as happy.
1649000	1655000	It goes against modern psychology and ancient wisdom and it's just terrible advice to give to anyone.
1655000	1662000	The one that sounds the nicest is always trust your feelings but most of like actual you know moral teaching is about no goodness.
1662000	1670000	Don't always trust your feelings their information not instructions as I can't remember her name but that's one of my favorite quotes on that.
1670000	1684000	And in this book we added a fourth great untruth which is no bad person has any good opinion that essentially so much of the debate seems to be trying to establish whether or not that someone is morally good or bad.
1684000	1691000	And that's actually where the conservative part comes in because like really what they're trying to say is like the spirits conservative and therefore immoral because they're all bad.
1691000	1696000	And therefore you don't have to listen to them and there's something really childish about this.
1696000	1705000	Now I always think of like you know Jean-Jacques Rousseau all the biographies of Rousseau show him to be a pretty awful human being.
1705000	1711000	That doesn't mean he's wrong about everything and actually I'd say that there's a you know maybe 40% of Rousseau that I actually quite agree with.
1711000	1717000	You shouldn't actually be evaluating thinkers on whether or not you think they're good people you should be evaluating them on their argument.
1717000	1723000	But there's also a huge double standard they don't tend to apply this to Rousseau because there's some affection for Rousseau still on the left.
1723000	1730000	There's the great David Hume which I say with you know such great reference because every science person and every First Amendment person loves him so.
1730000	1736000	He has a he had a footnote and I think 1752 that was by modern standards racist.
1736000	1741000	He also had a footnote in 1752 and there's an attempt to completely dismiss him.
1741000	1751000	Whereas Douglas Murray points out it's like by the way they don't do this with Marx you know like who was racist like anti-Semitic like all the kind of horrible stuff.
1751000	1757000	There's a huge double standard with who they apply the you know no bad people can have any good opinion.
1757000	1762000	What's that that you call that a offense archaeology where you go digging digging around.
1762000	1766000	To be clear that that's not our term I don't know I don't remember who originally came up with it.
1766000	1769000	I know I should learn to give credit where it's due.
1769000	1777000	But my favorite example of offense archaeology was a he was like on the board of directors I think of a major corporation.
1777000	1784000	And he had written against women being in the military in like 1986 or somewhere around there.
1784000	1795000	And he got canceled he got kicked off the board because of something he had written in the 80s which by the way he no longer even believed in and he was very clear about that.
1795000	1806000	So you and that's and that's the thing what we're trying to say is and one of the reasons why I got so frankly depressed and anxious when I was writing this book is as soon as you're a target the thing they're going to get you on isn't necessarily
1806000	1814000	the thing you're saying on the podcast. It's something that you might have tweeted you know 15 years ago it might be a column you wrote in high school.
1814000	1821000	The ability to try to find something on you is is one of the M. O.'s of cancel culture.
1821000	1822000	Yeah.
1822000	1834000	Ricky you talked about in the book you guys talk about the difference between the First Amendment as legal precedence and then just cultural free speech norms.
1834000	1846000	What's wrong with well OK let's put it this way I can't just say anything I want walking around the world telling people you're fat and uglier or whatever I mean we all silence ourselves out of politeness or whatever.
1846000	1858000	Isn't that different from whatever the First Amendment protects us and shouldn't corporations and universities have something like polite speech codes or you know don't be a dick and just say nasty things to people.
1858000	1859000	What's wrong with that.
1859000	1874000	Yeah I mean I think obviously there's the First Amendment that protects you in the public sphere and then it's certainly up to private corporations and private universities to create their own contours and I think I mean there is I would I in my
1874000	1883000	opinion I think there's a great deal of mistrust in people's ability to just filter on their own like I don't think a corporation necessarily needs to say Michael can't call his co-worker fat.
1883000	1888000	I think that most people can kind of do that on their own without their corporation stepping in and doing that.
1888000	1903000	But one one delineation that we do make is that we don't think that First Amendment law in on its own is adequate and protecting free speech in a culture because you have examples of actually contrasting examples of the French enlightenment
1903000	1918000	which was able to flourish in a context in which the legal the laws in the books were actually quite hostile to free speech and yet that was an enormous moment of intellectual flourishing versus if you go to a country like Turkey or North Korea or Russia
1918000	1928000	in a legal sense you actually have a perfectly fine standard of having free expression but that just doesn't actually happen in in in actuality.
1928000	1945000	And I think that the reason that we delineate between free speech culture and just free speech laws in the books is because it's truly you can't have a society where free speech is is thriving and healthy and well and discourses is robust
1945000	1958000	It's a principle that is drilled into every citizen's head and something that they truly believe in that knowing what other people really believe and have to say is is a something worth worth knowing.
1958000	1972000	And I mean I would say even just from my own personal perspective coming from Gen Z being a philosophy major doing I did a two year liberal arts condensed philosophy program at NYU at a great school I was at the top of my class.
1972000	1979000	And yet it took the pandemic and taking a leap of absence to decide on my own that I wanted to read John Stuart Mills on Liberty.
1979000	1993000	And I had this like, I mean, it's hard for me to even like, it's like learning to ride a bicycle like now I can't really think about what the world is like without the realization of what classical liberalism is but at that moment in time it was like,
1993000	2009000	whoa, like it just like hit me like, I've been taking for taking for granted all this time what free speech means to a society how I do actually have these, these amazing rights that are so historically and chronologically unlikely in the scheme of human history.
2009000	2022000	But it took actually learning about like why that principle matters and not just taking it for granted and saying like, oh maybe like some offensive speech should just be curved because like I don't want to hurt people's feelings like you need it you need people to be aware of
2022000	2029000	why we've all bought into this classical liberal ideal and just having a law on the books is certainly not enough to guarantee that.
2029000	2032000	Yeah, and I'd like to, you know, chime in.
2032000	2046000	Because I we actually put some of the more in the weeds arguments back in the appendix partially because since most people kind of know cancel culture is going we didn't want to have the in the weeds arguments break up the flow of the main argument so we put them a little bit in the back.
2046000	2061000	But I make the point that one of the reasons why we include the First Amendment about the First Amendment standards in the definition of cancel culture is to import a tremendous amount of thoughtfulness and nuance that actually exists in First Amendment law.
2061000	2070000	And so for example when you talk about the employment setting I tend to think of it as a analog or comparison to public employee status.
2070000	2082000	Now, what that means, at least in theory, is that, yeah, you call your your coworker fat, you know, in the office that's considered, you know, unprofessional and any employer government or not could probably fire you for that.
2082000	2091000	They might also be kind of like, okay, that's rude, stop being rude, you know, I don't like the fact that the first thing people seem to do is get fired these days but that's a totally different issue.
2091000	2107000	But if you express your opinion off off the job on a matter of public concern, there is some law saying that you that a public employee shouldn't be fired for having an opinion and when you're talking about things like free speech culture versus free speech law, you're really talking about
2107000	2122000	thumbs on the scale and different levels of balancing. And at the end, we give, we point out that there already are like sayings that we all grew up with or at least not so much Ricky, but me and you grew up with, like to each their own, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
2122000	2134000	All of these things that kind of put a little bit of a thumb on the scale of, okay, do I really want to fire this person for cracking a body joke on Twitter, you know, for example, which which really does happen.
2135000	2143000	Or should I be kind of like, well, you know, if everyone did that, if every corporation did that, that would be bad for democracy, right?
2143000	2150000	Right. Yeah, Ricky, so you grew up in the social media world.
2150000	2163000	And so I'm curious what a how a libertarian like you thinks about the regulation of social media companies. Should they shouldn't they I mean, if you if you're a free mark pro free market, shouldn't Twitter be able to do whatever they want operation?
2163000	2168000	Well, they used to have shareholders, but I guess not anymore.
2168000	2174000	But something like that, Facebook or whatever, that's their prerogative they can ban whoever they want.
2175000	2180000	Even though maybe normalize, you don't think they should, but shouldn't they be able to do that?
2180000	2190000	Yep, absolutely. I mean, I think that they they certainly should be able to I think there's some important nuances that have come out of like J.
2191000	2204000	Recently having a pretty, I think landmark victory in in now to court challenges of the Biden administration and several other federal agencies in which he and several other complainants were able to pretty
2204000	2220000	persuasively demonstrate that that federal agencies were reaching out to companies like social media companies like Twitter and saying, you know, here's a body of misinformation on on your on your platform and effectively job owning them into
2220000	2234000	answering on their behalf because, you know, these these large social media companies do have some favorable regulations and it's like, well, really nice company that you have there with all of your favorable policy is be ashamed if you didn't get rid of a little bit of this information
2234000	2249000	misinformation for us. So I think that's a very important nuance of defining the the boundaries between these companies which are increasingly just standing in for the public forum and also allowing for some free market alternatives to flourish,
2249000	2262000	which, I mean, there's been a tremendous amount of disruption with Elon Musk buying Twitter and all these different offshoots of now threads is an option I don't really think that went anywhere but and there was there were a few
2262000	2270000	I don't think any of them are going to I don't think any of them are going to go anywhere and there's something about the free market that doesn't solve these kinds of problems, just because of market momentum.
2270000	2281000	I mean, why aren't there a dozen Twitter there aren't they got there first and that's it they got they captured 99% of the audience. And you know you can start you can go to threads but no one's at on threads.
2281000	2283000	You gotta be on threads.
2283000	2284000	You are.
2284000	2285000	Okay.
2285000	2288000	I post a threads sub stack.
2288000	2294000	X, you know, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram because there's something wrong with me.
2294000	2299000	But here I'm giving you the argument, particularly to Ricky libertarian.
2299000	2305000	You know the free market is not solving this problem so government needs to step in and regulate.
2305000	2309000	I mean, which problem specifically.
2309000	2314000	Well, I guess censorship I mean people should not be free to say whatever they want.
2314000	2320000	I mean, ISIS should not be free to recruit members on Twitter, something like that.
2320000	2331000	So, so the argument would be I mean I agree with you but I also don't think that there's a large swath of social media companies that have just been like warm hosts to ISIS.
2331000	2344000	I do think that the free market has done a pretty good job of, of stepping up and creating the contours and experimenting rather than the government coming in and saying, here's, here's what is dangerous speech or here's what's not allowed.
2344000	2353000	And I would much rather allow for that experimentation, and which I think Twitter, Twitter did and Elon is trying to tinker with the different nuances there.
2353000	2359000	And I mean, I do, I also would push back a little bit on the idea that the free market has not created some alternatives.
2359000	2371000	I mean, for better or for worse, a place like it might not be a place that you and I would want to go to but like gab and truth social and all these other little crevices of the internet that are very much alive and unfortunately very polarized.
2371000	2378000	But like, there, there has been a free market alternative that it might be a little bit more of a niche market but those are pretty dedicated users.
2378000	2385000	We have a chapter actually on on what we think is kind of like primitive thinking on social media.
2385000	2400000	And one thing that's really cool is that we have, we got to work with NCRI National Contagion Research Institute to point to look at data indicating that people who were kicked off of Twitter in 2016 and 2017 and 2020.
2400000	2410000	Tended to go to places like gab where from the, you know, research they did seem to seem to indicate and unsurprisingly got much more radicalized.
2410000	2414000	And what people miss is that there's value in knowing what people really think.
2414000	2423000	So for example, like when you give the example of terrorists being, you know, kicked off different platforms, I get sympathy for it, but keep kicking them off.
2423000	2425000	But at the same time, they all move to WhatsApp.
2425000	2427000	They all move to things that were much better protected.
2427000	2430000	Meanwhile, it's kind of like, you're going to tell us what you're planning.
2430000	2431000	Great.
2431000	2435000	You know, like way to create a way to create a record way to do this out in the open.
2435000	2437000	And this is something I have to repeat a lot.
2437000	2442000	Like it's not, you don't defend freedom of speech because you think everything people say is good.
2442000	2448000	What you defend freedom of speech because you're saying that everything people say is information that might be valuable.
2448000	2451000	They might be announcing, hey, by the way, Nazi over here.
2451000	2452000	Great.
2452000	2456000	Don't go on a date with me that they might actually otherwise be hiding.
2456000	2457000	That's funny.
2457000	2458000	Yeah.
2458000	2461000	When there's all those calls to kick Trump off of Twitter, it's like, why?
2461000	2464000	I want to know what he's thinking at one in the morning.
2464000	2466000	It's important to know what he's thinking.
2466000	2468000	He's president.
2468000	2469000	Okay.
2469000	2470000	Let's look at the big picture of censorship.
2470000	2472000	What is it about human nature?
2472000	2480000	Do you think that the default seems to be always to censor other people, whether it's individuals or corporations or government agency.
2480000	2483000	It's just the long history of humanity.
2483000	2485000	Censorship is the norm.
2486000	2487000	Why?
2487000	2496000	Well, I mean, I call my substack the eternally radical idea because and that's it's a reference to freedom of speech because I think in every generation, people rise up.
2496000	2499000	And I always expect I'm going to say to defend free speech.
2499000	2500000	I'm like, no, no, no.
2500000	2502000	Every generation, people rise up to fight freedom of speech.
2502000	2509000	And they're usually historically speaking on the on the on the the sensors are on the winning side.
2509000	2514000	It's very like it's a comparative rare window of human history that free speech has been at all protected.
2514000	2517000	And I think that there's lots of different, you know, reasons for that.
2517000	2520000	I think that certainly tribalism is part of it.
2520000	2522000	I think that we crave certainty.
2522000	2524000	I think that we crave a more rational world.
2524000	2530000	I think we crave, like as Carl Popper points out, we crave a more permanent and rational world.
2530000	2538000	But we also like the idea of there being eternal, perfect truths that are unchanging, which is one of the reasons why I'm such a critic of Plato.
2538000	2542000	They don't give a whole speech, you know, get get a little cranky about Plato.
2542000	2545000	So I think this runs really deep with us.
2545000	2557000	And I think one of the reasons why freedom of speech is the eternally radical idea is because it goes against some of our intuition to say, you know, like, of course, the heavier thing falls faster than the than the lighter thing.
2557000	2559000	And it actually turns out, wait, my intuition was wrong.
2559000	2565000	I bet if you test it, that opened up the enlightenment was this incredible period of being like, what if we test all this stuff?
2565000	2568000	What if we actually look at it and go like, is this actually true?
2568000	2575000	And we found time and time again, oh, wow, no, no, we were totally wrong about a million different things when you actually when you actually test them.
2575000	2577000	But it's uncomfortable for a lot of people.
2577000	2584000	I think like temperaments like me, you and Ricky, we have a little bit of like, we're more comfortable with awe.
2584000	2589000	We like the idea that there's a massive ocean of stuff that we will never and can never know.
2589000	2594000	But for other people, that's profoundly unsettling.
2594000	2603000	Yeah, Ricky, what is your answer that based on like, say, your fellow students and when you were in college, what was it that they were driven to censor people?
2603000	2606000	Yeah, I mean, I think that there's definitely been different iterations.
2606000	2619000	And one thing that the coddling of the American mind did such a great job of was describing for me something that I felt like I was living through as like a test, like study subject, maybe, but like couldn't really see the larger zoomed out version.
2619000	2627000	And so to have Greg and John explain a lot of the safety ism of Gen Z was really clarifying for me because I could see all the symptoms of it.
2627000	2632000	But I couldn't quite grasp the cause of it or how it was different from times in the past.
2632000	2648000	But I would say in the most recent couple of years, it's been the tying of like psychological well-being and safety towards in a way that I think really appeals to some people's more sympathetic interest in saying like, oh, my gosh, I wouldn't want to harm somebody
2648000	2653000	or allow them to be hurt or wounded by words and those words could literally be violence.
2653000	2660000	And it sounds very hyperbolic, but that's discourse that I heard all the time at NYU and feeling as though you need to protect another.
2660000	2668000	And I would say at least from my vantage point, I mean, I went to a very diverse college, but almost every single time I heard that sort of discourse invoked.
2668000	2675000	It was by somebody who was saying, oh, we can't let like this other group, like we can't let these words wound this group.
2675000	2682000	And very, I can't come up with a single time when someone said like as a person of color or as a woman, I'm wounded by those words.
2682000	2686000	It's always to protect some other group abstraction.
2686000	2697000	But I would say at least in terms of the censorship inclination in my generation, it was totally just hijacking our genuine sympathy and empathy for people.
2697000	2709000	And convincing us that insulating people or stopping certain ideas from coming out of people's mouths was something that would actually legitimately stop harm for others.
2709000	2715000	You mean so you're saying it's a mistaken belief that words are the equivalent of violence?
2715000	2719000	Because if you really believe that, then there's kind of a rationality behind silence.
2719000	2724000	You don't want to let somebody physically pound on somebody else, you would intervene.
2724000	2733000	Yeah, I mean, it's quite literally you would hear that like those are violent words or you're harming me or I need a safe space, which is an ideological safe space.
2733000	2737000	But I almost feel like there's a physical element to that as well, obviously, in a very literal sense.
2737000	2743000	But yeah, I mean, words are tantamount to violence in the minds of a lot of people that I encountered in academia.
2743000	2758000	And I think that an outgrowth of that is if you if you really embrace that that mistake in my in my view, then it becomes perfectly acceptable to shout down a speaker or to like threaten somebody who's trying to go to a campus event
2758000	2766000	or to assault somebody who's espousing dangerous words because if words are tantamount to violence and that's a completely acceptable response to them.
2766000	2770000	Yeah, and I always try to point out that this is an ancient idea.
2770000	2779000	And I watch, you know, professors, most embarrassingly, but sometimes students think of think that almost like pat themselves on the back for thinking of like that.
2779000	2781000	Well, we now know words are violence.
2781000	2788000	It's kind of like, no, we knew words were violence back in the 13th century, kind of like there was not a major distinction made between the two.
2788000	2796000	And it was more or less a societal decision to make a bright line decision, a distinction between words and violence.
2796000	2804000	You know, it's embodied in the First Amendment, for example, took a took a while to realize, you know, the full extent of it wasn't really realized into the 20th century.
2804000	2805000	But at the same time, like this.
2805000	2817000	But and Jonathan Rauch, who's a good friend and, you know, one of my intellectual heroes, you know, he makes the point that it's underappreciated how much a bright line distinction between speech and violence has been a tool for
2817000	2830000	peace, because basically the way that the traditional way that we resolve disputes in human history is violence or the threat of violence or ostracism, like really coercive means.
2830000	2841000	And to move from not just we're going to tolerate dissenters, but we might actually even listen to them engage them and take seriously the possibility they might be right is uncomfortable.
2842000	2850000	It is also like a radical idea, but it's one of the best inventions the species has ever come up with.
2850000	2856000	So the canceling of the American mind is something of a sequel to the coddling of the American mind.
2856000	2875000	Is it that the coddling of parents be people like me of people like Ricky is what made them fragile and that's why they are suffering to have more anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, cutting all this fear of missing out and fear of being left out and all that stuff is.
2875000	2878000	Is that thesis held up?
2878000	2889000	We, you know, to be clear in coddling, we actually identified six different causal threads of why this happened and parenting is definitely a part of it, like anxious parenting is part of it.
2889000	2903000	We actually even added at a seventh that essentially the ability to sort of fall out of the upper classes, you know, has people and particularly in the upper classes kind of like in a perpetual state of sort of mild panic.
2903000	2911000	But we also talk about how social media sped all the stuff up, how the polarization made things much more intense.
2911000	2920000	So there's a technological influence here that not only sped some of these existing trends like polarization and paranoid parenting up.
2920000	2935000	I also created some new ones like God forbid Tumblr, you know, where the social dynamic became very much about earning some amount of prestige by going in deep at the worst aspects of your of your own thought.
2935000	2939000	So we think that actually this environment is created by a number of factors.
2939000	2950000	And but it is weird that the parenting and I think that partially the actual when I mentioned that the, you know, conservatives tend to live out in the country and liberals tend to live, you know, more densely packed.
2950000	2958000	I think a lot of what we're seeing is this divorce between the between sort of traditional thinking and progressive thinking.
2958000	2971000	Whereas those two work really well if they balance each other out that essentially like someone pointing out, you know, who really wants to be very, very forward thinking how they raise their kids having the grandparent there saying,
2971000	2977000	actually, some of that seems like a pretty bad idea, you know, from my grandparents told me that's actually a pretty good balance.
2977000	2987000	But now that we actually live in in communities that are much more politically isolated and much more homogenous, we kind of spiral off in our own particular idiosyncratic craziness.
2988000	2991000	Ricky, how come you're not a fragile snowflake?
2991000	2993000	What happened to you?
2993000	2995000	And she certainly is not.
2995000	2999000	She like I got depressed and anxious while writing the book and she was a rock.
3001000	3013000	I mean, I would say looking back a lot of the Gen Z isms were things that it was it was helpful to have Greg and John kind of identifying some of the cognitive distortions of my generation because I was guilty of a lot of them myself.
3014000	3028000	But I think having that awareness and having, you know, intellectual authorities like Greg and John who described that to me in a way that I took very seriously was something that allowed me to actually reflect in on myself and I've met a lot of young people who've read that
3028000	3036000	book and had the same experience to their credit, which is why I feel so fortunate to be able to play a role in in this next book with Greg.
3037000	3050000	But I would say another part that was of my upbringing that's very important to me is I've been very fortunate in the combination of parents that I was blessed with with a mother who is of Eastern European background and a lot of sensibility and no nonsense.
3050000	3055000	And I think that's part of that kind of cultural inheritance and a father who's actually 86 years old.
3055000	3060000	So I've got the most unbelievable span of generations in one household.
3060000	3074000	I mean, he's he was 63 when I was born and I think coming home with a lot of the the kind of generational tides of things that impacted me at school and I'd come home and I'd police his speech about whatever word was perfectly acceptable the day before.
3074000	3077000	But now I've been told by someone was unacceptable.
3077000	3079000	He'd be like, I don't give a shit.
3079000	3080000	Like, I'm sorry.
3080000	3082000	I don't care.
3082000	3088000	And I saw your dad was six, your dad was 63 when he had you.
3088000	3090000	Yeah, so I was I was a late addition.
3090000	3094000	And I think, you know, growing up with someone who could tell me, I mean, I've always been a history nerd too.
3094000	3110000	And growing up with someone who could tell me what it was like to see Nazi POWs with his own eyes being shipped to a camp in upstate New York and who had lived through a lot of social tides and and a lot of trends and fads that had died out.
3110000	3124000	I mean, just having that, I feel so fortunate to have been able to to ground my own conception of the world beyond just like social media or this moment here and now because it was like almost like an anchor against some of the generational tides, I would say, in retrospect, for sure.
3124000	3130000	I mean, I was like the only kid in I remember one time in like second grade, a teacher had come to my mom and been like, what's up with Ricky?
3130000	3132000	She said son of a gun.
3132000	3134000	And I've never heard anyone say that.
3134000	3156000	Well, and something really did my dad's actually was 50 when I was born, which is very unusual for people my age. And, you know, like, our family fled the Bolsheviks, you know, like we were originally serfs, you know, like so we have a long, long family history of that.
3156000	3162000	But particularly if you grew up in a first generation environment with other or also with other immigrant kids.
3162000	3172000	Like the rest of the world, particularly when they come here, they have, I think they have like a better understanding of some of the aspects of what they make America different and free speech is always right at the top of the list.
3172000	3180000	And how often Michael, I have to tell you, like, I'll have someone from I went to law school with talk about being concerned about political correctness.
3180000	3185000	And they'll and they'll mention or cancel culture or just ideology gone wrong.
3185000	3191000	And even if they're otherwise very lefty, they'll be kind of like, oh yeah, my mother was born in Slovakia.
3191000	3197000	You know, like they have some connection or, you know, my parents grew up in China.
3197000	3206000	Like they have some experience with authoritarianism in their family history or personally that makes them aware of the how precious freedom of speech is.
3206000	3219000	But that's one of the things that's so great about working with like a brilliant young woman like like Ricky is that, you know, she but partially by having, you know, a little bit of a lifeline to the more distant past through her dad.
3219000	3226000	You know, she she definitely maintained tremendous historical perspective on on how bad it could be without freedom of speech.
3226000	3232000	Yeah. Yeah. Well, Ricky, your dad's got me beat. I had my son at 62. He's now seven.
3233000	3242000	Yeah. And I have a 31 year old. I had a 31 year old daughter and I had her I was 37 and that was kind of old. So
3242000	3248000	I've been a great aunt since I was 10. So it's got to be like some sort of record.
3248000	3249000	That's really funny.
3249000	3250000	That's amazing.
3250000	3254000	Okay, let's talk about these generational differences. I've been thinking a lot about this.
3254000	3258000	I just read Jean Twangy's latest book Generations Highly Recommended.
3259000	3271000	Massive data set. So her thesis just to review it for the listeners is that technology has driven a lot of social change, mainly say vaccines, public health measures and so on double the lifespan.
3271000	3283000	If you lived in a time when you were likely to be half the population would be dead by age 35 on average, you know, you got to have 10 kids because half of them are going to die before they get to reproductive age and so on.
3284000	3295000	So we were a more what's called an R selected species. That is, we have lots of offspring and hope to get a few into breeding age like salmon versus elephants that have one or two.
3295000	3304000	I mean, we're more like elephants on average, but her argument is that when life gets safer and longer, it can slow down.
3304000	3308000	You don't have to have as many kids. You don't have to have them as early.
3308000	3314000	Her startling statistic was that women of my age on average got pregnant the first time at age 19.
3314000	3320000	Now it's 29 for your generation, Ricky. That's 10 years and they don't have four or five kids.
3320000	3323000	They have one, 1.5 or whatever.
3323000	3331000	And so her argument is the coddling part. Coddling is not the right word. They're more risk averse because you're only going to have one.
3331000	3338000	This is it. I'm putting all my resources into this one and that translates into things like play dates that we do.
3338000	3341000	You know, like, okay, I got a call set up the time. We're going to drop them off.
3341000	3345000	We're going to make sure everything is safe and protected and everything is good.
3345000	3351000	You know, whereas my generation, you know, you have four or five kids just come home by the time of dinner and that's it.
3352000	3363000	So the safetyism, she argues, comes from this kind of overprotecting and risk aversion because you have all your resources into just the one or maybe two.
3363000	3365000	I don't know. What are your thoughts on that?
3365000	3370000	I mean, I think that that makes sense even in the ways that I do think I was coddled.
3370000	3377000	It was by my mom and being an only child because she, you know, I was the kid that they poured all the resources into.
3377000	3386000	And I would go to all the right tutors and, you know, she'll admit herself to have been a helicopter parent a little bit.
3386000	3393000	And I think, you know, my dad's first family, he had four boys and it was like, I don't know which one's which at a certain point.
3393000	3397000	They were four and four years. So it was definitely a difference in that sense.
3398000	3412000	And I would also say, like, I think that the internet plays a role in that too, because of all this, like, I mean, such a wealth of a constant stream of information on like all these different theories about parenting and how you should be
3412000	3421000	parenting and all these different methods and, and there's this like constant stream of telling you what you what you're doing wrong with your kid or what you should be doing.
3421000	3428000	I mean, I think that that also puts so much pressure on parents to be giving their kids the best foot forward.
3428000	3438000	And that often does mean helicoptering over them or coddling them or, or doing things that are historically just negligible to the well-being of a child going forward.
3438000	3448000	So I think that that probably makes sense because if you have less kids and, and more time and a much louder bullhorn in your ear telling you how you're doing everything wrong as a parent,
3448000	3451000	then certainly that would make you coddle your kids.
3452000	3462000	Yeah. And in freedom from speech, at first I called this problems of comfort, which unfortunately I realized would be the initials would be POC and I realized I might get canceled for that.
3462000	3477000	So in coddling the American mind, we changed it to problems of progress that essentially, and so I was trying to sort of split the difference about trying to explain why I agree, you know, with pinker on things getting better in a lot of ways.
3477000	3480000	But also that I expect things to get worse for freedom of speech.
3481000	3494000	And particularly if you have environments where you're, you know, more isolated from people disagree with you and a more therapeutic culture and that has fewer larger problems and can actually has a higher expectation of comfort, frankly,
3494000	3503000	that you're going to get less and less comfortable with free speech over time, not despite other things getting better, but actually precisely because other things are getting better.
3503000	3511000	So I think that the decay of freedom of speech is a side effect of what should be considered progress.
3511000	3523000	I do think that if things turn awful, like if we end up in a nuclear war or something like that, some of that will go away because it tends to give people like a sense of perspective.
3523000	3528000	But I would rather have the problems of progress than not have them.
3529000	3537000	Yeah, I've often wondered if a lot of these big protests over small things are just the result of that's what's left to protest.
3537000	3543000	You know, the big things have been to Vietnam War and civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, these are all done largely.
3543000	3549000	And so what's next in the next generation? Well, I want to get out there and do something to help human progress.
3549000	3557000	What's left? Oh, the trans rights or whatever, and our BLM movement and, you know, and then also, you know, when you watch something like the George Floyd video,
3557000	3560000	I mean, it's really hard to watch and not just be curated.
3560000	3566000	Yeah. And then you think, well, what can I do? You know, I'm not a mayor, I'm not a politician, I'm not a police chief.
3566000	3569000	You know, what can I do? Well, I can go down there and protest.
3569000	3576000	Yes, tomorrow afternoon, we're going down to City Hall and we're going to have our signs or you go on Twitter and complain.
3576000	3579000	Because at least you feel like you're doing something.
3579000	3589000	And I would also add to that, like, in my generation, having been at a boarding school, like our school would, I think we were activated quite young politically and we, you know,
3589000	3599000	they would have buses to certain protests and rallies if you wanted to go down to DC for whatever the most recent, like a climate protest or something like that.
3599000	3609000	And then I also think you combine that with the fact that teenagers are not doing any of the normal teenager things that they have done for the entire span of human history.
3609000	3617000	Like they're not socializing, they're not getting outside, they're staying on their phones, they're not getting licenses, they're not dating, they're not getting summer jobs anymore.
3617000	3627000	And so they have a bunch of kids that are on their phones and on their devices with a 24 hour news cycle who are kind of taking on the weight of the world on their shoulders from day one.
3627000	3632000	As soon as they plug in online and they don't actually have healthy outlets to use their time.
3632000	3639000	So of course they're going to want to put that energy and that activism and that passion that they have somewhere.
3639000	3643000	And oftentimes I think it just ends up going into the political white noise.
3643000	3645000	Well, and let's be clear here.
3645000	3646000	And this is something that I do.
3646000	3652000	There's a tendency particularly for those of us who are more left leaning to never want to blame anybody.
3653000	3656000	You know, like I never want to say like anything was really anyone's fault.
3656000	3660000	It's impersonal factors taking over and that's the cause of everything.
3660000	3662000	It's just you're a victim of circumstance.
3662000	3668000	But we do try to be pretty clear in the book that there really was, for example, an anti free speech movement.
3668000	3681000	You know, there really were thinkers including Richard Delgado and Herbert Marcuse and actually what gets labeled now is CRT that really the first thing they did was try to pass speech codes and restrict freedom of speech.
3681000	3695000	And it's the same thing that comes to like the theory of cobbling in the American mind is that we're teaching young people to think in cognitive distortions, exaggerated mental habits that will make them anxious and depressed if they have them.
3695000	3701000	But to be clear, like some of that comes from, you know, just parents being extra anxious as there's less to worry about.
3701000	3718000	Some of it comes from a very intentional, you know, movement among K through 12 teachers, parents believing that if if you're absolutely terrified and depressed about global warming that will somehow make you more of an activist about it.
3718000	3725000	And again, to go back to Pinker, Pinker points out, no, that actually is likely to make you hopeless or come up with solutions that can't possibly work.
3726000	3738000	What you need to actually fix things like George Floyd absolutely horrifying and immediately, you know, there were like eight different reforms that would have made common sense to pass it would make an event like this less less likely.
3738000	3751000	But instead it became sort of a national consciousness raising thing and it really, you know, went after professors and students who tweeted things that were mildly, you know, insensitive, even some cases like that are just utterly ridiculous.
3751000	3764000	So I think that we shouldn't underestimate how much the mental health harm that we're doing to young people comes from a faulty belief that if we make them sufficiently miserable, it will somehow produce positive social change.
3764000	3771000	Yeah, sometimes you guys all hear pushback like you're just perpetuating a moral panic over much do about nothing. This isn't a big deal.
3771000	3782000	I mean, I heard since you mentioned the critical race theory, I heard Chomsky on a podcast the other day saying, Oh, this is just this tiny little legal theory in law schools, you know, grammar school teachers, middle school.
3782000	3785000	They don't have any idea what this they're not teaching us the kids.
3785000	3789000	That's a I have respect for Chomsky. He should know better.
3789000	3795000	The thing is, it's not like they're not literally teaching, you know, they're not handing out Derek Bell's books.
3796000	3808000	But I mean, there's some of the books that have been in controversial. There's one I think it's literally called intersectional baby, like anti racist baby, you know, like is absolutely that CRT.
3808000	3817000	A lot of these a lot of these ideas, there's so much in the culture that that people don't recognize that they're originally where they came from.
3817000	3819000	I'm Mark Kimberly Crenshaw.
3819000	3824000	Like even though like and Crenshaw has been critical of how they've turned out to a credit.
3824000	3832000	But yeah, it's it's omnipresent in our society. It's it's it's so taken for granted people forget where it initially came from.
3832000	3841000	Interesting books on different sides, even though Chris Ruffo isn't a big fan of ours because we we posed rightfully the stop will act in Florida because it was laughably unconstitutional.
3841000	3853000	You actually wrote a pretty good book about, you know, the origins of CRT that points out that, you know, things that people should know like Mark is actually still in the 70s thought Mao was terrific, you know, which is worth knowing.
3853000	3864000	And but also Yasha Monk on the other side wrote a book called The Identity Trap pointing out a lot a lot of this stuff and how much it actually has filtered filtered in everywhere.
3864000	3871000	You know, it includes aspects of everything from postmodernism to CRT. And it's yeah, it's everywhere now.
3871000	3877000	On this topic of identity, Ricky, maybe you know some people your fellow students.
3877000	3888000	This kind of sudden spike in in trans by gender identity fluidity and so on. What is going on with that? Do you think?
3888000	3903000	Yeah, I mean, this is definitely a contentious issue. But I mean, it's one that I have I have no problem talking about because I've seen it like, I mean, I think I think I draw a line between like I truly don't care.
3903000	3911000	I have a ton of bisexual friends. I think that there is a crazy uptick in people that identify as non straight.
3911000	3916000	I it's not something that I'm really worried about pontificating about because, you know, they're not hurting anybody.
3916000	3924000	They're if they want to experiment or end up one way or another, sure, fine, whatever. Like I'm very libertarian in my disposition on that front.
3924000	3935000	I do draw a line on on feeling as though I'm much more comfortable having a conversation about like when it comes to medicalization and permanent decisions that are being made,
3935000	3940000	especially when someone is not yet 18 when you can't get a tattoo or even have a beer yet.
3940000	3957000	And I think, at least from my vantage point, the people that I know who have who have gone down a gender non conforming route or who have decided to or have ended up deciding that their trans have consistently been people who have been very online and
3958000	3969000	like Tumblr. And I think, you know, there's a huge swath of historical data to demonstrate that young women are especially susceptible to social contagion.
3969000	3974000	And I think that that that that's a large portion of it, for sure.
3974000	3984000	And I think, you know, it's just incubated in in, it's like a ready made community that on a place like Tumblr, if you're a kid who's kind of a drift in your social world.
3985000	3996000	You're welcomed with open arms. I've interviewed a lot of detransitioners and that's something that I consistently hear is that they felt when they were in middle school that they were kind of on the outskirts and then all of a sudden here's this this warm welcoming
3996000	3999000	community with a solution to all their problems.
3999000	4013000	And that tells them that this is kind of the panacea to everything and and you get built in friends to and and a whole world that embraces you and then all of a sudden all your friends in school and real life are celebrating you because you've done something so brave or
4013000	4020000	having assemblies in school and suddenly you're the kid that was in the back corner and you're you're really at the center of everything.
4020000	4024000	And so I think that there's a lot of complex social things going on on that front.
4024000	4040000	But I would definitely say that the the social contagion aspect like I I saw in just from afar in my age cohort that there were I was definitely a propensity of friend groups like coming to that conclusion at the same time together.
4040000	4045000	And I don't think that that is a coincidence. Yeah.
4045000	4049000	Yeah. And I mean and I want to bring us back to cancel culture and how it relates to this.
4049000	4059000	So let's take Carol Hoeven, you know, absolutely brilliant, you know, wrote a wonderful like a really top notch book called testosterone called T.
4059000	4061000	And you know the dangerous time to be writing about it.
4061000	4072000	She's an evolutionary biologist and she's over been essentially forced out of Harvard because she won on Fox News and explained very compassionately, very sweetly that we should be respectful towards trans people.
4072000	4081000	We should use their pronouns, all of the stuff, but biological sex is real and that it's important and we can't lose sight of the importance of biological sex.
4081000	4096000	And immediately a DEI administrator, you know, started, you know, complaining about it very publicly and people students got together and wrote petitions, you know, together fired the or otherwise punished.
4096000	4106000	And they wouldn't work in her class, it wouldn't be TAs and she got really depressed and she she dropped out came back again to work for Steve Pinker's lab.
4106000	4118000	And given that she dropped out, we actually count that as a cancellation attempt in our database, but we don't actually count that as successful cancellation, which because she did it, you know, of her own accord.
4118000	4125000	But this happens all the time and it's hard to, you know, know what it doesn't happen as a school is high profile as Harvard.
4125000	4129000	But here's how this relates to the trans discussion.
4129000	4139000	People aren't stupid. And when they see that someone got absolutely, you know, pulled over raked over the coals for just saying biological sex is real.
4139000	4146000	When the next expert comes out and says, actually biological sex is on a spectrum, it's not really real is blah, blah, blah.
4146000	4158000	They're just going to say, why should I trust you? Because if you said anything else, your life would be totally messed up, you might be fired, you might actually lose your entire career and all your friends.
4158000	4165000	So that's one of the reasons why one of the subtler themes of the book is how cancel culture destroys trust and expertise.
4165000	4178000	Yeah. Yeah, just a final point on that because I had a trans student a few years ago, a Chapman who, 18, these are first year students and she decided in the midstream, I'm now I want to be a boy or a man or whatever.
4178000	4184000	But it was obvious in a few weeks, she didn't want to change sex or whatever she wanted to be trans.
4184000	4189000	The trans was the identity, not the other thing.
4189000	4192000	And that's by sense of what might be going on.
4192000	4207000	I think there's definitely also, I mean, there's so much pressure. It's, it was really bizarre. I was in humanities classes at NYU and there was so much pressure to attach your personal immutable characteristics to any point that you make as a preface in,
4207000	4213000	in especially philosophical conversations where you'd hear all the time, like, as a queer person, blah, blah, blah.
4213000	4219000	And it would be like talking about some philosopher from the 17th century and it's like, what is your, your identity have to do with that?
4219000	4234000	Or as a woman or as a person of color, because it was almost like, if you felt like you might be saying something a little bit controversial or your idea might be pushed back on a little bit, then you had to attach it to some sort of group that would shield you from it,
4234000	4238000	which is almost the inverse of the perfect rhetorical fortress of what Greg and I discussed with cancel culture.
4238000	4241000	It's like protecting yourself by saying, I actually am part of this class.
4241000	4253000	And so, you know, if you can, if you can adopt one of those classes too, then, then there might be social benefit to that in a world where people get torn down for not being the right identity and having a certain idea.
4253000	4261000	I remember talking to an Uber liberal mother whose daughter I think just turned 15 and she was bragging how she's bi bisexual.
4261000	4262000	I said, well, how do you know?
4262000	4267000	I mean, if she had sex with boys and had sex with girls and she said, I like them both equally.
4267000	4269000	And she said, no, she hasn't had sex with anybody.
4269000	4271000	It's like, then how do you know?
4271000	4273000	I mean, so it's the identity itself.
4273000	4276000	The word has captured this meaning.
4276000	4289000	It's interesting when you look at the data, how many women say that they're bisexual, but when you actually ask them, do they, who they have sex with, a large percentage of them only have sex with men.
4289000	4292000	And it's kind of like, OK, so what exactly does that mean?
4292000	4295000	Well, that does flip pretty considerably with Gen Z women.
4295000	4304000	Jean Twenge has some data on that in her book where actually a lot of the self-identified bisexual young women are engaging in sexual activity with both genders.
4304000	4305000	Interesting.
4305000	4310000	OK, let's, before we run out of time, let's make sure we cover the conservative cancel culture.
4310000	4318000	What's wrong with Ron DeSantis wanting to protect Floridian children and protect children going to Disney because they're going to be exposed to all this.
4318000	4320000	Crazy woke stuff.
4320000	4322000	Oh, don't get me started on this.
4322000	4326000	The laws coming out of Florida have just completely derailed some of the discussion.
4326000	4331000	Some of the very legitimate discussion about higher education reform, which, you know, badly needs to happen.
4331000	4335000	We need a lot of work to protect academic freedom and viewpoint diversity.
4335000	4347000	And that overwhelmingly got derailed by the Stop Woke Act, which, you know, literally when they're arguing in court, I believe they said it's kind of like, well, you could have someone being anti-affirmative action in class,
4347000	4349000	but they can't be pro-affirmative action.
4349000	4352000	It's like, no, that's laughably unconstitutional.
4352000	4354000	And we warned them about this.
4354000	4366000	And now, because that was a, and fire, bought it in court, by the way, and we won, that there's now a version of it, part two, that they're, that will, I think is just as unconstitutional.
4366000	4369000	And I think we'll be able to, we will be able to defeat it again.
4369000	4373000	But it was bad because it's unconstitutional.
4373000	4376000	You can't engage in viewpoint discrimination in higher ed.
4376000	4383000	And it very much said you can't, you know, talk about these topics, you know, whether race, sex, gender, but also really, you can't have these points of view.
4383000	4387000	It seemed to be very, it was baked into the law.
4387000	4392000	And meanwhile, this has turned into, oh, it's the new McCarthyism.
4392000	4396000	There's all of these laws across the country threatening academic freedom.
4396000	4409000	And I'm concerned about the bad laws coming out of a lot of these legislatures, but there really was, as best we can tell, one law that came out, and that's the Stop Woke Act, and we defeated it in court.
4409000	4418000	But the other bad things coming out of Florida, you know, like going after Disney for having a political position is just silly theater, but also, you know, abuse of power.
4418000	4432000	The one that I think people should be more worried about is the attempt to go after New York Times v. Sullivan, which is the case that really strongly makes it very hard to defame public figures and well-known people.
4432000	4438000	And it's funny because there's a little bit on the right that kind of like, oh, we'd be so much better officers, there's no New York Times v. Sullivan.
4438000	4444000	I'm like, guys, think this through. Who do you think would be the most likely to get in trouble without New York Times v. Sullivan?
4444000	4449000	The conservatives are crazy to think that somehow protects them more than anybody else.
4449000	4452000	Just explain that log in.
4452000	4471000	So New York Times v. Sullivan is a seminal First Amendment case from the 1960s, in which there was an ad run in the New York Times that talked about some of the racial justice protests going on, and it had a couple of minor factual mistakes in it.
4471000	4480000	And there was a lawsuit against the people who bought the ad and claiming that it was defamatory.
4480000	4492000	And in that case, the Supreme Court came up with a standard called actual malice, that essentially you have to, if you publish something that you know was false or you showed reckless disregard for the truth,
4492000	4497000	you have to meet that high level in order to defame a public official.
4497000	4509000	And this has been very good at protecting us, protecting the U.S. from the very real problem of people in power using defamation law to silence their critics.
4509000	4522000	So this is like when Megyn Kelly had around DeSantis on, she pushed back against this, that this is not good for conservatives because once you set that precedent, that it's okay for the government to go after corporations' attitudes politically.
4522000	4526000	Well, that's just going to turn around and bite liberals.
4526000	4543000	Yeah, and I think it's something that unfortunately is it appeals to like the baser instincts of people who may have been in the camp that I was in before I really sat down with like classical liberal texts and theory where like you see liberalism on the left and people fighting in a really mighty way to try to
4544000	4558000	and then it seems perfectly logical if you're not really steeped in the philosophy of free speech and pluralism and classical liberalism to say, well, we should be stamping it out too because we're fighting might with might and they're bringing their fists and we should fight back.
4558000	4567000	And I think it's a really unfortunate reality that that's something that has allowed someone like DeSantis to get so much attention and so much popular support because it actually feels like he's fighting the battles.
4567000	4592000	And there's not enough, at least in my opinion, in my view as someone more on the right, there's not enough truly principled people with solutions that are genuinely pluralistic and genuinely foster a diverse democracy that are coming up and saying like actually if the left is going to abdicate freedom of speech as a fundamental principle, why don't we just take that up and like that would actually be appealing to quite a lot of people.
4592000	4596000	But unfortunately, it's not quite as sexy as stopping woke.
4596000	4614000	Yeah. Well, right, stopping woke. I mean, there was a viral tweet last week of a page, photograph of a page from a children's but maybe middle school was hard to tell about anal sex, rimming, you know, how to stimulate somebody, make sure you use open water, got to be careful in this and that.
4614000	4618000	And this was just being passed around like this is what the left is trying to do.
4618000	4620000	Yeah, that's a book called Let's Talk About It.
4620000	4621000	Yeah.
4621000	4623000	Oh, yeah, what's the backstory there?
4623000	4642000	The backstory there is it's a book that, you know, I don't think is appropriate for kids but by a long shot and this is something that is frustrating where fire is coming out with a frequently asked question on, you know, book banning and I put that in quotes because a lot of what's called book banning is not book banning, but there is actual
4642000	4654000	book banning. We took some heat in the Wall Street Journal for talking about book banning in the book, but book banning is when you completely remove a book from a library that not not reclassified as for adults, you just completely take it out.
4654000	4670000	Book banning is when someone gets arrested for forgiving, you know, for suggesting the book. What is it? This book is gay, you know, which has some racy stuff in it, but at the same time, it's not a crime to distribute it.
4670000	4688000	And a lot of the way the media has been covering this is people are arguing that something is age inappropriate. And if you're saying, if you have a process and they decide that, you know, this book is not age appropriate, that's always what K-12 libraries and public libraries have done.
4688000	4705000	And so there is a problem of book banning. But the way it's actually being handled currently in the media is really deceptive. The one that bothers me the most, frankly, is when you have these laws saying, you know, we will not teach the following books in our curriculum.
4705000	4717000	Well, and that could call a book ban. And like, you can think these are stupid, and some of them I think are stupid. But at the same time, do you live in a world where decisions on curriculum were at some point in human history, not political?
4717000	4732000	They've always been political. And what scares me the most with some of this stuff is that there's a movement among some nonprofits that are essentially like just like the the governor, the former Democratic governor of Virginia, just right before he lost, was
4733000	4751000	really kind of saying that we should leave all decisions related to K-12 education just to graduates of education schools. And it's like, no, there are there, I have, you know, five and seven year old, there are kids, we pay the taxes on it, and this is a mandatory institution.
4751000	4760000	And therefore, there needs to be democratic oversight. So, so when it comes to curricular stuff, that's always been politically decided and should have some democratic oversight.
4760000	4768000	So I think there's been some, even though we we object to the problem of book banning, I also think the debate has been held at a very low and sometimes frankly, deceptive level.
4768000	4774000	Right. So you distinguish between public schools and private schools, for example.
4774000	4775000	Oh, of course, yeah.
4775000	4788000	Yeah, can do what they want, something like that. Yeah. Okay, before we run out of time here, because I know you guys got interviews lined up. Solutions, what should we, what should the average person listening to this do? What can I do?
4788000	4793000	Well, the third, the whole third of the book is about solution, but Ricky go first.
4793000	4810000	Yeah, I was going to say one thing that we do emphasize is on parenting. I think that this, we need to be very mindful to raise anti-cancelers and that's something that sounds very like hopeful and wishful thinking, but actually the vast majority of Gen Z actually has a negative view of cancel culture more so than any generation.
4810000	4823000	It's a small number of very loud and very vicious people who are tearing down fellow young people and a whole lot of young people that are sitting on their hands and are afraid to speak up for their friends and to put themselves out there.
4823000	4840000	And so I think that that parenting the next generation to be mindful of the fact that like everyone is going to screw up and everyone needs some grace at a certain point of time is certainly something that gives me hope that there are more parents being aware of instilling those values.
4840000	4848000	And a lot of young people who have come up like raise their hands when I started speaking out in NYU and said like, actually, I agree with you. Just don't tell anyone.
4849000	4857000	Right. Don't tell anyone. Right. So this is called pluralistic ignorance or the spiral of silence where everybody thinks everybody else thinks something. And in fact, they don't.
4857000	4858000	With collective illusion.
4858000	4860000	Yeah.
4860000	4876000	Yeah. And when it comes to, I mean, for me, I think we need to be thinking about big, bold other ways for the hardest working, smartest students out there to show that because I think that's how kind of pessimistic I am about some aspects, particularly of elite higher.
4876000	4883000	But first, I think people should hire it less often from elite higher ed, because a lot of these problems are much more intense in elite higher ed.
4883000	4891000	And I, but I also think that we need avenues, you know, that someone can show that they're because right now take Harvard and I'll pick on Harvard all day.
4891000	4906000	45% of students, I believe of white students are either kids of professors, kids of legacies or sports people and the average average GPA at Harvard is 3.8.
4906000	4917000	So you might have someone who just kind of waltzed in there because they're a legacy that they don't have to work hard. They'll get they'll get there and make it a 3.6. And I know this from Stanford as well.
4917000	4928000	Like, you know, it's hard to be the top of your class, of course, but it's all the most impossible to fail out. You can you can get away with doing very little in elite higher ed.
4928000	4943000	So right now, we have this product that's supposed to give us the hardest working best and brightest, and it's not. And it's also giving employer employers and often cases, people who show up and want to cancel anyone they disagree with and have, you know, forums about, you know,
4943000	4961000	someone said something conservative, you know, in my organization, let's let's have a giant meeting. I think that if we had some other alternate avenues, and I'm talking about University of Texas at Austin, for example, but even way beyond that, we need to have other ways of showing that that completely
4961000	4970000	circle that really go around elite higher education, because that's how serious I think some of these ideological problems are you need to find other avenues.
4971000	4973000	Okay.
4973000	4988000	Yeah, I mean, to Greg, to Greg's credit, he changed fires, hiring requirements to hire me because I ended up just being so like disgusted with the state of my education and the nerve of my school to charge full tuition for zoom.
4988000	5007000	And so now, so now fire will hire non grads he's walking the walk. And I think I think definitely challenging the the grip that elite higher ed, which is inculcated all these ideas has on on our society and our institutions of leadership is definitely a really important thing to chip away at.
5007000	5019000	Yeah, by the way, I think those kind of pressures will actually help encourage elite higher ed to reform itself because you know, let's face it, Harvard has a one, I crunched the numbers the other night, $1 trillion.
5020000	5039000	It's endowment. They're going to be they're going to be around for a while. So you also have to put pressure on elite higher ed to reform itself but I would but I would love to start seeing, you know, people figuring out ways that people can show, you know, how many books they've read on a particular topic because those are the kind of people
5039000	5050000	that at fire more. Basically, when we're hiring people were trying to figure out, would you defend freedom of speech, even if it wasn't your job, and do you live and breathe this stuff, because then you're one of us.
5050000	5066000	Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, so Ricky, is it enough to say, I disagree with cancel culture, maybe just saying it other people go hey me too and then all of a sudden you get a cascade of shifting of opinions.
5066000	5082000	I certainly believe the courage is contagious. And yeah, it's just a matter of, of, I think, you know, an example that I think is really gives me a ton of hope is in Harvard their free speech council had 100 professors on it who all at the same time step forward and said yes, this is a problem.
5082000	5089000	And I think the safety in numbers is a really important thing because they've not been castigated in a way that I think if it was just one of them they almost definitely would have been.
5089000	5104000	And so, you know, the more people can actually put together that there are those around them that think the same way which was my experience at NYU having professors and deans and students that I knew and classmates that I never would have known agreed with me that free speech was an issue on campus,
5104000	5120000	and I think that's a really helpful path forward. There's my 230.
5120000	5122000	Okay.
5122000	5134000	I'll say goodbye and just make a few more comments with with Greg. Thank you, Ricky. Thank you so much. Congratulations on getting a major book deal with a major publisher at such a young age. You're just getting started. You're rolling.
5134000	5138000	Ricky is the best. I feel very lucky to get to work with her.
5138000	5141000	Thank you both so much. It's been a pleasure.
5141000	5149000	Thank you, Ricky. I'll just a few more comments with you, Greg. I'm glad you guys took on The Bachelor and Chris Harrison.
5149000	5150000	Oh, yeah. Yeah.
5150000	5155000	My wife and I have, you know, we have a little junk TV we like to watch, which used to be The Bachelor and The Bachelor.
5155000	5156000	It's great.
5156000	5164000	Yeah. And I always thought that was a stupidest show until I started watching it. Then you get attached to the characters and, you know, like, oh, she should have picked him or whatever.
5164000	5179000	But then that last season where the white woman picks the black guy is the man she wants to marry, and then they do some offense archaeology and they find when she was in high school, she went to like an antebellum, like a...
5179000	5181000	Scarlett O'Hara dance.
5181000	5188000	Yeah, Scarlett O'Hara. Yeah, something like that. And they, oh my God. And those final episodes were just painful to watch.
5188000	5189000	Yeah.
5189000	5197000	And they were like, you know, why did you pick him? It's like, well, because I'm in love with him. No, no, that's not it. You know, and it's like, you got to do the work. They kept telling her she has to do the work.
5197000	5198000	Ah, do the work.
5198000	5202000	And that's the first time I had heard that phrase. Like, what does that mean, do the work?
5202000	5212000	It means I'm superior to you and there's some knowledge that I have that you have. And Chris Harrison, what he came out and said in that was, let's have some grace.
5212000	5221000	But the people are being absolutely awful. Like, it was something that was perfectly reasonable to say. And he got forced out after, what was it? I don't remember exactly, 18 years?
5221000	5228000	Yeah, 19 years. Yeah, it was astonishing. And he comes off as the nicest guy, probably Uber liberal, just everyone.
5228000	5229000	Yeah.
5229000	5236000	And tolerate differences and so on. I mean, he deals with all that. And to be run out of town like that, it was just shameful.
5236000	5237000	Yeah.
5237000	5248000	And then they brought in that new host, a black guy, Ocho, I think, A-C-H-O or something like that, Emmanuel Ocho. He was a professional, I think, football player.
5248000	5253000	And sort of making, trying to make the transition into television.
5253000	5259000	So I read his book, which is basically, it's a little bit like the anti-racism type theme.
5259000	5260000	Oh.
5260000	5267000	Where everybody is a racist and, oh, I think the title was, you know, difficult conversations with white people, something like that.
5267000	5268000	Yeah.
5268000	5270000	That usually means lectures too.
5270000	5281000	Yes, yeah. So I said, all right, I'm a white guy. I have difficult conversations on my show with lots of people. So let's get them on. And the publisher, my publisher, is McMillan.
5281000	5283000	And they're like, nah, he doesn't want to do it.
5284000	5290000	Yeah. It was just like, yeah, I'll lecture to you, Sharma, but I don't want to talk to you about this because there's no conversation to be had.
5290000	5291000	Yeah.
5291000	5299000	Yeah. And that's one thing that we do in the book. We talk about, you know, we talk about things, cancellations related to COVID. We talk about journalism, publishing.
5299000	5304000	We talk about corporations, because to make the point that this is really, you know, escaped the lab.
5304000	5322000	And fire, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, where I'm CEO, we change from being the Foundation for Individual Rights in education focused overwhelmingly on higher ed to expression in just last year because the situation has gotten so bad off campus as well.
5322000	5323000	Yeah.
5323000	5333000	Can people who work in a corporation or at a university stand up and say, I'm not doing the DEI training? That's pretty risky to lose their job, right?
5333000	5350000	If you're in a private corporation, it's especially risky because they probably can, you know, fire you for that. However, if you're in a university setting, and you say that I'm not attending this, there's a very particularly given the way some of these are formed,
5350000	5364000	there's a very strong compelled speech argument, because a lot of times what they don't just want you to come to this thing, they want you to confess your evil or your oppression, which brings up serious issues of conscience and compelled speech.
5364000	5385000	So one thing that fire is challenging right now, and I love this about fire, we fought and defeated the Stop Woke Act. We're also suing in California going after this absolutely outrageous DEI policy that they have that requires professors no matter what they teach to work in ideas like intersectionality,
5385000	5398000	anti-racism, all of the approved DEI type stuff into their classes. And it's like, and I watch some people kind of explode on threads, for example, where I am, you know, someone yelled in a response,
5398000	5420000	read a book looking out off and I'm like, I have friends. But the, and I have to point out, listen, if you understood why it was a threat in the Stop Woke Act, this is actually even worse. This is telling professors what they must to say, and it makes it basically categorically eliminates the possibility that you come out and say, oh, by the way, I actually think some of this is BS.
5420000	5427000	It's actually requiring you to have a point of view on some of these topics. So we're suing it in court there.
5427000	5437000	So the constitutional legal precedence on that goes back to the saying of the Pledge of Allegiance for some Jehovah Witnesses, right?
5437000	5444000	Yes, 1943, very good. Yeah, the Barnett case, which is probably my all-time favorite Supreme Court decision.
5444000	5446000	You can't make people say things.
5446000	5457000	And it's something that, and I say this, as bad as it is to tell people what they can't say, it's even worse to tell them what they must say and downright totalitarian to tell them what they have to say.
5457000	5469000	And that would apply to public schools, right? I mean, if I go to a Christian school and I want a Christian education and I'm supposed to believe in Jesus, you know, they have a right to not hire me, Michael Schirmer, the atheist, right?
5470000	5481000	It depends on what they promise. You know, like, we definitely do recognize that, like, particularly like a public, like a private Christian college, if it wants to not promise freedom of speech or academic freedom,
5481000	5490000	they have the right to do that. We'll list them as a school. We call them warning schools. But what we mean by that is, like, well, if you want freedom of speech, it's not actually promised by these schools.
5490000	5498000	So just be warned. That doesn't necessarily mean the environment there is terrible for free speech, but it could be. And they can do that.
5498000	5509000	But what's interesting is a lot of these nominally religious schools have profoundly, you know, strong commitments to freedom of speech in their policies, like Georgetown.
5509000	5517000	And I almost wonder if Georgetown should just eliminate them because they were third from last in our most recent free speech rankings because they...
5518000	5526000	And it's not like they're firing people for being contradicting Catholic teaching, although they are punishing students for that to some degree.
5526000	5539000	In a lot of cases, you know, like going after Ilya Shapiro is because he made the left mad because he talked about how he was critical of Joe Biden's decision to say that he's going to hire a black woman to be the next Supreme Court.
5539000	5547000	And something like 59% or some percentage of the American public was like, yeah, that wasn't appropriate. The person's always going to be...
5547000	5552000	It makes it seem like whoever gets the job didn't get it on the basis of merit.
5552000	5560000	Well, there you can just apply a Rawlsian original position where you don't know what the person's skin color or gender is.
5560000	5572000	And therefore you wouldn't want a rule that says I can hire a nominated Supreme Court justice who is X-Race and Y-Gender because everybody will know that in principle that can't be right.
5572000	5574000	Yeah, I agree.
5574000	5582000	But if you fill it in with the correct race and gender, correct for the wrongs of the past, I guess that's what's really going on.
5582000	5585000	But I do apologize because I actually also have to go.
5585000	5588000	Yeah, you've got to go too. Okay, yeah, I'll let you go. All right, Greg. Yeah, no worries. I know you guys are busy. Thanks so much.
5588000	5599000	Always a pleasure, Michael. And everyone should know that Michael also appears in the book talking about some of the stuff that's been going on with Scientific American, which breaks my heart as well as a former subscriber.
5599000	5601000	All right. Take care.
