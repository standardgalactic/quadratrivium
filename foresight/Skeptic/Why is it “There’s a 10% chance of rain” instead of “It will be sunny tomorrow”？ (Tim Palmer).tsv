0	3740	Hello everyone, it's Michael Schirmer and it's time for another episode of the Michael
3740	4740	Schirmer Show.
4740	11220	This one is brought to you by Wondrium, a series of college-level audio and video courses and
11220	16740	documentary films and series produced and distributed by The Teaching Company.
16740	23020	Wondrium brings you engaging educational content through short-form videos, long-form courses,
23020	29060	my favorites, tutorials, how-to lessons, travelogues, documentaries, and more covering every topic
29060	34380	you've ever wondered about, and many, many more you've never even thought you'd wonder
34380	35380	about.
35380	39500	For example, here's one I'm going to take this week.
39500	43980	Again, the app is right on the phone, you just tap it, open it up, and they give you
43980	48860	a whole series of courses and tutorials and films and things you can watch or listen to.
48860	52980	This one's called The U.S. Constitution Through History.
52980	59860	This is 24 30-minute lectures, which I always listen to at 1.2 or 1.3 speed, depending on
59860	70500	the lecture, America's founding ideas, failures of early American governments, dilemma, dilemmas
70500	76420	of the Constitutional Convention, ratification of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the
76420	82700	first federalist power, first federal powers, Hamilton's Bank, and this goes on and I'm
82700	85660	not going to read all 24 of these, but you get the idea.
85660	90020	Nice thing about these, you start a lecture and it remembers where you're located in the
90020	95660	lecture, such that if you stop and come back, it's right there, or if you skip into another
95660	101820	lecture, maybe you even change courses, literally, and then you come back to this course, it
101820	104020	picks up right where you left off.
104020	112340	So check it out, go to Wondrium.com slash Shermer to get 50% off the first three months
112340	113340	of Wondrium.

134540	136420	It's a great way to spend your time.
136420	145020	All right, this one is brought to you by Wren, W-R-E-N, Wren, Wren is a startup that's making
145020	151980	it easy for all of us to work toward making a difference in the coming climate crisis.
151980	155660	I don't think it's an existential crisis, as you've heard me say here, I think it's
155660	160900	the kind of problem that we can solve in the long run if we all do just a little bit of
161060	163780	changes in our actions.
163780	168860	And here with Wren, they're not talking about, you should use less carbon, make a lower carbon
168860	169860	footprint.
169860	174060	No, they will calculate for you what your carbon footprint is, information you give them,
174060	177380	obviously, and then they will plant trees.
177380	182460	And in your name, to counter, well, you get involved in all this, but they plant the trees
182460	190420	for you and do other things that help sequester CO2 gases and in the long run, lower the average
190420	191860	global temperature.
191860	195660	In the long run, again, not, no, there's a collective action problem, no one of us can
195660	200220	make a difference, much of a difference at all, but collectively, if enough of us do
200220	204540	it, and particularly if we get momentum, then we can make a change.
204540	210100	And again, I think in the coming years, decades, centuries, it'll be fine.
210100	211300	We will recover from this.
211300	217820	We will solve this problem just like we did the ozone, hole in the ozone problem.
217820	223260	And we did that through collective action against that, and that's what Wren wants you
223260	224260	to do.
224260	225500	So, here's the deal.
225500	233780	If you go to Wren.co slash Shermer, W-R-E-N dot CO slash Shermer, they will plant 10 extra
233780	235020	trees in your name.
235020	236020	That's pretty cool.
236020	237020	I did it.
237020	238020	I think it's cool.
238020	240540	I calculated my carbon footprint and so on.
240540	243460	And if enough of us do it, it will make a difference.
243460	244460	So check it out.
244460	250980	That's W-R-E-N dot CO slash Shermer, Wren.co slash Shermer, and you'll be on your way.
250980	251980	It's a cool thing.
251980	252980	Check it out.
252980	255140	Thank you to that company for supporting this podcast.
255140	259700	As you know, we don't have a lot of advertisers on here, and I would only have people that
259700	263780	are doing something that we support and that I personally support.
263780	264780	Thanks for listening.
264780	265940	Here's our episode.
265940	269420	My guest today is Tim Palmer.
269420	274660	He is a Royal Society Research Professor in the Department of Physics at the University
274660	275660	of Oxford.
275660	281540	He pioneered the development of operational ensemble weather and climate forecasting,
281540	286540	and in 2007, he was formally recognized as having contributed to the Intergovernmental
286540	290660	Panel on Climate Changes Nobel Peace Prize.
290660	295340	Palmer is a commander of the British Empire, a CBE, which is pretty cool, and a fellow
295340	300980	of the Royal Society, FRS, and the National Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the
300980	303620	Institute of Physics, Dirac Gold Medal.
303620	305220	He lives near Oxford.
305220	306740	Tim, nice to see you.
306740	308220	Thanks for coming on the show.
308220	309220	Hi.
309220	310220	Thank you.
310220	311220	Great pleasure.
311220	314020	You can imagine, I love the title of your book.
314020	318420	This is the book we're discussing today, The Primacy of Doubt, given in as much as that
318420	323980	I publish a magazine called Skeptic, and might as well be called Doubt.
323980	327860	The subtitle is From Quantum Physics to Climate Change, How the Science of Uncertainty Can
327860	330340	Help Us Understand Our Chaotic World.
330340	334660	We'll be releasing this conversation the week this book comes out, so congratulations.
334660	335660	I love the book.
335660	338420	It was a really fun, interesting read, well-written.
338420	342420	Anybody can understand it, even though there's some technical science in it, but that's a
342420	346060	sign of good science writing, in my opinion.
346060	352260	Let me just open with the epigrams here you have from Richard Feynman, in which you write
352340	357500	quoting him, our freedom to doubt was born of a struggle against authority in the early
357500	358700	days of science.
358700	362100	It was a very deep and strong struggle.
362100	364300	Permit us to question, to doubt.
364300	367340	That's all, not to be sure.
367340	371980	So I'd gathered Feynman as something of a role model for you, or hero, or just somebody
371980	373780	to admire.
373780	375280	Absolutely.
375280	379980	I mean, Feynman's a role model, I think, for pretty much any physicist.
380020	385540	My background was in physics and theoretical physics, so he figured very strongly in my
385540	388940	education.
388940	395940	Maybe I could add the second quote in that thing, which is that the actual phrase, the
396460	403460	primacy of doubt, came from a quote by James Glick, who did a wonderful biography of Feynman.
404660	408500	And Glick says, yeah, he believed in the prime, he, Feynman, believed in the primacy
408500	415180	of doubt, not as a blemish on our ability to know, but as the essence of knowing.
415180	422180	And I kind of find that a very kind of profound statement that, you know, what characterizes
422180	428460	us humans and our knowledge and our ability to think and reason and so on, is intimately
428460	432940	connected to the fact that we are infallible, we make mistakes, you know, we're not computers
432940	437820	that just run the same old programs over and over again, getting the same answers.
437820	442060	So there's something profound about the human condition and the notion of uncertainty or
442060	443860	doubt.
443860	446900	I want to spend some time on that, but first I'm going to do a slight detour from your
446900	452300	first page of your author's note to give some biographical background, and then I'm going
452300	457860	to segue into how you ended up doing what you're doing as an example of chance and contingency
457860	461260	in how lives turn out, so you'll see where I'm going with this.
461260	465820	So here's a quote from you, I studied for a PhD in the 1970s researching Einstein's theory
465820	470940	of general relativity, Einstein had become a hero of mine by the time I was a teenager.
470940	476700	I was lucky, the 1970s were considered have been a golden age for general relativity theory.
476700	481500	At the first scientific conference I ever attended in 1974, I literally heard Stephen
481500	486220	Hawking, he hadn't lost his voice, announced his most important and famous result that
486220	490500	black holes aren't truly black, but radiate quantum particles.
490500	492980	That's Hawking radiation, right?
492980	496340	Well first of all, what was that, what was that, well let me continue because you end
496340	499180	up with a great story here.
499180	505380	My research supervisor Dennis Siamma, Hawking's PhD supervisor some years earlier was ecstatic
505380	506380	about this result.
506380	511020	Siamma was optimistic that we were on the verge of understanding how to unify Einstein's
511020	515300	theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics, the theory that successfully describes
515300	517820	atoms and elementary particles.
517820	521820	There were problems however, one problem which frustrated Siamma was that Hawking's calculations
521820	526740	were a little arcane, Siamma was convinced that there must be a more physically transparent
526740	529260	way of deriving such an important result.
529260	533260	He started to look at alternative ideas based on concepts from a field of physics called
533260	535260	non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
535260	540900	Siamma asked me to look at what is called the principle of maximum entropy production,
540900	542380	something I hadn't heard at the time.
542380	546860	Toward the end of my PhD research I had become an expert on black holes and was successful
546860	550780	in securing a postdoctoral position in Hawking's group at Cambridge.
550780	554500	All seems set for a career as a theoretical gravitational physicist.
554500	557380	Indeed, why would you want to do anything else?
557380	562020	I mean you're at the peak there and yet you ended up doing something completely different.
562020	570020	Yeah, it's a good question and I often, well actually I don't often but people often
570020	576540	say to me, what would your career have been like had you stayed?
576540	579820	I think there were two things.
579820	590900	One is that, let me tell you a story, I used to very frequently, parties and Oxford people
590900	595420	would ask me, some really attractive young lady would come up and ask me what I would
595420	601780	do and I would say black holes and she'd go, wow that's fantastic, wow that's incredible,
601780	603580	black holes, wow that's incredible.
603580	606820	Just tell me a bit more about what you do.
606820	614620	So okay, so you want to know a bit more detail, well I research into gravitational energy
614620	622980	momentum from black holes and how I'm looking for mathematical solutions for the quasi-locality
622980	628100	problem which involves looking at tenses over the tangent bundle to phase space and mappings
628100	629100	down onto space.
629140	636900	Anyway, so I've got half of these sentences and you can see starting to lose, very rapidly
636900	638620	lose interest.
638620	648460	So the point is that when you're doing research you're really doing kind of nitty gritty mathematical
648460	654620	details on probably kind of really infinitesimally small parts of a theory and at some stage
654660	661860	you ask yourself, well am I going to crack the really big problem with what I'm doing?
661860	670420	Because after all what I'm doing affects nobody, it's not really of any great service to humankind,
670420	675020	I'm doing this just for the sort of hell of it if you like to, I mean some sense advanced
675020	680140	physics, so I bet advanced physics in a pretty fundamental way I guess was my thinking and
680140	684900	the more I thought about what I was doing at a very, very detailed technical level I
684900	692700	was kind of decided, I was just making small inroads into a very big problem that I wasn't
692700	698660	likely to solve and the big problem which is actually still a problem to this day is
698660	702860	how to reconcile quantum mechanics and gravitation.
702860	710100	It sounds fascinating but unless you have some very specific ideas, you're either going
710140	716060	following along dotting eyes and crossing T's from some other person's work or you have
716060	720060	your own idea about how to make progress and at the time I didn't have any great ideas
720060	725180	so I got more and more thinking well maybe I should spend most of my career at least
725180	732260	doing stuff that is more relevant and hopefully useful to my fellow human beings and that
732260	737020	kind of led me ultimately to my, I have to say my parents dismay, I mean they obviously
737060	743020	wanted me to go to Cambridge and work with Hawking and so on but in the end I decided
743020	748820	to do something different and all I could say is it's worked out really well.
748820	754660	I actually continue to kind of, you know in the what spare time I have I continue to probe
754660	759180	some of these issues about quantum mechanics but fundamentally most of my kind of active
759180	764380	career has been much more in the climate and weather science which I, you know, I believe
764380	772540	I have made some impacts on how we perceive weather and climate so I think it's been a
772540	778020	good decision but of course it's a counterfactual to know what the alternative would have been
778020	782820	like but my gut feeling is it wouldn't have been as good.
782820	783820	Interesting, yeah.
783820	789780	So give us some sense of before we dive into all that research, what was it like to work
789820	790820	with Stephen Hawking?
790820	796140	What was he like as a person and how did you work as his condition worsened?
796140	804180	Well, no, I mean Stephen, Stephen was in Cambridge and my, my Dennis Sharma who, who
804180	809980	supervised me with, with Stephen's supervisor was based in Oxford.
809980	814380	Dennis had been in Cambridge so when he supervised Stephen as a PhD student he was in Cambridge
814380	818100	but he moved to Oxford in the early 70s.
818100	827260	So my biggest two influences were Dennis Sharma himself but also Roger Penrose who, who had
827260	833620	moved again fairly very recently from Birkbeck College in London to Oxford to the Mathematics
833620	841220	Institute in Oxford in the early 70s and I mean Roger was a phenomenal person, well still
841220	845300	is of course, he's won a Nobel Prize a couple of years ago and still very active in his
845300	853220	90s but he was, you know, he was a kind of Richard Feynman of general relativity.
853220	859020	So as, as Richard Feynman is to high energy particle physics, so Roger Penrose is to and
859020	864220	certainly was in those days to general relativity and in particular black hole physics and
864220	866500	all that sort of stuff.
866500	872580	And I have to say I, I kind of probably, you know, some of my skepticism about traditional
872580	877700	quantum mechanics and quantum field theory and stuff like that which goes into standard
877700	884180	particle physics probably came from interacting with Roger Penrose in those days, Roger, Roger.
884180	890260	Roger's carried on the, I guess Roger's carried on the tradition from Einstein if you like
890260	895060	of being somewhat skeptical about quantum mechanics even though experimentally it seems
895060	897820	to be a very accurate theory.
897820	905180	So I didn't have much interaction with Stephen during my PhD, I met him a few times.
905180	912740	Of course, you know, soon after I heard him speak, I mean he was, it was difficult, you
912740	918180	know, he'd already almost lost his voice when he gave that talk in the conference I went
918180	923740	to but he hadn't quite lost it but he was, you know, it was difficult to, you know, his
923740	928260	speaking was difficult so it was difficult to understand him and it became increasingly
928260	930700	difficult to communicate with him.
930700	937780	So I would say my, you know, the communications I had with Stephen were pretty limited, unfortunately.
937780	941820	But you know, if I had gone to Cambridge they would have obviously improved but that didn't
941820	942820	happen.
942820	943820	Yeah.
943820	949220	Yeah, just, just because I'm curious, what's the problem to be solved?
949220	954380	Why does quantum physics need to be righted with general relativity, why can't there just
954380	960580	be two different physics for two different levels and just leave it at that?
960580	967660	Well, because we think there is a domain where the two will overlap.
967660	976260	So for example, we can currently send, I mean the sort of iconic experiment that demonstrates
976260	981220	the quantum nature of particles is what's called the two slit experiment.
981220	987780	So the two slit experiment, you know, was originally done for light, you know, beams
987780	992260	of light in the, in the 19th century by Thomas Young.
992260	995660	So you take a beam of light and you pass it through two slits and you get this kind of
995660	1003060	funny, what's called diffraction pattern in a screen behind the two slits where you get
1003060	1008180	regions of the screen which are very light and then other regions which are dark.
1008180	1013260	And the explanation is when you have light waves, the waves are kind of interfering to
1013260	1017980	create, to create regions of darkness.
1017980	1023140	Now the extraordinary thing is that if you, if you, so in the 20th century it was realized
1023140	1029300	you could send particles of light through one at a time, these are photons.
1029300	1036380	And again, the pattern, you send them through these two slits and this pattern of light and
1036380	1042900	dark kind of emerges even though the particles go through this one slit or the other, you
1042900	1043900	know, one at a time.
1043900	1048340	So it's a real mystery to know how, even to this day, it's still a mystery as to why
1048340	1051500	this interference pattern builds up.
1051500	1053020	But that's a quantum phenomenon.
1053020	1057020	Now over the years people have sent heavier and heavier particles.
1057060	1063700	So photons, yes, do that, do it with electrons, then you can do it with individual atoms.
1063700	1068780	And now people even talking about, you know, sending little sort of bacteria through slits
1068780	1071060	and getting interference patterns.
1071060	1077220	So then the question arises, what happens when you send particles that are so massive
1077220	1082140	that you can detect their gravitation, their own self gravitation?
1082140	1089700	And this is something we can't quite do yet experimentally, but we'll soon be able to,
1089700	1091180	I think, in a matter of years.
1091180	1098180	And it's really an important question as to whether sort of particles whose gravity you
1098180	1103820	can detect will still show this interference phenomenon or not.
1103820	1110700	So whether it does or it doesn't means that, you know, for what it's worth, my betting
1110700	1116460	is that once you detect the gravitation of a particle, you won't see this interference
1116460	1117460	effect.
1117460	1120100	But, you know, other people will say otherwise.
1120100	1127500	But basically that is testing a kind of a regime in physics where both quantum mechanics
1127500	1132180	and gravity are simultaneously important.
1132180	1135500	And so we kind of, we need a theory to describe that situation.
1135500	1139740	What the theory is, as I say, is open for grabs.
1139780	1144860	And then, you know, in the whole kind of nature in a more esoteric way, the nature of the
1144860	1150740	say the big bang, the beginning of the universe, and what goes on in the center of black holes
1150740	1157980	is, you know, it will be impossible to properly understand without having this combined understanding
1157980	1162540	of gravity and quantum mechanics in a single theory together.
1162540	1168980	So there are good reasons why we need this, but, you know, it's been, it is absolutely
1169020	1171780	the holy grail in theoretical physics.
1171780	1176420	And as I say, my supervisor, when Hawking announced his result, he thought, oh, well,
1176420	1178580	we'll solve this problem within two or three years.
1178940	1184260	But, you know, over, well, 50 years later, basically, we're still struggling.
1184780	1187740	And the solutions, and still I don't think in sight, either.
1189260	1193460	I'm not sure if this is applicable, but jumping ahead to your chapter on consciousness, you
1193460	1197500	discussed Roger Enrose and Stuart Hameroff's theory of consciousness.
1197500	1202140	And I should note, parenthetically, there's like 27 different theories that are floating
1202140	1202820	around out there.
1202820	1206060	So I think we're a long ways from any one of them being obviously right.
1206900	1212540	But there, you know, their idea that inside neurons are these little microtubules that
1212540	1214580	are like scaffolding that hold the cell together.
1214900	1220220	And inside the microtubules, there is these little quantum effects that can be measured
1220660	1226860	and that their idea is that if I get this straight, there's kind of a correlation between
1226860	1233500	the neurons in a brain that the wave function is collapsing in some kind of synchronized
1233500	1239380	way and out of that, you will get this kind of consciousness, whatever we mean by that,
1239900	1244460	you know, sort of aware of being aware of being aware in some level, something like that.
1244820	1249580	But then the counter to that when that first came out was that, well, those quantum effects
1249820	1254700	apply at the subatomic level, but neurons fire it at a molecular size level.
1254700	1259580	These are, you know, massive, you know, chemical molecules going between these neurons and
1259580	1265100	these synaptic gaps and operating like a lock and key molecules and so on, and that that
1265100	1266260	would wash out that.
1266260	1270660	Now, last time I talked to Stuart about this, he said, no, no, there's quantum effects at
1270660	1272060	the macro level now and so on.
1272060	1277260	And I haven't followed closely that research, but so kind of walk us through some of that.
1278100	1285420	Well, I mean, I think you're right to say that this is still a very uncertain area of
1285420	1292180	science, both from, you know, physically, exactly how quantum mechanics operates in
1292180	1293180	the brain.
1293180	1300980	And secondly, whether quantum processes are fundamental for consciousness, I personally,
1301820	1308500	well, personally, I do think quantum processes are important in the brain.
1308500	1310860	I'll give you an example of this in just a second.
1311140	1318900	But I also do, I'm inclined to Penrose's view, you know, because his ideas about
1318900	1325060	consciousness were very much motivated by the question of whether computers, you know,
1325060	1330100	can understand things, really understand things in the way we understand things.
1331100	1336900	And I still think, you know, the example he used in his, his original book, The Emperor's
1336900	1343140	New Mind, of what's called Gerdl's theorem, which basically says there are aspects of
1343140	1347740	mathematics that, you know, can't be described with algorithms.
1347940	1352420	So, you know, there are truth, there are things that are true, but are not provably true
1352420	1353580	with a with an algorithm.
1354180	1358620	Now, a computer by definition is something that works using an algorithm.
1359300	1367620	So a computer by definition cannot understand this, this kind of notion of Gerdl's theorem.
1368340	1370620	Whereas we humans can understand it.
1370620	1374700	I mean, if you read, you know, if you read through it, you can follow each step and you
1374700	1377100	say, OK, yeah, I get, I get all that.
1378380	1383660	So his, so Penrose's point is to say, well, if that's true, there must be something that
1383660	1389740	the human brain is doing, which is not like just an algorithm that a computer runs on.
1390860	1395420	So I find that actually, all those, I know some people are not convinced, but I find
1395420	1399300	that a fairly sort of powerful, generic kind of idea.
1399980	1408260	Now, I've, I was, I mean, one of, one of the things which has interested me over the years,
1409020	1413620	because I use in my professional climate work, I use computers a lot and really, really
1413620	1417460	big computers, like the biggest computers that there are in the world.
1418060	1425260	And in fact, I, I, you know, I, I, I spent a lot of my time advocating for the fact that
1425260	1429260	in climate science, we need even bigger computers than when we can get at the moment.
1429260	1432900	If we really want to get down to the nitty gritty of climate change, we need much bigger
1432900	1435660	computers or access to much bigger computers.
1436340	1443020	But there's a really interesting kind of anomaly between the human brain and, and a
1443020	1447500	computer, which is that computers are unbelievably energy intensive.
1448180	1456420	So these computers, you know, which do all these calculations are consuming tens of megawatts
1456460	1457100	of power.
1457900	1462420	And most of that power is actually used to move data around from one bit of a computer
1462420	1462940	to another.
1463820	1468940	Now, in the human brain, we actually, I mean, the optical, you know, the optical nerves
1468940	1475820	are actually transporting pretty much as much data into the brain as a big supercomputer
1475820	1476780	moves around.
1477660	1483300	And it processes all that data from the outside world, you know, tries to make sense of, of
1483340	1484820	what we perceive and so on.
1485460	1487700	But it does it all on 20 watts.
1487740	1491260	So six orders of magnitude less than a, than a computer does.
1491660	1493060	So supercomputer.
1493340	1498380	So I think that's a kind of, I mean, I, you know, I'm totally convinced that, you know,
1498380	1504060	there are some big clues in that, that, you know, trying to just emulate the brain on a
1504060	1509420	supercomputer is kind of missing the point, which is that it does it on 20 watts on a light bulb,
1509420	1511260	what a light bulb takes to, to light.
1512060	1518500	Now, so I've been certainly interested in trying to understand why the brain does what it
1518500	1520820	does on such a low amount of, of energy.
1521100	1527500	And I came across a really interesting paper by some physicists and neuroscientists from
1529140	1529700	Austria.
1531540	1535540	Gustav Bernreider is one of them, who's somebody I've met a couple of times now.
1537060	1543340	And what they have realized is that to, you talk about new neurons and sending signals
1543380	1546860	along these axons of neurons.
1546860	1549260	So these long sort of wires, if you like.
1550100	1556220	Now, the point is that the signals have to be boosted every, every short distance, because
1556220	1559500	otherwise they would just dissipate in the sort of noisy environment.
1560100	1563660	And they do that with kind of what you might call protein transistors.
1564340	1568540	You know, that's the analogy of a transistor amplifying a signal, but it's done with these,
1570500	1581220	with these, well, what are basically ion channels, so electrically charged atoms or yes, are fed
1581220	1589100	through the walls of neurons in a controlled way, which boosts the signal that propagates
1589100	1589780	along the neuron.
1590420	1597820	Now, what these scientists have realized is that if you did this, if you, if these protein
1597820	1604140	transistors were acting purely in a classical way, so non quantum way, the amount of energy
1604140	1610740	you would need to, to do the signal boosting would just be more than is available by, by
1610740	1611300	a long way.
1611980	1617820	And what they have realized is that it's actually a very quantum mechanical process, which allows
1617820	1620540	these protein transistors to operate.
1621420	1627820	So here, quantum mechanics is acting in a way to reduce the energy demand on the brain.
1627820	1633700	So it's one of the, and there may well be other examples of how quantum mechanics allows
1633700	1638740	the brain to do things which at a classical level would be impossible or just take too
1638740	1639460	much energy.
1640740	1646100	Now, I don't know whether, you know, Stuart Hammerhoff and Roger Penrose's microtubules
1646100	1650820	would actually come under that category that they're from an energetic point of view, they're
1650820	1655940	something where quantum physics can do things much more energetically efficiently than classical
1655940	1656300	physics.
1656700	1662980	But certainly this whole area of neuron propagation, I think, is a great example of where quantum
1662980	1667580	mechanics can step in and say, I can do this much cheaper than you could ever do with classical
1667580	1668180	physics.
1669620	1675220	And this has got to be surely a kind of an important message for, you know, building
1675220	1682660	computers which make much more efficient use of energy, which at the moment we don't, we
1682660	1683180	don't do.
1683700	1688580	So, so yeah, so there's lots of uncertainties here, but I do think, you know, that's an example
1688580	1693540	of where quantum mechanics probably does play a really important role in the brain.
1693580	1700420	And, and I think, I mean, this is another issue, but I do think the whole, I mean, it's
1700420	1703980	something I discuss in the book, you may not, we may not want to go into details now, but
1703980	1710420	the whole question of free will and consciousness, I think it actually is bound up with the role
1710460	1712420	that quantum mechanics plays in the brain.
1713300	1715460	Well, we can get into it because this is super interesting stuff.
1715460	1720180	I've had most of the big consciousness people on the show, Matthew Cobb and Christoph
1720220	1727100	Koch and Neil Seth and Jeffrey Goff and John Joe McThadden, you know, they've all, you know,
1727100	1728260	presented their ideas.
1728740	1733380	I guess my one beef I have is that this often turns on language.
1734380	1739660	My favorite science cartoon is Sydney Harris's cartoon with the two mathematicians at the
1739660	1744260	chalkboard and with the complex equations and then in the middle, he says, and then a
1744260	1745140	miracle happens.
1745140	1749660	And the other one says, I think you need to be more explicit here in step two, often feel
1749660	1753580	like, you know, right, you know, and then and then the microtubules and the wave function
1753580	1760300	and then consciousness or and then, you know, the the the waves, the kind of electromagnetic
1760300	1764860	waves that the EEG is picking up and then consciousness to me, it often feels like and
1764860	1769740	then a miracle or emergence, you know, complexity theory, emergence and then emergence happens
1769740	1772820	and consciousness to me, it often feels like and then a miracle happened.
1774500	1776260	Right, right, right.
1776300	1777420	Well, I understand that.
1777420	1786460	And well, OK, so, I mean, I discuss consciousness a little bit, and I'll give you my definition
1786460	1788220	of consciousness in a second.
1788220	1794060	But let me precede it with saying something about free will.
1796020	1804300	And I I've got interest, I mean, I'm interested in free will because it appears
1805300	1811980	I say appears because there's some controversy about this.
1811980	1816820	But in in standard, so so I need to backtrack.
1816820	1827980	So in the book, I discuss a lot about whether the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics,
1828580	1834060	you know, which anyone who knows anything about quantum mechanics knows this thing called
1834060	1841140	the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which is really, really difficult to understand.
1841180	1848460	Because normally, when we think about uncertainty, for example, in weather forecasting, as an
1848460	1855180	example of, you know, of a chaotic system, and a chaotic system is one where, you know,
1855180	1861460	very small uncertainties in the initial conditions for a weather forecast can can lead to a very
1861460	1863820	different prediction of weather.
1865380	1869780	So, you know, you we could say that we are uncertain about what the weather's going to
1869780	1876860	be like in a couple of weeks time, because we humans don't have perfect knowledge of
1876860	1881460	today's weather, we can't like measure it absolutely everywhere, all the little worlds
1881460	1882580	and eddies and so on.
1883580	1890580	So uncertainty is in those in that context, and in most context in which people use the
1890580	1897380	word kind of reflects what would be called a kind of epistemic uncertainty, in other
1897380	1905180	words, an uncertainty that that we have about the system we're trying to predict or understand.
1906260	1913300	The problem is in quantum mechanics, and I have to say Heisenberg himself, when he wrote
1913300	1920540	some of his first kind of expository articles about the uncertainty principle, he actually
1920540	1927020	tried to explain it in those terms, it's sort of we can't kind of measure stuff arbitrary
1927020	1928020	accurately.
1928020	1932540	And Niels Bohr, who was the, you know, one of the great grandfathers pioneers of quantum
1932540	1936620	mechanics, you know, took Heisenberg to task, he said, No, this is not right.
1938140	1940900	Whatever uncertainty is in quantum mechanics is different.
1940900	1945540	It's, it's, you know, the word philosophers would use is ontological.
1945540	1950900	There's something inherently uncertain in the equations of quantum mechanics.
1952340	1961540	So that's the standard, that's the standard view, which personally, I, I don't actually
1961540	1964620	believe, but that's a very controversial view.
1964940	1971660	So yeah, yeah, so I go into quite a lot in, in the book about, so what, what is the, you
1971660	1978980	know, if you had to say one reason why people don't think that uncertainty is epistemic and
1978980	1984860	is more ontological, they would probably cite something called Bell's theorem, Bell's inequality,
1984860	1990660	which is a kind of an experimental test, which seems to suggest that there is no kind of
1990660	1997740	definite, that quantum reality is not definite, it's something sort of indeterministic and
1997740	2002620	sort of, I don't know, it's difficult to use words actually here because it, it doesn't kind
2002620	2006500	of, it doesn't match with anything that we sort of understand.
2007740	2012380	So in the book, in my book, I go into Bell's theorem quite a bit.
2012380	2018820	Now Bell's theorem, as it's usually phrased, so I'm coming around to your question, Bell's
2018820	2023820	theorem as it's usually phrased involves the issue of free will.
2024180	2032260	So in Bell's theorem, you imagine experimenters who measure, you know, they just do simple
2032260	2035100	measurements on particles, like measuring their spin.
2036620	2043780	But an important ingredient in Bell's theorem is that although an experimenter actually
2043780	2049940	measured the spin of a particle in a certain direction or with the apparatus oriented in
2049940	2055700	a certain way, they could have measured the spin in a different way.
2056380	2061660	So in other words, the standard way in which Bell's theorem, which seems to suggest quantum
2061660	2068900	uncertainty is, is ontological, requires this notion of, well, it requires this notion of
2068900	2075420	counterfactual worlds, where the experimenter did other than what they actually did.
2076420	2086620	And I have been using ideas from chaos theory, and in particular, the mathematics of the
2086620	2088140	geometry of chaos.
2088140	2094620	So underpinning chaos is this wonderful, wonderfully beautiful, fantastically, just incredible
2095580	2096780	fractal geometry.
2097980	2099780	And fractals have gaps.
2099820	2102860	So if you look at a fractal, it's always got little gaps.
2103140	2107180	And the gaps, you know, you zoom in, and there are gaps within the gaps and the gaps and so on,
2107180	2109980	they get smaller and smaller, but they're always there.
2111220	2119380	And my claim is that some of these crucial counterfactual experiments correspond to points
2119380	2121260	that lie in the gaps in these fractals.
2121260	2127140	So in your, if your theory is based on these fractals, then these, these counterfactual
2127140	2135620	experiments would actually be disallowed by, by this theory.
2136260	2141820	And so this, this actually provides a way of getting around this, this Bell's theorem.
2142820	2148260	However, so we're coming to your point now, the point people say, well, yeah, but you know, I do
2148260	2152860	have free will, I could have done this experiment, you know, that's what was a typical kind of
2153060	2153580	reaction.
2154220	2159580	And so, you know, if it raises the question, well, first of all, raises the question, what is free
2159580	2164860	will, but a question which people don't ask very much, and there's something I've kind of
2164860	2175660	dwelt on in my book, is why do we, why do we humans feel so very viscerally, and kind of almost,
2175660	2181500	you know, will thump our fists on the table to assert this point that we have free will, what
2181500	2186060	is it that actually makes it such a, you know, I'm sure a computer doesn't have this feeling
2186060	2191740	of free will. So what is it that makes us feel we have free will. So this is where I think,
2193500	2199020	again, quantum mechanics in the brain could be playing a role. So this is my hypothesis that
2201100	2208780	see, because I, I do actually believe that ultimately, the laws of physics are deterministic.
2208780	2214220	So there are no, there's no kind of randomness in the, in the equations of physics, ultimately,
2214220	2222780	that things are deterministic. But you see, so the question is what distinguishes
2222780	2228380	quantum mechanics from ordinary classical mechanics. And this is where this idea of,
2229260	2235660	this is going to be sound a little bit, a little bit kind of weird, perhaps, but I can assure you
2235660	2240620	there is mathematics that will pin that will sort of back this up, that we don't want to go into it
2240620	2247740	now. But the idea is that these, the, I mentioned these kind of fractal attractors. The idea is
2247740	2259740	that quantum mechanics feels so it, you see, we can think of our world as the world evolving
2260700	2266860	that we perceive to be a particular sort of solution of the equations of physics.
2267900	2274620	But there are nearby solutions in some kind of more abstract solution space, if you like,
2275340	2281420	with slightly different initial conditions. And quantum mechanics kind of feels these
2281420	2288700	neighboring solutions in a way which classical physics doesn't. It kind of feels the geometry
2288700	2293660	of this fractal attractor, if you can sense, if you like, little neighborhoods of this geometry.
2295260	2303260	And my, my feeling is that what we think of as free will is a very sort of weak and imprecise
2303260	2312940	perception of these neighboring solutions, which we would interpret as worlds where we did otherwise.
2313740	2318060	So my belief is our really strong visceral feeling about free will comes from
2319100	2324300	this notion of sort of alternative solutions in this abstract solution space.
2325260	2329900	All right, so then I got thinking about, so I got to come to consciousness because that links to
2329900	2333500	consciousness. Okay, but Tim, let's, let's, let's halt for just a second, because there's a lot
2333500	2338540	of jargon on there I want to unpack. And this could be the core question for the entire book,
2338540	2344380	that that is to what extent is uncertainty built into the system itself, and is not just
2344380	2350380	a limitation of our knowledge. So the latter would be epistemic, the former would be ontological.
2350380	2358540	So here I have, from my coin collection in 1883, silver dollar, 18, yeah, 1883 silver dollar,
2358540	2364220	says in God we trust on there. So they've been putting that on the coins since the 1800s.
2364220	2370220	So if I flip the coin, and just do my little flip here, and, and okay, it's tails, all right,
2370220	2375820	so I flip it again, boom. And this time it's tails, so two in a row, and so I do this 10 times or 100
2375820	2382380	times. And so we know that I would, I would say, well, I got a 5050 chance because it's not a
2382380	2388300	rig coin. But that, that's only because I just don't know all the, all the particles and the wind
2388300	2394460	currents in my room here or whatever. Are you saying that if, if Laplace's demon was real,
2395020	2399580	or it was the equivalent of a magician that is doing a trick and so knows 100% what the outcome
2399580	2406220	is going to be, or, or God is, you know, knows his omniscient and tell, or is it that even with
2406220	2411260	the best all the knowledge we have, you would still cannot predict with 100% certainty the
2412220	2416380	flip of the coin because of something built into the physical system itself?
2419340	2429100	Well, okay, so what, if I, if I wear my, like, conventional physics hat, you know, if I, if you,
2429100	2436140	if you ask me that question, to me, a physicist, and I'm a representative of the,
2437100	2442780	you know, the conventional physics community, so I'm giving you the kind of conventional
2443980	2452220	answer, then I would say that in quantum mechanics, so if you were flipping, if you like an atom,
2452220	2456220	if you like or an electron or something, if you're doing the equivalent of this coin flip
2456220	2463500	to a quantum mechanical system, like an electron or an atom, then the uncertainty would not be
2463660	2473980	because you didn't know something about the atom. It, it, it, it, it would be because there is
2473980	2485420	something inherently uncertain and undeterministic about the equations for, for the quantum system.
2486780	2491820	So I have to be slightly technical, because when you, you, you, when you, you do two things,
2491820	2496940	when you do the equivalent of a coin flip to an atom, you flip the atom in some sense,
2496940	2500140	but then you have to look at it to measure, you actually have to see
2501980	2506300	whether it's kind of up or down, if you like heads or tails, quantum heads or quantum tails.
2507020	2514300	And the traditional view is that the actual process of looking to see whether it's up or down,
2515020	2521420	which is called measurement, introduces some inherently uncertain, indeterministic
2521420	2526540	kind of physics. So that's, that's the standard. So that is different to the epistemic uncertainty,
2526540	2532220	where it's just something about the coin that you don't know. Now Einstein famously
2533500	2538220	thought that was bunk, because he, his, his very famous statement, God does not play dice,
2538780	2546300	was exactly, you know, making the point that that's ridiculous. I mean, how can it be that
2546300	2551980	nature has indeterministic equations doesn't make sense to him. And of course, Schrodinger
2551980	2556060	thought it was nonsense as well. Schrodinger was with Heisenberg was one of the two founding
2556620	2562700	fathers for the basic laws of quantum mechanics that we now use every day in many different
2562700	2570220	areas of physics. And his famous cat is, is, is an example of that. So the cat, you know,
2570220	2577260	the cat's in the box, you have a little atom, which may or may not decay has a probability of
2577260	2585020	decaying. And again, quantum mechanically, you have to say, after say 10 minutes, there's
2585020	2592220	the, the atom is like half decayed and half not decayed in some weird sense. But the idea is if
2592220	2598940	the, if it has decayed, it breaks a capsule cyanide and kills the cat. So then you say, well,
2598940	2607500	what states the cat in? And the state of the cat is not just that you don't know whether the cat's
2607500	2611820	alive or dead, you open a box and you can see whether it's alive or dead. But quantum mechanics
2611820	2617900	says inside that box before you've looked at it, the cat is neither alive nor dead. There's some
2617900	2624060	inherent uncertainty about the aliveness or deadness of the cat. Now Schrodinger introduced
2624060	2629740	that example, not to say that cats are both alive and dead at the same time, but because
2629740	2635980	that's a completely daft idea. It's just stupid. And he wanted to really to make the point that
2635980	2640300	there's something wrong with quantum mechanics, even though he was one of the fathers of quantum
2640300	2647900	mechanics, he realized there was something wrong with it. And so in the book, I try to
2650780	2657420	develop ideas which might take us back. And I'm not in any way claiming I have a complete
2657420	2664220	theory. I have, I mean, I have, I have a theory to the extent that I have papers published in the
2664780	2668620	peer reviewed literature, and I certainly don't go into any technical details in the book.
2668620	2674700	But it's, I'm trying to show a path, if you like, where, which might take us back
2675580	2684940	towards a more kind of sensible, I suppose, theory of, of quantum physics where uncertainty
2684940	2690380	is again, epistemic. So the fact that we don't know whether the cat is alive or dead
2691260	2695660	is just because we don't know all the details about how that atom decayed. But sure enough,
2695660	2701660	inside the box, the cat would be alive or would be dead. So that's, that's, so that I'm just,
2701660	2707260	you know, I try to go and, and so it, you know, so that, and then that leads to the free will.
2707260	2711820	And then if we have a minute, we'll talk about consciousness. Yeah, let's stay on free will
2711820	2717660	for a minute, because it first, as you know, Dan Dennett argued that quantum uncertainty doesn't
2717660	2721180	give you free will because it just throws an element of randomness into the machine.
2721820	2727100	Absolutely, absolutely. So if you just add, that's a really important point. If you just say,
2728700	2731900	oh, you know, there's something indeterministic about quantum mechanics,
2731900	2736860	then it just, all that will do for you is that, you know, every time you're making a decision,
2736860	2741660	it's like, you know, just something random goes into your head. And that's what causes you to
2741660	2746540	make a decision. But that's clearly not how we make decisions most of the time. We think through
2746620	2753260	things and, you know, analyze things carefully. And free will is not, that's not what free will
2753260	2758860	is. So I totally agree with the Dennett on that point. It seems to turn very much on the question,
2758860	2763500	could you have done otherwise? So if we have these thought experiments, like, you know,
2763500	2768860	you rewound the tape and played it again. Well, if it's a read only memory tape, and everything
2768860	2773740	is just rerun exactly as it was, well, yeah, you'd have to do exactly what you did, because
2773820	2778380	it's just basically a movie of what happened. But so the question then seems to be,
2779020	2786940	if you could emulate the tape, say tomorrow, where it's pretty close to what happened yesterday,
2786940	2791660	could you have done otherwise? And so if I'm following you, I think you're saying you could,
2791660	2798380	because you, if you know, particularly if you know the causal factors operating on you, and you know
2798460	2805020	that yesterday this happened. And so tomorrow, I'm going to avoid going there or stepping left,
2805020	2809660	and I'll go right instead of left, or whatever, because you're aware of what happened. And the
2809660	2814300	universe can never be completely perfectly replicated from one day to the next. And last,
2814300	2820060	so here's a key question, the universe is predetermined. So this block universe idea, or there's a
2820060	2825500	God outside of it that knows every particle, and already knows what happened took next week,
2826060	2828700	just that we don't know. So take it from there.
2831820	2839340	Right. Well, I think you've absolutely hit the nail on the head by saying this whole thing hinges
2839340	2845660	around, you know, could we have done otherwise? So let's just, let's just, let's just analyze that
2845660	2854300	a little bit more carefully. So as you say, you know, you come out of a shop, and, you know,
2854300	2861100	there's a cyclist on the pavement, and the cyclist collides with you and, you know, you're
2861100	2866780	carted off to hospital with a broken leg or something. And you, you know, that that ruins
2866780	2871740	your life for the next year or so. And you say to yourself, Oh, if only I had looked,
2872380	2879100	you know, round, I would have seen that bicycle and I would have avoided it. So what you have to
2879180	2887020	do then is you go back to that moment, you're leaving the shop. And you're imagining a world
2888300	2894620	in which everything is the same, the bicycle is still, you know, the cyclist is just right
2894620	2900140	riding on the, did I use the word pavement, I have to be careful about British English here,
2900140	2905180	pavement means sidewalk, I think in America. So the cyclists on this on the sidewalk, yeah.
2905420	2910620	What we would call the pavement, which I think you shouldn't be there. First of all,
2910620	2915900	he shouldn't be there. That's the main point. He shouldn't have been there. But so anyway,
2915900	2921340	but the point is you wind the, you're lying in bed in hospital, and you're winding the
2921340	2926620	clock back to that moment, you left the shop, and you say, Okay, I'm going to keep everything in the
2926620	2933260	universe fixed. You know, the moons of Jupiter are where they are, the moon is where it is.
2933260	2939500	The cyclist is where he is. And everybody else is where he is. But I do still one small thing
2939500	2948780	differently. I look to my right, let's say. Now, what you're doing is clearly that isn't the real
2948780	2953340	world. That's not the real world. It's a hypothetical, what we call counterfactual world.
2954060	2961100	So the question to ask is, is that hypothetical world where everything is basically the same,
2961100	2968380	except for one small thing where you've moved your head to the right? Is that new hypothetical
2968380	2974700	world allowed by the laws of physics? Because if it's allowed by the laws of physics,
2974700	2982300	then you can, you know, you can, in principle, imagine then winding time forward again from
2982300	2989260	this slightly altered initial state. And you can, you know, rightly infer that you would have
2989260	2993580	avoided the cyclist, and therefore you wouldn't be in hospital and all the rest of it.
2994380	3003580	So, so the crucial question is, can we kind of fairly, let's say arbitrarily change
3004700	3011500	initial conditions, and still have states of the world which are consistent with the laws of physics?
3012540	3017500	Now, in my book, I give this, now you see, sorry, just before I come on to that point,
3017500	3028300	I just want to say in most kind of, in most examples in physics, that is possible. So a good
3028300	3033580	example is, you know, weather forecasting. We have, we use what are called classical laws of physics
3033580	3039340	for doing weather forecasting. And by classical laws, I mean like Newton's laws of motion
3040380	3045900	applied to fluids like the atmosphere, the atmosphere is the gas and the oceans are,
3045900	3055020	you know, liquids and so on. And according to those equations, we can change initial conditions
3055020	3061580	very slightly. And the equations don't care, actually, the equations will be quite happy
3061580	3070220	with that slightly altered initial condition. But in the book, I talk about how, and I mentioned
3070220	3081500	it just now, certain models of chaos can exhibit this fractal geometry in a kind of abstract
3082140	3087660	space of solutions, which may not be worth going, describing in too much detail here.
3090540	3096460	But if you take the view that this geometry is something sort of fundamental, then
3096460	3105580	actually, it can tell you that there are certain of these counterfactual states which
3105580	3114060	actually aren't consistent with the underlying laws. So in particular, if you have a state of
3114060	3120780	the world and you add a little, you change it very slightly, but that change takes you into one of
3120780	3126940	the gaps in the fractal, you know, places where there aren't any, where the fractal is doesn't
3126940	3132780	exist, if you like, a little gap. If we had a diagram I could show you, but people can look up,
3132780	3138300	you know, Cantor sets or Mandelbrot sets and they, they see, they can see these little gaps,
3138300	3143660	you know, there's always gaps. So if this counterfactual world takes you into a gap,
3143660	3153020	then you're no longer allowed to infer that that, you know, is an allowable state of, of the world.
3153980	3163500	Now, this may or may not happen at the level of, you know, of looking, of looking for bicycles on,
3163580	3172940	on, on, on pavements or sidewalks. But, but I do think it's relevant in asking questions
3172940	3180220	about measurements on quantum systems. If, if I measure, you know, if I measure the
3180940	3189340	position of a particle, could I also have measured the momentum of a particle and here,
3189340	3196460	you know, this idea of kind of gaps in solution space where you can't do these perturbations
3197020	3205660	arbitrarily. So, so in short, I'm not saying that all counterfactual worlds are impossible,
3205660	3212860	I'm not saying that, but I'm saying certainly in quantum mechanical situations, there may well be
3213820	3222060	counterfactual measurements on, on quantum systems, which actually are forbidden by the,
3222060	3229580	or at least they're forbidden by my, by my approach to quantum mechanics. And that's a way of getting
3229580	3234860	round this Bell's theorem, which is so important in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. So
3234860	3239500	counterfactuals, we shouldn't, so in other words, we shouldn't be, we shouldn't just take
3240300	3247260	counterfactual definiteness for, you know, as a given that things that we might have done,
3247260	3252300	but we didn't do are automatically allowed by the laws of physics. Some are allowed,
3252300	3258140	but some definitely aren't allowed. That's, that's my view. Okay, I want to talk more about
3258140	3264780	free will, but first on the weather. So when, when you guys make predictions like there's a 70%
3264780	3272220	chance of rain tomorrow, what you mean is if you ran tomorrow 100 times in your computer models,
3272220	3277900	70 days, it would rain. Now, what if the models were better, like decade from now or a hundred
3277900	3283420	years from now, and you could say, you know, it's 90% chance of rain. Isn't that still just a
3283420	3289100	measurement problem? It's an epistemic uncertainty. Or are you saying at some level, it'll never be,
3290060	3296460	you know, 100% predictable because of chaos theory and, and, you know, the butterfly effect and
3296460	3305020	things like that? Well, first of all, you're right that basically in that situation, the
3305980	3316700	uncertainty is, is epistemic. And you're, you're also right to say that as models improve, you
3316700	3323340	know, computers get bigger, we can, we can make our models more realistic. They can include
3325980	3330780	cloud systems, for example, which current global models can't, can't, can't describe.
3332140	3336700	Then, then the, the forecast will get more accuracy, more accurate. And, and as you say,
3336700	3345980	that will mean that today, when we say there's a 70% chance of rain, for exactly what the reason
3346700	3352060	sorry, the reason you said that we run an ensemble of say 100 forecasts and in 70 of them it rains
3352060	3356060	and in 30 it doesn't. So that gives us our probability. But you're right to say that it
3356060	3362380	could well be in, you know, in a decade or two, we'll have got that to 90% rather than 70% by,
3362380	3371420	by improving the models. And just the whole initial conditions will be more accurate. But
3371500	3379180	but I do go into the book in the book a bit that there's a kind of an interesting,
3382460	3386300	actually even non quantum systems have some strange
3388700	3396620	properties. And I describe quite a lot the, in one chapter, the uncertainty associated with
3396620	3404060	turbulence in fluids and the weather is kind of, you know, like a manifestation of turbulence in,
3404060	3413420	in the whole atmosphere as a fluid. And, and in particular, I talk about the work of, of, of a
3413420	3417900	meteorologist, American meteorologist called Ed Lorenz, who's, who's pretty much the father of,
3417900	3426540	of a lot of chaos theory. But he actually wrote a paper in 1969 that's actually less well known
3426620	3436540	than his 19 famous 1963 paper, which was the origin of chaos, which is the, how does uncertainty grow
3436540	3447820	in a, a turbulent, so I should say a turbulent fluid. You see, if you look at a turbulent fluid,
3447820	3453820	it's got eddies and whirls, but you can kind of zoom into one of those eddies, and you see smaller
3453820	3459820	eddies, and you can zoom into one of those smaller eddies and see yet smaller eddies. So it's actually
3459820	3466380	got a bit of a kind of self, what we call self similar structure like fractals have. So, you know,
3466380	3472220	you, if you look at a weather, a weather system from a satellite, and then you zoom in to a bit
3472220	3476860	of the weather system, you see clouds. And if you zoom into the clouds, you'd see turbulence
3476860	3481820	within the clouds. And if you zoomed into the turbulence, you'd see smaller turbulence. Anyway,
3481820	3489340	so Lorentz asked the question, how long would it take for small scale turbulence to, to start to
3489340	3495900	affect uncertainty in the very largest weather scales? And there's a, there's a really kind of,
3495900	3499980	from a conceptual point of view, there's something very interesting, which he uncovered,
3500940	3505820	which we haven't yet been able to prove mathematically, whether this is actually true or not,
3506220	3514380	which is that the time for uncertainty in a small scale piece of turbulence to affect a large scale
3514380	3524060	piece of turbulence has a fixed time scale. And it doesn't matter how small that uncertainty is in
3524060	3530540	scale, it will take a fixed time, let's say a couple of weeks to affect the uncertainty in the
3530620	3536540	the uncertainty in the very largest scale weather system. And this is actually a little bit different,
3536540	3541100	or this is, in fact, is quite different to normal chaos theory, because in normal chaos theory,
3543020	3548380	the idea is that if you could actually reduce the uncertainty to like an infinitesimally small
3549100	3554780	amplitude, you could predict as far ahead as you'd like, because you'd kind of suppress the chaos
3555740	3560460	for as long as you wanted by making the initial uncertainty sufficiently small.
3561020	3567420	But Lorentz conjectured, and you know, with pretty, I would say pretty strong mathematical
3567420	3573260	arguments, but they weren't 100% rigorous, that there is a finite time for uncertainty
3574300	3579420	in a turbulent system to grow to larger scales, no matter how small the uncertainty is.
3579580	3585580	Now, if that's correct, it means that although we'll be able to get that, like as you said,
3585580	3593980	70% to 90% for a weather forecast for, you know, the next few days, we'll probably never be able to
3593980	3599980	predict in detail the weather beyond two or three weeks, you know, that that's just going to be
3599980	3608540	hopeless. Now, the interesting thing is that this Lorentz's conjecture relates to a
3609420	3619340	problem which appeared at the turn of the millennium. So in 2000, the Clay Mathematics
3619340	3628300	Institute published a list of unsolved mathematical problems to kind of parallel what the famous
3628940	3635740	mathematician David Hilbert announced in 1900. You know, he famously gave an address where he
3635740	3643420	said, these are the most important unsolved problems in mathematics in 1900. And the Clay
3643420	3647500	Mathematics Institute, you know, with advice from mathematicians around the world,
3647500	3653580	announced a similar list of problems at 2000. And one of them was essentially this problem
3653580	3658940	of turbulence, solving this uncertainty about how uncertainty in turbulence grows.
3658940	3667740	And I could go on about this. I mean, this is this is what actually Lorentz meant by the butterfly
3667740	3674620	effect. It's this notion that a tiny scale disturbance could affect something very large
3675420	3681740	in a finite amount of time. So the butterfly effect actually has been slightly misused over the years.
3682700	3689020	And that's what it really means. So there's a lot of fascinating stuff, you know,
3690460	3697260	even in classical physics about uncertainty. Yeah, so but the butterfly effect,
3698380	3703420	I mean, the flap of a butterfly's wings in the middle of a hurricane isn't going to have any
3703420	3710780	effect at all. It has to be in the very early conditions or when the system is teetering on
3710780	3718220	shifting kind of a change, what they call a change transition point of criticality. I think,
3718220	3724700	yes, there is use that like the, you know, drop grains of sand and you get a little pile going
3724700	3729740	all of a sudden it collapses. And at that moment, the one little grain matters, but most of the
3729740	3734140	time the little one little grain doesn't matter. So it depends on the conditions either early
3734140	3739180	initial conditions or when it's teetering in the balance. So the horseshoe nail doesn't matter
3739260	3743820	for most of the battle only either early on or if the battle is hanging in the balance.
3746460	3750860	That's that's that's absolutely right. And you know, I
3753660	3762380	I mean, we talked about my decision to switch fields. Yeah. I mean, one of the things which
3762460	3769580	I like to think, and people may curse, curse me for it possibly, that I have done which has
3769580	3774140	sort of had an impact on people's lives is that I've introduced this notion of probabilistic
3775020	3782700	forecasting using these ensembles, so running models multiple times with slightly different
3782700	3793660	initial conditions and so on. And, you know, initially, it wasn't so much people, it's not
3793660	3800860	like, I mean, my colleagues were trying to think of the right words sort of skeptical about it.
3801900	3809580	Because, you know, if you if you have to run a weather model 50 times, each for each
3810460	3816220	forecast start date, you know, that takes up a lot of computer time. And, you know, what
3816860	3824460	what they perhaps didn't like was that they had other ideas on how to use that computer time,
3824460	3830780	you know, they'd rather improve the resolution of the model and so on. And they would say, well,
3830780	3838460	you know, most of the time, you know, we, we can forecast a few days out pretty well.
3839660	3848860	But I used to show them, I used to show them results from Lorenz's model of chaos. And I said,
3848860	3857740	look, this is a very sort of generic situation that that you can have within a single chaotic model,
3857740	3862940	a chaotic model, you can have initial conditions that are very predictable, which actually aren't
3862940	3867740	chaotic at all, or they're not for a long time, you have to integrate them out many, many, many,
3867740	3872460	you know, long period of time before they start showing evidence of unpredictability.
3873420	3879180	And in the very same model, you can find initial conditions where the uncertainty absolutely
3879180	3886460	explodes from the very start date. And, you know, I said, there's no reason why this
3888060	3893820	can't happen for, you know, the real weather. And the problem is, if you, if you, you know,
3893820	3901100	if you make blatantly wrong forecasts, people lose confidence in you. And around this time,
3901100	3908700	there was just the most, for me, wonderful example of this, which people of my age who
3909740	3915660	are British will know this, because it's kind of, it's kind of etched in our national psyche,
3915660	3925500	if you like, that in 1979, sorry, 1987, the weather forecaster came on the BBC TV,
3925500	3930540	a guy called Michael Fish, everyone knows this, Michael Fish, everyone British knows it, came on
3930540	3937340	TV and said, it's a kind of interesting story, actually, somebody apparently from France had
3937340	3943180	phoned up to say, they heard somewhere there's a hurricane on the way, is it true? And he just kind
3943180	3947100	of, he just laughed it off, he said, don't be stupid, you know, we don't have hurricanes in
3947100	3951660	Britain, there'll be no hurricane, don't worry about that. And then the next morning, there was
3951660	3957900	literally hurricane force winds, hurricane force gusts and, you know, caused, I guess in today's
3957900	3964940	money would be many billions of pounds of damage and people lost their lives and all sorts of chaos
3965820	3972700	ensued. And, you know, the head of the Met Office, they were called for him to resign,
3972700	3978300	the government, you know, had did an inquiry, what, you know, what was, how could, how, you know,
3978300	3982140	we spend all this money on the weather forecast service, how could they get it so hopelessly
3982140	3990060	wrong, just 12 hours before they weren't, they didn't know about this thing. So, we took a look
3990060	3999100	at this case, and it just is a spectacular example of, of just kind of explosive unpredictability
3999660	4006300	by introducing tiny, tiny flaps of butterflies wings, if you like, or computer types of flaps
4006300	4013020	of butterflies wings. We showed that just within a day or so, the solutions would completely diverge
4013020	4019740	from the most horrendous storms to completely benign weather. And it just, it just made it
4019740	4027020	completely clear then, there was, I mean, you know, that the only way to sensibly address this issue
4027020	4033180	is to, you know, is to develop an ensemble approach to forecasting where you, you introduce
4033180	4039180	these small uncertainties. By the way, not only in the initial conditions, but also in the model
4039180	4044540	equations. So we introduce noise, and I have a lot of a big chapter in the book about the,
4044540	4052780	the benefit of adding noise into, into certain nonlinear systems. And that leads to more
4053580	4057980	reliable, much more reliable forecasts. And you know when you can trust them, when you can trust
4057980	4063260	the forecast, and when, you know, you've got to be careful. And the really exciting thing about all
4063260	4071500	this is that now humanitarian organizations are using this type of information for deciding when
4071500	4079100	they can be proactive in sending aid and medicine and shelter and water and food and so on, to areas
4079180	4085980	that are potentially, you know, at risk of some extreme weather event. Whereas in the past, in
4085980	4091340	the past, with the old fashioned deterministic forecasts, so where you didn't have any estimate
4091340	4096940	of uncertainty, it was just too risky. They'd run out of money very quickly. If every time there was
4096940	4102940	a, a forecast of an event, you know, they sent, they sent aid out and they just run out of resources
4102940	4108700	immediately. Now what they do is they have a, they know they have a threshold, a probability
4108700	4113340	threshold. And they'd say, if the probability, the forecast probability exceeds this threshold,
4113340	4120220	then we take precautionary proactive action. And they've done a proper, you could, because now you
4120220	4126620	could do a proper cost loss analysis of whether the uncertainty is, is large enough. If it's too
4126620	4130940	large, then obviously all you can do is sit and wait and see what happens. But if the uncertainty
4130940	4136700	of this extreme event is sufficiently small, so that the probability of it exceeds the
4136700	4143820	predetermined threshold, then you know, you know, you have a logical and objective reason for going
4143820	4149180	in and helping people ahead of time. And that's always going to be more effective. But it means
4149180	4155580	they make use of their limited resources in a, in a much more, yeah, kind of objective and
4156380	4163420	way. So, so I, you know, I know people curse probability of rain on their apps and so on.
4163420	4166860	And I can understand that, you know, why don't they just tell us what it's going to be like.
4166860	4174620	But, you know, this is a case where actually for, you know, really serious extreme weather,
4174620	4182540	this probabilistic approach really is the way to, to, to make informed and logical and objective
4182540	4187980	decisions about whether it's sending aid into a region or evacuating a region or whatever it is.
4187980	4190860	And really that's, that's where weather forecasting is important.
4191420	4196140	Yeah, I wonder if you could comment on climate change models related to this. You'll often hear
4196140	4200620	from the climate skeptics. Well, look, you know, the limitations of these computer models, these
4200620	4205580	guys are running out a couple of days or a week. And then it, you know, after that, it's, you know,
4205580	4210460	it's, it's random. So how can you say a century from now, this is where we're going to be. Therefore,
4210460	4215100	we have to take drastic action to cut CO2 gases and so on. What's the difference between those
4215100	4219260	kind of models and how confident are you that they can make long term predictions?
4221820	4224220	Right. Well, there's a number of, a number of points there.
4226380	4234220	I think the first point to make is that one shouldn't conflate the weather forecast problem
4234860	4242620	with the climate change problem. And I'll give you a very simple example of what I mean.
4244460	4253340	So I'm, you know, I'm, I'm in my study in, in Southern England. I'm about 20 miles south of
4253340	4259260	Oxford. And we've had a, actually, we've had quite a remarkably warm for Britain anyway,
4259260	4265180	we've had a remarkably warm and dry summer. And today is a, is just another example. I mean,
4265180	4272540	outside the temperatures, probably in the high 20s, which is, we actually hit 40 Celsius,
4272540	4276060	which I don't know what that is in Fahrenheit, well, well over 100, 110 maybe.
4278620	4283100	But look, I can say with complete certainty, I think,
4283100	4288700	99.999% certainly, that in six months time,
4292220	4300460	so in January, it will not be 29 degrees Celsius. Right. And that's because every day the sun,
4301340	4308700	you know, spends a little bit less time in the sky. And, you know, we have an annual cycle.
4308940	4314140	So in other words, there's a kind of a predictable astronomical forcing,
4314860	4320860	which affects the statistics of weather. Now, I can't say in six months time whether it'll be
4320860	4326300	rainy or dry, but I can say pretty clearly it's going to be colder than it is today.
4327740	4334620	And climate change is, is like that with the, the predictable atmospheric forcing
4334620	4343260	of the annual cycle is now replaced with a predictable increase in,
4344860	4352220	in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere caused by our emissions. So we can say, I think,
4352220	4357180	you know, with pretty much certainty that because most of the governments of the world have said,
4357180	4363660	we will not be reducing our emissions to zero until at least mid century. So we can say that we
4363660	4369180	will continue to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for at least another, say 50 years,
4369180	4375820	possibly more. And as a result of that, carbon dioxide concentrations will increase a year on
4375820	4383420	year for at least the next 50 years, possibly more. And that has a predictable effect on the
4383420	4389980	statistics of weather, just as the seasonal cycle has a predictable effect on the statistics of
4389980	4395100	weather. So it's just a kind of a class error to say, oh, well, because we can't forecast the
4395100	4398700	detailed evolution of weather beyond a couple of weeks or so, it's hopeless saying anything about
4398700	4404220	climate change a hundred years from now, you're just conflating two completely different types
4404220	4408540	of problem. One is an initial condition problem, the initial weather forecasting. And the other is
4408540	4415740	where you're adding a kind of an external forcing. So what can we say? Well, so,
4416620	4422940	you know, there is there is no doubt whatsoever that as a result of this increase in CO2, the
4422940	4429660	global temperatures will continue to increase. Now, as I discuss in my book, how much they will
4429660	4437980	increase depends on factors, which actually are uncertain. And perhaps the biggest uncertainty
4437980	4449660	of all is due to clouds. Clouds have different effects on the climate depend, well, they have
4449660	4453260	multiple, they have many effects on climate, but they have different effects on temp, the surface
4453260	4460940	temperature of the earth, depending on what type of cloud they are. So when you have this kind of
4460940	4465820	what I call stratus clouds, very low level, sort of thick clouds, which just block the sun,
4468060	4473100	then that cools. I mean, then the atmosphere is typically colder than if the clouds weren't there,
4473100	4479020	because basically, the sun is reflected, the sunlight's reflected back to space. So the clouds
4479020	4486380	just block the sun, cool the surface. On the other hand, when you have very thin cirrus clouds, which
4487580	4493740	are way up in the high atmosphere, you know, 10 kilometers or more up, and they tend to be
4494220	4500460	much thinner clouds and often just made of little ice crystals. They actually play a much more
4500460	4507900	of a role in trapping the heat from the surface of the earth and stopping it radiating out to space,
4509100	4514860	which is why quite often, certainly in Britain, you know, when you think there's going to be an
4514860	4523420	overnight frost, and then a layer of cirrus cloud comes along during the night, that can often stop
4523420	4528700	frost from forming, because you actually end up warming the planet. Well, you know, in the sense
4528700	4534460	of that the atmosphere loses less heat to space. So this would be the greenhouse. So the critical
4534460	4539660	question, I mean, a really big sort of like zero thought of question for climate change is what
4539660	4546940	are clouds going to do? Because if cirrus clouds increase and stratus clouds decrease, then this
4546940	4553100	will amplify the climate change signal. It'll make it warmer, potentially by quite a lot.
4554380	4560460	That's actually, you know, that's that then you're into catastrophe, like, you know,
4562380	4567340	catastrophic changes in climate change. If stratus clouds low level kind of stratus
4567340	4573980	cumulus clouds dissipate, and the higher level clouds either stay the same or increase. If
4573980	4579260	it's the other way around, then actually clouds will help us. It will be won't be quite as bad.
4580220	4586780	Unfortunately, the models are tending towards the wrong in the wrong way, they're making the
4586780	4594860	low level clouds less, less of them, and that's amplifying the warming. But I would say because
4594860	4599820	we can't represent clouds explicitly in models, they're done with very simplified formulae. This
4599820	4607340	is the biggest area of uncertainty. Now, the other area of uncertainty is is local is what happens
4607340	4613740	at a regional level. So are we going to get more droughts? I mean, like here in the UK,
4613740	4621180	we've had a drought this summer. And the question is, I mean, this drought may well
4621180	4628300	continue into the autumn and winter. And that's a really big question for infrastructure,
4628300	4633100	how much more reservoir capacity do we need is based around this question of how
4634060	4638460	are long lived droughts of, you know, multi season droughts becoming more
4639020	4644460	commonplace or not under climate change? And current generation models just can't answer
4644460	4649420	that question because they're not good enough at simulating these long lived droughts. And that's
4649420	4655340	because we can't put enough resolution into the models. And that's because the computer's
4655340	4660940	resources we have are not big enough. So I I've been advocating for a like a CERN for climate
4660940	4667740	change where we pool our resources. And just, you know, by the biggest, you know, we now can
4667740	4673340	buy what's called exascale computers 10 to the 18 floating point operations per second,
4673340	4677660	that's a million, million, million calculations per second, that will make a big change in
4677660	4682220	our ability to simulate climate change accurately. We could have one of these centers in a place
4682220	4688140	where the energy comes from renewable could be solar wind or geothermal or something. We don't
4688140	4692940	want to burn coal to run the power to run a computer, that's for sure. But we can do it with
4692940	4698780	renewables. And if we if we form a new international institute, this could make a big
4698780	4703260	advance in our ability to understand and again, reduce these uncertainties in future climate
4703260	4709340	change. Would that be a good solution also for predicting pandemics and economic recessions?
4709340	4713900	Then you mentioned those and you have chapters on them. Well, it's it's yeah, I mean, it's it's an
4713900	4726780	interesting, you know, just coming back to my story about Michael Fish. See, you know, here was
4726780	4735340	the situation where the weather actually most of 1987, I don't think the weather was especially
4735340	4740700	sort of unpredictable or something, but suddenly in October 87, along this came this kind of a
4740700	4752620	massively unpredictable storm. And what it what it demonstrates is that what I said about the
4752620	4760060	Lorentz chaos model that the model itself is chaos, but the degree of chaos is not the same
4760060	4767100	day in day out. Different initial conditions have different degrees of chaos. And there are
4767180	4772460	some initial conditions that are exceptionally unpredictable. And other initial conditions
4772460	4780060	are reasonably predictable. And in fact, you could say most of the time, for these chaotic models,
4780060	4783900	the initial conditions are reasonably predictable, but just as a small region where they're
4783900	4790460	exceptionally unpredictable. Now, you know, you look at other systems like, like the economy,
4791260	4797500	or, you know, global health, or indeed, you know, the state of conflict in the world,
4798780	4801660	where you could say for a lot of the time things we sort of bump along
4802460	4811260	in a reasonably kind of predictable and sort of stable way. But occasionally we get these,
4811980	4817180	you know, like the 2008 financial crash. And then of course, in terms of public health,
4817740	4827420	the COVID pandemic. And now we have, you know, the Putin's invasion of Ukraine has kind of triggered
4827420	4836060	a global crisis. So, you know, it does seem that there are clearly parallels with other
4836060	4842940	types of systems, perhaps more involved in social sciences. So I do discuss in the book, because
4842940	4851740	I did a bit of research contacting economists and epidemiologists and conflict modelers
4851740	4860620	to see to what extent ensemble based forecasting is being used in these other fields. And I think
4860620	4869980	the answer is they're much less well developed than in, in, in, in sort of weather and climate.
4869980	4875980	But perhaps the one where I did find the most kind of traction was actually in COVID modeling. And
4875980	4881660	in particular in the United States, where a number of university groups have developed their own
4882860	4889580	individual COVID models. But there was a central facility which, which, you know, took in all of
4889580	4896620	the data from all these different models and synthesized it in a kind of probabilistic way
4896620	4902620	and showed actually that, you know, the ensemble forecast information of COVID, you know,
4902620	4908220	things like COVID incidents and COVID hospitalizations and so on, was actually much more
4909180	4917900	skillful from the ensemble as a whole than from any one of the models. And that got me thinking,
4917900	4925500	by the way, that just as the world meteorological organization WMO has been sort of leading the
4925500	4932300	development of climate change prediction ensembles, which go into these IPCC assessment reports,
4932300	4937980	the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, you know, so the WHO World Health Organization
4937980	4945500	could maybe mastermind some of these ensembles for doing much more kind of coordinated
4946940	4951100	disease prediction in, I mean, not only COVID, but all the other types of
4951740	4955660	important diseases around the world. I mean, I think they're probably are starting to do this,
4955660	4961420	but I think there's a lot that they can learn, as indeed the economists, I think, and the
4962300	4966460	conflict models from what we have been through in weather and climate prediction in the last
4967660	4973580	few decades. Yeah, I think one of the problems with the divisiveness politically,
4974300	4981180	particularly around climate change, endemics, economic recessions, is the amount of doubt
4981180	4987660	that arises amongst people who just kind of watch the daily news go by and,
4988300	4993660	you know, Dr. Fauci says this, now he says that, the CDC recommended this, now they recommend that,
4994220	4998380	you know, they can't keep their story straight, you know, I should just be skeptical across the
4998380	5002540	board. This is kind of a larger question, you know, what is the skeptic, you know, are you a
5002540	5007100	climate change skeptic or are you skeptical of the climate change skeptics, which would make you
5007100	5012780	a believer, whatever that would mean in science. You see what I'm getting at, why should people trust
5014380	5021260	what health experts say about the coming pandemic or what we should do, wear a mask,
5021260	5025180	don't wear a mask, get the vaccine, don't, whatever. How do you think about it on that
5025180	5028940	larger scale and what would you recommend to people who bring these kinds of things up,
5028940	5033580	which sound reasonable, like they keep changing their mind and they've been wrong so many times,
5033580	5047340	why should I listen to the experts now? Well, I would say in my, if I could take climate change
5047340	5054620	as an example about which I know the most, so let me stick to that because I know
5055340	5056460	I think what I'm talking about.
5060380	5067900	You see, you have to realize that there are two sides to the issue. There's a scientific,
5068460	5074140	there's a scientific question. And then there's, and then because we're talking about policy
5074140	5080860	relevant science, there is a, there is a political, if you like, analysis and decision that has to be
5081420	5091580	made using as input the scientific evidence. So, in the case of climate change, I, you know,
5092620	5097500	and I think this is true of most, not necessarily all, but most of my colleagues,
5100300	5107580	they have tried to address this question of climate change from a science point of view.
5107580	5113740	So, what does that mean? It means if you ask the question, you know, are humans
5115260	5121740	emitting, you know, by burning fossil fuels, are we emitting carbon into the atmosphere,
5121740	5125660	carbon dioxide into the atmosphere? Yes, there's no question scientifically, there's no question
5125660	5131260	about it. Is that warming the planet? Yes, there's no question about that.
5132220	5138780	Will the planet continue to warm by our ongoing emissions of carbon dioxide?
5139500	5147580	Yes, there's no doubt about that. Are we increasing the risk of, you know, severe
5147580	5152140	or extreme weather events by these emissions of carbon dioxide? Yes, there's no doubt about that.
5153180	5158700	Should we therefore cut our emissions of carbon dioxide? Now, once you ask that question,
5159260	5165260	you're no longer asking a science question, you're asking a policy question. And,
5168300	5173740	I mean, my, as I say, I think I speak for a lot of my colleagues, they would just say, well,
5174940	5179500	you know, that, I can give you my personal view as a human being on the planet,
5181260	5187580	but if you ask me from a science point of view, should you cut emissions, then I can't tell you,
5187580	5194540	because that involves value judgments. You know, there is a cost to cutting our emissions. We do,
5195340	5202380	you know, I mean, everything in daily life, hospitals and, you know, social welfare, everything,
5202380	5208700	you know, is currently geared around fossil fuel energy. Everything, you know, in our lives
5208700	5216540	currently is based around fossil fuel energy. So converting to zero carbon energy is a difficult
5216620	5222780	and involves a cost. And you could argue, for example, and I have some sympathy with this argument,
5222780	5230460	that in the developing world, where we want people's standards of living to get, you know,
5230460	5236860	close to our own in the rich world, if we suddenly say stop burning fossil fuels and only use solar
5236860	5245740	panels, we're going to hinder their economic growth. So if you try to make that final step of
5245740	5251020	should we cut our emissions, you're going, you know, into politics. And I think it's important
5251020	5259980	to realize that that is where scientists have no big bigger or better insights than anybody else.
5259980	5266380	You know, I know pretty well what a molecule of carbon dioxide does in the atmosphere,
5266380	5274060	but trying to, you know, estimate way up on the one side, the benefits, and on the other side,
5274060	5285180	the costs of moving to zero carbon involves, you know, economic social assessments that I'm not
5285180	5294220	an expert in. I mean, in the book, I try to give an approach to that based on what's called an
5294220	5301340	estimate of a value of a human life. But, you know, I don't have any, I don't consider myself
5301340	5311980	an expert in that. So what I'm trying to say here is that perhaps COVID is, if we take COVID as an
5311980	5321180	example, the politicians, you know, that the scientists would have gone to meetings with
5321180	5327260	the politicians and said, well, these are what the model, these are what the models show. And
5327980	5333420	maybe not at the beginning of COVID, but certainly towards the end, they were able to show
5334300	5341420	their results in a probabilistic way. So this is the probability that there will be x deaths per
5341420	5347900	thousand people or something like that. Then the politicians have to decide, is that risk high enough
5347900	5354300	to take action to shut down an economy or to, you know, stop people moving around? And when people
5354300	5364140	say, oh, well, they got that wrong. It wasn't, I mean, the decisions may or may not have been
5364140	5371100	wrong, but it wasn't the science that was wrong. It was maybe in hindsight, the decision that was
5371100	5375900	made wasn't the right decision. I don't know. But actually, at the time, maybe it was the right
5375900	5381500	decision given given the evidence. But I just want to emphasize that point that there are,
5381580	5386060	you know, saying, oh, they got it wrong, you may actually, or the people making that, so it may
5386060	5391100	be more referring to the decisions that were made on the basis of the evidence that there was at the
5391100	5400860	time. You know, it's like if I say to you, there's a 70% chance of it raining tomorrow, you might say,
5401580	5406780	well, in that case, I'll take my umbrella to work or to wherever I'm going. And then, of course,
5406860	5413100	it may not rain. So does that mean you were wrong in deciding to take your umbrella to work? I mean,
5413100	5418460	the fact of the matter is, at the time, the best available evidence was that there was a 70% chance
5418460	5427020	it would rain. So you have to recognize that when you make decisions under uncertainty, I don't think
5427020	5432060	actually calling them wrong is the right way to describe such a decision. But the answer, you know,
5432060	5436940	in hindsight, it may be that a different decision would have cost you less. But this is just an
5436940	5443420	inevitable consequence of uncertainty. And it's better than just tossing a coin in the air when
5443420	5447100	you're making a decision where that's an important, I mean, taking an umbrella is not an important
5447100	5452940	decision. But if it's whether to evacuate somewhere or something like that, then having the
5452940	5458140	scientific, the best scientific available evidence is better than just, you know, tossing a coin.
5458780	5463420	Yeah. Yeah, people get confused about that. Like with the 2016 election of Trump and Clinton,
5464620	5468620	you know, that Hillary had a 70% chance of winning. Well, then how did Trump win? Well,
5468620	5473420	if you ran the election 100 times, Hillary wins 70 of them. So this was one of the 30.
5474060	5479820	And that's how it happens. Right. So, all right, so let's go back to... And I think it's important
5479820	5486060	for, you know, scientists to be honest. I mean, I tell you what the hardest thing is for me,
5486060	5492140	and I'm sure it's true of when you get interviewed by a journalist who's writing a story for,
5492140	5497740	you know, tomorrow's edition, you could tell that he wants you, he or she wants you to be
5497740	5502380	more definite than you are, because it's not a great story if it's couched in the language of
5502380	5507900	uncertainty. So you kind of feeling under pressure the whole time to be more certain than you are.
5507900	5515420	But I think it is important for scientists to tell, you know, to be honest about uncertainty.
5516300	5520780	And ultimately, you know, that's the politician's jobs to make decisions under uncertainty. That's
5520780	5525980	why we vote for them. It's not for scientists, you know, to make those decisions for them.
5526700	5530700	So we shouldn't, you know, let them off the hook. They have to make, it's tough. You know,
5530700	5534380	sometimes it's tough making decisions under uncertainty, but the scientist's job is to
5534380	5542540	tell them the evidence fairly and dispassionately. And that's what I certainly try to do. And that's
5542540	5547820	the kind of philosophy in the book, if you like. Yeah. Carl Sagan had a funny story about that,
5547820	5554460	how he would give some rough estimate, like, oh, I don't know, it's about 150,000 kilometers to
5554460	5559660	whatever. And then, and then the journalist would translate that into the Archaic American
5559660	5566220	Standard System, and it would come out, you know, at some exact number, you know, like 0.67. How
5566220	5570220	did he know that it's exactly that? It's like, he doesn't. It was just the rough estimate the
5570220	5577020	first place. Right. Yeah. So, all right, Tim, let's just kind of wrap up here by going to your
5577020	5583020	last chapter and again, return to free will consciousness and then God, which I love all
5583020	5587820	that stuff. So just one final point on the free will issue. I'm a compatibilist. I liked your
5587820	5594860	approach. It gels with mine very much. I think we can do otherwise. The universe is not, it's not
5594940	5599580	predetermined. You know, we are part of the causal net determining things ourselves,
5599580	5604620	as well as aware of the factors that we can at least try to control. Now here, the determinists
5604620	5610620	would say, no, no, no, no, you're just confusing different levels of causality. So here, I'll use
5610620	5617500	Adrian Reigns examples from his book, The Anatomy of Violence, about Mr. OFT off, they don't use his
5617500	5622380	real name, but he was this school teacher who had a, turned out he had an orbital frontal cortex
5623020	5632060	tumor and he, at mid-age, so like 40-something, became kind of a pedophile. He started acting
5632060	5637500	inappropriately with his wife's daughter, his stepdaughter, and kiddie porn on his computer
5637500	5642300	and all this stuff. So she turns him into protective services and, you know, he's going to go to jail
5642300	5647980	and then the psychiatrist scans his brain and, oh my God, he's got a tumor there. And then, so the way
5647980	5652860	Reigns presents this, it's like, you kind of feel sorry for him, like, oh, oh, he's not a pedophile,
5652860	5658380	he's a medical patient, he has this tumor and, you know, they took the tumor out and his, those
5658380	5662700	feelings go away, he's back to normal and then six months later, the wife finds more porn, kiddie
5662700	5669340	porn on his computer, oh, so brain scan, it's back. So, you know, there it's obvious. And then,
5669340	5675420	Reigns second example is this African-American young man named Dante Page, who was convicted
5675420	5682300	for raping and murdering a college-age woman in Colorado. And he was up for the death penalty
5682300	5689180	and Reigns was on the defense attorneys, defense teams attempt to get him life in prison rather
5689180	5694300	than the death penalty. So he wrote extensively about this guy's background, which is the most
5694300	5699420	horrible background you could possibly imagine. You know, single mom was addicted to drugs,
5699420	5705260	beaten constantly by the men in her life, dropped on his head a dozen times, many trips to the
5705260	5710300	ER for brain damage and so on. By the time he's 18, he's had like the worst life anybody could
5710300	5716700	have in America. Just horrible environment and gangs, terrible diet, you name it, he's got it.
5717500	5721820	Now, Reigns point is that there's nothing on the brain scan really quite like a tumor,
5722780	5728060	you know, but it's tumors all the way down. It's the equivalent of you just don't see
5728060	5733500	what the neural changes are because of that horrible background, but it's the same thing.
5733500	5739340	So why is the Dante Page different from the pedophile guy with the tumor? And the determinists
5739340	5745260	would say it's all the same. They're all just physical causes. The brain is a physical mechanism
5745260	5750380	that obeys the laws of physics and everything else. And so how would you respond to kind of a
5750380	5761420	deterministic argument like that? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I certainly accept that, you know, there
5761420	5769500	are situations where the moral culpability of somebody is borderline because of medical conditions.
5769500	5776220	But look, let's just take Hitler. I mean, surely we can all agree that Hitler was evil, you know,
5776220	5782380	he exterminated or attempted to exterminate, you know, large sections of society.
5783100	5793580	What word can you use an evil? So the argument that, you know, and I understand, you know,
5793580	5802540	the reason why people don't like determinism is that they say, oh, well, you know,
5804460	5810060	it was all conditioned by whatever the cosmological, you know, Big Bang initial conditions were.
5811020	5816940	That that sort of set the clock ticking and then everything after that was inevitable. So we can't,
5818300	5822220	we can't kind of blame Hitler for what he did because it was all determined by the
5822780	5830060	initial conditions. So that that's, I think, probably the most common type of argument that
5830060	5841900	people who don't like determinism bring up. And I actually find that a powerful argument.
5841900	5848380	You see, so it's kind of, you know, at the level of physics, theoretical physics,
5850540	5856780	determinism, I think, is quite an attractive concept because the alternative, which is
5856780	5862060	indeterminism and God playing dice and things is just such kind of nonsense, it seems to me.
5863180	5868460	But when you phrase it in this moral way, moral capability, it's a dilemma because,
5868460	5873500	you know, nobody wants to let Hitler off the hook for what he did to the Jews and the Gypsies
5873500	5880700	and everything else. So how do we square that? And I tried to address that again in the last
5880700	5889260	chapter by coming back to this notion of a fractal attractor. This idea that, which in some sense
5889260	5894380	borrows a lot of ideas from Einstein that the laws of physics are geometric. So his idea about
5894380	5901740	general relativity was that the laws of laws of gravitation are ultimately caused or due to the
5901740	5911340	fact that space-time has a sort of non-trivial geometry. And these fractal geometries in the
5911340	5919340	space of solutions of the equations is another kind of geometric approach. And what it does
5919340	5927020	is if you take that view, then actually the initial conditions, the cosmological initial
5927020	5935100	conditions are no longer somehow fundamental and sort of the moment that everything takes off from.
5935100	5941900	In some sense, all of the states of the world from the cosmological state to the present day and in
5941900	5949260	the future and so on, sort of have equal ontological status as points on this geometry.
5949260	5959820	And what that does then is to tell you that there's a kind of a, it's almost like a self-referential
5961900	5971340	picture that you have. The geometry is sort of telling us how we evolve from one day to the
5971340	5977660	next. But equally what we do is determining the structure of this geometry. There's a kind of
5977660	5986780	duality here, which is kind of a little bit difficult to say exactly. I mean, I don't have a
5986780	5993340	precise way of defining it, but there's a sort of duality here between the geometry. It's a little
5993340	5997580	bit like in general relativity, there's, I think, John Wheeler, the famous theoretical physicist,
5997580	6008460	kind of said, the geometry tells matter how to move and the matter tells spacetime how to curve.
6008460	6014540	So this is kind of duality in terms of spacetime geometry. And I think there's something in
6014540	6019740	parallel going on here that the spacetime, that the diffractal geometry is in some sense telling us
6020460	6027340	how the atoms in our body are going to evolve from one day to the next. But our actions are
6027340	6033340	equally, in some sense, determining the structure of this geometry. Again, there's a sort of duality.
6034620	6039420	I'm shaking my head because I don't have a clear enough picture to kind of really nail down what
6039420	6046140	I'm saying here, but I feel it intuitively that, as with the Wheeler duality for spacetime, there's
6047100	6053180	something here. But what that would mean is that that then will not let Hitler off the hook,
6053740	6059740	because it does put some onus on what we do as, you know, means we have to take responsibility
6061020	6068060	for what we do. I throw this out in the last chapter. Look, I mean, the book,
6069180	6075580	it's important to make this point that the book starts very, very in very, very, very solid
6077100	6081500	the maths and physics of chaos. It goes through things like weather and climate,
6081500	6089660	which again, pretty damn solid, I would say, talks a bit about economics, COVID and something,
6089660	6094460	perhaps a little bit more uncertain there. The last section of the book is all about consciousness,
6095740	6102940	free will, moral responsibility, and then as you say, right at the end, God. And I think I try to
6103020	6107580	say right at the beginning of that section, this is much more speculative. So I'm not going to,
6107580	6114300	I can't sort of absolutely nail everything to the mast and say I've completely picked this. But
6114300	6120460	there's something I think important here about taking away the Big Bang as something where,
6120460	6124860	you know, everything was set in stone at the moment of the Big Bang and nothing could change,
6124860	6131740	to something much more fluid, I suppose in some sense, where we do actually have some role in
6131740	6137660	determining this geometry, just as the geometry has a role in influencing us. So I think this,
6137660	6145420	at the very least, let's say this, it provides a new ingredient, I suppose, into the debate about
6146620	6152380	determinism and moral responsibility and so on. And I hope at least that will get people thinking.
6152380	6157020	Yeah, no, I like that very much. All right, last page here, you talk about, for example,
6157020	6163180	in the cosmological invariant set model, there is an afterlife, we and our loved ones will be
6163180	6168780	coming back in future epochs of the universe on trajectories in state space, close to the
6168780	6173500	present one, but none precisely the same as the present one. What in the world are you talking
6173500	6186300	about there? Well, yeah, so if you take something like the Lorentz model,
6189340	6193820	the states and the Lorentz model, they evolve on this fractal geometry, and
6195660	6201100	they can go round and round and round and then come back, they never come back exactly
6201980	6208300	to where they were, but they come back very close. There's a point in the future
6210060	6215580	of a trajectory in this solution space, I call it state space. I try to explain what I mean by
6215580	6221180	state space in the book, but there's no time here to go into detail. But let's say it's space of
6221180	6229420	solutions, where the solution comes round, it never exactly comes back to the point you started,
6229420	6239180	but it comes as close as you like. And at that moment, that state is like within the flap of
6239180	6246540	a butterfly's wings away from that original state. So if this is how the universe works,
6246540	6254060	and that's my belief actually, and it links in with a lot of Roger Penrose's latest ideas about
6254620	6261980	what he calls cyclic cosmology. But with this difference, that the universe is never
6261980	6268140	cyclic in a precise way, it doesn't actually repeat itself, but it gets back to a state
6268140	6276540	which is very close to where it was in a previous Eon. And so what that means is that we,
6278060	6282460	it's a bit like actually the example we had earlier of me walking out of the shop
6283260	6289340	and being hit by a bicycle. In a future Eon, I will walk out of that shop and see the bicycle
6289340	6294700	and avoid it, and I won't end up in hospital. So certain things will be better, but maybe some
6294700	6298780	good decisions, you know, that I made, I'll make lousy decisions. And so in other respects,
6298780	6304540	it'll be worse. But that's what seems to be, you know, if I mean, I'm being speculative,
6304540	6308140	I understand all that. But if you take this model of the universe as a
6308780	6313580	chaotic system evolving on one of its fractal attractors, as they're called,
6314860	6320860	this is where it leads you to a universe where, in some sense, you do come back,
6320860	6327500	but things are slightly different. And I find that quite, so as I say, loved ones,
6327500	6330860	you'll meet loved ones again, if that's right. But you'll have a different life with them,
6330860	6334940	things will be different. This would make God something of a computer modeler
6335740	6339980	who is replicating our loved ones in some sort of virtual reality.
6340620	6344300	Or am I missing that? It's something different in the future.
6345100	6353180	Well, it wouldn't be a computer, actually, because the thing about computers is because they're,
6357340	6360780	you know, one of the things about, if you have a model of chaos,
6361740	6368700	and you represent it on a computer, then actually, the state does eventually return to
6368700	6375260	exactly its starting point, because the numbers inside a computer can only be represented with
6375260	6382860	a finite number of bits. So God isn't a computer, but certainly God is mathematical, in some sense.
6384380	6388380	And, well, I just finish, I don't know whether this is giving too much away,
6388380	6395580	but I finish with this conjecture, well, suppose God just is this geometry, in some sense, this
6395580	6401660	fractal. I mean, that is God. It's kind of a Spinozian philosophy of God, but sort of on steroids,
6401660	6407420	because it's not just our universe, but it's like the sum totality of all of the eons and stuff put
6407420	6415420	together. You know, and I kind of, it just amuses me that Lorenz, who invented the butterfly effect
6415420	6421900	which we spoke about, he also invented this model of chaos. And if you look at the attractor of the
6421900	6427340	Lorenz model, it actually looks like a butterfly. A bit of the wing of that butterfly is on the
6427340	6433580	front cover of the book. It looks like a butterfly. Now that is a complete, yeah, I mean, you've got
6433580	6438140	you've got the sort of two wings of the butterfly there sort of thing. But that's a complete coincidence.
6438140	6443900	It's totally, you know, it's just fortuitous. But it just got me thinking maybe the geometry
6443900	6448700	of this cosmological attractor is a picture of God. I mean, who knows?
6452380	6459020	But this isn't a personal guy. I just feel it's it's worth exploring, but I, you know, who knows.
6459020	6464700	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, at this point, that's all you can do, because I do think we kind of hit
6464700	6469900	an epistemological wall when we talk about things like that, or why is there something rather than
6469900	6474460	nothing? Well, what do you mean by nothing? And then you get into the physics metaphysics
6474460	6478460	of nothingness. And, and then it's just like, words, I do have.
6481020	6490620	Yeah, I do. I'm not somebody that dismisses religion and God out of hand, which of course,
6490620	6499500	a lot of scientists do. And I think, you know, we need to look for ways of reconciling science
6499500	6512060	and religion in ways which are not, you know, as confrontational as they often are. And I mean,
6512060	6519340	this is just my attempt to, you know, to raise a concept which might possibly bring people together
6519340	6525100	in a way. You mean as a strategy for, you know, can't we all just get along? Yes, that would be good.
6525980	6531020	Versus an actual epistemological attempt to understand the natural reality. We need religious
6531020	6545100	people in their views as well as scientists. Well, I'm not sure what I'm saying. I mean, you need,
6545820	6556220	can I say, I think to make progress in fundamental science, you do, you know, it's not, I mean,
6556220	6564300	science is not a kind of a logical process. You need insights of imagination, leaps of imagination,
6566140	6572940	which often you don't get from just staring at equations, you know, it's having some more
6572940	6579580	kind of liberating philosophy which can take you to places that you just don't get by looking at
6579580	6587660	equations. I think often that is important in science. You know, progress is kind of inductive,
6587660	6596300	it's not deductive. And yeah, I mean, people with religious feelings and backgrounds, I think there
6596300	6603340	are useful, they have insights that could be useful. I mean, I can't say categorically that
6603340	6609420	they are needed. But on the other hand, I would feel science would be the poorer if we somehow
6609420	6616620	excluded such people. I think it would limit us in our ability to think outside the box, which we
6616620	6624780	do need questionably. And in this area of quantum gravity, we need question. So I, you know, I'm
6624780	6637340	trying to say that in physics, at least, being cognizant of different religious, philosophical
6637340	6644300	traditions, I think is can be useful. Yeah. That's right. Because you had a discussion on the
6644300	6651100	relationship of noise in the brain and creativity, if I'm remembering that right. So this would be
6651100	6656140	an example of we need as many people as possible who have thought about these big questions,
6656140	6659660	because who knows what noise goes on in their head and they come up with some ideas
6659660	6662460	related to spiritual traditions or whatever that are useful.
6664060	6668620	Right. That's right. I mean, I, as you say, I mean, it comes back to this question of
6670380	6676860	what's so special about 20 watts of power that will run the brain. And what's what one of the
6676860	6685420	things that's special about it is that there likely are situations where the the the signals in the
6685420	6693900	neurons are affected by noise, thermal noise, maybe actually even quantum mechanical noise.
6695180	6699180	Now, what manifestations would that take? Well, it could be that that's what helps us
6699500	6706860	bring ideas together from what would be in a purely sort of logical deductive way,
6707740	6717740	you know, unlikely connections. And so you need two ingredients to make to make the connections,
6717740	6724300	you need two ingredients, you need to have those ideas, you need to have, you know, the ideas don't
6724300	6730300	come out of nowhere, but you need to have had those ideas. And then the noise, which by the way,
6730300	6738380	happens mostly susceptibility to noise is probably happens mostly when you're in a very relaxed
6739420	6746140	mode, not thinking about anything in particular. That's when the brain can make connections between
6746140	6752380	really quite different ideas. And I discuss in my book how the eureka moments that some of our
6752460	6756700	top, you know, Nobel Prize winners have had, these have all occurred when they're just relaxing,
6756700	6762380	doing nothing. And I tell my students, you know, don't spend the whole day in front of the computer
6762380	6768380	and night in front of the computer, because you're just, you know, you're you're preventing these
6769020	6774220	the eureka moments from happening. So yeah, so the brain, I think,
6774540	6781820	so having a diverse kind of multi, multi dimensional view of, of the world from different
6781820	6787180	perspectives, and then that ability to relax and allow the noise in the brain to make the connections
6787180	6792860	that that's the kind of my view of the secret to creativity and inventiveness.
6792860	6799740	So here we'd probably say no noise favors the prepared mind. Because if I have a dream about
6800700	6807420	writing on a beam of light or falling down an elevator shaft, I'm not coming up with the theory
6807420	6813420	of relativity, because I'm a nobody in physics, right? You got to have the mind ready to solve the
6813420	6821020	problem. You have to have a certain amount of I mean, you have to remember, Einstein was not
6821980	6827740	a mathematical genius. His knowledge of mathematics was actually somewhat limited. I mean, by the
6827740	6832140	standards of mathematicians, you know, people wouldn't have called him a mathematician, but he
6832140	6837500	knew enough mathematics to realize when he'd had that idea about writing a beam of light,
6838220	6843900	that that had mathematical implications. And then he went to his, you know, his friends Minkowski
6843900	6849820	and so on, and, and then formulated things mathematically. So you don't need to be like
6849820	6855020	super expert, you know, in different areas, but you do have to have a general broad,
6855900	6860060	I think knowledge of different things. I think that is important. At least that's what,
6860060	6866540	and that's squares with my own experience. I've tried to, you know, know a little about a lot
6866540	6873260	of things. And sometimes that's, that can be useful. Yeah, one of my favorite Steve Gould essays
6873260	6878060	was talking about since we started with Feynman, we can end with Feynman, where he was going to
6878060	6883980	Caltech to give a public talk and he was contacted by Feynman's office. We'd like to have lunch.
6883980	6889900	Yeah, okay, wow, the great Feynman. Yeah, that'd be great. So Feynman proceeds to bounce some ideas
6889900	6895980	he had about evolution with Gould, which essentially turned out to be sexual selection,
6895980	6901260	which Darwin had figured out by the 1870, that it wasn't just natural selection, there was
6901260	6905260	natural selection of female select emails, for example, but they're competing and they have
6905260	6910460	different kinds of camouflage or whatever colors that would not be camouflaged if it was natural
6910460	6915980	selection. So anyway, Gould finally said, well, yeah, we worked all that out like a century ago.
6917180	6922860	And Feynman said, I didn't, I never read anything about a subject like that, because I want to come
6922860	6928700	to it fresh with a clear mind. Anyway, Gould's point of his essay was, yeah, except it's good
6928700	6933020	to know what's already been done in case, you know, the errors that you're about to make have
6933020	6943260	already been made and we figured those out. That's right. I agree. So, all right, Tim, well,
6943260	6947900	you've been very patient. We've got almost two hours here and I appreciate you entertaining
6947900	6951900	all my questions here. Standing in for our listeners who don't know much about this stuff.
6951900	6956860	I think your book is super clear. I hope everybody reads it because it's just a masterful example
6956860	6961260	of clear science writing on some of the biggest, most interesting, important topics of our time.
6961260	6964940	So thank you for doing that. What's next on your writing or research plate?
6967820	6975820	I'm writing a paper whose title is Quantum Physics from Number Theory. So I'm a great
6975820	6983820	believer that, you know, Newton discovered the calculus and the calculus is used in pretty
6983820	6990780	much all of modern physics from, you know, throwing a throwing a stone in the air, forecasting the
6990780	6996620	weather, even the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics is based on the calculus. The problem
6996620	7004300	with the calculus is that it assumes variables are infinitely, you know, variable. Whereas
7005020	7010860	number theory is about the properties of whole numbers, one, two, three, four, five, six.
7012220	7018220	At very little is made use of number theory in physics and certainly in fundamental physics.
7018860	7026860	So my project at the moment is writing a technical paper on how some very interesting kind of number
7026860	7030780	theorems about properties of whole numbers, the relationship of whole numbers and what are
7030780	7037820	called trigonometric functions, like the sine and cosine of an angle could provide some really
7037820	7042300	big insights into the nature of quantum physics. So we'll see how that goes.
7042300	7047100	And do you get those insights from playing the banjo and guitar, if I can comment on your backdrop?
7047100	7053260	Is that one of your creative outlets? Einstein had the violin, you have the guitar.
7054060	7064460	Yeah, I play in a village rock and roll band. And I've been like a folk musician since I was
7064460	7071580	about 12 or so, inspired by the Beatles, I have to say originally. I don't find much connection
7071580	7077660	between science and playing musical instruments. I'm not somebody that loves Bach because of its
7077740	7083820	mathematical intricacies. I like playing fairly simple music just as an emotional release. There's
7083820	7091260	nothing better than playing Johnny B. Good on a Gibson EF 335 in front of 100 people who are
7091260	7096220	dancing like mad. There's just nothing to compare with it. It's fantastic. It's almost as good as
7096220	7103100	doing science. I was watching a YouTube video of Queen performing, I don't know where it was,
7103100	7108380	but there must have been 100,000 people. And there was Brian May. Doesn't he have a PhD
7108380	7114060	in astrophysics or something like that? Anyway, I just can only imagine. I have a story about Brian
7114060	7124620	May. He finished his PhD at Imperial College after Freddie Mercury had died and the group had
7124620	7130620	sort of gone into abeyance. And he finished his PhD and he had to give a seminar in the physics
7130700	7137340	department on his PhD work. And I wasn't there, but apparently he said, I thought this was great.
7137340	7143980	He said, you know, I've given concerts in front of 100,000 people in stadiums.
7144700	7149500	I've played on the roof of Buckingham Palace in front of royalty and things.
7150860	7155340	I've never been as nervous as I am now giving a seminar in front of 20 people in the physics
7155340	7164860	department. That's a great story. Every guy wants to be a rock star and so what are rock stars
7164860	7170780	want to be? I don't know, I guess astrophysicists or something. That's really funny. All right, Tim,
7170780	7171580	thank you so much.
