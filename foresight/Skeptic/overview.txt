 Certainly! It seems that Michael Shermer, who you greeted, is still involved with the skeptical community and the Center for Inquiry (CFI) on a more informal basis. As a senior research fellow at CFI, he retains a connection with the organization but without any financial compensation. He contributes to their magazine "Free Inquiry" occasionally, and he has also written for "Skeptical Inquirer."

Recently, following Nick Little's unexpected resignation as the general counsel at CFI in October, Michael Shermer was asked to temporarily take on the legal duties that Nick held. This is to assist with ongoing litigation matters. Additionally, Michael Shermer has also become affiliated with other entities or projects in recent years, although the specifics of these new affiliations were not detailed in your message. Overall, he remains active and involved in the skeptical movement, contributing his expertise and insights when needed.

Checking Skeptic/An AI... Utopia？ (Nick Bostrom, Oxford).txt
在討論人工智能（AI）是否有意識的問題時，有幾種理論被提出來解釋如果AI可以像我們一樣經驗意識。其中最著名的理論是全局工作空間（GWT）理論，它提倫AI之間的數據和資源共享，使得不同的認知模型能夠讀取和寫入該共享空間中的信息。另一種理論是注意度方案理論（ATTN），它認為意識是對我們可能關注的事物所追蹤的注意力機制的上升。

這些理論可以被應用到AI上，從而推測某些AI已經有意識，或者使用當前技術建立一個有意識的AI相對容易。為了判斷AI是否有意識，我們可以通過提問來獲得信息，但必須避免在訓練AI時對其進行預先設定的回答。此外，我們可以尋找解釋性方法，以確定AI在某個操作模式下是否試圖說真話或者只是重複記憶中的事物，或者嘗試娛樂。

目前，一些研究表明，通過追蹤AI在說謊和試圖準確回答問題時的神經活動模式，可能會發現它是否有類似於嘗試準確回答其他問題的能力。這些方法可能會提供有關AI內部狀態的信息，包括它是否有意識，以及它當前是否有意識或者正在專注於某件事情等。

最終，這些探索可能會為我們提供一種方式來判斷AI的意識狀態，並且這將對未來的道德考量至關重要。因為隨著技術的進步，大多數思想可能會變成數位形式，我們需要確保這些數位思想也得到適當的尊重和照顧。

Checking Skeptic/Cancel Culture and What to Do About It (Greg Lukianoff & Rikki Schlott).txt
1. **Fire (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education)**: An organization founded by Alan Charles Kors and Harvey A. Silverglate that defends individual rights on college campuses, particularly the right of free speech.
   - Recently, Fire successfully fought against the Stop Woke Act, which aimed to restrict discussion about race and gender in certain educational institutions.
   - Fire is also involved in a legal challenge against a California policy that requires professors to incorporate DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) concepts into their teaching, arguing it infringes on academic freedom and free speech.
   - The case draws on the precedent set by the 1943 Supreme Court decision West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, which ruled that students cannot be compelled to salute the flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance based on the First Amendment.

2. **Academic Freedom vs. Institutional Commitments**: While private institutions like religious schools can set their own speech and academic freedom policies, many such institutions also have strong free speech commitments.
   - Some institutions, like Georgetown, may be criticized for not fully upholding these commitments, leading to lower rankings in free speech indexes.
   - An example of controversy involving free speech was the backlash against Ilya Shapiro for his comments on President Biden's Supreme Court nominee selection criteria.

3. **Rawlsian Perspective**: A Rawlsian approach (referring to John Rawls' "A Theory of Justice") would suggest that in the original position, where individuals select principles without knowing their own place or properties in society, they would not choose a principle that allows for the selection of a Supreme Court justice based on race or gender because it could be perceived as unfair.
   - However, some argue that considering race and gender is necessary to correct historical injustices.

4. **Michael's Role**: Michael is associated with Fire and discusses these issues in the context of protecting free speech and academic freedom. He also laments the loss of subscribers from Scientific American, which he previously supported.

Checking Skeptic/Robert Sapolsky on Free Will and Determinism.txt
 In this conversation between Robert Wright and you, the discussion covers a range of topics including the nature of consciousness, free will, utopia, and the afterlife. Here are some key points and takeaways from the dialogue:

1. **Consciousness**: Wright notes that our subjective experience of consciousness is like a movie we cannot perceive behind the scenes—it feels immediate and present, but we don't see the brain processes that create it.

2. **Free Will**: The discussion touches on the concept of free will and how our perception of making choices can lead us to attribute those choices to an inherent self or soul, which might be a byproduct of our cognitive processes.

3. **Utopia and Morality**: Wright expresses concern that in pursuit of utopia, some might sacrifice others who oppose their vision. This raises ethical questions about how societies handle care for the elderly and other vulnerable populations.

4. **Theism vs. Atheism**: The conversation references the argument that without God, everything is permissible, including atrocities like those committed by Hitler. Wright argues for the importance of establishing good justice now because the afterlife's nature is uncertain.

5. **Afterlife Beliefs**: The discussion includes skepticism about life after death, with the idea that humans are natural dualists and may struggle to imagine non-existence since they can't conceive of a time when they didn't exist.

6. **Book Promotion**: Wright is promoting his upcoming book, which has a publication date in mid-October. He mentions upcoming debates, including one with Bob Meister, author of "Evil," and expresses anticipation for these discussions.

7. **Influence of Psychological Research**: The conversation highlights the impact of psychological research on our understanding of human behavior, including the role of self-esteem and sociopathic tendencies in criminal actions.

8. **Self-Reflection**: Wright encourages more self-reflection to understand how our perceptions of free will and agency might be influenced by cognitive biases and to recognize moments when they are not as present as we believe them to be.

The conversation is a deep dive into the philosophical, psychological, and ethical challenges of understanding human nature, consciousness, and the quest for meaning in a world where the existence of an afterlife is uncertain.

Checking Skeptic/Why is it “There’s a 10% chance of rain” instead of “It will be sunny tomorrow”？ (Tim Palmer).txt
1. **Gould and Feynman's Encounter**:
   - Anecdote about Richard Feynman and Stephen Jay Gould meeting at a conference dinner.
   - Feynman, not being familiar with Gould's work on punctuated equilibrium, was making incorrect statements about evolution.
   - Gould graciously explained the concept without revealing Feynman's ignorance to others at the table.

2. **Understanding Evolution**:
   - Evolution is not just natural selection; it includes other mechanisms like genetic drift and sexual selection.
   - The example of female butterflies having different camouflage patterns in competition, which cannot be explained solely by natural selection.

3. **Gould's Advice on Research**:
   - Scientists should know what has already been discovered to avoid repeating errors that have already been addressed.

4. **Tim Palmer's Work and Future Project**:
   - Tim Palmer is a climate scientist whose book "Storms of My Grandchildren" explains climate change in layman's terms.
   - He is also a theoretical physicist and has written papers on the predictability of weather systems.
   - His upcoming work, "Quantum Physics from Number Theory," aims to explore insights into quantum physics using number theory and the properties of whole numbers.

5. **Creativity and Science**:
   - Tim Palmer plays in a village rock and roll band as a creative outlet, separate from his scientific pursuits.
   - He does not find a direct connection between playing music and doing science, but sees both as sources of joy and emotional release.
   - Reference to Queen's Brian May, who is also an astrophysicist and found public speaking in academia more nerve-wracking than performing in front of large crowds.

In summary, Tim Palmer discussed the importance of understanding evolution beyond natural selection, his interdisciplinary work as a scientist, and his future project that combines number theory with quantum physics. He also shared a personal anecdote about the legendary physicist Richard Feynman and emphasized the value of being well-informed about prior scientific research to avoid repeating past errors.
