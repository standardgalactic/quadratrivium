Checking Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence/AI： Intelligent, Conscious, or Merely Evil？ Peter Thiel from COSM 2022..txt
1. **Slow Progress in Many Fields**: Since the 80s and 90s, when computer science made significant strides, progress in other engineering fields like aerospace, nuclear engineering, mechanical, and chemical has been much slower. The advancements require substantial investment and infrastructure, making it more challenging for individuals or smaller entities to innovate.

2. **Semiconductor Industry**: The semiconductor industry, which is critical for technological advancement, requires enormous scale and investment. This includes expensive equipment like ASML machines for lithography, making it difficult for new companies to enter the market and for venture capitalists to invest due to the high cost and complexity involved.

3. **China's Development**: China is working to catch up with Western technology but currently relies on chemical methods instead of advanced lithography equipment like ASML. Although there are hurdles, it's not inconceivable that China could eventually converge with current technological capabilities.

4. **Global Competition**: The competition between countries, particularly the US and China, is intense, with national security and economic dominance at stake. The rate of new innovations is not as rapid as it once was, which means countries like China have a realistic chance of catching up if they continue to advance.

5. **Venture Capital**: Venture capitalists are investing less in semiconductors due to the complexity and scale required, indicating a shift towards larger businesses dominating the field.

6. **Peter's Perspective**: Peter Thiel, the speaker, acknowledges these challenges and expresses concern about the slow pace of technological progress in areas other than computer science, highlighting the need for new approaches and breakthroughs to maintain a technological edge over countries like China.
