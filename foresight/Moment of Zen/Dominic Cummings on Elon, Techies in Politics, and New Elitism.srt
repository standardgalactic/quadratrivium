1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
When I was doing all these focus groups last year one of the interesting things that came up all the time was people saying like

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,520
Democrats or swing voters not Maga people would say

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,900
Yeah, you know what? We do need a wall. We need a wall around California

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,820
Stop basic shit escaping and washing over the rest of the country

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,000
They see the same videos right if like the homeless people like walking zombies with machetes in their hands and they

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Want that we don't want this everywhere. Yeah, this is happening. Yeah, too

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,240
So it can happen again that that's the opportunity it can happen

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,280
But the thing is that people people either stay and they put down roots and they get woke or they make a pile of money

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,980
And they leave that's it like no one actually invests in San Francisco. That's the problem

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,120
In one sense like you can't really get

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,640
PR or a story stronger than what Hamas did and to me the actual interesting thing there is right

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,720
That's like pretty much bad as it gets right

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,440
It's like sort of filming the torture to chambers of the NKVD and the Gestapo in Eastern Europe

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
But within like 10 days, it's basically

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:12,320
The NPCs in the media just go back to the script basically only not the most ripped for you know, like a few new cycles

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Like maybe 10 days

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,440
It's funny right before this Dominic I tweeted I'm about to talk to Dominic Cummings

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,640
What should I ask and someone actually chime in some bigger questions?

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,880
So I was just reading those before so I've got some some great follow-ups that I think we want your input on

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,720
But yeah, on the right wing left wing thing

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
I am a bit of a Fukuyama fanboy

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
and I think

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,360
He's he's vast not that I think you are to be clear, but I think he's vastly misunderstood people

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,560
Don't read through the 40 chapters of reinterpreted Hegel

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,920
They barely even repest the title it and his and of course the best chapter in that book is actually the last chapter

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,800
in which he actually he predicts a lot of the sort of

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,760
you know

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,440
Philosophical on we and melez that we currently see in the West right and he actually predicted in some sense the rise of

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,360
Wokeness or sort of perverted liberalism that would turn out turning on itself

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
You know Fukuyama's point just

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Sort of

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
He goes

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,840
That last chapter which I agree with you. I think it's the book

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,500
He goes into some detail in in to Nietzsche's critique of modern liberal

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
and

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,280
And that is forgotten. You're right in the way that people talk about that book

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
They always get the last chapter. Yeah, and just to summarize there

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,920
I've done a whole piece on it defending. I'm actually in my in my sub stack

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
You know when he said the end of history

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
He didn't mean obviously that that things would stop happening in the world

41
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,800
What he meant is that the the arc of political evolution

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,760
However far back you want to draw it from hunter-gatherer tribes to the agricultural revolution

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,360
You know middle-aged the theocratic dynasties the imperial age nation whatever whatever that arc is

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,520
It kind of ends with liberal capitalism, right?

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,120
Because the original Marxist idea Marx originally predicted that communism to come after liberal capitalism had yeah

46
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,320
had triumphed in a way to come up and divide the spoils and deal with the inevitable inequality they had dealt with but the

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,520
Fukuyama in charge is like no no no, that's a we're not we're probably not going to regress to a darker age

48
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,760
Although we might but we're definitely not advancing into some sort of socialist utopia

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Like this is as good as it gets liberal capitalism

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,440
end of story that and and the Nietzschean angle like he he quotes thus bake our a sister a lot in which again to summarize very

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,680
Quickly what is a complex work?

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,520
There are supposed to be these men with hollow chests who live at the end who have given up the passions

53
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,280
And the mad joys of tribalism war, you know pestilence wars of ethno-nationalic

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
I you know ethno-nationalist identity which is funny to say in the context of Israel, which I want to get to as well

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,600
But in some sense in that book

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,960
I think he actually explicitly says the European Union would be the final retirement home of the last man like that the European project in

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
some sense was the home of the last man and

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,880
In some sense with the far right you're seeing it's unwinding potentially exactly also with you know with with the growth of Putin and

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
You know the way the EU

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:07,080
In lots of ways, I think that's exactly right and Brussels has tried to live out that role in many ways right over the last 10 years. I mean

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,160
15 years ago when I would say to people I

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,560
Used to live in Russia. I met people like Putin

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,920
He is not what you think this whole idea that like he's some kind of like quite moderate reformer and a technocrat and

64
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,040
Russia's going to join the EU in you know in a few decades time. This is all completely insane and

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,960
You're all gonna get a terrible shock by this and it was an incredibly at that time

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,600
It was a very serious like a very extreme view

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:47,280
Even two or three years ago. No Britain and Europe were basically pretty happy with the state of squo in which London is the laundry for the Russian mafia

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,280
Energy keeps flowing to to Germany very cheaply

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,840
And we just kind of like draw fail over a lot of the KGB oligarch behavior

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,200
People didn't want to face it

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,640
So when Trump came over and pointed out some of these things it became a meme with everyone in the EU literally laughing at Trump

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,840
About the about the Nord Stream pipeline and warning, right? I mean, of course like now nobody gives Trump any credit for being for being

73
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Be correct about it

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,520
But that sort of shows the extent to which I think the Brussels just didn't want to face these kind of issues and still doesn't

75
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,920
Okay, I've got a random question. It's a slight detour Eric

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,960
But maybe you'll let me go crazy with the agenda one conversation speaking of the house of the last man

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,560
By the way, I love the house of the last bed like the post history is actually pretty cozy

78
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,120
I was in Lisbon recently and I was in Paris recently. My daughter is actually moving to France. She's a Franco

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
She's a she speaks French. She went to the DC here

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,720
I'd be I'd love my child to grow up in Paris, right?

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,800
And I think, you know, one of the base that we have in the group is you know

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,040
It's kind of around the spread of wokeness that you know

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,600
This whole this whole business of things going squishy a total dedication to equality a fallen standards

84
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,480
Like a lot of things are just kind of going soft

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,960
What I found interesting for example, and again, I'm actually driving at a point here in the case for example

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,280
The Paris rights that happened this this summer that in its contours kind of felt a little bit like the BLM phenomenon in the United States

87
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,080
Which as you know kind of in the in the COVID tizzy became like a whole thing a whole moral panic that kind of sees the West

88
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,000
You saw it explode in the UK

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,160
I think the the Anglo-Saxon English speaking world is definitely kind of a thing and I think the UK

90
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,560
Here is the echoes very loudly of the American political zeitgeist

91
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I think those echoes are heard much less loudly on the continent and you saw what happened in Paris that the legendaries would

92
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,480
Showed up and the riot police and they crushed it and that was the end of it

93
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,160
Did not extend from there and I told the group look this Anglo-Protestant software does not run on Latin Catholic hardware

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,920
It's just not gonna wokeness is not gonna spread to the continent in the way that you're expecting

95
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,720
Like I is that true or am I am I misreading food?

96
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,300
Mean I think you've definitely got something of a point like there's definitely a kind of common Anglo-American

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Several problems

99
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,440
Partly connected with the fact that our that's that's our universities and our media are much more similar right the media and

100
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Oxford and Harvard

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,480
BBC in New York Times

102
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,160
There's just much much more crossover than there is between either Britain and France or America and France

103
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,480
So I think extent it's definitely true on the other hand of course

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,720
There's many many layers of irony the whole thing, but

105
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
it

106
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,160
To a very large extent the kind of crazy

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,640
Philosophical origins of the whole I don't even like using the word woke because I think it's a mistake, but that's phenomenon

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,000
It is itself a product of continental philosophy right transported over to America

109
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,600
Christie's post-war and growing particularly in the 60s and then infiltrating humanities departments and social science departments and

110
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,800
Everything else though. Obviously like the the Allen Bloomsburg closing American mind is

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,760
It's partly a kind of trace of the if this intellectual current so

112
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,040
In that sense, I think that probably like the long-term trajectory

113
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,640
I think still similar in Europe and you can see it in Brussels

114
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,840
You know, it's still following. We're all basically downstream of the madness of San Francisco like it's different

115
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,960
But you're everywhere in Europe is downstream of

116
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,480
San Francisco's and sciencey. It's just a question. Is is that so true because I I think you're right

117
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,800
But the joke has always been in the United States that San Francisco is five years ahead of the US

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,400
And then whatever that madness is is roughly five years ahead of Europe

119
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,600
I think the time scales have actually compressed. It's more like a year

120
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,800
But you still think it's downstream of of the city. I'm speaking to you from

121
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Exactly. Yeah

122
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,600
What do you know that the time to go is this

123
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,960
This kind of insane Petri dish of experimentation

124
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,600
The the Berkeley itself was like, you know, the kind of radical center of a lot of the so 67 68

125
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,760
Craziness, right? And and that kind of that impetus never died away. It's kept pushing

126
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,400
and

127
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,360
these things just have a have an incredible tendency to

128
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,520
Wash East know if you'd said

129
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,040
If you'd started to watch some of the just let's take for example some of the crazy shit on trans right

130
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,160
Now if you'd said a few years ago, okay, there's like a full-stack system in

131
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,560
Northern California

132
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
whereby kids are

133
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,560
Brainwashed into this crazy shit and then there's actually like you can go to Stanford Medical Center and they'll and they'll start

134
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,600
Giving you surgery and start talking about taking out ovaries from 12 year olds

135
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,720
And that's in Europe that I said that this is completely insane like that couldn't possibly happen

136
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
It actually sounds like child abuse

137
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,040
Ten years later here we all are right with this dealing with the same shit

138
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,480
So speaking of San Francisco one topic I wanted to get to we can't I guess we can just jump to it if we're following this

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,640
This you know bizarre sort of this this tour. So

140
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,440
We were talking recently Dominic or I know some of the people

141
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
So there's like an SF reform movement going on right there's some people

142
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,280
I think that we all know that who by the way are very well respected in tech more broadly like people like Gary Tan

143
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,680
Who has made quite a name?

144
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,920
He runs Y Combinator which speaking of influential organizations hugely

145
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,440
I went through it myself hugely influential organization people like David Sacks who was early on a PayPal a bunch of companies huge investor are

146
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,120
Putting real money and time into trying to change the politics of San Francisco

147
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
I think this is exactly what you just said

148
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,200
Which is the way I've dealt with it having lived here off and on for almost two decades is like it's not really a city

149
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't expect saying city behavior. It is a Petri dish in which we will say oh psychedelic drugs game on or rule of law

150
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,560
Who needs it defund the police? Oh, let's see what happens or you know autonomous vehicles, you know, what's gonna happen, right?

151
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,520
Yeah, that said some people do care about seriously, which I support by the way

152
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,440
And they definitely want to reform it and change it and we were kind of studying the reasons as to why

153
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,080
We think it was broken. I I'll just toss that theory out there

154
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,720
You're filled free to disagree on and riff in another direction

155
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,680
But I think part of the problem with San Francisco is twofold

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,280
One there's endemic corruption going back decade. I mean going back to the gold rush days

157
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,920
It's always been just a pit of corruption at the city level and it's no different now

158
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,880
It's just masquerading under progressive politics in my opinion. There's a whole homeless industrial SF has the second highest municipal budget in the United States

159
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,680
I think over 11 billion dollars at this point. It's only a city of roughly seven to eight hundred thousand people

160
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,520
It's not a very big city. It has the second biggest municipal budget in the United States after New York

161
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,440
Where does that money go? You look you walk around it doesn't seem as if this is a well-funded city

162
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,760
It looks like a dystopia frankly

163
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,360
It's funny

164
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,960
I retweeted a photo recently someone posted of an autonomous vehicle in front of a homeless guy stealing electricity charges laptop

165
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,640
And that's exactly literally what I've described it as autonomous vehicles navigating around homeless people people think it's a joke

166
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
But that's literally what it is when you walk outside

167
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,520
so it's a combination of corruption and I think the other thing is and and to you know

168
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,640
Give a little shade to the tech people tech people fundamentally don't deeply care about politics

169
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,480
I think you have opinions on this

170
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,600
I think they just you know you go to a museum here and whoever funds it funds it

171
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
But like there's not a Google hospital or like a Facebook

172
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,240
I mean Zuck gives a fair amount of money you go to New York and even the biggest wall speed asshole has endowed like a wing of

173
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,560
You know Cornell Medical Center or whatever the latest exhibit is at the Met in San Francisco

174
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,480
That's less so people to it's a gold rush town people the miners come in either make a fortune and stick around or move to Marin

175
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,680
Or they leave and that's it. No, no one's kind of from here and no one really invests in a deep way

176
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,160
Although to be clear that's changing people like Gary. I think we're changing that

177
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,160
Any that's just all framing. What do you think it would take to fix San Francisco?

178
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,280
And we come can we maybe convince you to try to help fix it by coming to San Francisco?

179
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I mean

180
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,280
What you say makes sense to me, but I

181
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,200
Guess like the obvious question is like the people who accept obviously is crime gets worse crime is obviously

182
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
often a very big issue in politics, right and

183
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
logic

184
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,200
San Francisco earlier this year like I turned the wrong corner

185
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,020
I went down a street and then suddenly felt like I've walked into like some kind of a poor leg

186
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
And literally had to run back down out the street

187
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,040
Really like 90 seconds for a way. There's like people coming around as if it's like perfectly normal. It's just

188
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,120
Hey, I then went and spoke to some people that night. I had dinner in Palo Alto and they're like

189
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,640
Fucking like you're in San Francisco. Like I haven't been there in like for you for you

190
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,780
I think I know I live in I live in London. I think I visit San Francisco more often than a lot of people in

191
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Which maybe says something about

192
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,960
As you say about the disconnection between the tech world and the city but of the people who were left

193
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,680
Well

194
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,840
What so here's a question why why?

195
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,760
hasn't

196
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,800
Independence obviously Republicans have completely do but why haven't independence

197
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,880
Campaigning on crime and corruption being able to make any progress when it's when it's like when it's a global punchline

198
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,720
For like videos of apocalyptic dystopia

199
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,920

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,920
I

219
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,040
Think it's so the first time I ever got dog piled on Twitter was I don't know how many years ago

220
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,080
It was I guess in 2015 or 16 when they passed this thing called prop C

221
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,920
That was a tax on gross revenues, which is nuts particularly for tech businesses

222
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
To basically give more money to the homeless industrial complex even though it wasn't working

223
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,360
And I think I calculated how much money you would raise

224
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,000
Divided it by the number of homeless people and realized that it was as much money for homeless people as like the base salary as a Google engineer

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,440
They were literally put it falling that much money

226
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
And I'm like how is this possible?

227
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,160
I got totally dog piled and ripped apart now if you go and

228
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,760
Criticize the homeless industrial complex or even call it that you don't get dog piled

229
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,880
And in fact, there's a whole set of people who are there with you saying yeah

230
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,160
We need to fix this and so I think the the vibe has definitely changed. There's been something like the recall of

231
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,920
Chesa Boudin who was literally the son of communist cop killers

232
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,000
It sounds like I'm making it up

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,200
But that actually who works for Chavez in Venezuela like it sounds like a like a punchline

234
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,240
But it's actually his biography and he got elected district a turret like the prop the equivalent of like the prosecutor, right?

235
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,560
And then it was like so outrageous he finally got kicked out

236
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,000
So I think some of that is happening and that was a crime issue. That was literally there is no law in order to get rid of this guy

237
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,640
So yeah, that that is I think that is happening to a certain degree. I guess though that so what one thing that

238
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,720
Possibly behind it. I don't know you tell me is that I found

239
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
So when I wrote this thing in 2021 saying

240
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,960
Like we're heading towards Biden Trump to like everyone thinks the Trump's finished and it's not going to come back

241
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:46,720
But actually we're heading towards Biden Trump to and let's Silicon Valley people decide to intervene and build alternatives

242
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,440
I spent some time talking to people there and the and the basic a problem that I had was people said

243
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:03,760
We largely agree with what you're saying and we largely agree that if it just ends up doing it as Trump Biden to that's obviously terrible, but

244
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,920
Precisely because politics has got so insane in the ways that you described

245
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,840
It's exactly why it's totally impossible for me and my friends and other people here who've got anything to actually get involved with it

246
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,440
Because it would just be instantly completely destructive and I'd

247
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,520
My family and my friends and my investors and my staff would all think I'd literally lost my fucking mind

248
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,120
If I suddenly said we're gonna build an alternative to Biden, you know, we've got to do something different

249
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:42,280
So it does seem to be this kind of catch-away to and it's similar catch-away to in Britain. I think that

250
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,600
As political as the kind as establishment politics becomes more insane and

251
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,920
The kind of communist mind virus expands and expands into the mainstream media as well

252
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:01,200
And they attack and trying to destroy the lives and careers of anyone who gets involved with politics

253
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,960
It doesn't share the kind of approach

254
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,640
Then it then there is this paradox where

255
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,440
Able people entrepreneurs builders people who could do it much better

256
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,760
Want to more and more and the probably more inclined to get involved with politics in one sense

257
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,000
And they were 10 15 years ago whether like politics is we know, whatever

258
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,200
Vote Obama and get on with building my my trillion dollar company

259
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,520
The the more inclined to get involved in one sense, but in another sense the madness is like it is system

260
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Is a great room greater barrier?

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
As I know

262
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,600
I think that makes sense

263
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,000
I think yeah, I think the problem with techies is that not that they can't be political or be operators because they can they end up having

264
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,160
These large organizations, but I think a couple things one

265
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,360
The whole techie vibe just gives a lot of mainstream normie voters the ick to use zoomeries, which is like

266
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,320
It's just a different sort of vibe what it takes to make

267
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,160
I mean look at Mark Zuckerberg who I worked for I was at at Facebook 10 years ago on early members

268
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,880
I actually think very highly of them and I said as much in my memoir, but you know like you know that guy couldn't sell free

269
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
beer, I mean, it's just

270
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,080
It's just one of those things. I mean maybe now

271
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Maybe but he also pissed off a lot of people like we raised the question

272
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,920
I could either run for mayor of San Francisco and win and I'm not I'm not sure he could actually even among techies

273
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,160
He may not be able to he actually might have a better chance and like Reno, Nevada

274
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,320
But you know, which is definitely more red than San Francisco than he wanted San Francisco

275
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,280
Yeah, I mean, I think he was a great example of this public right because he got someone who

276
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,960
Was actually a hero to lots of people on the left even just three to five years ago

277
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
He was very

278
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,600
Explicitly and openly saying I would change this a bit to you. That's why I'm going to do electric cars

279
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,040
And this is why we're going to do space exploration and etc etc etc and

280
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,080
But even someone with the

281
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
success that he had and

282
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,280
the kind of backstory of actually being on the side of the

283
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,600
Progressive supposes like one of the top three biggest causes

284
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,280
As soon as you basically put a couple of feet out of line with the establishment view

285
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,160
They just immediately said oh, you're a Nazi and we've got to start, you know

286
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,700
Having the DOJ investigate you and maybe we should take all your shit

287
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:40,320
And that's no, I mean I've had to me don't you know, like if if if Elon can go from being like

288
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,960
Global love figure to global hate figure in like 18 months then imagine what they could do to me, right?

289
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,080
And you're seeing it now as a as a side thing. I mean, you know relevant

290
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:01,100
Elon just went to Israel and inside of Twitter. I Jewish Twitter. It's a whole kerfuffle because a lot of sort of mainstream

291
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,260
bien penson liberal American Jews dislike Elon one for like

292
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,220
Applying snarkily to some vaguely anti-semitic tweet, maybe and also just maintaining a Twitter platform in which I mean to be blunt

293
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,380
There are kind of open anti-Semites on Twitter now

294
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,020
And they haven't been banned, right?

295
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,140
But he's definitely not he's obviously not telling the party line when it comes to content moderation on Twitter

296
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,860
But this is a guy who by the way went some of the places

297
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,740
I went to actually and reported from for tablet magazine like the actual keep it seem right in the Gaza border

298
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,860
He was seen wearing body armor in one of them because it actually is dangerous down like I was down there

299
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,580
It's a war zone. So the guy actually went there I spray set up met with hostages

300
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,100
Accepted a gift that I'm not taking off till you get your hostages back basically said. Yeah, Hamas has to be destroyed

301
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:49,220
This is this is unacceptable and he's still he's still being pillared as an anti-Semite because of his like content moderation policies on

302
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,940
Twitter, which are definitely not the sort of the sort of policies that the left would want. It's just it

303
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
Yeah, you just shaking my head

304
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,580
SMH

305
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,220
Yeah, I don't really think it's to do with content moderation though

306
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,660
I think it's I think it's a I think it's a much broader thing. He just he signaled that he is not with

307
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,380
the main

308
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,500
All right, and the way that the Ukraine war kind of

309
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,660
Coordinated in a very in a pretty unusual way

310
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
like establishment position

311
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
establishment politicians and media in

312
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,420
Washington and London and across Europe very quickly and

313
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,540
Anyone who stood out against that

314
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
I have I have the same thing here like

315
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:40,400
I've been like I've been like the one one in a thousand or one in ten thousand anti-putin for 20 years

316
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,220
Regarded as madly extreme in my anti-putin this right

317
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,500
Literally the whole thing just flipped because I said I think this war is a fuck up. I don't think there's an actual strategy

318
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,900
It's gonna end in tears. We're gonna get bored and then have to finish it for the news

319
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,260
Well, you're obviously a paid Putin shell your

320
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:03,620
Fascist Apologies, you're an evil perk the whole thing. So I think

321
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,980
He did he bought Twitter he said I'm pro free speech and he didn't tell the didn't tell the line on on Ukraine

322
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,500
All in short order and that was enough seemed to me

323
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,180

I

338
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,340
Wasn't so Torrenberg here is actually the son of Israeli Jew and I converted actually just so you know the company you're keeping her down

339
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
I

340
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:32,620
I went to Israel recently and you know, obviously, I'm pretty public about being kind of pro-Israel and what they're doing in the war

341
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,420
one thing that people have commented on and I

342
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,660
I tend to agree with it

343
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:43,300
Israeli PR is like terrible like they're just not cracking the nut when it comes to the West I have theories as to why but before I

344
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,260
Contaminate the the vibe. I'm curious if you agree with that

345
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,620
What is your take on Israel? What is your take on their PR strategy? Can they even win the PR war?

346
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
well, I think so a

347
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,380
Few things right

348
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,580
Ironically like the whole kind of you know Russia was involved with Trump in 2016 story was obviously complete bullshit

349
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,340
right, but

350
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:10,780
There was a major KGB operation from the 1960s to try and shape Western perception about

351
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
Israel in a negative way

352
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
that was highly successful and

353
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,860
Ended up influencing all kinds of publications in the West including publications read by people like Jeremy Corbyr, right?

354
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,900
The guy who took over the lay of party here who's like crazy

355
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,460
extreme anti

356
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:32,340
anti-Israel so you have like almost became and almost became PM to be clear

357
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:39,860
Yeah, it's within like 12,000 vote 12,000 votes distributed in different seats and and he would have been Prime Minister in 2017

358
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,740
Yeah, exactly um

359
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:49,300
So there's those like very long-term currents which have programmed the intelligentsia here for

360
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:57,620
For decades in ways which I think are almost like not one in 10,000 people know the history of this and quite understand

361
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,620
What what like how this actually worked?

362
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
You also though have

363
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,100
It's clear talking to people there that the you know Netanyahu does not have a grip of the whole Prime Minister's office

364
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,300
It's chaotic Prime Minister's office does not coordinate well with Mossad and other parts of the deep state in Israel

365
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,900
So like there is no concerted problem messaging

366
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,780
Either

367
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,580
So I think in a kind of tactical operational sense that's in that's important

368
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:32,420
But also though, I think there's like a psychological problem, which is that they keep they think that

369
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,100
They think

370
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,580
They make what I think is like a common problem, which is they think it's basically about facts

371
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:46,740
they think oh these we watch this terrible news from the BBC or whatever and

372
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,300
These people don't know the truth and if we explain the actual facts about Hamas and explain blah blah blah

373
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,140
Then it'll suddenly change somehow

374
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,980
And so they keep trying to hammer it with certain PR strategies of the Western media

375
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
But I think it's just fundamentally

376
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,180
flawed

377
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,060
because I don't think it's about facts like the

378
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,140
Sad truth is that BBC like all the broadcasters

379
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,700
They have a long-term moral simple moral story about why Israel are

380
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,060
Is an apartheid state and their occupiers

381
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,100
And everything all information filters into this simple story and then filters out

382
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,940
Right, and then and that's it. It doesn't it doesn't require it doesn't work on the basis of facts

383
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,100
It doesn't work on the basis of reason doesn't work on the basis of logic

384
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,380
So I think any PR strategy which tries to combat it with facts and reason and logic is just is doomed

385
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,420
but it's like

386
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,660
It's a bit like in a way like in a small in a small scale obviously

387
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,500
But just in terms of what you were saying before about about Zuckerberg

388
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,660
When the first crazy

389
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,020
Carol card one of the stories came out in 2016 about

390
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,580
Russia and Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and all of that

391
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,100
Facebook sort of thought well, this is all such obvious bullshit and like it doesn't reflect how digital advertising actually works

392
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,540
We'll explain some facts and then everyone will realize what the truth is

393
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,420
They didn't understand that they were actually caught up in them in a in a moral story, right?

394
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,900
But the whole point was evil tech companies have helped the evil fascists

395
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:34,300
So just explaining to you at times guys like your coverage doesn't actually understand what how digital marketing works

396
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,740
And if we you know, we'll explain to you how digital marketing works and then you know, there's terrible coverage

397
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,980
We'll go away who's that work in Facebook like clearly operating like this for like three years

398
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,380
And then in the end they why don't we just keep getting fucked it like what's going on here?

399
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:55,300
But that's why right because they're trying to deal with logic in facts about something that's sort about logic in facts

400
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,820
Yeah, and I found that same trap. So my book came out in 2016, which is a memoir, which you know was a very kind of

401
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,660
Inside truthy. What's that? I read it great. Oh, great. Oh, thank you. Great. Thanks. Yeah

402
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,260
And I yeah, I actually met that Carol Calder were a figure once at some festival and yeah

403
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,020
Yeah, and it's worth noting that in her career career before being a journalist

404
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,060
I'm using air quotes for those listening to a podcast. She was a novelist

405
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,380
Which I think is probably where her talent should have remained because given

406
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,980
Literally everything she wrote about Facebook was completely fictional, but I also felt. Oh, yeah

407
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,660
No, no, no, I'm gonna explain how digital marketing works as I've been on the inside

408
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,660
It got nowhere it meant it meant nothing

409
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,220
Everyone still thinks that the Russian influence campaign or that this came to analytical thing was real and yeah, you're right

410
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220
I mean it was just hopeless at the end

411
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,660
But but getting back to Israel like I mean

412
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,980
Once like kind of argument is that like the videos that first came out of like the barbaric attacks did have some impact

413
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,940
Like there was a window of like one week of grace period in which world-dependent seemed to be kind of pro-Israel as you saw

414
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:02,140
Literally the most barbaric and heinous atrocities being committed like literally live streamed by the people actually committing it

415
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,180
And I think, you know, I saw the famous 46 minute video

416
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:12,700
That's even like more gory of what Hamas did as did Douglas Murray and other journalists and they've reacted very strongly to it

417
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,660
I included it in my piece and tablet about what's going on there. So

418
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,340
to some degree I think and I think truth does help but

419
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,940
Getting back to like you're right. It doesn't fit into the narrative like this poster business

420
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,540
Which has driven me crazy right this business of ripping down. I've put kidnapped posters

421
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,500
Just on that point because I think that's an important thing right

422
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,980
In one sense like you can't really get

423
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,420
PR or a story stronger than what Hamas did

424
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:47,460
And to me the actual interesting thing there is right, that's like pretty much bad as it gets right

425
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:53,180
It's like sort of filming the torture to chambers of the NKVD and the Gestapo in Eastern Europe

426
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,220
But within like 10 days, it's basically

427
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,180
The NPCs in the media just go back to the script

428
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,180
So even

429
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,420
Mentally

430
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,580
Appalling as that and as powerful as that basically only knocks them off script for you know

431
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,020
Like a few new cycles like maybe 10 days and then they're back to oh Israel's destroyed a hospital in Gaza. I

432
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Know right. It's crazy. It's like imagine the Nazis had like live streamed Auschwitz and then like two weeks later people were like

433
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,180
Wow, I don't know were they really shoved in ovens did this expert of

434
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,260
Exactly, I don't know that they know the dead German civilian count is higher than the British one

435
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,020
I think we should have a ceasefire. That's clearly what we should do now

436
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,820
That was clear the tenor of the conversation in 1943 at 10 downing

437
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,820
Yeah, no, I agree with you. Um, yeah, and that I mean now

438
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,220
To me like like the people in Israel doing the communications

439
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,740
Understand this way. I feel so sorry for them because watching them it looked like it looks increasingly like that

440
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:08,980
Like doesn't the world sort of knows what Hamas did right, but it seems like we can't get traction with this

441
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,580
so like

442
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
repeating it or and

443
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
They seem to be like increasingly lost

444
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:20,900
As there's there's some realized like global opinion and the global media is away from the story

445
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:27,300
But they don't have like a follow-up plan. No, I think so, you know, I've got lots of Israeli friends

446
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
I've Israeli business partners. I was there for a while

447
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,420
Who knows I may move there one these days

448
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,180
I think the problem with Israel and I said this in my piece is like the Israelis

449
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,300
Israel is a fascinating country with the fascinating people. They don't realize how weird they are, right?

450
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,780
Like they're obviously very assimilated to like global American Anglo whatever Western business culture

451
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,180
They've obviously been very very successful as an economy GDP per capita

452
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,860
matching Germany in the UK's which is

453
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,300
More than 10x higher than any neighboring country. It's like they're very good at playing the Western game

454
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,580
But the internal Israeli nation narrative is completely unlike the West right now to the point that like

455
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,080
One of the questions I got from a friend of mine is like

456
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,500
How is it that the Western left is lining up with a theocratic death cult instead of like the Israeli left?

457
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,860
Which is actually super commie by the way, and it's funny like all these kibbutz that were attacked by Hamas

458
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,820
Like European press was calling them settlements. It's like do you have any idea what you're talking about?

459
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,980
This is literally the lefty tree hugging peaceniks who live in literal communism

460
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,140
Where they literally split up the income and live in the only functioning communism one confined in the West

461
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:33,780
That's who got attacked. That's who you're calling settlers and and and painting as the right, but that's the thing

462
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,780
I think the Israelis

463
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,400
How are they gonna sell the story they're a religious ethno-state like

464
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:46,300
That's square with a Western narrative in which oh, no, it's borderless. It's universalist anybody can be Norwegian

465
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,580
right like this business of the

466
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,860
You know the Irish the Algerian or whatever it was immigrant who like stabbed the kid in Ireland that they kept on saying

467
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,580
No, no, no, it's it's an Irish man. It's like no it isn't and the fact he isn't it's some of the material to the story

468
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,060
But you can't accept the fact that in fact not everybody can become an Irish man or whatever

469
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,940
And that's that's the collision like I'm not sure that Israel can be sold and at some point like my advice to them would like win

470
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,940
The war and just it doesn't matter what the West

471
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,380
But I mean you can see the kind of madness of the West right

472
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,980
The the most the most perfect example of it

473
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:27,340
The way that the most insane trans-right activist propaganda people have kind of joined forces

474
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,860
The first people who are all getting thrown off the roof

475
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,300
stat

476
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,580
of

477
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,780
mobilizing most aggressively on behalf of

478
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Hamas and Hezbollah

479
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,340
I understand the madness of Western. I mean to the first Israelis. It is pretty tough to understand that right

480
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,620
I mean, it's like, you know, joke is it's like chickens organizing for KFC. It's like I

481
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,740
Do you understand what the nature of the thing you're talking about is? Yeah

482
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,900
So maybe switching topics slightly to one of the questions and one of the things came up in our group

483
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,780
So, you know Dominic you, you know, I pretty clearly in Britain where things are pretty classic

484
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,540
So at least as far as I understand, I actually don't know the UK deeply well

485
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,700
I've lived in Spain and France, but I don't know the UK well

486
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
but but you have hovered in elite circles and

487
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,180
I've kind of dabble. I mean in tech, right?

488
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,060
Well, this is the real core of the question. What is an elite? What is the new elitism that's coming?

489
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,220
There's a lot of people that I think we all know who are from those elite circles are very financially

490
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,060
Capable and endowed and privileged and all that and they're not gonna send their kids to university, right?

491
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,020
Like they're just not gonna go the Harvard Cambridge route or whatever that is

492
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,420
And but they don't they don't have an alternative like they don't know what what's the other thing

493
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,180
So is there a new elite coming does there need to be a new elite like what?

494
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,100
What's your read on all that? I mean you have kids I assume. So this is like a real question for you

495
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,740
I

496
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,020
Mean a lot a lot of different questions bound up in that. I do think that

497
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,900
Was the one thing is you alluded to I

498
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,860
Think it's very interesting about this question like are we gonna send our

499
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,380
Like I've got a seven year old a seven year old kid

500
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,700
You know ten years ago

501
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,460
I would probably not really have even reflected on it much

502
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,980
But just would have assumed that obviously like I wanted to do certain kind of school and then

503
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,780
Ideally get into one of the top

504
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,740
universities in the Western world and I wouldn't have probably reflected on it much. Whereas now I

505
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,980
think

506
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,580
The opposite I think maybe in maybe in like 10 12 years

507
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,420
Like if he really wants to do maths and he's really good at maths

508
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:46,540
Then maybe he should still go to Cambridge or Harford if he can get into one of those two places, but barring that

509
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
It seems to me

510
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,820
Less likely with every day

511
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,900
That that's something that I would want him to go and spend his time in quite the opposite

512
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,740
So I do think that's a big issue

513
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,980
I

514
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,820
Hope that some of the rich people do what their

515
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Forefathers it

516
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,740
And actually go out and start new things. I also hope

517
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,300
It also strikes me that maybe there's an opportunity

518
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,820
To kind of jailbreak the maths and physics departments because a lot of the credibility of these universities

519
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,660
Why doesn't any more come from the history of the English department or whatnot?

520
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,660
Which is all just taken over by

521
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:37,180
By insane forces the credibility that they have left really comes from doing hard sciences

522
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,500
So maybe

523
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:44,940
You know one one thing I've been talking to some people about is the idea of could you say

524
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,140
Right, we're going to set up something

525
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:55,940
An offer faculty from maths physics, maybe computer science and say you only have to move like half a mile away

526
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,260
For work you don't have to move your family

527
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,380
But you can shift to a new institute which we're going to run

528
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,540
It's gonna be running the following ways

529
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,140
There's gonna be actual academic freedom all of the crazy communist shit is going to be completely forbidden

530
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
None of it's going to exist

531
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,300
and

532
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,900
Here's the kind of principles on which it will operate you'll get more money you'll get more freedom

533
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:22,380
You'll be able to move much faster. You know if you're a professor of physics now at Oxford

534
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,260
The amount that you can actually do

535
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:31,420
In any kind of time frame is like almost zero because the bureaucracy is so completely insane

536
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,260
So I think there are there are possibilities like that maybe for for creating different

537
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,220
For creating different institutions. It doesn't strike me as likely that in like 30 years time

538
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,260
The smartest kids are all going to be keeping going to these universities

539
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,260
And they're going to be

540
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
You know as mad as they are now politically

541
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,580
So something's going to something's going to change there. Are they going to break up and fracture?

542
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,060
Or people are going to create new things and pull away high status people

543
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
And a little change like that

544
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
And obviously

545
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,260
Yeah, so on the on the university front. I think that's but

546
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,820
Politically though the fundamental question is I think goes back to what we were talking about before

547
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:26,220
We've you know, we've we've seen in the western world this very big shift in elite talent

548
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,220
Where

549
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,540
You know 50 years ago or 70 years ago a huge number of the most able

550
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,420
Smartest people that could actually build things the general groves characters

551
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,020
Of people who built bletchley in britain, right?

552
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,700
These people have

553
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,260
Very largely stopped going into public service

554
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,620
So if you go to the the caliber of top civil servants now in in britain

555
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,220
And in washington is drastically lower

556
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,180
And more and more of the of the most able people are in some combination of maths money

557
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,740
pc

558
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,580
hedge funds

559
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,100
startup world

560
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,100
et cetera et cetera now

561
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,620
That obviously has all kinds of advantages from an economic perspective

562
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,980
But I think it's also disastrous from a government perspective

563
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,020
And some of these people are going to need to have to get

564
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,380
Again, I'm going to move back into politics. I think if it's going to change. We can't just have

565
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,340
all of our great builders

566
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,900
Operating as entrepreneurs in private companies whilst

567
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,260
you know the cia and the nsa and

568
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,980
white haired institutions

569
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,460
Just keep decaying and are less and less able to cope with with problems

570
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,580
But then the

571
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:49,820
Right, but then the question becomes do you sort of revitalize existing institutions or do you create new ones?

572
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
At the end of the day, I mean, I'm

573
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,300
Really in the camp. I mean having having done both in government

574
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,940
I very strongly think that um

575
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
The startup model is the way that

576
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,860
To go in government like if you're going to try if if your goal is

577
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,380
if you so if you're the new president you take over january 2025

578
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,220
and by

579
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,580
2030 20 20 20 35 you want a drastically reformed american military

580
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,580
Do you a

581
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:23,820
Try to do some kind of conventional reform project in the pentagon or b set up new institutions

582
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,380
That will just tunnel

583
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
around the bureaucracy

584
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:34,300
Empowered in different ways legally set up in different ways with completely different freedoms over hr

585
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,620
Over freedom of information over procurement over, you know, all of the bullshit

586
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:45,580
Which makes it just impossible to do any and it's obvious that you do be right. You don't say to the u.s. Air Force

587
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,780
Um, I mean, I've I'll give you like a classic example that I've actually had experience within government

588
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:58,220
What do you do with future planes? Well, of course the existing raf in britain doesn't want to do drones

589
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,660
Because the whole institutional structure and the whole way you get promoted is by being in charge of pilots

590
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,460
so

591
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,460
He fights against all

592
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:14,460
Against actually shifting to modern technology. So instead of trying to convince this old bureaucracy

593
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,180
To do the new thing you just set up as you set up the drone force, right?

594
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,980
You don't try and make the old thing do the new thing

595
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,740
You set up the new thing and you just shift money and power towards the new thing

596
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,420
um

597
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,580
You know, it is possible to reform things

598
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:36,860
And I've reformed some things. I spent a lot of time in the department of education changing things, but it's incredibly hard

599
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,020
It's incredibly slow

600
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,220
um

601
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,220
The forces against you are so massive and you've got to kind of get everything aligned

602
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:52,540
Just right. It's it's just much simpler to to to do startups in government that it is to to um

603
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,580
I'll give you a practical example of that as well

604
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,820
So we set up a new data science and ai team in number 10

605
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,700
Because it was new

606
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,140
It was actually much easier to create it seemed much less threatening

607
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:07,660
um

608
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:14,460
It didn't seem like it like this terrible challenge to existing power structures the way that telling a lot of existing things

609
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,540
That had to change would have been

610
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,580
Uh, of course now it's actually successful and it's doing all sorts of things

611
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,460
Of course part of the system are desperately trying to close it and destroy it because it shows everyone up

612
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,500
But it's super ours for the old parts of the system

613
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,980
But it certainly was much easier to get

614
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,460
that it was

615
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,460
You know persuade thousands of people to change

616
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,340
What if you're trying to become president?

617
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,620
In the first place you talk about, you know, if you do become president

618
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,380
But if you're trying to win in the first place, do you try to take over the left?

619
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:49,100
Do the democratic party? Do you try to take over the republican party? Do you start a new party?

620
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,340
How would you how would you think about that? I know you're interested in america 2024

621
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,340
Um

622
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Talk talk about that

623
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,900
I mean, I think practically speaking now in the states like the

624
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,940
I think the the die is cast on the republican side, right? Like trump is going to win the nomination now

625
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:11,580
This seems like a lot of donors are going to throw a lot of money down the toilet trying to back. Um, hailey. I think, um

626
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:20,300
She cut there's no campaign that she can run that can win like possibly trunk can blow himself up. Um, but uh

627
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
She she got

628
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,540
Time to do that as I said in 2021 was then um, and and and they've left all that too late. Um

629
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:36,300
I do think it's underrated with biden that uh, the kind of assumption seems to be that

630
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,860
Now he wants to do it. Therefore, he'll just keep doing it

631
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,500
I think an underrated scenario is that he just takes like another mental dip

632
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,140
And the polls blip down enough that it's just clear that trump is going to win

633
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:56,140
The electoral college and all the focus group reports start pinging back up through the system from the five six key states saying

634
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,500
Yeah, there's all this thing though to say that

635
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,780
Biden doesn't mean biden biden means either we've seen our biden gargar biden

636
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:10,060
They can't actually be president or it's going to be president kamala and we'd rather have trump than president kamala

637
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,580
So fuck it. We're gonna go for trump and as those focus group reports come back up

638
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,260
You can imagine panicking

639
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:21,740
Democratic party and they shove him out. So I do think it's underrated that biden could still get the that he could get pushed out

640
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,980
um

641
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,700
I mean it was a setting up a new party. So I did some focus group and polling research on this

642
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,220
um

643
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,220
last year in the states

644
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,180
And it was we we hit a kind of interesting problem like

645
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,340
Figuring out what a new party should say and do to be very popular

646
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,580
Was not so hard right which is generally a lesson of electoral politics

647
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,740
If you actually just listen and you want to figure it out

648
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,540
There's there's usually a way the problem that we found was that people said

649
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:59,020
Yeah, god, we hate the old parties. It's crazy that they're so shit. It's crazy that they won't change and listen to us

650
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,540
Yes, I want the third party

651
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,940
But I probably wouldn't vote for it and you go but why not like you literally just said all these things and now

652
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:12,140
We've given you the third party. Here's our policy. We've designed it. We've got your theoretical leader that you like

653
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,100
But then what like why are you not going to vote for it? And they go

654
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,260
Well, because we're just going to be a waste of vote and the crazy people never get in and like the whole from the country

655
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:29,020
So they kind of that first pass the post problem. I think is it is a real problem and I think

656
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,580
To realistically you like it's so therefore like getting over that. It's either a very long process

657
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,380
You have to resign yourself might take 20 30 years to build

658
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,460
or

659
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,460
You need a kind of global superstar

660
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
You need an elon type person

661
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:53,020
Or can you type person someone of someone of that level of global fame that just like instantly punches through all media

662
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,060
Do you know what I mean?

663
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,300
Yeah, let's say it wasn't too late

664
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,860
It was like a couple years ago and someone like elon had come to you and said hey, you know, I want to run

665
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:06,300
I want I want to compete. What is sort of the core issues or what is the platform that would that would that would

666
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,180
That would be able to compete that would that would most widely resonate

667
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,140
I think you talked about this a little bit in your podcast with andrew sullivan

668
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,900
um

669
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
When you unpack that a little bit

670
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,460
um

671
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,500
well

672
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,540
again, so

673
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,740
so

674
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:28,300
What issues really simple right and kind of shows the problem if you if you just do regular focus use of people and you chat around

675
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,900
What sort of things that people people want one of the first things that people will spontaneously say is term limits

676
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,740
We've got all of these old people. We've got these like senile people in both parties everywhere

677
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,980
It's it's an it's an embarrassment for us on the world stage

678
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:52,700
We've got to have term limits and drive these old people out and get new talent in and also we just not just old people

679
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
We just don't want the same people there all the time

680
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:01,820
And it cuts completely across party support. You can aoc fans support it trump fans magus the most

681
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:03,980
board is like

682
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,980
a total home run

683
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,740
But why do no

684
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,300
But the old parties can't support it right because the old parties are locked into a system where if you say that

685
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:18,460
That's like that's like calling for like everybody in congress to to be you know, investigated by the irf

686
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,820
It's like it's declaring war on the system

687
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:28,700
But if you're going to be a third party you didn't care about that you prepared to take risks and and you and you were just openly out

688
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,380
war with the system anyway

689
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,380
then you'd have a bunch of things like

690
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,700
Term limits like much stricter controls on congress

691
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,820
All of their dodgy sharing, you know buy stocks and shares and inside failing all that kind of crazy shit

692
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,060
You have a whole set of things like that

693
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,860
um, I think you'd be

694
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:52,860
Uh, you'd be very tough on the border very tough on crime like you'd be much closer to trump on that

695
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,620
And it's constantly interested like the democrats are just out of touch with a lot of their own voters on that

696
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,020
Like I can't remember now when I did all this research it was last year and I can't remember the exact numbers

697
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:10,060
But no there's a good chunk of democrats who uh, uh, um, who supported biden in 2020

698
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:16,140
Who basically agree with trump on police the border, uh, etc, etc

699
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,300
um

700
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:24,540
I think you'd be crazy to do a lot of what the republicans trying to do constantly writing on social security and

701
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,940
and um, destroying obama care

702
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
again, I would

703
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,660
everything like that, um

704
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:39,580
Trying to like have some kind of big argument about the overall structure of the healthcare system is just doomed

705
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:45,500
I've I've run a whole bunch of focus groups on that. There's no way through. There is no like

706
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:52,380
Great new universal plan that people go. Oh, yeah, okay. This guy's cracked it and this is what we should do

707
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,180
But I think definitely you definitely have um, you definitely avoid that. Um

708
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,620
But I think

709
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:08,540
A bit like a bit like um, what we did in 2016 and 2019, right? We got attacked by the media constantly as being completely incoherent

710
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,580
uh, um, and it was

711
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,580
Because our agenda

712
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:18,140
Didn't fit neatly onto the existing party access and it didn't fit onto a left-right thing

713
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,380
So we were much tougher on immigration than the conservatists were but we were actually in the same place as the country was

714
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,860
Like we were with the median voter

715
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:33,420
We were um to the left so to speak of the conservator party on um healthcare

716
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:38,460
But we were exactly where the median voter was now in west minster all the media say

717
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:42,860
Oh, your policy is in go here and no one will pay attention to that doesn't make any sense

718
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,020
But that's not how voters think

719
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,820
So again, if you're constructing if you're constructing

720
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,700
A party in the states and you just were optimizing for winning

721
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:59,420
Right, not whether or not the pundits say you're smart or whether your strategy makes sense if you're just optimized for winning

722
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,540
It's it's definitely going to look a bit odd like that. It won't fit into the conventional party structure

723
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,540
It won't fit on a left-right axis

724
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,620
And that's partly because like

725
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,900
It is sort of crude caricature terms if you if you do focus groups in research

726
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,620
on swing voters

727
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,620
Whether it's in california or or pennsylvania or in britain

728
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:24,460
They're kind of nationalist, right? They are

729
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,380
Then they are far to the right

730
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:36,220
Of most elected representatives on many issues and and to the left of them on many issues at the same time the same person

731
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,740
And this is completely constantly. I think I underrated and and not um

732
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:47,980
So the whole political punditry world works constantly on this idea of the center ground

733
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,820
Which is regarded as this kind of average of left and right

734
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,620
Oh, there's balloons coming up

735
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,620
Yeah

736
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,620
Um

737
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,220
This idea of the center ground whether where people are kind of average of left and right

738
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,300
And it's just

739
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,820
It all pundits basically believe it and there's endless everyone writes about it in every election

740
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,060
But it just doesn't actually map to the data of how how real voters

741
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,500
Yeah, I mean it's I mean I agree with you, right?

742
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Like it's funny one of the catchphrases you see of san francisco your average san francisco guy is like

743
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:29,740
I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative. It's like actually most americans are fiscally liberal and socially conservative

744
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,980
As a matter of fact your it's you

745
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:35,100
I mean that that is an elite view but most americans are actually not like that

746
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,780
They're actually socialists of the core and the government better not touch my medical care

747
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,180
But they're actually to the right and a bunch of other issues

748
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,180
exactly

749
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:46,940
One thing I I wouldn't I don't know if I pushed back on it because I suspect that party would actually still win

750
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:53,180
But one thing I've noticed again the eu us difference in the eu however, and again, I mean the the continent for the most part

751
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,940
However broken any political process might be it does seem like things kind of converge

752
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,100
If there is a majority view and to use one particularly hot button issue, but

753
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,940
It's it's a good issue because it's very parameterized abortion, right?

754
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:12,620
Abortion is actually not a binary thing the real debate is actually at what is the what is the cutoff at which abortion happens

755
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:17,340
And if you look at most polling in the united states, it's almost exactly where the law dictates in most european

756
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,220
Again, I'm not sure what the laws in the uk, but in germany france and spain

757
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,460
It's basically anywhere between 11 to 13 weeks is the upper bound for abortion

758
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:28,300
That tends to be where people pull at most people don't want a total ban

759
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,660
Most people don't want an abortion literally two seconds before the child is born

760
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,420
And most people land in that 35 and and americans are the same way by the way

761
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,140
And and yet the narrative in the united states is either

762
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,020
Fully banned no way like the catholic party line or it's the liberal line

763
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:48,460
Which is any encroachment to abortion is unthinkable never mind that like when disantis for example

764
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,660
I think in his initial platform he had a 15 week limit

765
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:58,220
Which is more permissive than most european countries and most american liberals like didn't even seem to understand

766
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,620
That actually florida abortion law would be more to the left than france's would

767
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,740
But it didn't matter right but in the u.s. Thing and then

768
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,900
And i could cite examples when it comes to to gun laws to a bunch of other things where in fact most americans are not crazy

769
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,100
I need to own a tank gun nuts nor total banners or somewhere in the middle

770
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,780
And yet in europe policy tends to converge to the democratic meme

771
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,060
But in the u.s. Actually it does it it actually pins to the extremes

772
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,500
And i don't know if that's because of primary first pass post voting or what but it things can be different

773
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,100
Because of the proof because of the primary problem become

774
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:38,700
On certain things like abortion because as you say it's um, I mean so again, I looked at this issue last

775
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,060
Last year um

776
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:51,180
And you can see like how you could craft a policy on abortion which would basically be like reasonably popular with people but

777
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,580
It will be attacked

778
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:58,300
Whether you're a republican or democrat you'd be massively attacked by the people on your own side

779
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,180
for

780
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,180
Proposal if you actually crafted

781
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:07,180
The like the optimal strategy on abortion for a presidential candidate

782
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:13,420
As soon as you said it you would be attacked whether you're a republican or democrat by by your own side as like

783
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:19,340
As a mass traitor, but i've got a theory on this like it's not inconceivable to me

784
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:24,940
The trump might actually go into the next by like september october 2024

785
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:31,100
Trump may have a more popular policy on uh, it'd be closer to the median voter and have

786
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,340
Uh a more popular policy on abortion than than biden

787
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:43,340
Because if you look at his history, he was never a kind of um very far right on this issue. It's from new york. Um

788
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,460
So it's possible

789
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,540
possible

790
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:54,380
Certainly if you listen to the polls, he will do but it would be a very interesting move for him suddenly to shift

791
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,300
And and here's and here's an alternative like way of how the of how abortion works

792
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,300
Like during 2020 election campaign

793
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:08,220
Biden actually shifted from a more popular policy on abortion to a less popular policy on abortion

794
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,060
Why did that shift happen?

795
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,460
It happened because the staff in his own campaign revolted and basically

796
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,980
Demanded of him that he changed policy and he didn't feel strong enough at that moment in the campaign when he was still weak

797
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:27,420
to push back against his own staff and that shows like another dynamic at this point the democrats are

798
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:34,060
so taken over by very young very elite university educated

799
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,380
staff

800
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:41,980
That they constantly push their own campaigns to positions which are completely irrational

801
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,540
If you're actually trying to optimize for winning

802
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,220
You know, can you see this?

803
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:52,860
There's all sorts of vapor out on this right in 2016 something like a third of the ads that hillary ran actually helped trump

804
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,420
and the ads which were most

805
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:03,180
Popular with democrat activists and donors and got most clicks with them with the most helpful towards trump

806
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:09,660
Right, this is like a crazy thing which doesn't fit with the conventional wisdom the conventional wisdom is

807
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,580
Okay, politicians may be shittered government, but they are at least trying to win elections

808
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,700
That is not true. It's almost never true

809
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:22,060
Politicians generally are optimizing for much shorter term things. They're optimizing for internal

810
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:27,980
Kind of in-group dynamics in their factions and signaling to the media over like a 48 hour window

811
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,460
That's most of what their activity is

812
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,660
And that's what explains this constant weird stuff of wide

813
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,380
wire politicians not actually

814
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:41,420
Adopting the optimal strategy, which is doesn't make ends basic democratic theory

815
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,700
But is that unique to the u.s. Because like again in the u. Just just to cite the european example

816
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,660
Things have kind of converged to the public will in the u.s. They have it

817
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,980
um

818
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:58,540
No, I think it's I think it's uh, I mean, I think it's why I think it's I think it's widespread across across democratic

819
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:04,060
I guess across democratic politics. I think america is a bit odd because of the primary thing

820
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,660
But um britain has definitely been the same, you know, I've watched elections here 20 years

821
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:21,020
Certainly since 2010 the only election campaign that was actually rational was our campaign in 2019

822
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:26,060
It's just apart from that both sides constantly run

823
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,220
Run election messages, which are just which clearly don't work

824
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,660
And another example of it, right isn't the referendum

825
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:44,220
Our strategy was hated by all of the mps and um the most kind of committed activists on our own side

826
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,580
Because these people

827
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,580
They don't really want to listen to the public

828
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,380
What they want to do is is tell the public what they should believe

829
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:59,100
And they constantly think well if you just shout louder at them and tell them more

830
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,660
Then the public's finally going to go all right. Okay. Well, I agree with you. Okay, right

831
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:10,300
Which is not how things usually work, but they hate listening people importantly hate listening

832
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,020
Yeah

833
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:18,460
Can I can I bring up one last thing speaking of alternatives to democracy one topic that came up in in our group chat this morning?

834
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,300
um, I believe uh

835
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,300
A venture capitalist we both know dominic

836
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,460
Was hanging around with uh king charles. He's king now, right?

837
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,100
Part of my privilege is being an american is not thinking about royals, which is what spurred the debate

838
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,300
He felt that the british the british monarchy has a certain gravitas

839
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,780
And a certain social function to play

840
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,500
As head of state

841
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,500
I think it's a ridiculous out ofistic throwback to a barbaric age that we should be done away with

842
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,460
I think one of the most ridiculous things about the australians and the canadiens that they still have a foreign monarch on their coin

843
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,820
Unlike us crazy americans gun nuts that we are we have no foreign monarch on our coins. Thank you very much

844
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:01,420
And in fact my my right as an american is not thinking about which royal waste rule popped out of which royal vagina

845
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,660
I don't have to think about this crap

846
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,820
And I think that in fact if there is a liberal democrat

847
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,980
I mean, I think the role of head of state though is important

848
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:11,500
And one thing that actually the westminster not the westminster system, I guess but

849
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,500
Other parliamentary systems have is they have a head of state that's different than the head of government, right?

850
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,420
Like in israel, for example, um, you know, you've got her's izak herzog

851
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:24,060
Who's the head of state who meets with douglas murray and the hostages and kind of represents the people?

852
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,700
And then you've got the head of government who everyone hates of course because the head of government always hated who actually operationally runs things

853
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,900
And um, if there's one thing the american political system gets wrong

854
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,220
Is the head of government the head of state are basically the same person

855
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:39,340
Which is why national politics are basically symbolic religious wars when really it should be about who's the best ceo

856
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,980
But in any case that's a that's a long wind up. But what do you think of the royals dominic? Are they worth keeping around?

857
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,580
um

858
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:52,140
I mean obviously the thing is ridiculous in lots of ways, but I think you're being too russian is tantonia. I think you're thinking

859
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:58,860
But well, it's this weird throwback and it doesn't really make any sense and they all have these

860
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,460
Weird outfits and how can this possibly be a rational way of looking at it? But um

861
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,700
I would say

862
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:16,540
Russianism in european politics is uh as often being the path to catastrophe

863
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,460
um

864
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:25,980
The people family makes no logical sense, but I would actually be in favor of keeping it and I think that um

865
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,420
I've got two basic two basic things

866
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:35,740
One is that I think from a practical point of view if it was replaced

867
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:41,340
It's almost inconceivable that what replaced it will be an improvement in my

868
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:44,220
In my eyes and secondly

869
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:47,980
Something that I've noticed which I think is important

870
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:54,700
Very hard to quantify is I think I think it's it's it's a kind of um

871
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:01,420
It's a last defense against extremism slash fascism slash communist takeover

872
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:08,780
And the reason for that is that um the armed forces don't swear an oath to the government. They swear an oath to

873
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,420
But they did swear an oath to the queen

874
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,380
Now we'll see this where it goes to the king

875
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:16,620
and

876
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,460
I think that has an oddly

877
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:25,260
Stabilizing effect that you can imagine all kinds of political disasters

878
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,300
Or you can imagine the kind of political things you often see in god who's happening

879
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:31,180
If you imagine similar things happening in britain

880
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,300
Because it distributes power in this way

881
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:38,460
It will be much harder for some kind of like extremist fanatic government

882
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:45,660
To take over and actually take over the entire state and take over the armed forces and have some kind of Stalinist coup

883
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,260
Do you know what I mean?

884
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,740
Because the armed forces are the parts of the state

885
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,540
there's this like residual feeling of

886
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,780
Oh, you're actually basically like some kind of like foreign inspired coup and we're just not going to do what you say

887
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,540
Yeah, and that and that's literally happened. So in 1981

888
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:07,500
There was a coup a coup attempt in spain actually in which the wari de civile

889
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:13,740
Which is like the the paramilitary like the the militarized police literally stormed the parliament and there's a photo of

890
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,620
Coronel tejero like wavering on a pistol and giving a lecture in front of the

891
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,140
The in the chamber of deputies in spain and what happened?

892
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:28,220
King what Carlos the second of spain basically got on tv in his uniform with the flag behind him and said

893
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:33,100
Yeah, we're not going back to fascism. This is not going to happen and basically called up every general and said all right

894
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,140
Pick a side bro

895
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,940
Me or jail and everyone said okay. Okay. Okay. Everyone come down

896
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:40,300
Like and then they arrested the coup leaders and like that was the end of it

897
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:45,100
And so in fact it worked exactly as you said right the embodiment the spirit of the nation kind of arose and said no

898
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,580
We're not doing this crazy shit. Everyone go back to your room

899
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,980
exactly

900
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,140
if someone tried to do that in britain and then

901
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:57,660
Because of this diffuse authority, you know, it is sort of slightly weird like, you know, you sit in number 10

902
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:04,780
Are you the prime minister says, okay? We're going to do this or you know, sending special forces somewhere or we're going to do this with whatever

903
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,500
the actual like the

904
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,620
The actual formal powers in lots of ways are

905
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,700
Not his he is acting on behalf of the queen

906
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,420
and

907
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:21,420
It does have a weird effect and it and it does mean that these people

908
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,940
Would not, you know, if it suddenly went crazy

909
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,540
or

910
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:33,980
Or there was some kind of like, you know, weird person managed to take like a Hitler star situation right where someone actually wins an election

911
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,860
becomes head of state

912
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,420
In all kinds of rationalist european constitutions

913
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,980
Well, the whole system now reports up to them including the armed forces and the new person is won the vote

914
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,820
Well, everyone just has to do what they say sort of thing

915
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:51,500
That doesn't happen in in the in the weird archaic irrational british constitution

916
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:56,940
But I think the little bit of friction and absurdity in it is like a good good long-term hedge

917
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,180
Interesting. Yeah, I mean, it's like the second amendment in the united states

918
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,500
The worst comes to worst everyone's got their rifle

919
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,780
But yeah, I'm trying to think in the u.s. Who occupies that role of like sanity check

920
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,660
It really is the constitution right the u.s. Constitution is the symbolic thing that embodies the nation

921
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:17,180
But of course, that's a tax subject interpretation, which is why supreme court almost acts like a rabbinical court, you know

922
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,260
Interpreting the the Torah or something right and so the u.s. Is kind of a religious project

923
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,980
But yeah in the u.s. There is no embodying of the nation outside of the

924
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,540
The constitution

925
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:30,780
About going too far in some ways, isn't that like I always find it interesting how

926
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,180
um

927
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:36,460
If you take like a quite an extreme situation in american politics

928
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,980
Of rusevelt in the 30s after his second win

929
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:45,020
When he was really like I can't remember exactly what the majority was that they had in congress

930
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,700
But it was extraordinarily massive and he'd got a massive landslide

931
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,660
And he could really he could and was

932
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,980
Ripping out washington closing things down reopening things doing all kinds of stuff

933
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,780
But he then made a move on the supreme court and he basically had to back off

934
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:05,340
It was seen as like just a stepped off. That's a good example

935
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:09,900
He tried packing the court famously by which meaning putting his cronies in and basically interpreting

936
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,860
You know like the my my polyside professor in high school said what is the u.s. Constitution?

937
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,180
Whatever nine justices say it is

938
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:21,100
And so if you control the justices you control the constitution and that that in fact was the step too far

939
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,540
I mean that was like that would be like imprisoning the queen. That's it. You've lost everybody. Nobody's going to follow you there, right?

940
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,180
yeah

941
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,740
Okay, we've been talking

942
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,660
I'll go for it. It's a

943
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:38,700
No, I'm just saying I've harassed dominic with all my okay. Ask the smartest bird. I know questions

944
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:41,980
Dominic you got them all

945
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:45,340
I've got a couple more and then we'll get down. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead

946
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,020
well one

947
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:53,340
So some people use the mental model of thinking about the the left in the u.s. As you know college educated people

948
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,580
one third of the country plus

949
01:07:56,060 --> 01:08:01,260
You know certain might you know a large percentage of certain minority groups that those college educated people claim to speak on

950
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,460
behalf of and and prioritize and and give deference to

951
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:07,260
Against on the right non-educated

952
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:09,980
uh, or you know non college educated

953
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,220
What working class white people and that's a crude, you know summarization

954
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:19,020
but it's a way of the kind of describing the differences and the tensions that emerge where

955
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,580
sort of one third of the the country

956
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:27,260
Sort of speaks for two for for the rest of the country in terms of dominating the institutions

957
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:33,420
That that governed the the rest of the country and best there's sort of this populist outrage that that has the numbers

958
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:37,260
But doesn't have the power and thus elect someone like trump

959
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:43,980
How would you edit that that characterization the u.s. And i'm curious if that same sort of cleaving or something similar to that

960
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:47,340
Is what's also happening in other countries where we're seeing

961
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:53,180
Sort of similar figures like trump or is it all very very different

962
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,900
No, i mean i think so

963
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,900
There's definitely something

964
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:03,580
Common across the western world in terms of what's happening with educational polarization, right?

965
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,780
You can see in the data in every country

966
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:11,820
The story is is sort of similar since since 1945

967
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,140
graduates

968
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,340
used to be

969
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,340
much more conservative

970
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,540
And and and that shifted dramatically

971
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:30,380
I mean, sorry it shifted gradually for decades and then it's really kind of become turbocharged in the last in the last 10

972
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,940
10 20 years

973
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
And that's definitely thrown poor

974
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:42,620
It's definitely confused all of the old system right they don't they haven't quite understood it as part of the reason why

975
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,940
they

976
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:51,820
Didn't see brexit coming and didn't see trump coming. I mean just in like one interesting way before brexit

977
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:56,220
Most of the polling companies didn't wait by education

978
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,140
Certainly in britain and i think similar problems happen with the polling in

979
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,060
In america, um

980
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:07,100
They just didn't like so our data science team

981
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:10,940
looked at all of these polls in 2015 2016 and they said, you know, like

982
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:15,100
The data that we've got is not being is not reflected in the mainstream polls

983
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:22,460
The fundamental reason is that they don't understand what's happening with education polarization and very similar thing happened, I think

984
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,940
With trump, so there's no doubt that

985
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:31,180
establishment parties of being caught on the on

986
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,740
All on on the part for it by that

987
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,660
I'd like to ask one more question since, um

988
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,700
Getting to this issue of um, you know education and the and left versus right

989
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,660
I mean, I forgot who I read it was probably tyler cohen or somebody

990
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,860
If you mentioned how in the 1950s if you told somebody you're a democratic or republican

991
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,700
Or to use a slightly more wonky term if it was the input to your you know, your logistic

992
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,980
Regression model that tried to classify various parts of your lifestyle

993
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:00,380
Being republic or democrat wouldn't have told you whether you owned a firearm went hunting

994
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,020
Had a college education. I wouldn't have told you lots of things actually and while now it's almost

995
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,780
Dispositive, right?

996
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,660
Literally, it is like a 90-10 split either way for every question

997
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:13,340
I just said whether you're a republican democrat whether you own a gun went to college, etc

998
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,740
And so there's just been massive split of just

999
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:21,020
Beyond politics. I mean in the u.s. It really is a red versus blue tribe sort of issue

1000
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,780
um, and I'm not even sure what why that is and I've lived in red states and

1001
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:28,860
I'd be a hard nut to crack with if you tried based on politics

1002
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,340
You know, whether I own a gun or not or whether I have a college education

1003
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,660
But like broadly speaking like why is it?

1004
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:34,940
Here's a better question

1005
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:40,220
Why does the right kind of suck in the sense that like when it comes to like aesthetics when it comes to education

1006
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:44,300
I mean, I think it was david revneck who famously called trump a short-fingered vulgarian

1007
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,300
Which he kind of is and you know

1008
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,580
He said many things that were true, right?

1009
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,460
Like his his critique of russia during 2016 was actually correct

1010
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,100
And so not to say that everything trump said was was nonsense

1011
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:55,660
But there's there's an error about him when he has a rally

1012
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:59,740
It's like the pillow guy that shows that it's like people that you wouldn't want your sister to date or

1013
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:05,340
You know media or culture that you yourself wouldn't consume or identify with and yet you're kind of stuck

1014
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:06,940
Right because on the one hand

1015
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:12,860
Like let's face it anyone with any level of IQ education elite status income is like shopping at Whole Foods

1016
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:15,900
And living in one of six cities and that's their lifestyle

1017
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,380
And yet if if you kind of reject whole hog the the far left agenda

1018
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,060
Well, what do you do? Are you going to go live in Nashville? Like no

1019
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,980
That said this is someone who's lived in Reno and rural Washington

1020
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:31,260
So I I have made that jump but probably speaking most people are not going to do that

1021
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:35,100
It feels like it feels like the mid-wit mean right whereas the right

1022
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:41,980
You know both has sort of the the the hick but also peter teal and sort of the the new counter-lead or sort of the true intellectual

1023
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:47,100
Yeah, but the but the peter teals are the majority right at the end of the day. That's not that's not, you know, if you

1024
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:51,900
Would a guy from San Francisco even if he had some trump sympathy if they went to a trump rally

1025
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,620
Would they look around and say, oh, yeah, we I have a deep sympathy with these people. No, he wouldn't you walk right out of there

1026
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,580
And so what do you do with that? Right? If

1027
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:03,500
You're not going away. You're not going with the far left agenda and yet you're you know

1028
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,700
The polarization question is

1029
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,380
Someone and it does seem I mean I'm not an expert on this now

1030
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:13,900
In terms of looking across like lots of different countries. So I'm not sure

1031
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:16,620
how's correct statement

1032
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,980
Certainly relative to Britain. So for example

1033
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,700
in America

1034
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:28,140
These issues as you say have become more and more polarized and more and more identified on a party basis

1035
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,300
So even if you go back to like 1980

1036
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:34,700
You had far more ticket splitting you had far more people who would like vote for a Democrat senator

1037
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,780
but then maybe vote for Reagan, right?

1038
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:44,460
And you couldn't be as sure by the fact that they voted for Reagan about a whole set of their views

1039
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:49,180
As you would be now if someone said I voted for Trump. So it's definitely shifted

1040
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,740
um

1041
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,060
Over the last 40 years

1042
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,700
That that kind of process hasn't happened in in Britain

1043
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:04,220
And I think quite a lot of other European countries in terms of these things being locked into party identities

1044
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:09,020
So there has been educational polarization. That's like a cross-western trend

1045
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:15,100
But that educational polarization is not mapped onto party identification

1046
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:19,020
Across the west in the same way it has in America

1047
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,420
And I don't know what the answer

1048
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,300
It's a very interesting question as to why as to why that's different

1049
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:29,020
Um, again, like is the project is the primary process play some some part of that

1050
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:34,140
Uh, other structural dynamics in the in the american vote system don't know. Um

1051
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:43,420
But that is a difference for sure between america in europe and also and also britain on that other question

1052
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:48,860
um, I think it comes back to to to what was touched on a couple of times, which is just

1053
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,100
um

1054
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,900
Small people on the right have gone out of politics

1055
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:56,380
so

1056
01:14:56,380 --> 01:15:00,860
If you look at say so everyone hate on the right people like me

1057
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,620
We hate the new york times

1058
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:07,420
We hate a whole load of like that

1059
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,540
Liberal media in quotes, right

1060
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:11,580
but

1061
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:16,620
Nobody's trying to create an elite thing to take on the new york times in its own terms

1062
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,900
As you say like a lot of the media

1063
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:25,260
Kind of entrepreneurial activity like banon type stuff

1064
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:33,340
Is basically just like trashy. It's not trying to create. It's not trying to like beat the new york times in its own game

1065
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,140
Which someone should try and do

1066
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,980
but

1067
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:43,260
I think I think a big part of the reason why is is this question of where of where talents

1068
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,460
It's gone

1069
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:49,980
And the left still has a whole load of smart people who are basically on the left go into politics because they want to control these

1070
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,060
Old institutions and they want to tell everyone what to do

1071
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,340
Whereas people who are as smart on the right

1072
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,540
Are you know, so you have like two kids now age 20

1073
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,940
The one who's left inclined wants to go and work with like larry summers in washington

1074
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:09,420
And then work in the u.s. Treasury you tell everyone what to do and then get rich good work for golden sacks after some spell in dc, right?

1075
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,580
whereas

1076
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,580
the person who

1077
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,140
Has read a lot of mesas and hyac

1078
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,900
are

1079
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,340
It's probably gonna

1080
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,620
Want to come and work with you guys in in california or on some tech startup, right?

1081
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,540
Maybe go work for angioreal and combine drones and national security

1082
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:30,060
But when they look around at the p and this becomes self-reinforcing

1083
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:35,100
When you when when smart 20 year old? I mean, I've had this myself in terms of recruiting and looking at things

1084
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,860
We have like very smart kids age 20 23

1085
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:45,340
They're looking at options and they go and look and talk to the politicians like I don't want to work with these fucking clowns

1086
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:51,980
They just they they're losers. They're not going to get anything done. They don't really know what they're there for

1087
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:55,260
Uh, why do I want to go and work with those people?

1088
01:16:56,060 --> 01:17:02,460
So the smart person on the right the hyac fan those often does different things and I think over generations this

1089
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:09,820
This is just compounded and compounded and compounded. I was fascinating. You know when I after just after the election

1090
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:15,580
I wrote a blog and the blog basically said, okay, we're going to rip up government

1091
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:17,660
And we're going to do all of this stuff differently

1092
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:21,340
We're going to break a load of shit and we're going to build a load of new shit

1093
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,660
And if you want to do this if you're a weirdo if you're a misfit if you've got technical

1094
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:31,820
Abilities that you've like never got involved with politics because it's such a shit show get in touch and come and help

1095
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:38,540
And I had a common exact number that but like 50 000 people applied for a job. I mean it was just completely insane

1096
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,180
So you can see there is this untapped

1097
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:45,020
There are a lot of people who actually do want to get involved with politics and government

1098
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,900
who are like not people on the left

1099
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:51,820
But at the moment they're like largely away doing their own things

1100
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:55,580
And they're not going to drop those things to go work for a conventional

1101
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,380
conservative thing in washington or london

1102
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:03,340
That they just think is hasn't got an actual plan couldn't execute any way is not going to win

1103
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,500
By the way, I was going to ask you about that ad because that was pretty that was pretty famous and went viral at the time

1104
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,540
Did you actually hire somebody from from the 50 000 applicants?

1105
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,100
We hired some we had some like

1106
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:17,980
Openly and we hired some covertly and was kind of going to get planted them in a deep state

1107
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,180
Oh, wow

1108
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:26,380
I uh, I love I love it. I want to close by uh ending or I want to end by

1109
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:33,340
Returning to where we began which is on san francisco. There was one argument earlier that we said hey tech people don't care about san francisco

1110
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:38,940
There's the counter argument that that uh, mark adresin has publicly made uh, who you know came on the show

1111
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:46,060
Who whose group chat introduced us and he said hey actually they do care and they're um, you know

1112
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,540
Reed Hoffman dustin moskovitz

1113
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:54,700
um and other tech people are some of the biggest donors to the dnc to to the biden campaign and um also to

1114
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:01,340
In san francisco politics, they're we're actually we've tech has created the situation that they currently exist

1115
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:05,580
They're and they're relatively happy with it or they think that's the best that can be done

1116
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:12,220
With within the limitations and that efforts like gary tan and um, you know others

1117
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:16,060
And by the way, mike solana is trying to create a right wing new york times our good friend

1118
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,900
You know, he's early in that. Well, hopefully he'll he'll be able to do it, but um

1119
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,620
Yeah, people like gary tan

1120
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:24,860
Well good intention

1121
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:31,580
Mark's argument that he made on our show is that it um, it actually doesn't help because there because there's no republican party

1122
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:32,940
um

1123
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:41,100
Trying to reform just from within the left will further um incentivize the left to keep going crazy and and and and take control

1124
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:48,060
Whereas the only real solution is to let things get so bad that that a republican party can can emerge

1125
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:54,460
And and no no gary nobody wants to go right wing even 80 percent of elan of san francisco is anti elan

1126
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,900
They think he's too, you know, right winger beyond the pale and so we're caught

1127
01:19:58,620 --> 01:19:59,580
In a rock and a hard place

1128
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:05,420
Which is do we just not do anything and wait till things are so bad that a republican party can emerge or

1129
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:12,540
Can reform happen from within the the the the the left and people like gary the others kind of take over

1130
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,260
Despite the sort of structural

1131
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,340
ratcheting to the most extreme

1132
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,940
That mark mentions happens in kind of one party cities or states

1133
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,460
So strikes me as as extremely unlikely that there's going to be a republican

1134
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,420
In any kind of like short-term way like in the next 10

1135
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,900
15 years or so

1136
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:38,460
Because of other national dynamics. I just can't see it's a bit like what we're talking about in terms of is

1137
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:41,020
Israel and like just moral

1138
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,700
signals

1139
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,980
but

1140
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,860
The moral signals of the republican party are such that

1141
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:53,260
Magic whole bunch of people go. Oh, yeah, you know, I listen to what they've got to say in san francisco crime's got so bad

1142
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:55,340
Maybe we should go republican

1143
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,900
I don't think that that's going to happen. However bad things get

1144
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:01,100
I can sort of understand

1145
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,700
mark's

1146
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:09,980
argument about the potential futility of trying to reform inside the democrats, but so my answer to that would be

1147
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:15,740
Hoping for a republican revival is doomed certainly in the next 10 years

1148
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,460
So forget that

1149
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,980
uh

1150
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:25,740
It's perfectly plausible that trying to like have any kind of reform inside the democrat party isn't going to work

1151
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:30,540
But why are those unique to alternatives? Why can't you build an independent force?

1152
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,420
Which doesn't have the branding of either

1153
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,260
That's what that's where I would start

1154
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,020
and

1155
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,180
So I wouldn't try and spend a lot of my time like

1156
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:45,820
Fighting the internal battle to the democrat party because I think a lot of that is a waste of time

1157
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,700
And an effort and energy and won't work anyway

1158
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:55,500
If if there is a way through and it may not be right sometimes like places and cities and cultures to just like

1159
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,820
Their own secretary and there's nothing you can do about it

1160
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,820
um

1161
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:07,580
Uh, but if there is a way through I'm sure that it it's by building something separate to the two parties in san francisco

1162
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,900
And say right we are san francisco people

1163
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:14,060
We don't like the republicans for that reason. We don't like the democrats for this reason

1164
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:17,900
But here are the things that we believe in and here's what we want to build and if you put us in power

1165
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,140
Well, here's how we'll fight corruption. Here's how we'll fight crime. Here's how we'll do this

1166
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,740
And you know, you just you you market test the message that you know

1167
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:30,540
At least it works with with the voters that you need

1168
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,100
And then you try and find some people to

1169
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:39,420
To to sell the message and see see see what can be built. That's where that's where I that's where I would start

1170
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:45,740
But the hardest problem I'm sure is going to be people like because of this chicken and egg problem the worst

1171
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,180
The worst the worst the better already ends up working. You're like when the real

1172
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:58,620
When the revolution comes until that it just puts everyone off from getting involved

1173
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:04,940
I and I I would say the black pill on sf politics we saw very recently

1174
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:10,780
Which is that in fact sf could be easily cleaned up. So she I'm literally on second street in soma

1175
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:15,340
About a block away from a high highway that typically has a homeless encampment under it

1176
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:19,420
And it currently doesn't because shishin bing was here and they cleaned up all the streets in san francisco

1177
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:25,580
And practically overnight practically overnight the city went from the dystopia you saw to something else and I would say

1178
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,540
To quote one of our great american philosophers hl menkin

1179
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:31,900
Democracy is letting the voters choose and then giving it to them good and hard

1180
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:37,180
And I would say that maybe the democrats actually want things to be this way because they amplify the problems

1181
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:40,700
Which they are the solution which is oh no, there's this drug and homelessness problem

1182
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:44,060
And there's this whole thing about it. Again, they could clean it up, but they sort of choose not to

1183
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,860
Yeah, I think that

1184
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,180
That makes so

1185
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,900
That makes um a lot of sense to me

1186
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:00,460
A lot of california, um, I mean california democrat politics is intensely mainly corrupt and for people like usum

1187
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:03,660
The current thing

1188
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:09,020
The only way the current thing doesn't work for usum is if he actually wants to go and become a national figure

1189
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,100
And I think that's an interesting question right because

1190
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:16,620
When I was doing all these focus groups last year one of the interesting things that came up all the time was people saying

1191
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,220
like

1192
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,940
Democrats or swing voters not maga people would say

1193
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:26,380
Yeah, you know what? We do need a fucking wall. We need a wall around california

1194
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:31,260
Stop basically shit escaping and washing over the rest of the country

1195
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:38,940
And you know because they see the the same videos right of like the homeless people like walking out like zombies with machetes in their hands and they think

1196
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,380
We don't want this everywhere. Um

1197
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,180
And that's a real problem for usum for sure if he wants to become a national

1198
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:54,060
A national figure, but in terms of the internal california politics maybe the democrat party could just

1199
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,660
Doing this for

1200
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:01,340
For a long time right you you tech people can like keep insulating yourselves

1201
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:04,620
Like the roman senators in the republic you can build your

1202
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:12,380
Build your your walled gardens the walls of the walled gardens ever higher and your fish ponds ever more magnificent and keep the madness out for

1203
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:15,260
another 10 years maybe

1204
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:19,820
I mean I I've always suspected my my dark theory by way sf is a tech hub

1205
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:25,420
Is that you need like billion dollar startups to fix some of the problems the city has and it's actually not even a joke right?

1206
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:30,380
Like the public transport here sucks. So we had uber the housing situation hotels completely sucks. We had airbnb

1207
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:33,420
The dating scene by the way is terrible. So we had dating apps

1208
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:38,860
The social scene is actually not so great either. So we had all the social media like literally every every great consumer tech

1209
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:44,540
Sort of innovation you've seen has been kind of a patch to the sf system from very entrepreneurially minded people

1210
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,980
Company to provide personal security with drones is like

1211
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,620
Yeah privately is next. Um

1212
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,740
I mean before we go starting a new party. I presume is very difficult

1213
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:00,300
You you don't have the infrastructure that the other parties have

1214
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:02,140
um

1215
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:04,620
If if that were so obvious why aren't people

1216
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,140
Doing it. What are the big bottlenecks to to making that happen?

1217
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,060
I think the

1218
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:16,380
Overwhelmingly the the biggest bottleneck is just this first pass the post problem that you have to get to some critical mass before you can break

1219
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:21,100
Through uh, and and it's very hard to persuade people to get involved with with something

1220
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:26,220
In a first pass the post system because they think well, you know, I don't want to commit 10 years of my life to building this

1221
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,100
Which may not get

1222
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,780
Where you actually

1223
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:35,660
Can punch through that's the fundamental

1224
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:40,220
Uh, and I think it's that's why it's like it's overwhelmingly likely that

1225
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,580
If that's solved it'll be because someone

1226
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:49,260
Super duper famous like global like legit globally famous character

1227
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,820
Decides to do it. That's that's the way you could

1228
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:58,220
Jumpstart it. I don't think lack of info. I think actually the lack of info in lots of ways is actually a great advantage, right? I mean

1229
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,780
Just in our own experience because we were a startup in 2016

1230
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:08,220
We just did everything better than the established parties did because we just you know use the cloud

1231
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:12,140
We built all this stuff ourselves. We actually built had a proper tech team

1232
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:13,980
um

1233
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:17,180
Whereas as soon as we went in and we took over the conservative party

1234
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:22,540
We looked around the infrastructure there like the whole thing is just completely rotten and broken and doesn't work is like

1235
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,460
um

1236
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:28,540
A bit like central government. Actually, you know, like people think this is it can't possibly be true

1237
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,540
But when I arrived in number 10

1238
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,660
The prime minister of great britain

1239
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:40,460
Has less access to a file sharing system that like a two person startup does

1240
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:46,540
They can at least use google docs and like live edit the same document in different parts of the building or hotel

1241
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:50,460
Or in different parts of the building the british prime minister could not do that

1242
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,780
oh my god

1243
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:54,860
in tony you mentioned at the beginning of this call how

1244
01:27:55,180 --> 01:28:00,700
San Francisco has like an 11 billion dollar budget or something like that and 700 800 000 residents

1245
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:06,460
Do we know how that money is spent? Is that is that public and if so are you know, where is it spent?

1246
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:13,020
I mean, I I assume it's public record. Um, I think the the correction is not like literally bags full of cash level of corruption

1247
01:28:13,420 --> 01:28:17,820
It's the sort of todyism of there's all these ngos, right that are you know

1248
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:21,820
ngos are basically church groups for people who think they're smarter than religion effectively

1249
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:27,020
And so you have all these ngos and it's literally this gravy train in which they throw money at people who make the problems

1250
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:29,180
worse and

1251
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:31,900
You know, I forget exactly how much aid you get as a homeless person

1252
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:35,020
I said, I think it hovers around eight eight hundred to nine hundred dollars a month

1253
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:38,380
You basically get for free just showing up and so I mean one of the

1254
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,100
Shocking not shocking things that if you actually talk to homeless people

1255
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,660
And there's a few twitter accounts in which people go out and chat to almost people

1256
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,500
Almost none of them are actually from san francisco

1257
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:50,220
They come from abroad because they know they can get it basically get a free right here and here here's a quick

1258
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:55,820
Here's a quick job interview question dominic if the aid for the homeless person is nine hundred dollars

1259
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:59,820
What is the average fentanyl dose price in san francisco per day?

1260
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:07,020
If you're if you show up if you wash up hopeless in san francisco and you're basically given

1261
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:13,500
Um, you know a nine hundred dollars a month cash grant. What's the average cost of a fentanyl dose on the street?

1262
01:29:14,780 --> 01:29:17,660
I guess that's out right like it's basically like

1263
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,780
20 30 dollars a day is what that's how

1264
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:25,660
Because of course it is the markets in equilibrium

1265
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,900
Right, of course it is so and so yeah, I mean, I assume this is all public record, eric

1266
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:34,060
But it's like I don't know. I mean the taxes are incredibly another thing by the way is a shocking thing

1267
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,460
Another random us eu

1268
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,940
Observation because I I thought when I wrote cast monkeys

1269
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:43,180
I actually moved to europe thinking I'd get canceled for other reasons for for writing like this tell all book

1270
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:47,260
And so I like I spent time in barcelona and berlin and paris like checked out the startup scenes

1271
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,700
I didn't go to london by the way

1272
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:55,420
But it's like europe does everything right to get startups going like literally they'll take over entire buildings and give them the startups

1273
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:56,460
They'll have grants

1274
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,340
There's a lot of talent in europe like they do everything right and then like nothing happens startup wise in the united states

1275
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:06,220
They do literally everything wrong top to bottom and yet you they cannot stop producing

1276
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,540
Which is incredible

1277
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:15,580
But like there's so many taxes here like your your restaurant bill is marked up with some health mandate thing

1278
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:20,140
Which isn't even a hard number the restaurant can just randomly mark shit up by like five or ten percent

1279
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:26,620
Which is ridiculous and yeah, it's just there's there's so much loss and ridiculousness in california and yet here we are

1280
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
I'm this i'm in san francisco

1281
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:33,420
But to me the twitter is a good analogy where ilan could have started a new twitter

1282
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:37,020
And we have friends who've tried to start a new twitter and it's it's very difficult network effects are very hard

1283
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:41,740
And it's it's much easier although still hard to take over existing twitter and similarly

1284
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:46,460
I went to miami a couple years ago thinking that everybody would leave san francisco and also follow

1285
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:49,820
And it turns out no matter how bad it gets people aren't leaving

1286
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:56,220
And so it's probably a lot easier to move more people to miami to san francisco than to move people out of san francisco into

1287
01:30:56,780 --> 01:31:00,620
Uh, some other city or some other country where you can get some deal with the government

1288
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:04,220
Like like like the whole technology state move network state movement is trying to do

1289
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:11,260
So it sounds kind of like totally plausible, right? Like what what why but so quickly the obvious question like why hasn't this happened before?

1290
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,460
Why hasn't it happened already people?

1291
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,980
Well, hold on so it

1292
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,900
I don't know who you're trying to move here

1293
01:31:19,900 --> 01:31:25,100
But so I mean san francisco. I was here for the first tech boom people should loads of people moved in san francisco

1294
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,580
Like it's still kind of dead like it is not recovered fully from covet

1295
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:31,740
But like circa 2011 the place you want it to be in the western world

1296
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:37,180
Was within 10 blocks of where i'm sitting right now, which is where every consumer internet company was literally created

1297
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:43,180
Right, like it was happening socially happening business wise. Everything was here. You felt like you were in the center of the world

1298
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:48,060
This is that's right. Yeah, this is happening. Yeah, too. So it can happen again. That's the opportunity

1299
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:48,620
It can happen

1300
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:52,700
But the thing is that people people either stay and they put down roots and they get woke or they make a pile of money

1301
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:56,300
And they leave that's it like no one actually invests in san francisco. That's the problem

1302
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:01,580
Yeah, it might be changing though. There's a rise in political consciousness in the last few years

1303
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:04,220
Like I know entrepreneurs who are now getting into politics full time

1304
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:11,500
um, because they see how how fucked things have gotten here and um, and there's there's like a ecosystem around it. Um

1305
01:32:12,220 --> 01:32:15,820
There's uh, there's it's high status now in a way that it wasn't a few years ago

1306
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,940
That's true. Things have changed a little bit, right? You can get twitter influenced by posting about san francisco politics in a way that

1307
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:23,180
You would never have done 10 years ago. Yeah

1308
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,100
Solana built his whole his whole you know audience off his media company off that

1309
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:33,500
Um, if practical campaigns that you guys think like, you know, so-and-so is going to try and do something and they're a good guy

1310
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:37,820
Then obviously like hook me up. I'll be happy to like look at you know, research

1311
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:41,980
They're doing or ideas for messaging and stuff like that if I can help in some way

1312
01:32:43,180 --> 01:32:44,060
Cool

1313
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:46,060
Yeah, we'll uh, we'll keep you posted

1314
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:48,620
I don't know of anything at the moment outside of grosef

1315
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,300
But you're in that group chat and I don't think they're they're serious enough

1316
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:53,660
um

1317
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:57,740
But I'd also be interested. So yeah, we're trying to create that conversation here in the podcast

1318
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,060
So let's uh, let's keep the conversation going

1319
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:04,380
But when the next governor comes up, maybe we should try to find some like, um,

1320
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:09,180
legit celeb that we can work with to like the walk or someone to

1321
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:11,740
become governor

1322
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,220
Yeah, totally. It's been it's been done before

1323
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:17,020
We're on arrange it

1324
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:23,500
Rather mutant via like virus tryout place, right? So let's let's let's get the walk going in calif

1325
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,900
