0	5760	When I was doing all these focus groups last year one of the interesting things that came up all the time was people saying like
6600	9520	Democrats or swing voters not Maga people would say
10160	14900	Yeah, you know what? We do need a wall. We need a wall around California
15300	19820	Stop basic shit escaping and washing over the rest of the country
19820	26000	They see the same videos right if like the homeless people like walking zombies with machetes in their hands and they
27000	30800	Want that we don't want this everywhere. Yeah, this is happening. Yeah, too
30800	33240	So it can happen again that that's the opportunity it can happen
33240	37280	But the thing is that people people either stay and they put down roots and they get woke or they make a pile of money
37280	40980	And they leave that's it like no one actually invests in San Francisco. That's the problem
41640	44120	In one sense like you can't really get
44760	52640	PR or a story stronger than what Hamas did and to me the actual interesting thing there is right
52760	55720	That's like pretty much bad as it gets right
55720	61440	It's like sort of filming the torture to chambers of the NKVD and the Gestapo in Eastern Europe
61440	63440	But within like 10 days, it's basically
65160	72320	The NPCs in the media just go back to the script basically only not the most ripped for you know, like a few new cycles
72320	74320	Like maybe 10 days
74520	82440	It's funny right before this Dominic I tweeted I'm about to talk to Dominic Cummings
82440	84640	What should I ask and someone actually chime in some bigger questions?
84640	89880	So I was just reading those before so I've got some some great follow-ups that I think we want your input on
90640	92720	But yeah, on the right wing left wing thing
93880	95880	I am a bit of a Fukuyama fanboy
96200	98000	and I think
98000	102360	He's he's vast not that I think you are to be clear, but I think he's vastly misunderstood people
103000	105560	Don't read through the 40 chapters of reinterpreted Hegel
105560	109920	They barely even repest the title it and his and of course the best chapter in that book is actually the last chapter
110160	112800	in which he actually he predicts a lot of the sort of
113880	115760	you know
115760	120440	Philosophical on we and melez that we currently see in the West right and he actually predicted in some sense the rise of
120440	123360	Wokeness or sort of perverted liberalism that would turn out turning on itself
124080	126080	You know Fukuyama's point just
126080	128080	Sort of
128360	130360	He goes
130880	133840	That last chapter which I agree with you. I think it's the book
134080	138500	He goes into some detail in in to Nietzsche's critique of modern liberal
139400	141400	and
141400	145280	And that is forgotten. You're right in the way that people talk about that book
145280	148640	They always get the last chapter. Yeah, and just to summarize there
148640	151920	I've done a whole piece on it defending. I'm actually in my in my sub stack
152160	154160	You know when he said the end of history
154160	156720	He didn't mean obviously that that things would stop happening in the world
156880	159800	What he meant is that the the arc of political evolution
160360	164760	However far back you want to draw it from hunter-gatherer tribes to the agricultural revolution
165080	170360	You know middle-aged the theocratic dynasties the imperial age nation whatever whatever that arc is
170360	172520	It kind of ends with liberal capitalism, right?
172520	178120	Because the original Marxist idea Marx originally predicted that communism to come after liberal capitalism had yeah
178120	183320	had triumphed in a way to come up and divide the spoils and deal with the inevitable inequality they had dealt with but the
183920	188520	Fukuyama in charge is like no no no, that's a we're not we're probably not going to regress to a darker age
188520	191760	Although we might but we're definitely not advancing into some sort of socialist utopia
191760	193760	Like this is as good as it gets liberal capitalism
194360	201440	end of story that and and the Nietzschean angle like he he quotes thus bake our a sister a lot in which again to summarize very
201440	202680	Quickly what is a complex work?
202680	207520	There are supposed to be these men with hollow chests who live at the end who have given up the passions
207520	213280	And the mad joys of tribalism war, you know pestilence wars of ethno-nationalic
213280	218280	I you know ethno-nationalist identity which is funny to say in the context of Israel, which I want to get to as well
218280	219600	But in some sense in that book
219600	225960	I think he actually explicitly says the European Union would be the final retirement home of the last man like that the European project in
225960	227960	some sense was the home of the last man and
228400	235880	In some sense with the far right you're seeing it's unwinding potentially exactly also with you know with with the growth of Putin and
236560	238560	You know the way the EU
238600	247080	In lots of ways, I think that's exactly right and Brussels has tried to live out that role in many ways right over the last 10 years. I mean
249520	252160	15 years ago when I would say to people I
252920	255560	Used to live in Russia. I met people like Putin
255720	261920	He is not what you think this whole idea that like he's some kind of like quite moderate reformer and a technocrat and
262640	268040	Russia's going to join the EU in you know in a few decades time. This is all completely insane and
268760	273960	You're all gonna get a terrible shock by this and it was an incredibly at that time
274120	277600	It was a very serious like a very extreme view
278720	287280	Even two or three years ago. No Britain and Europe were basically pretty happy with the state of squo in which London is the laundry for the Russian mafia
287680	293280	Energy keeps flowing to to Germany very cheaply
293960	298840	And we just kind of like draw fail over a lot of the KGB oligarch behavior
298960	300200	People didn't want to face it
300200	306640	So when Trump came over and pointed out some of these things it became a meme with everyone in the EU literally laughing at Trump
307120	314840	About the about the Nord Stream pipeline and warning, right? I mean, of course like now nobody gives Trump any credit for being for being
315440	317440	Be correct about it
318360	324520	But that sort of shows the extent to which I think the Brussels just didn't want to face these kind of issues and still doesn't
324760	326920	Okay, I've got a random question. It's a slight detour Eric
326920	331960	But maybe you'll let me go crazy with the agenda one conversation speaking of the house of the last man
331960	335560	By the way, I love the house of the last bed like the post history is actually pretty cozy
335560	341120	I was in Lisbon recently and I was in Paris recently. My daughter is actually moving to France. She's a Franco
341120	343440	She's a she speaks French. She went to the DC here
343920	346720	I'd be I'd love my child to grow up in Paris, right?
346720	349800	And I think, you know, one of the base that we have in the group is you know
349800	352040	It's kind of around the spread of wokeness that you know
352040	357600	This whole this whole business of things going squishy a total dedication to equality a fallen standards
357600	359480	Like a lot of things are just kind of going soft
359480	363960	What I found interesting for example, and again, I'm actually driving at a point here in the case for example
363960	370280	The Paris rights that happened this this summer that in its contours kind of felt a little bit like the BLM phenomenon in the United States
370280	377080	Which as you know kind of in the in the COVID tizzy became like a whole thing a whole moral panic that kind of sees the West
377160	379000	You saw it explode in the UK
379000	384160	I think the the Anglo-Saxon English speaking world is definitely kind of a thing and I think the UK
384520	387560	Here is the echoes very loudly of the American political zeitgeist
387560	393560	I think those echoes are heard much less loudly on the continent and you saw what happened in Paris that the legendaries would
393560	396480	Showed up and the riot police and they crushed it and that was the end of it
396680	403160	Did not extend from there and I told the group look this Anglo-Protestant software does not run on Latin Catholic hardware
403160	406920	It's just not gonna wokeness is not gonna spread to the continent in the way that you're expecting
407760	410720	Like I is that true or am I am I misreading food?
411720	413720	I
414560	420300	Mean I think you've definitely got something of a point like there's definitely a kind of common Anglo-American
421920	423920	Several problems
424360	431440	Partly connected with the fact that our that's that's our universities and our media are much more similar right the media and
432560	434560	Oxford and Harvard
434920	436480	BBC in New York Times
436480	442160	There's just much much more crossover than there is between either Britain and France or America and France
442480	446480	So I think extent it's definitely true on the other hand of course
447560	450720	There's many many layers of irony the whole thing, but
451480	452600	it
452600	455160	To a very large extent the kind of crazy
455840	462640	Philosophical origins of the whole I don't even like using the word woke because I think it's a mistake, but that's phenomenon
463400	469000	It is itself a product of continental philosophy right transported over to America
469200	476600	Christie's post-war and growing particularly in the 60s and then infiltrating humanities departments and social science departments and
477200	481800	Everything else though. Obviously like the the Allen Bloomsburg closing American mind is
482200	485760	It's partly a kind of trace of the if this intellectual current so
487240	493040	In that sense, I think that probably like the long-term trajectory
493040	497640	I think still similar in Europe and you can see it in Brussels
498160	503840	You know, it's still following. We're all basically downstream of the madness of San Francisco like it's different
506400	509960	But you're everywhere in Europe is downstream of
510920	516480	San Francisco's and sciencey. It's just a question. Is is that so true because I I think you're right
516480	519800	But the joke has always been in the United States that San Francisco is five years ahead of the US
519800	522400	And then whatever that madness is is roughly five years ahead of Europe
522400	524600	I think the time scales have actually compressed. It's more like a year
524600	527800	But you still think it's downstream of of the city. I'm speaking to you from
529120	531120	Exactly. Yeah
531520	534600	What do you know that the time to go is this
534600	539960	This kind of insane Petri dish of experimentation
542800	549600	The the Berkeley itself was like, you know, the kind of radical center of a lot of the so 67 68
550680	556760	Craziness, right? And and that kind of that impetus never died away. It's kept pushing
557960	559400	and
559400	562360	these things just have a have an incredible tendency to
563360	565520	Wash East know if you'd said
567160	573040	If you'd started to watch some of the just let's take for example some of the crazy shit on trans right
573840	579160	Now if you'd said a few years ago, okay, there's like a full-stack system in
579680	581560	Northern California
581560	583560	whereby kids are
584200	591560	Brainwashed into this crazy shit and then there's actually like you can go to Stanford Medical Center and they'll and they'll start
591560	595600	Giving you surgery and start talking about taking out ovaries from 12 year olds
595600	599720	And that's in Europe that I said that this is completely insane like that couldn't possibly happen
599720	601720	It actually sounds like child abuse
602360	606040	Ten years later here we all are right with this dealing with the same shit
606840	611480	So speaking of San Francisco one topic I wanted to get to we can't I guess we can just jump to it if we're following this
612040	615640	This you know bizarre sort of this this tour. So
616400	619440	We were talking recently Dominic or I know some of the people
619440	622560	So there's like an SF reform movement going on right there's some people
622560	627280	I think that we all know that who by the way are very well respected in tech more broadly like people like Gary Tan
627440	628680	Who has made quite a name?
628680	631920	He runs Y Combinator which speaking of influential organizations hugely
631920	639440	I went through it myself hugely influential organization people like David Sacks who was early on a PayPal a bunch of companies huge investor are
640040	644120	Putting real money and time into trying to change the politics of San Francisco
644120	646240	I think this is exactly what you just said
646280	651200	Which is the way I've dealt with it having lived here off and on for almost two decades is like it's not really a city
651200	658000	Don't expect saying city behavior. It is a Petri dish in which we will say oh psychedelic drugs game on or rule of law
658000	663560	Who needs it defund the police? Oh, let's see what happens or you know autonomous vehicles, you know, what's gonna happen, right?
663600	667520	Yeah, that said some people do care about seriously, which I support by the way
667800	673440	And they definitely want to reform it and change it and we were kind of studying the reasons as to why
673800	677080	We think it was broken. I I'll just toss that theory out there
677080	679720	You're filled free to disagree on and riff in another direction
679720	682680	But I think part of the problem with San Francisco is twofold
683200	687280	One there's endemic corruption going back decade. I mean going back to the gold rush days
687280	690920	It's always been just a pit of corruption at the city level and it's no different now
690920	697880	It's just masquerading under progressive politics in my opinion. There's a whole homeless industrial SF has the second highest municipal budget in the United States
697880	702680	I think over 11 billion dollars at this point. It's only a city of roughly seven to eight hundred thousand people
702680	706520	It's not a very big city. It has the second biggest municipal budget in the United States after New York
706520	710440	Where does that money go? You look you walk around it doesn't seem as if this is a well-funded city
710440	711760	It looks like a dystopia frankly
711760	712360	It's funny
712360	717960	I retweeted a photo recently someone posted of an autonomous vehicle in front of a homeless guy stealing electricity charges laptop
717960	722640	And that's exactly literally what I've described it as autonomous vehicles navigating around homeless people people think it's a joke
722640	724640	But that's literally what it is when you walk outside
724640	729520	so it's a combination of corruption and I think the other thing is and and to you know
730440	734640	Give a little shade to the tech people tech people fundamentally don't deeply care about politics
734640	736480	I think you have opinions on this
736480	740600	I think they just you know you go to a museum here and whoever funds it funds it
740600	743200	But like there's not a Google hospital or like a Facebook
743200	749240	I mean Zuck gives a fair amount of money you go to New York and even the biggest wall speed asshole has endowed like a wing of
749240	753560	You know Cornell Medical Center or whatever the latest exhibit is at the Met in San Francisco
753560	759480	That's less so people to it's a gold rush town people the miners come in either make a fortune and stick around or move to Marin
759520	763680	Or they leave and that's it. No, no one's kind of from here and no one really invests in a deep way
763680	766160	Although to be clear that's changing people like Gary. I think we're changing that
766520	770160	Any that's just all framing. What do you think it would take to fix San Francisco?
770160	774280	And we come can we maybe convince you to try to help fix it by coming to San Francisco?
774280	776280	I mean
776280	779280	What you say makes sense to me, but I
782480	788200	Guess like the obvious question is like the people who accept obviously is crime gets worse crime is obviously
789520	791520	often a very big issue in politics, right and
792480	794480	logic
795320	799200	San Francisco earlier this year like I turned the wrong corner
799200	803020	I went down a street and then suddenly felt like I've walked into like some kind of a poor leg
804320	806720	And literally had to run back down out the street
807840	814040	Really like 90 seconds for a way. There's like people coming around as if it's like perfectly normal. It's just
814760	820120	Hey, I then went and spoke to some people that night. I had dinner in Palo Alto and they're like
820880	824640	Fucking like you're in San Francisco. Like I haven't been there in like for you for you
825640	830780	I think I know I live in I live in London. I think I visit San Francisco more often than a lot of people in
832440	834440	Which maybe says something about
835680	841960	As you say about the disconnection between the tech world and the city but of the people who were left
842400	844680	Well
844680	847840	What so here's a question why why?
848920	850760	hasn't
850760	854800	Independence obviously Republicans have completely do but why haven't independence
856520	863880	Campaigning on crime and corruption being able to make any progress when it's when it's like when it's a global punchline
864880	867720	For like videos of apocalyptic dystopia

965280	965920	I
965920	971040	Think it's so the first time I ever got dog piled on Twitter was I don't know how many years ago
971040	974080	It was I guess in 2015 or 16 when they passed this thing called prop C
974400	978920	That was a tax on gross revenues, which is nuts particularly for tech businesses
979600	983120	To basically give more money to the homeless industrial complex even though it wasn't working
983120	985360	And I think I calculated how much money you would raise
985680	992000	Divided it by the number of homeless people and realized that it was as much money for homeless people as like the base salary as a Google engineer
992000	994440	They were literally put it falling that much money
994440	996040	And I'm like how is this possible?
996040	999160	I got totally dog piled and ripped apart now if you go and
999520	1002760	Criticize the homeless industrial complex or even call it that you don't get dog piled
1002760	1005880	And in fact, there's a whole set of people who are there with you saying yeah
1005920	1011160	We need to fix this and so I think the the vibe has definitely changed. There's been something like the recall of
1011880	1016920	Chesa Boudin who was literally the son of communist cop killers
1017600	1019000	It sounds like I'm making it up
1019000	1023200	But that actually who works for Chavez in Venezuela like it sounds like a like a punchline
1023200	1029240	But it's actually his biography and he got elected district a turret like the prop the equivalent of like the prosecutor, right?
1031520	1034560	And then it was like so outrageous he finally got kicked out
1034560	1039000	So I think some of that is happening and that was a crime issue. That was literally there is no law in order to get rid of this guy
1039600	1045640	So yeah, that that is I think that is happening to a certain degree. I guess though that so what one thing that
1046360	1049720	Possibly behind it. I don't know you tell me is that I found
1051280	1053600	So when I wrote this thing in 2021 saying
1055120	1059960	Like we're heading towards Biden Trump to like everyone thinks the Trump's finished and it's not going to come back
1059960	1066720	But actually we're heading towards Biden Trump to and let's Silicon Valley people decide to intervene and build alternatives
1068240	1074440	I spent some time talking to people there and the and the basic a problem that I had was people said
1075800	1083760	We largely agree with what you're saying and we largely agree that if it just ends up doing it as Trump Biden to that's obviously terrible, but
1086080	1089920	Precisely because politics has got so insane in the ways that you described
1090320	1097840	It's exactly why it's totally impossible for me and my friends and other people here who've got anything to actually get involved with it
1098480	1101440	Because it would just be instantly completely destructive and I'd
1101840	1107520	My family and my friends and my investors and my staff would all think I'd literally lost my fucking mind
1107760	1114120	If I suddenly said we're gonna build an alternative to Biden, you know, we've got to do something different
1114760	1122280	So it does seem to be this kind of catch-away to and it's similar catch-away to in Britain. I think that
1123760	1128600	As political as the kind as establishment politics becomes more insane and
1129080	1134920	The kind of communist mind virus expands and expands into the mainstream media as well
1134920	1141200	And they attack and trying to destroy the lives and careers of anyone who gets involved with politics
1141200	1143960	It doesn't share the kind of approach
1144920	1147640	Then it then there is this paradox where
1148760	1153440	Able people entrepreneurs builders people who could do it much better
1154760	1159760	Want to more and more and the probably more inclined to get involved with politics in one sense
1159760	1163000	And they were 10 15 years ago whether like politics is we know, whatever
1163360	1167200	Vote Obama and get on with building my my trillion dollar company
1168200	1173520	The the more inclined to get involved in one sense, but in another sense the madness is like it is system
1173520	1175520	Is a great room greater barrier?
1177000	1179000	As I know
1179520	1180600	I think that makes sense
1180600	1187000	I think yeah, I think the problem with techies is that not that they can't be political or be operators because they can they end up having
1187000	1190160	These large organizations, but I think a couple things one
1191120	1198360	The whole techie vibe just gives a lot of mainstream normie voters the ick to use zoomeries, which is like
1199640	1202320	It's just a different sort of vibe what it takes to make
1202320	1208160	I mean look at Mark Zuckerberg who I worked for I was at at Facebook 10 years ago on early members
1208160	1214880	I actually think very highly of them and I said as much in my memoir, but you know like you know that guy couldn't sell free
1214880	1216880	beer, I mean, it's just
1216880	1219080	It's just one of those things. I mean maybe now
1221160	1224160	Maybe but he also pissed off a lot of people like we raised the question
1224160	1228920	I could either run for mayor of San Francisco and win and I'm not I'm not sure he could actually even among techies
1228920	1232160	He may not be able to he actually might have a better chance and like Reno, Nevada
1232160	1236320	But you know, which is definitely more red than San Francisco than he wanted San Francisco
1237600	1242280	Yeah, I mean, I think he was a great example of this public right because he got someone who
1242640	1247960	Was actually a hero to lots of people on the left even just three to five years ago
1248600	1250400	He was very
1250400	1255600	Explicitly and openly saying I would change this a bit to you. That's why I'm going to do electric cars
1255600	1260040	And this is why we're going to do space exploration and etc etc etc and
1263240	1266080	But even someone with the
1266880	1268880	success that he had and
1269440	1273280	the kind of backstory of actually being on the side of the
1273880	1277600	Progressive supposes like one of the top three biggest causes
1278080	1283280	As soon as you basically put a couple of feet out of line with the establishment view
1284960	1289160	They just immediately said oh, you're a Nazi and we've got to start, you know
1289160	1291700	Having the DOJ investigate you and maybe we should take all your shit
1293560	1300320	And that's no, I mean I've had to me don't you know, like if if if Elon can go from being like
1300800	1306960	Global love figure to global hate figure in like 18 months then imagine what they could do to me, right?
1308040	1312080	And you're seeing it now as a as a side thing. I mean, you know relevant
1312560	1321100	Elon just went to Israel and inside of Twitter. I Jewish Twitter. It's a whole kerfuffle because a lot of sort of mainstream
1322040	1326260	bien penson liberal American Jews dislike Elon one for like
1327100	1333220	Applying snarkily to some vaguely anti-semitic tweet, maybe and also just maintaining a Twitter platform in which I mean to be blunt
1333220	1335380	There are kind of open anti-Semites on Twitter now
1335860	1338020	And they haven't been banned, right?
1338020	1342140	But he's definitely not he's obviously not telling the party line when it comes to content moderation on Twitter
1342140	1344860	But this is a guy who by the way went some of the places
1344860	1349740	I went to actually and reported from for tablet magazine like the actual keep it seem right in the Gaza border
1349740	1353860	He was seen wearing body armor in one of them because it actually is dangerous down like I was down there
1353860	1357580	It's a war zone. So the guy actually went there I spray set up met with hostages
1357940	1362100	Accepted a gift that I'm not taking off till you get your hostages back basically said. Yeah, Hamas has to be destroyed
1362100	1369220	This is this is unacceptable and he's still he's still being pillared as an anti-Semite because of his like content moderation policies on
1369220	1373940	Twitter, which are definitely not the sort of the sort of policies that the left would want. It's just it
1374300	1376300	Yeah, you just shaking my head
1376460	1377580	SMH
1377580	1381220	Yeah, I don't really think it's to do with content moderation though
1381220	1387660	I think it's I think it's a I think it's a much broader thing. He just he signaled that he is not with
1388380	1390380	the main
1390860	1394500	All right, and the way that the Ukraine war kind of
1395500	1398660	Coordinated in a very in a pretty unusual way
1399740	1401740	like establishment position
1402140	1404140	establishment politicians and media in
1404540	1407420	Washington and London and across Europe very quickly and
1408540	1410540	Anyone who stood out against that
1411220	1413220	I have I have the same thing here like
1413860	1420400	I've been like I've been like the one one in a thousand or one in ten thousand anti-putin for 20 years
1420780	1424220	Regarded as madly extreme in my anti-putin this right
1424620	1429500	Literally the whole thing just flipped because I said I think this war is a fuck up. I don't think there's an actual strategy
1429500	1432900	It's gonna end in tears. We're gonna get bored and then have to finish it for the news
1434260	1437260	Well, you're obviously a paid Putin shell your
1438100	1443620	Fascist Apologies, you're an evil perk the whole thing. So I think
1445220	1451980	He did he bought Twitter he said I'm pro free speech and he didn't tell the didn't tell the line on on Ukraine
1451980	1455500	All in short order and that was enough seemed to me

1515180	1517180	I
1518580	1524340	Wasn't so Torrenberg here is actually the son of Israeli Jew and I converted actually just so you know the company you're keeping her down
1524340	1526340	I
1526620	1532620	I went to Israel recently and you know, obviously, I'm pretty public about being kind of pro-Israel and what they're doing in the war
1532980	1535420	one thing that people have commented on and I
1535420	1536660	I tend to agree with it
1536660	1543300	Israeli PR is like terrible like they're just not cracking the nut when it comes to the West I have theories as to why but before I
1543420	1546260	Contaminate the the vibe. I'm curious if you agree with that
1547420	1551620	What is your take on Israel? What is your take on their PR strategy? Can they even win the PR war?
1552260	1554260	well, I think so a
1554420	1556380	Few things right
1556380	1562580	Ironically like the whole kind of you know Russia was involved with Trump in 2016 story was obviously complete bullshit
1562980	1564340	right, but
1564340	1570780	There was a major KGB operation from the 1960s to try and shape Western perception about
1571140	1573140	Israel in a negative way
1573300	1575300	that was highly successful and
1576060	1581860	Ended up influencing all kinds of publications in the West including publications read by people like Jeremy Corbyr, right?
1581860	1584900	The guy who took over the lay of party here who's like crazy
1585740	1587460	extreme anti
1587460	1592340	anti-Israel so you have like almost became and almost became PM to be clear
1592620	1599860	Yeah, it's within like 12,000 vote 12,000 votes distributed in different seats and and he would have been Prime Minister in 2017
1599860	1601740	Yeah, exactly um
1601740	1609300	So there's those like very long-term currents which have programmed the intelligentsia here for
1609900	1617620	For decades in ways which I think are almost like not one in 10,000 people know the history of this and quite understand
1617620	1619620	What what like how this actually worked?
1620500	1622500	You also though have
1622980	1629100	It's clear talking to people there that the you know Netanyahu does not have a grip of the whole Prime Minister's office
1629740	1635300	It's chaotic Prime Minister's office does not coordinate well with Mossad and other parts of the deep state in Israel
1635300	1637900	So like there is no concerted problem messaging
1639100	1640780	Either
1640780	1644580	So I think in a kind of tactical operational sense that's in that's important
1646020	1652420	But also though, I think there's like a psychological problem, which is that they keep they think that
1655100	1657100	They think
1657500	1661580	They make what I think is like a common problem, which is they think it's basically about facts
1661780	1666740	they think oh these we watch this terrible news from the BBC or whatever and
1669420	1675300	These people don't know the truth and if we explain the actual facts about Hamas and explain blah blah blah
1676140	1678140	Then it'll suddenly change somehow
1678660	1683980	And so they keep trying to hammer it with certain PR strategies of the Western media
1684500	1686500	But I think it's just fundamentally
1686940	1688180	flawed
1688180	1691060	because I don't think it's about facts like the
1692260	1697140	Sad truth is that BBC like all the broadcasters
1697940	1703700	They have a long-term moral simple moral story about why Israel are
1704700	1707060	Is an apartheid state and their occupiers
1708100	1713100	And everything all information filters into this simple story and then filters out
1713980	1718940	Right, and then and that's it. It doesn't it doesn't require it doesn't work on the basis of facts
1718940	1722100	It doesn't work on the basis of reason doesn't work on the basis of logic
1722220	1728380	So I think any PR strategy which tries to combat it with facts and reason and logic is just is doomed
1729420	1731420	but it's like
1732220	1735660	It's a bit like in a way like in a small in a small scale obviously
1735660	1738500	But just in terms of what you were saying before about about Zuckerberg
1739060	1740660	When the first crazy
1740660	1744020	Carol card one of the stories came out in 2016 about
1744500	1747580	Russia and Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and all of that
1748220	1754100	Facebook sort of thought well, this is all such obvious bullshit and like it doesn't reflect how digital advertising actually works
1754500	1757540	We'll explain some facts and then everyone will realize what the truth is
1757900	1762420	They didn't understand that they were actually caught up in them in a in a moral story, right?
1762420	1766900	But the whole point was evil tech companies have helped the evil fascists
1767620	1774300	So just explaining to you at times guys like your coverage doesn't actually understand what how digital marketing works
1774300	1779740	And if we you know, we'll explain to you how digital marketing works and then you know, there's terrible coverage
1779740	1784980	We'll go away who's that work in Facebook like clearly operating like this for like three years
1785300	1789380	And then in the end they why don't we just keep getting fucked it like what's going on here?
1789700	1795300	But that's why right because they're trying to deal with logic in facts about something that's sort about logic in facts
1796140	1801820	Yeah, and I found that same trap. So my book came out in 2016, which is a memoir, which you know was a very kind of
1802260	1807660	Inside truthy. What's that? I read it great. Oh, great. Oh, thank you. Great. Thanks. Yeah
1807660	1813260	And I yeah, I actually met that Carol Calder were a figure once at some festival and yeah
1813260	1818020	Yeah, and it's worth noting that in her career career before being a journalist
1818020	1821060	I'm using air quotes for those listening to a podcast. She was a novelist
1821060	1824380	Which I think is probably where her talent should have remained because given
1824980	1828980	Literally everything she wrote about Facebook was completely fictional, but I also felt. Oh, yeah
1828980	1831660	No, no, no, I'm gonna explain how digital marketing works as I've been on the inside
1831660	1833660	It got nowhere it meant it meant nothing
1833660	1839220	Everyone still thinks that the Russian influence campaign or that this came to analytical thing was real and yeah, you're right
1839220	1841220	I mean it was just hopeless at the end
1842420	1845660	But but getting back to Israel like I mean
1846140	1850980	Once like kind of argument is that like the videos that first came out of like the barbaric attacks did have some impact
1850980	1855940	Like there was a window of like one week of grace period in which world-dependent seemed to be kind of pro-Israel as you saw
1855940	1862140	Literally the most barbaric and heinous atrocities being committed like literally live streamed by the people actually committing it
1862300	1866180	And I think, you know, I saw the famous 46 minute video
1866180	1872700	That's even like more gory of what Hamas did as did Douglas Murray and other journalists and they've reacted very strongly to it
1872700	1875660	I included it in my piece and tablet about what's going on there. So
1876220	1879340	to some degree I think and I think truth does help but
1880140	1883940	Getting back to like you're right. It doesn't fit into the narrative like this poster business
1883940	1887540	Which has driven me crazy right this business of ripping down. I've put kidnapped posters
1889260	1891500	Just on that point because I think that's an important thing right
1892500	1894980	In one sense like you can't really get
1895620	1900420	PR or a story stronger than what Hamas did
1901380	1907460	And to me the actual interesting thing there is right, that's like pretty much bad as it gets right
1907460	1913180	It's like sort of filming the torture to chambers of the NKVD and the Gestapo in Eastern Europe
1915220	1917220	But within like 10 days, it's basically
1918900	1922180	The NPCs in the media just go back to the script
1923180	1925180	So even
1925900	1927420	Mentally
1927420	1932580	Appalling as that and as powerful as that basically only knocks them off script for you know
1932580	1938020	Like a few new cycles like maybe 10 days and then they're back to oh Israel's destroyed a hospital in Gaza. I
1939100	1944100	Know right. It's crazy. It's like imagine the Nazis had like live streamed Auschwitz and then like two weeks later people were like
1944100	1948180	Wow, I don't know were they really shoved in ovens did this expert of
1952420	1956260	Exactly, I don't know that they know the dead German civilian count is higher than the British one
1956260	1959020	I think we should have a ceasefire. That's clearly what we should do now
1959020	1962820	That was clear the tenor of the conversation in 1943 at 10 downing
1964140	1967820	Yeah, no, I agree with you. Um, yeah, and that I mean now
1970180	1974220	To me like like the people in Israel doing the communications
1975020	1981740	Understand this way. I feel so sorry for them because watching them it looked like it looks increasingly like that
1982540	1988980	Like doesn't the world sort of knows what Hamas did right, but it seems like we can't get traction with this
1989300	1990580	so like
1990580	1992580	repeating it or and
1992620	1994620	They seem to be like increasingly lost
1995180	2000900	As there's there's some realized like global opinion and the global media is away from the story
2000900	2007300	But they don't have like a follow-up plan. No, I think so, you know, I've got lots of Israeli friends
2007300	2009300	I've Israeli business partners. I was there for a while
2009780	2011420	Who knows I may move there one these days
2011420	2015180	I think the problem with Israel and I said this in my piece is like the Israelis
2015500	2020300	Israel is a fascinating country with the fascinating people. They don't realize how weird they are, right?
2020300	2025780	Like they're obviously very assimilated to like global American Anglo whatever Western business culture
2025780	2029180	They've obviously been very very successful as an economy GDP per capita
2029860	2031860	matching Germany in the UK's which is
2031860	2036300	More than 10x higher than any neighboring country. It's like they're very good at playing the Western game
2036420	2042580	But the internal Israeli nation narrative is completely unlike the West right now to the point that like
2043180	2045080	One of the questions I got from a friend of mine is like
2045080	2050500	How is it that the Western left is lining up with a theocratic death cult instead of like the Israeli left?
2050500	2054860	Which is actually super commie by the way, and it's funny like all these kibbutz that were attacked by Hamas
2055140	2058820	Like European press was calling them settlements. It's like do you have any idea what you're talking about?
2058820	2062980	This is literally the lefty tree hugging peaceniks who live in literal communism
2062980	2068140	Where they literally split up the income and live in the only functioning communism one confined in the West
2068220	2073780	That's who got attacked. That's who you're calling settlers and and and painting as the right, but that's the thing
2073780	2075780	I think the Israelis
2076020	2079400	How are they gonna sell the story they're a religious ethno-state like
2079900	2086300	That's square with a Western narrative in which oh, no, it's borderless. It's universalist anybody can be Norwegian
2086300	2087580	right like this business of the
2087580	2092860	You know the Irish the Algerian or whatever it was immigrant who like stabbed the kid in Ireland that they kept on saying
2092860	2097580	No, no, no, it's it's an Irish man. It's like no it isn't and the fact he isn't it's some of the material to the story
2097580	2101060	But you can't accept the fact that in fact not everybody can become an Irish man or whatever
2101060	2106940	And that's that's the collision like I'm not sure that Israel can be sold and at some point like my advice to them would like win
2106940	2108940	The war and just it doesn't matter what the West
2110140	2114380	But I mean you can see the kind of madness of the West right
2116060	2119980	The the most the most perfect example of it
2120540	2127340	The way that the most insane trans-right activist propaganda people have kind of joined forces
2129740	2132860	The first people who are all getting thrown off the roof
2133700	2135300	stat
2135300	2136580	of
2136580	2140780	mobilizing most aggressively on behalf of
2141500	2143500	Hamas and Hezbollah
2144020	2149340	I understand the madness of Western. I mean to the first Israelis. It is pretty tough to understand that right
2150220	2154620	I mean, it's like, you know, joke is it's like chickens organizing for KFC. It's like I
2155220	2159740	Do you understand what the nature of the thing you're talking about is? Yeah
2161660	2165900	So maybe switching topics slightly to one of the questions and one of the things came up in our group
2166940	2171780	So, you know Dominic you, you know, I pretty clearly in Britain where things are pretty classic
2171780	2174540	So at least as far as I understand, I actually don't know the UK deeply well
2174540	2176700	I've lived in Spain and France, but I don't know the UK well
2176700	2178700	but but you have hovered in elite circles and
2179420	2182180	I've kind of dabble. I mean in tech, right?
2182900	2187060	Well, this is the real core of the question. What is an elite? What is the new elitism that's coming?
2187060	2192220	There's a lot of people that I think we all know who are from those elite circles are very financially
2192700	2197060	Capable and endowed and privileged and all that and they're not gonna send their kids to university, right?
2197060	2200020	Like they're just not gonna go the Harvard Cambridge route or whatever that is
2200020	2203420	And but they don't they don't have an alternative like they don't know what what's the other thing
2203700	2207180	So is there a new elite coming does there need to be a new elite like what?
2207460	2211100	What's your read on all that? I mean you have kids I assume. So this is like a real question for you
2211100	2211740	I
2211740	2216020	Mean a lot a lot of different questions bound up in that. I do think that
2217900	2219900	Was the one thing is you alluded to I
2220900	2224860	Think it's very interesting about this question like are we gonna send our
2225580	2228380	Like I've got a seven year old a seven year old kid
2230300	2231700	You know ten years ago
2231700	2234460	I would probably not really have even reflected on it much
2234460	2238980	But just would have assumed that obviously like I wanted to do certain kind of school and then
2239780	2241780	Ideally get into one of the top
2242580	2247740	universities in the Western world and I wouldn't have probably reflected on it much. Whereas now I
2248980	2250980	think
2251980	2256580	The opposite I think maybe in maybe in like 10 12 years
2256780	2260420	Like if he really wants to do maths and he's really good at maths
2260420	2266540	Then maybe he should still go to Cambridge or Harford if he can get into one of those two places, but barring that
2268580	2270580	It seems to me
2270820	2272820	Less likely with every day
2273620	2278900	That that's something that I would want him to go and spend his time in quite the opposite
2279740	2281740	So I do think that's a big issue
2282260	2283980	I
2283980	2287820	Hope that some of the rich people do what their
2288660	2290660	Forefathers it
2291500	2294740	And actually go out and start new things. I also hope
2296300	2298300	It also strikes me that maybe there's an opportunity
2298780	2304820	To kind of jailbreak the maths and physics departments because a lot of the credibility of these universities
2304820	2308660	Why doesn't any more come from the history of the English department or whatnot?
2308660	2310660	Which is all just taken over by
2311580	2317180	By insane forces the credibility that they have left really comes from doing hard sciences
2317820	2319500	So maybe
2319500	2324940	You know one one thing I've been talking to some people about is the idea of could you say
2326140	2328140	Right, we're going to set up something
2328620	2335940	An offer faculty from maths physics, maybe computer science and say you only have to move like half a mile away
2337260	2339260	For work you don't have to move your family
2339380	2343380	But you can shift to a new institute which we're going to run
2343380	2344540	It's gonna be running the following ways
2344540	2349140	There's gonna be actual academic freedom all of the crazy communist shit is going to be completely forbidden
2349580	2351580	None of it's going to exist
2351620	2353300	and
2353300	2357900	Here's the kind of principles on which it will operate you'll get more money you'll get more freedom
2358300	2362380	You'll be able to move much faster. You know if you're a professor of physics now at Oxford
2363260	2365260	The amount that you can actually do
2365620	2371420	In any kind of time frame is like almost zero because the bureaucracy is so completely insane
2372140	2377260	So I think there are there are possibilities like that maybe for for creating different
2378140	2382220	For creating different institutions. It doesn't strike me as likely that in like 30 years time
2385740	2389260	The smartest kids are all going to be keeping going to these universities
2389740	2391260	And they're going to be
2391260	2393260	You know as mad as they are now politically
2393820	2397580	So something's going to something's going to change there. Are they going to break up and fracture?
2398220	2402060	Or people are going to create new things and pull away high status people
2403100	2405100	And a little change like that
2407580	2409580	And obviously
2409580	2413260	Yeah, so on the on the university front. I think that's but
2413740	2417820	Politically though the fundamental question is I think goes back to what we were talking about before
2419740	2426220	We've you know, we've we've seen in the western world this very big shift in elite talent
2426940	2428220	Where
2428220	2432540	You know 50 years ago or 70 years ago a huge number of the most able
2433180	2437420	Smartest people that could actually build things the general groves characters
2438620	2441020	Of people who built bletchley in britain, right?
2442700	2444700	These people have
2444700	2447260	Very largely stopped going into public service
2447980	2452620	So if you go to the the caliber of top civil servants now in in britain
2453420	2456220	And in washington is drastically lower
2456780	2461180	And more and more of the of the most able people are in some combination of maths money
2462620	2463740	pc
2463740	2465580	hedge funds
2465580	2467100	startup world
2467100	2469100	et cetera et cetera now
2469420	2472620	That obviously has all kinds of advantages from an economic perspective
2473100	2475980	But I think it's also disastrous from a government perspective
2476780	2479020	And some of these people are going to need to have to get
2479820	2484380	Again, I'm going to move back into politics. I think if it's going to change. We can't just have
2485340	2487340	all of our great builders
2488300	2491900	Operating as entrepreneurs in private companies whilst
2492940	2495260	you know the cia and the nsa and
2495980	2497980	white haired institutions
2498460	2502460	Just keep decaying and are less and less able to cope with with problems
2504220	2505580	But then the
2505580	2509820	Right, but then the question becomes do you sort of revitalize existing institutions or do you create new ones?
2511420	2513420	At the end of the day, I mean, I'm
2513420	2516300	Really in the camp. I mean having having done both in government
2516940	2518940	I very strongly think that um
2519260	2521260	The startup model is the way that
2521820	2524860	To go in government like if you're going to try if if your goal is
2525420	2528380	if you so if you're the new president you take over january 2025
2529100	2530220	and by
2530220	2535580	2030 20 20 20 35 you want a drastically reformed american military
2536140	2537580	Do you a
2537580	2543820	Try to do some kind of conventional reform project in the pentagon or b set up new institutions
2544380	2546380	That will just tunnel
2546700	2548700	around the bureaucracy
2548700	2554300	Empowered in different ways legally set up in different ways with completely different freedoms over hr
2554700	2558620	Over freedom of information over procurement over, you know, all of the bullshit
2558940	2565580	Which makes it just impossible to do any and it's obvious that you do be right. You don't say to the u.s. Air Force
2566140	2570780	Um, I mean, I've I'll give you like a classic example that I've actually had experience within government
2571980	2578220	What do you do with future planes? Well, of course the existing raf in britain doesn't want to do drones
2579020	2583660	Because the whole institutional structure and the whole way you get promoted is by being in charge of pilots
2584460	2586460	so
2586460	2588460	He fights against all
2589100	2594460	Against actually shifting to modern technology. So instead of trying to convince this old bureaucracy
2595180	2599180	To do the new thing you just set up as you set up the drone force, right?
2599260	2601980	You don't try and make the old thing do the new thing
2602300	2605740	You set up the new thing and you just shift money and power towards the new thing
2606220	2607420	um
2607420	2609580	You know, it is possible to reform things
2610220	2616860	And I've reformed some things. I spent a lot of time in the department of education changing things, but it's incredibly hard
2617020	2619020	It's incredibly slow
2619260	2620220	um
2620220	2624220	The forces against you are so massive and you've got to kind of get everything aligned
2625180	2632540	Just right. It's it's just much simpler to to to do startups in government that it is to to um
2633580	2635580	I'll give you a practical example of that as well
2635660	2639820	So we set up a new data science and ai team in number 10
2640940	2642700	Because it was new
2642700	2646140	It was actually much easier to create it seemed much less threatening
2646940	2647660	um
2647660	2654460	It didn't seem like it like this terrible challenge to existing power structures the way that telling a lot of existing things
2654540	2656540	That had to change would have been
2656620	2659580	Uh, of course now it's actually successful and it's doing all sorts of things
2659660	2664460	Of course part of the system are desperately trying to close it and destroy it because it shows everyone up
2664540	2667500	But it's super ours for the old parts of the system
2667980	2669980	But it certainly was much easier to get
2670860	2672460	that it was
2672460	2674460	You know persuade thousands of people to change
2675020	2677340	What if you're trying to become president?
2677900	2680620	In the first place you talk about, you know, if you do become president
2680620	2684380	But if you're trying to win in the first place, do you try to take over the left?
2684780	2689100	Do the democratic party? Do you try to take over the republican party? Do you start a new party?
2689900	2693340	How would you how would you think about that? I know you're interested in america 2024
2694300	2695340	Um
2695340	2697340	Talk talk about that
2697340	2699900	I mean, I think practically speaking now in the states like the
2700460	2704940	I think the the die is cast on the republican side, right? Like trump is going to win the nomination now
2705180	2711580	This seems like a lot of donors are going to throw a lot of money down the toilet trying to back. Um, hailey. I think, um
2712860	2720300	She cut there's no campaign that she can run that can win like possibly trunk can blow himself up. Um, but uh
2721180	2723180	She she got
2724300	2730540	Time to do that as I said in 2021 was then um, and and and they've left all that too late. Um
2731180	2736300	I do think it's underrated with biden that uh, the kind of assumption seems to be that
2736700	2738860	Now he wants to do it. Therefore, he'll just keep doing it
2739260	2743500	I think an underrated scenario is that he just takes like another mental dip
2744220	2748140	And the polls blip down enough that it's just clear that trump is going to win
2749020	2756140	The electoral college and all the focus group reports start pinging back up through the system from the five six key states saying
2757100	2759500	Yeah, there's all this thing though to say that
2760060	2764780	Biden doesn't mean biden biden means either we've seen our biden gargar biden
2764780	2770060	They can't actually be president or it's going to be president kamala and we'd rather have trump than president kamala
2770380	2773580	So fuck it. We're gonna go for trump and as those focus group reports come back up
2773660	2775260	You can imagine panicking
2775260	2781740	Democratic party and they shove him out. So I do think it's underrated that biden could still get the that he could get pushed out
2782380	2783980	um
2783980	2788700	I mean it was a setting up a new party. So I did some focus group and polling research on this
2789100	2790220	um
2790220	2792220	last year in the states
2792940	2795180	And it was we we hit a kind of interesting problem like
2797020	2801340	Figuring out what a new party should say and do to be very popular
2801980	2805580	Was not so hard right which is generally a lesson of electoral politics
2805740	2807740	If you actually just listen and you want to figure it out
2808220	2812540	There's there's usually a way the problem that we found was that people said
2813500	2819020	Yeah, god, we hate the old parties. It's crazy that they're so shit. It's crazy that they won't change and listen to us
2820540	2822540	Yes, I want the third party
2822540	2826940	But I probably wouldn't vote for it and you go but why not like you literally just said all these things and now
2826940	2832140	We've given you the third party. Here's our policy. We've designed it. We've got your theoretical leader that you like
2832700	2835100	But then what like why are you not going to vote for it? And they go
2835980	2841260	Well, because we're just going to be a waste of vote and the crazy people never get in and like the whole from the country
2842700	2849020	So they kind of that first pass the post problem. I think is it is a real problem and I think
2849980	2855580	To realistically you like it's so therefore like getting over that. It's either a very long process
2855740	2858380	You have to resign yourself might take 20 30 years to build
2859260	2860460	or
2860460	2862460	You need a kind of global superstar
2862700	2864700	You need an elon type person
2865020	2873020	Or can you type person someone of someone of that level of global fame that just like instantly punches through all media
2873020	2874060	Do you know what I mean?
2874060	2876300	Yeah, let's say it wasn't too late
2876300	2880860	It was like a couple years ago and someone like elon had come to you and said hey, you know, I want to run
2881100	2886300	I want I want to compete. What is sort of the core issues or what is the platform that would that would that would
2886700	2889180	That would be able to compete that would that would most widely resonate
2889260	2892140	I think you talked about this a little bit in your podcast with andrew sullivan
2892700	2893900	um
2893900	2895900	When you unpack that a little bit
2896860	2898460	um
2898460	2899500	well
2899500	2900540	again, so
2900540	2901740	so
2901740	2908300	What issues really simple right and kind of shows the problem if you if you just do regular focus use of people and you chat around
2910300	2915900	What sort of things that people people want one of the first things that people will spontaneously say is term limits
2916700	2921740	We've got all of these old people. We've got these like senile people in both parties everywhere
2922220	2925980	It's it's an it's an embarrassment for us on the world stage
2926860	2932700	We've got to have term limits and drive these old people out and get new talent in and also we just not just old people
2932700	2934700	We just don't want the same people there all the time
2935340	2941820	And it cuts completely across party support. You can aoc fans support it trump fans magus the most
2942620	2943980	board is like
2943980	2945980	a total home run
2946380	2947740	But why do no
2947740	2952300	But the old parties can't support it right because the old parties are locked into a system where if you say that
2952860	2958460	That's like that's like calling for like everybody in congress to to be you know, investigated by the irf
2959500	2961820	It's like it's declaring war on the system
2962620	2968700	But if you're going to be a third party you didn't care about that you prepared to take risks and and you and you were just openly out
2968700	2970380	war with the system anyway
2970380	2972380	then you'd have a bunch of things like
2973500	2976700	Term limits like much stricter controls on congress
2977340	2981820	All of their dodgy sharing, you know buy stocks and shares and inside failing all that kind of crazy shit
2982060	2984060	You have a whole set of things like that
2984860	2986860	um, I think you'd be
2987020	2992860	Uh, you'd be very tough on the border very tough on crime like you'd be much closer to trump on that
2993420	2998620	And it's constantly interested like the democrats are just out of touch with a lot of their own voters on that
2999500	3003020	Like I can't remember now when I did all this research it was last year and I can't remember the exact numbers
3003020	3010060	But no there's a good chunk of democrats who uh, uh, um, who supported biden in 2020
3010860	3016140	Who basically agree with trump on police the border, uh, etc, etc
3016780	3018300	um
3018300	3024540	I think you'd be crazy to do a lot of what the republicans trying to do constantly writing on social security and
3024940	3026940	and um, destroying obama care
3027500	3029500	again, I would
3029660	3031660	everything like that, um
3034540	3039580	Trying to like have some kind of big argument about the overall structure of the healthcare system is just doomed
3039820	3045500	I've I've run a whole bunch of focus groups on that. There's no way through. There is no like
3046380	3052380	Great new universal plan that people go. Oh, yeah, okay. This guy's cracked it and this is what we should do
3052780	3057180	But I think definitely you definitely have um, you definitely avoid that. Um
3058620	3060620	But I think
3061020	3068540	A bit like a bit like um, what we did in 2016 and 2019, right? We got attacked by the media constantly as being completely incoherent
3069580	3071580	uh, um, and it was
3071820	3073580	Because our agenda
3073580	3078140	Didn't fit neatly onto the existing party access and it didn't fit onto a left-right thing
3078780	3084380	So we were much tougher on immigration than the conservatists were but we were actually in the same place as the country was
3084860	3086860	Like we were with the median voter
3087660	3093420	We were um to the left so to speak of the conservator party on um healthcare
3094060	3098460	But we were exactly where the median voter was now in west minster all the media say
3098860	3102860	Oh, your policy is in go here and no one will pay attention to that doesn't make any sense
3103020	3105020	But that's not how voters think
3105420	3107820	So again, if you're constructing if you're constructing
3108540	3112700	A party in the states and you just were optimizing for winning
3113740	3119420	Right, not whether or not the pundits say you're smart or whether your strategy makes sense if you're just optimized for winning
3120220	3124540	It's it's definitely going to look a bit odd like that. It won't fit into the conventional party structure
3124540	3126540	It won't fit on a left-right axis
3126620	3128620	And that's partly because like
3129420	3133900	It is sort of crude caricature terms if you if you do focus groups in research
3134620	3136620	on swing voters
3136620	3140620	Whether it's in california or or pennsylvania or in britain
3141340	3144460	They're kind of nationalist, right? They are
3146380	3148380	Then they are far to the right
3149020	3156220	Of most elected representatives on many issues and and to the left of them on many issues at the same time the same person
3156780	3161740	And this is completely constantly. I think I underrated and and not um
3163020	3167980	So the whole political punditry world works constantly on this idea of the center ground
3168620	3171820	Which is regarded as this kind of average of left and right
3172620	3174620	Oh, there's balloons coming up
3176620	3178620	Yeah
3178620	3180620	Um
3180620	3184220	This idea of the center ground whether where people are kind of average of left and right
3184940	3186300	And it's just
3186300	3191820	It all pundits basically believe it and there's endless everyone writes about it in every election
3192060	3196060	But it just doesn't actually map to the data of how how real voters
3197580	3199500	Yeah, I mean it's I mean I agree with you, right?
3199500	3203500	Like it's funny one of the catchphrases you see of san francisco your average san francisco guy is like
3204140	3209740	I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative. It's like actually most americans are fiscally liberal and socially conservative
3209980	3211980	As a matter of fact your it's you
3212140	3215100	I mean that that is an elite view but most americans are actually not like that
3215100	3218780	They're actually socialists of the core and the government better not touch my medical care
3219180	3221180	But they're actually to the right and a bunch of other issues
3221820	3223180	exactly
3223180	3226940	One thing I I wouldn't I don't know if I pushed back on it because I suspect that party would actually still win
3227180	3233180	But one thing I've noticed again the eu us difference in the eu however, and again, I mean the the continent for the most part
3234220	3238940	However broken any political process might be it does seem like things kind of converge
3239340	3243100	If there is a majority view and to use one particularly hot button issue, but
3243580	3246940	It's it's a good issue because it's very parameterized abortion, right?
3247180	3252620	Abortion is actually not a binary thing the real debate is actually at what is the what is the cutoff at which abortion happens
3252860	3257340	And if you look at most polling in the united states, it's almost exactly where the law dictates in most european
3257420	3260220	Again, I'm not sure what the laws in the uk, but in germany france and spain
3260220	3264460	It's basically anywhere between 11 to 13 weeks is the upper bound for abortion
3264700	3268300	That tends to be where people pull at most people don't want a total ban
3268540	3271660	Most people don't want an abortion literally two seconds before the child is born
3271980	3275420	And most people land in that 35 and and americans are the same way by the way
3275900	3278140	And and yet the narrative in the united states is either
3278780	3283020	Fully banned no way like the catholic party line or it's the liberal line
3283100	3288460	Which is any encroachment to abortion is unthinkable never mind that like when disantis for example
3288460	3291660	I think in his initial platform he had a 15 week limit
3291820	3298220	Which is more permissive than most european countries and most american liberals like didn't even seem to understand
3298700	3302620	That actually florida abortion law would be more to the left than france's would
3303260	3305740	But it didn't matter right but in the u.s. Thing and then
3306220	3311900	And i could cite examples when it comes to to gun laws to a bunch of other things where in fact most americans are not crazy
3311900	3315100	I need to own a tank gun nuts nor total banners or somewhere in the middle
3315340	3318780	And yet in europe policy tends to converge to the democratic meme
3319020	3322060	But in the u.s. Actually it does it it actually pins to the extremes
3322300	3327500	And i don't know if that's because of primary first pass post voting or what but it things can be different
3328220	3331100	Because of the proof because of the primary problem become
3332700	3338700	On certain things like abortion because as you say it's um, I mean so again, I looked at this issue last
3342060	3344060	Last year um
3344060	3351180	And you can see like how you could craft a policy on abortion which would basically be like reasonably popular with people but
3351580	3353580	It will be attacked
3353740	3358300	Whether you're a republican or democrat you'd be massively attacked by the people on your own side
3359180	3361180	for
3361180	3363180	Proposal if you actually crafted
3363740	3367180	The like the optimal strategy on abortion for a presidential candidate
3367660	3373420	As soon as you said it you would be attacked whether you're a republican or democrat by by your own side as like
3374060	3379340	As a mass traitor, but i've got a theory on this like it's not inconceivable to me
3380060	3384940	The trump might actually go into the next by like september october 2024
3385660	3391100	Trump may have a more popular policy on uh, it'd be closer to the median voter and have
3392460	3395340	Uh a more popular policy on abortion than than biden
3396540	3403340	Because if you look at his history, he was never a kind of um very far right on this issue. It's from new york. Um
3404460	3406460	So it's possible
3406540	3408540	possible
3408700	3414380	Certainly if you listen to the polls, he will do but it would be a very interesting move for him suddenly to shift
3416460	3420300	And and here's and here's an alternative like way of how the of how abortion works
3420300	3422300	Like during 2020 election campaign
3422700	3428220	Biden actually shifted from a more popular policy on abortion to a less popular policy on abortion
3428700	3430060	Why did that shift happen?
3430060	3434460	It happened because the staff in his own campaign revolted and basically
3434700	3441980	Demanded of him that he changed policy and he didn't feel strong enough at that moment in the campaign when he was still weak
3442540	3447420	to push back against his own staff and that shows like another dynamic at this point the democrats are
3448220	3454060	so taken over by very young very elite university educated
3455020	3456380	staff
3456380	3461980	That they constantly push their own campaigns to positions which are completely irrational
3462540	3464540	If you're actually trying to optimize for winning
3465100	3466220	You know, can you see this?
3466220	3472860	There's all sorts of vapor out on this right in 2016 something like a third of the ads that hillary ran actually helped trump
3473420	3475420	and the ads which were most
3475900	3483180	Popular with democrat activists and donors and got most clicks with them with the most helpful towards trump
3484140	3489660	Right, this is like a crazy thing which doesn't fit with the conventional wisdom the conventional wisdom is
3489740	3493580	Okay, politicians may be shittered government, but they are at least trying to win elections
3494220	3496700	That is not true. It's almost never true
3497420	3502060	Politicians generally are optimizing for much shorter term things. They're optimizing for internal
3502540	3507980	Kind of in-group dynamics in their factions and signaling to the media over like a 48 hour window
3508460	3510460	That's most of what their activity is
3510780	3513660	And that's what explains this constant weird stuff of wide
3514380	3516380	wire politicians not actually
3516620	3521420	Adopting the optimal strategy, which is doesn't make ends basic democratic theory
3522540	3526700	But is that unique to the u.s. Because like again in the u. Just just to cite the european example
3527020	3529660	Things have kind of converged to the public will in the u.s. They have it
3531020	3531980	um
3531980	3538540	No, I think it's I think it's uh, I mean, I think it's why I think it's I think it's widespread across across democratic
3539180	3544060	I guess across democratic politics. I think america is a bit odd because of the primary thing
3544700	3549660	But um britain has definitely been the same, you know, I've watched elections here 20 years
3553980	3561020	Certainly since 2010 the only election campaign that was actually rational was our campaign in 2019
3562540	3566060	It's just apart from that both sides constantly run
3567020	3570220	Run election messages, which are just which clearly don't work
3570940	3573660	And another example of it, right isn't the referendum
3575580	3584220	Our strategy was hated by all of the mps and um the most kind of committed activists on our own side
3585820	3587580	Because these people
3587580	3589580	They don't really want to listen to the public
3590700	3594380	What they want to do is is tell the public what they should believe
3595260	3599100	And they constantly think well if you just shout louder at them and tell them more
3599660	3603660	Then the public's finally going to go all right. Okay. Well, I agree with you. Okay, right
3604380	3610300	Which is not how things usually work, but they hate listening people importantly hate listening
3611660	3613020	Yeah
3613020	3618460	Can I can I bring up one last thing speaking of alternatives to democracy one topic that came up in in our group chat this morning?
3618940	3620300	um, I believe uh
3620300	3622300	A venture capitalist we both know dominic
3622860	3626460	Was hanging around with uh king charles. He's king now, right?
3627100	3631100	Part of my privilege is being an american is not thinking about royals, which is what spurred the debate
3631740	3636300	He felt that the british the british monarchy has a certain gravitas
3636780	3638780	And a certain social function to play
3639900	3641500	As head of state
3641500	3645500	I think it's a ridiculous out ofistic throwback to a barbaric age that we should be done away with
3646220	3650460	I think one of the most ridiculous things about the australians and the canadiens that they still have a foreign monarch on their coin
3650780	3655820	Unlike us crazy americans gun nuts that we are we have no foreign monarch on our coins. Thank you very much
3656460	3661420	And in fact my my right as an american is not thinking about which royal waste rule popped out of which royal vagina
3661660	3663660	I don't have to think about this crap
3664060	3665820	And I think that in fact if there is a liberal democrat
3665900	3667980	I mean, I think the role of head of state though is important
3668220	3671500	And one thing that actually the westminster not the westminster system, I guess but
3671900	3675500	Other parliamentary systems have is they have a head of state that's different than the head of government, right?
3675500	3679420	Like in israel, for example, um, you know, you've got her's izak herzog
3679420	3684060	Who's the head of state who meets with douglas murray and the hostages and kind of represents the people?
3684060	3688700	And then you've got the head of government who everyone hates of course because the head of government always hated who actually operationally runs things
3689100	3691900	And um, if there's one thing the american political system gets wrong
3692140	3694220	Is the head of government the head of state are basically the same person
3694540	3699340	Which is why national politics are basically symbolic religious wars when really it should be about who's the best ceo
3699500	3703980	But in any case that's a that's a long wind up. But what do you think of the royals dominic? Are they worth keeping around?
3704780	3705580	um
3705580	3712140	I mean obviously the thing is ridiculous in lots of ways, but I think you're being too russian is tantonia. I think you're thinking
3712940	3718860	But well, it's this weird throwback and it doesn't really make any sense and they all have these
3719260	3724460	Weird outfits and how can this possibly be a rational way of looking at it? But um
3726700	3728700	I would say
3731260	3736540	Russianism in european politics is uh as often being the path to catastrophe
3737180	3738460	um
3738460	3745980	The people family makes no logical sense, but I would actually be in favor of keeping it and I think that um
3746940	3749420	I've got two basic two basic things
3750860	3755740	One is that I think from a practical point of view if it was replaced
3756380	3761340	It's almost inconceivable that what replaced it will be an improvement in my
3762220	3764220	In my eyes and secondly
3764780	3767980	Something that I've noticed which I think is important
3768540	3774700	Very hard to quantify is I think I think it's it's it's a kind of um
3775580	3781420	It's a last defense against extremism slash fascism slash communist takeover
3782140	3788780	And the reason for that is that um the armed forces don't swear an oath to the government. They swear an oath to
3789420	3791420	But they did swear an oath to the queen
3792380	3794380	Now we'll see this where it goes to the king
3794620	3796620	and
3798460	3800460	I think that has an oddly
3801260	3805260	Stabilizing effect that you can imagine all kinds of political disasters
3805340	3808300	Or you can imagine the kind of political things you often see in god who's happening
3809180	3811180	If you imagine similar things happening in britain
3812220	3814300	Because it distributes power in this way
3814460	3818460	It will be much harder for some kind of like extremist fanatic government
3819100	3825660	To take over and actually take over the entire state and take over the armed forces and have some kind of Stalinist coup
3825660	3827260	Do you know what I mean?
3827260	3829740	Because the armed forces are the parts of the state
3830540	3832540	there's this like residual feeling of
3833500	3838780	Oh, you're actually basically like some kind of like foreign inspired coup and we're just not going to do what you say
3840060	3842540	Yeah, and that and that's literally happened. So in 1981
3843260	3847500	There was a coup a coup attempt in spain actually in which the wari de civile
3847500	3853740	Which is like the the paramilitary like the the militarized police literally stormed the parliament and there's a photo of
3855180	3858620	Coronel tejero like wavering on a pistol and giving a lecture in front of the
3859420	3862140	The in the chamber of deputies in spain and what happened?
3863100	3868220	King what Carlos the second of spain basically got on tv in his uniform with the flag behind him and said
3868620	3873100	Yeah, we're not going back to fascism. This is not going to happen and basically called up every general and said all right
3873100	3874140	Pick a side bro
3874140	3876940	Me or jail and everyone said okay. Okay. Okay. Everyone come down
3877420	3880300	Like and then they arrested the coup leaders and like that was the end of it
3880380	3885100	And so in fact it worked exactly as you said right the embodiment the spirit of the nation kind of arose and said no
3885100	3887580	We're not doing this crazy shit. Everyone go back to your room
3888300	3889980	exactly
3889980	3892140	if someone tried to do that in britain and then
3892860	3897660	Because of this diffuse authority, you know, it is sort of slightly weird like, you know, you sit in number 10
3898220	3904780	Are you the prime minister says, okay? We're going to do this or you know, sending special forces somewhere or we're going to do this with whatever
3905500	3907500	the actual like the
3907980	3910620	The actual formal powers in lots of ways are
3911420	3914700	Not his he is acting on behalf of the queen
3916060	3917420	and
3917420	3921420	It does have a weird effect and it and it does mean that these people
3922140	3924940	Would not, you know, if it suddenly went crazy
3925420	3926540	or
3926540	3933980	Or there was some kind of like, you know, weird person managed to take like a Hitler star situation right where someone actually wins an election
3934860	3936860	becomes head of state
3937100	3939420	In all kinds of rationalist european constitutions
3939420	3943980	Well, the whole system now reports up to them including the armed forces and the new person is won the vote
3944060	3945820	Well, everyone just has to do what they say sort of thing
3946300	3951500	That doesn't happen in in the in the weird archaic irrational british constitution
3952140	3956940	But I think the little bit of friction and absurdity in it is like a good good long-term hedge
3959100	3961180	Interesting. Yeah, I mean, it's like the second amendment in the united states
3961260	3963500	The worst comes to worst everyone's got their rifle
3963580	3966780	But yeah, I'm trying to think in the u.s. Who occupies that role of like sanity check
3966940	3971660	It really is the constitution right the u.s. Constitution is the symbolic thing that embodies the nation
3971900	3977180	But of course, that's a tax subject interpretation, which is why supreme court almost acts like a rabbinical court, you know
3977260	3981260	Interpreting the the Torah or something right and so the u.s. Is kind of a religious project
3981500	3983980	But yeah in the u.s. There is no embodying of the nation outside of the
3984540	3986540	The constitution
3986860	3990780	About going too far in some ways, isn't that like I always find it interesting how
3991340	3993180	um
3993180	3996460	If you take like a quite an extreme situation in american politics
3997260	3999980	Of rusevelt in the 30s after his second win
4000540	4005020	When he was really like I can't remember exactly what the majority was that they had in congress
4005100	4008700	But it was extraordinarily massive and he'd got a massive landslide
4009260	4011660	And he could really he could and was
4012460	4015980	Ripping out washington closing things down reopening things doing all kinds of stuff
4017020	4020780	But he then made a move on the supreme court and he basically had to back off
4021580	4025340	It was seen as like just a stepped off. That's a good example
4025340	4029900	He tried packing the court famously by which meaning putting his cronies in and basically interpreting
4030220	4034860	You know like the my my polyside professor in high school said what is the u.s. Constitution?
4035180	4037180	Whatever nine justices say it is
4037180	4041100	And so if you control the justices you control the constitution and that that in fact was the step too far
4041100	4046540	I mean that was like that would be like imprisoning the queen. That's it. You've lost everybody. Nobody's going to follow you there, right?
4047180	4049180	yeah
4049740	4051740	Okay, we've been talking
4052140	4053660	I'll go for it. It's a
4053660	4058700	No, I'm just saying I've harassed dominic with all my okay. Ask the smartest bird. I know questions
4059980	4061980	Dominic you got them all
4062540	4065340	I've got a couple more and then we'll get down. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead
4065980	4067020	well one
4067020	4073340	So some people use the mental model of thinking about the the left in the u.s. As you know college educated people
4073580	4075580	one third of the country plus
4076060	4081260	You know certain might you know a large percentage of certain minority groups that those college educated people claim to speak on
4081260	4084460	behalf of and and prioritize and and give deference to
4085260	4087260	Against on the right non-educated
4087980	4089980	uh, or you know non college educated
4090700	4094220	What working class white people and that's a crude, you know summarization
4094300	4099020	but it's a way of the kind of describing the differences and the tensions that emerge where
4099580	4101580	sort of one third of the the country
4102300	4107260	Sort of speaks for two for for the rest of the country in terms of dominating the institutions
4107980	4113420	That that governed the the rest of the country and best there's sort of this populist outrage that that has the numbers
4113820	4117260	But doesn't have the power and thus elect someone like trump
4118060	4123980	How would you edit that that characterization the u.s. And i'm curious if that same sort of cleaving or something similar to that
4124220	4127340	Is what's also happening in other countries where we're seeing
4128220	4133180	Sort of similar figures like trump or is it all very very different
4133900	4135900	No, i mean i think so
4135900	4137900	There's definitely something
4137980	4143580	Common across the western world in terms of what's happening with educational polarization, right?
4143900	4146780	You can see in the data in every country
4147420	4151820	The story is is sort of similar since since 1945
4152700	4154140	graduates
4154140	4155340	used to be
4155340	4157340	much more conservative
4159020	4162540	And and and that shifted dramatically
4163580	4170380	I mean, sorry it shifted gradually for decades and then it's really kind of become turbocharged in the last in the last 10
4170940	4172940	10 20 years
4173580	4175580	And that's definitely thrown poor
4177340	4182620	It's definitely confused all of the old system right they don't they haven't quite understood it as part of the reason why
4183420	4184940	they
4184940	4191820	Didn't see brexit coming and didn't see trump coming. I mean just in like one interesting way before brexit
4193180	4196220	Most of the polling companies didn't wait by education
4197020	4200140	Certainly in britain and i think similar problems happen with the polling in
4202060	4204060	In america, um
4204140	4207100	They just didn't like so our data science team
4207660	4210940	looked at all of these polls in 2015 2016 and they said, you know, like
4211660	4215100	The data that we've got is not being is not reflected in the mainstream polls
4215340	4222460	The fundamental reason is that they don't understand what's happening with education polarization and very similar thing happened, I think
4224540	4226940	With trump, so there's no doubt that
4227660	4231180	establishment parties of being caught on the on
4231500	4233740	All on on the part for it by that
4235660	4237660	I'd like to ask one more question since, um
4239260	4242700	Getting to this issue of um, you know education and the and left versus right
4242860	4245660	I mean, I forgot who I read it was probably tyler cohen or somebody
4245820	4248860	If you mentioned how in the 1950s if you told somebody you're a democratic or republican
4249100	4252700	Or to use a slightly more wonky term if it was the input to your you know, your logistic
4253020	4255980	Regression model that tried to classify various parts of your lifestyle
4256380	4260380	Being republic or democrat wouldn't have told you whether you owned a firearm went hunting
4260860	4265020	Had a college education. I wouldn't have told you lots of things actually and while now it's almost
4265420	4266780	Dispositive, right?
4266780	4269660	Literally, it is like a 90-10 split either way for every question
4269660	4273340	I just said whether you're a republican democrat whether you own a gun went to college, etc
4273580	4275740	And so there's just been massive split of just
4276620	4281020	Beyond politics. I mean in the u.s. It really is a red versus blue tribe sort of issue
4281420	4284780	um, and I'm not even sure what why that is and I've lived in red states and
4285820	4288860	I'd be a hard nut to crack with if you tried based on politics
4289180	4291340	You know, whether I own a gun or not or whether I have a college education
4291660	4293660	But like broadly speaking like why is it?
4293980	4294940	Here's a better question
4294940	4300220	Why does the right kind of suck in the sense that like when it comes to like aesthetics when it comes to education
4300540	4304300	I mean, I think it was david revneck who famously called trump a short-fingered vulgarian
4304540	4306300	Which he kind of is and you know
4306300	4307580	He said many things that were true, right?
4307580	4310460	Like his his critique of russia during 2016 was actually correct
4310860	4313100	And so not to say that everything trump said was was nonsense
4313340	4315660	But there's there's an error about him when he has a rally
4315660	4319740	It's like the pillow guy that shows that it's like people that you wouldn't want your sister to date or
4320540	4325340	You know media or culture that you yourself wouldn't consume or identify with and yet you're kind of stuck
4325420	4326940	Right because on the one hand
4326940	4332860	Like let's face it anyone with any level of IQ education elite status income is like shopping at Whole Foods
4333260	4335900	And living in one of six cities and that's their lifestyle
4336380	4340380	And yet if if you kind of reject whole hog the the far left agenda
4340540	4344060	Well, what do you do? Are you going to go live in Nashville? Like no
4345020	4347980	That said this is someone who's lived in Reno and rural Washington
4347980	4351260	So I I have made that jump but probably speaking most people are not going to do that
4351260	4355100	It feels like it feels like the mid-wit mean right whereas the right
4355180	4361980	You know both has sort of the the the hick but also peter teal and sort of the the new counter-lead or sort of the true intellectual
4361980	4367100	Yeah, but the but the peter teals are the majority right at the end of the day. That's not that's not, you know, if you
4368060	4371900	Would a guy from San Francisco even if he had some trump sympathy if they went to a trump rally
4371900	4376620	Would they look around and say, oh, yeah, we I have a deep sympathy with these people. No, he wouldn't you walk right out of there
4377020	4379580	And so what do you do with that? Right? If
4380220	4383500	You're not going away. You're not going with the far left agenda and yet you're you know
4384700	4386700	The polarization question is
4387340	4390380	Someone and it does seem I mean I'm not an expert on this now
4390940	4393900	In terms of looking across like lots of different countries. So I'm not sure
4394620	4396620	how's correct statement
4397340	4399980	Certainly relative to Britain. So for example
4400700	4402700	in America
4402940	4408140	These issues as you say have become more and more polarized and more and more identified on a party basis
4408300	4410300	So even if you go back to like 1980
4410460	4414700	You had far more ticket splitting you had far more people who would like vote for a Democrat senator
4414780	4416780	but then maybe vote for Reagan, right?
4417980	4424460	And you couldn't be as sure by the fact that they voted for Reagan about a whole set of their views
4424780	4429180	As you would be now if someone said I voted for Trump. So it's definitely shifted
4429740	4431740	um
4432060	4434060	Over the last 40 years
4435020	4438700	That that kind of process hasn't happened in in Britain
4439420	4444220	And I think quite a lot of other European countries in terms of these things being locked into party identities
4445020	4449020	So there has been educational polarization. That's like a cross-western trend
4449660	4455100	But that educational polarization is not mapped onto party identification
4456060	4459020	Across the west in the same way it has in America
4459420	4461420	And I don't know what the answer
4461500	4464300	It's a very interesting question as to why as to why that's different
4464780	4469020	Um, again, like is the project is the primary process play some some part of that
4469500	4474140	Uh, other structural dynamics in the in the american vote system don't know. Um
4475580	4483420	But that is a difference for sure between america in europe and also and also britain on that other question
4483980	4488860	um, I think it comes back to to to what was touched on a couple of times, which is just
4489420	4491100	um
4491100	4493900	Small people on the right have gone out of politics
4494700	4496380	so
4496380	4500860	If you look at say so everyone hate on the right people like me
4502620	4504620	We hate the new york times
4504620	4507420	We hate a whole load of like that
4508540	4510540	Liberal media in quotes, right
4510620	4511580	but
4511580	4516620	Nobody's trying to create an elite thing to take on the new york times in its own terms
4517900	4519900	As you say like a lot of the media
4522540	4525260	Kind of entrepreneurial activity like banon type stuff
4525900	4533340	Is basically just like trashy. It's not trying to create. It's not trying to like beat the new york times in its own game
4534060	4536140	Which someone should try and do
4536780	4537980	but
4537980	4543260	I think I think a big part of the reason why is is this question of where of where talents
4543660	4544460	It's gone
4544460	4549980	And the left still has a whole load of smart people who are basically on the left go into politics because they want to control these
4550060	4552060	Old institutions and they want to tell everyone what to do
4552780	4555340	Whereas people who are as smart on the right
4555980	4558540	Are you know, so you have like two kids now age 20
4558940	4562940	The one who's left inclined wants to go and work with like larry summers in washington
4563020	4569420	And then work in the u.s. Treasury you tell everyone what to do and then get rich good work for golden sacks after some spell in dc, right?
4570300	4571580	whereas
4571580	4573580	the person who
4574140	4576140	Has read a lot of mesas and hyac
4576780	4577900	are
4577900	4579340	It's probably gonna
4579340	4582620	Want to come and work with you guys in in california or on some tech startup, right?
4582700	4586540	Maybe go work for angioreal and combine drones and national security
4586860	4590060	But when they look around at the p and this becomes self-reinforcing
4590380	4595100	When you when when smart 20 year old? I mean, I've had this myself in terms of recruiting and looking at things
4595580	4598860	We have like very smart kids age 20 23
4598940	4605340	They're looking at options and they go and look and talk to the politicians like I don't want to work with these fucking clowns
4607340	4611980	They just they they're losers. They're not going to get anything done. They don't really know what they're there for
4612940	4615260	Uh, why do I want to go and work with those people?
4616060	4622460	So the smart person on the right the hyac fan those often does different things and I think over generations this
4622940	4629820	This is just compounded and compounded and compounded. I was fascinating. You know when I after just after the election
4631260	4635580	I wrote a blog and the blog basically said, okay, we're going to rip up government
4635660	4637660	And we're going to do all of this stuff differently
4637980	4641340	We're going to break a load of shit and we're going to build a load of new shit
4641820	4645660	And if you want to do this if you're a weirdo if you're a misfit if you've got technical
4646220	4651820	Abilities that you've like never got involved with politics because it's such a shit show get in touch and come and help
4652860	4658540	And I had a common exact number that but like 50 000 people applied for a job. I mean it was just completely insane
4659180	4661180	So you can see there is this untapped
4661580	4665020	There are a lot of people who actually do want to get involved with politics and government
4665580	4667900	who are like not people on the left
4668780	4671820	But at the moment they're like largely away doing their own things
4671980	4675580	And they're not going to drop those things to go work for a conventional
4676380	4678380	conservative thing in washington or london
4678460	4683340	That they just think is hasn't got an actual plan couldn't execute any way is not going to win
4683980	4687500	By the way, I was going to ask you about that ad because that was pretty that was pretty famous and went viral at the time
4687580	4690540	Did you actually hire somebody from from the 50 000 applicants?
4691100	4693100	We hired some we had some like
4693500	4697980	Openly and we hired some covertly and was kind of going to get planted them in a deep state
4699180	4701180	Oh, wow
4701180	4706380	I uh, I love I love it. I want to close by uh ending or I want to end by
4707740	4713340	Returning to where we began which is on san francisco. There was one argument earlier that we said hey tech people don't care about san francisco
4713740	4718940	There's the counter argument that that uh, mark adresin has publicly made uh, who you know came on the show
4719660	4726060	Who whose group chat introduced us and he said hey actually they do care and they're um, you know
4726540	4728540	Reed Hoffman dustin moskovitz
4728620	4734700	um and other tech people are some of the biggest donors to the dnc to to the biden campaign and um also to
4735340	4741340	In san francisco politics, they're we're actually we've tech has created the situation that they currently exist
4741740	4745580	They're and they're relatively happy with it or they think that's the best that can be done
4745900	4752220	With within the limitations and that efforts like gary tan and um, you know others
4752620	4756060	And by the way, mike solana is trying to create a right wing new york times our good friend
4756300	4759900	You know, he's early in that. Well, hopefully he'll he'll be able to do it, but um
4760620	4762620	Yeah, people like gary tan
4762860	4764860	Well good intention
4764860	4771580	Mark's argument that he made on our show is that it um, it actually doesn't help because there because there's no republican party
4772060	4772940	um
4773020	4781100	Trying to reform just from within the left will further um incentivize the left to keep going crazy and and and and take control
4781580	4788060	Whereas the only real solution is to let things get so bad that that a republican party can can emerge
4788300	4794460	And and no no gary nobody wants to go right wing even 80 percent of elan of san francisco is anti elan
4794540	4797900	They think he's too, you know, right winger beyond the pale and so we're caught
4798620	4799580	In a rock and a hard place
4799580	4805420	Which is do we just not do anything and wait till things are so bad that a republican party can emerge or
4805900	4812540	Can reform happen from within the the the the the left and people like gary the others kind of take over
4813260	4815260	Despite the sort of structural
4815340	4817340	ratcheting to the most extreme
4817900	4820940	That mark mentions happens in kind of one party cities or states
4821420	4826460	So strikes me as as extremely unlikely that there's going to be a republican
4828540	4831420	In any kind of like short-term way like in the next 10
4832300	4833900	15 years or so
4833900	4838460	Because of other national dynamics. I just can't see it's a bit like what we're talking about in terms of is
4839020	4841020	Israel and like just moral
4841580	4842700	signals
4842700	4843980	but
4843980	4846860	The moral signals of the republican party are such that
4847900	4853260	Magic whole bunch of people go. Oh, yeah, you know, I listen to what they've got to say in san francisco crime's got so bad
4853340	4855340	Maybe we should go republican
4855340	4857900	I don't think that that's going to happen. However bad things get
4859100	4861100	I can sort of understand
4861340	4862700	mark's
4862700	4869980	argument about the potential futility of trying to reform inside the democrats, but so my answer to that would be
4871740	4875740	Hoping for a republican revival is doomed certainly in the next 10 years
4876460	4878460	So forget that
4878540	4879980	uh
4879980	4885740	It's perfectly plausible that trying to like have any kind of reform inside the democrat party isn't going to work
4886140	4890540	But why are those unique to alternatives? Why can't you build an independent force?
4891420	4893420	Which doesn't have the branding of either
4895260	4897260	That's what that's where I would start
4897420	4899020	and
4899020	4901180	So I wouldn't try and spend a lot of my time like
4901740	4905820	Fighting the internal battle to the democrat party because I think a lot of that is a waste of time
4906300	4908700	And an effort and energy and won't work anyway
4909580	4915500	If if there is a way through and it may not be right sometimes like places and cities and cultures to just like
4915820	4917820	Their own secretary and there's nothing you can do about it
4918220	4919820	um
4919820	4927580	Uh, but if there is a way through I'm sure that it it's by building something separate to the two parties in san francisco
4927900	4929900	And say right we are san francisco people
4930780	4934060	We don't like the republicans for that reason. We don't like the democrats for this reason
4934300	4937900	But here are the things that we believe in and here's what we want to build and if you put us in power
4938700	4942140	Well, here's how we'll fight corruption. Here's how we'll fight crime. Here's how we'll do this
4942620	4945740	And you know, you just you you market test the message that you know
4946460	4950540	At least it works with with the voters that you need
4951100	4953100	And then you try and find some people to
4953340	4959420	To to sell the message and see see see what can be built. That's where that's where I that's where I would start
4961020	4965740	But the hardest problem I'm sure is going to be people like because of this chicken and egg problem the worst
4969420	4973180	The worst the worst the better already ends up working. You're like when the real
4974140	4978620	When the revolution comes until that it just puts everyone off from getting involved
4980060	4984940	I and I I would say the black pill on sf politics we saw very recently
4985420	4990780	Which is that in fact sf could be easily cleaned up. So she I'm literally on second street in soma
4991420	4995340	About a block away from a high highway that typically has a homeless encampment under it
4995660	4999420	And it currently doesn't because shishin bing was here and they cleaned up all the streets in san francisco
4999740	5005580	And practically overnight practically overnight the city went from the dystopia you saw to something else and I would say
5006300	5008540	To quote one of our great american philosophers hl menkin
5009180	5011900	Democracy is letting the voters choose and then giving it to them good and hard
5012220	5017180	And I would say that maybe the democrats actually want things to be this way because they amplify the problems
5017180	5020700	Which they are the solution which is oh no, there's this drug and homelessness problem
5020780	5024060	And there's this whole thing about it. Again, they could clean it up, but they sort of choose not to
5024860	5026860	Yeah, I think that
5027180	5029180	That makes so
5029500	5031900	That makes um a lot of sense to me
5033580	5040460	A lot of california, um, I mean california democrat politics is intensely mainly corrupt and for people like usum
5041660	5043660	The current thing
5043740	5049020	The only way the current thing doesn't work for usum is if he actually wants to go and become a national figure
5049100	5051100	And I think that's an interesting question right because
5051660	5056620	When I was doing all these focus groups last year one of the interesting things that came up all the time was people saying
5057020	5058220	like
5058220	5060940	Democrats or swing voters not maga people would say
5061900	5066380	Yeah, you know what? We do need a fucking wall. We need a wall around california
5066940	5071260	Stop basically shit escaping and washing over the rest of the country
5072060	5078940	And you know because they see the the same videos right of like the homeless people like walking out like zombies with machetes in their hands and they think
5079900	5082380	We don't want this everywhere. Um
5083660	5087180	And that's a real problem for usum for sure if he wants to become a national
5088220	5094060	A national figure, but in terms of the internal california politics maybe the democrat party could just
5095660	5097660	Doing this for
5097660	5101340	For a long time right you you tech people can like keep insulating yourselves
5102140	5104620	Like the roman senators in the republic you can build your
5105260	5112380	Build your your walled gardens the walls of the walled gardens ever higher and your fish ponds ever more magnificent and keep the madness out for
5113260	5115260	another 10 years maybe
5116140	5119820	I mean I I've always suspected my my dark theory by way sf is a tech hub
5120060	5125420	Is that you need like billion dollar startups to fix some of the problems the city has and it's actually not even a joke right?
5125420	5130380	Like the public transport here sucks. So we had uber the housing situation hotels completely sucks. We had airbnb
5131260	5133420	The dating scene by the way is terrible. So we had dating apps
5133580	5138860	The social scene is actually not so great either. So we had all the social media like literally every every great consumer tech
5139260	5144540	Sort of innovation you've seen has been kind of a patch to the sf system from very entrepreneurially minded people
5145420	5147980	Company to provide personal security with drones is like
5150620	5152620	Yeah privately is next. Um
5153900	5157740	I mean before we go starting a new party. I presume is very difficult
5157900	5160300	You you don't have the infrastructure that the other parties have
5160860	5162140	um
5162140	5164620	If if that were so obvious why aren't people
5165420	5168140	Doing it. What are the big bottlenecks to to making that happen?
5168860	5170060	I think the
5170060	5176380	Overwhelmingly the the biggest bottleneck is just this first pass the post problem that you have to get to some critical mass before you can break
5176380	5181100	Through uh, and and it's very hard to persuade people to get involved with with something
5181500	5186220	In a first pass the post system because they think well, you know, I don't want to commit 10 years of my life to building this
5187100	5189100	Which may not get
5190780	5192780	Where you actually
5193340	5195660	Can punch through that's the fundamental
5196860	5200220	Uh, and I think it's that's why it's like it's overwhelmingly likely that
5200940	5203580	If that's solved it'll be because someone
5204300	5209260	Super duper famous like global like legit globally famous character
5209820	5211820	Decides to do it. That's that's the way you could
5212460	5218220	Jumpstart it. I don't think lack of info. I think actually the lack of info in lots of ways is actually a great advantage, right? I mean
5219500	5222780	Just in our own experience because we were a startup in 2016
5223340	5228220	We just did everything better than the established parties did because we just you know use the cloud
5228300	5232140	We built all this stuff ourselves. We actually built had a proper tech team
5232780	5233980	um
5233980	5237180	Whereas as soon as we went in and we took over the conservative party
5237180	5242540	We looked around the infrastructure there like the whole thing is just completely rotten and broken and doesn't work is like
5243340	5244460	um
5244460	5248540	A bit like central government. Actually, you know, like people think this is it can't possibly be true
5248540	5250540	But when I arrived in number 10
5251660	5253660	The prime minister of great britain
5254380	5260460	Has less access to a file sharing system that like a two person startup does
5260700	5266540	They can at least use google docs and like live edit the same document in different parts of the building or hotel
5266620	5270460	Or in different parts of the building the british prime minister could not do that
5271260	5272780	oh my god
5272780	5274860	in tony you mentioned at the beginning of this call how
5275180	5280700	San Francisco has like an 11 billion dollar budget or something like that and 700 800 000 residents
5280700	5286460	Do we know how that money is spent? Is that is that public and if so are you know, where is it spent?
5286860	5293020	I mean, I I assume it's public record. Um, I think the the correction is not like literally bags full of cash level of corruption
5293420	5297820	It's the sort of todyism of there's all these ngos, right that are you know
5298540	5301820	ngos are basically church groups for people who think they're smarter than religion effectively
5302140	5307020	And so you have all these ngos and it's literally this gravy train in which they throw money at people who make the problems
5307180	5309180	worse and
5309180	5311900	You know, I forget exactly how much aid you get as a homeless person
5311900	5315020	I said, I think it hovers around eight eight hundred to nine hundred dollars a month
5315260	5318380	You basically get for free just showing up and so I mean one of the
5318780	5321100	Shocking not shocking things that if you actually talk to homeless people
5321100	5323660	And there's a few twitter accounts in which people go out and chat to almost people
5323820	5325500	Almost none of them are actually from san francisco
5325500	5330220	They come from abroad because they know they can get it basically get a free right here and here here's a quick
5330700	5335820	Here's a quick job interview question dominic if the aid for the homeless person is nine hundred dollars
5336220	5339820	What is the average fentanyl dose price in san francisco per day?
5342780	5347020	If you're if you show up if you wash up hopeless in san francisco and you're basically given
5347740	5353500	Um, you know a nine hundred dollars a month cash grant. What's the average cost of a fentanyl dose on the street?
5354780	5357660	I guess that's out right like it's basically like
5358460	5360780	20 30 dollars a day is what that's how
5363660	5365660	Because of course it is the markets in equilibrium
5365980	5369900	Right, of course it is so and so yeah, I mean, I assume this is all public record, eric
5369900	5374060	But it's like I don't know. I mean the taxes are incredibly another thing by the way is a shocking thing
5374460	5376460	Another random us eu
5376620	5378940	Observation because I I thought when I wrote cast monkeys
5378940	5383180	I actually moved to europe thinking I'd get canceled for other reasons for for writing like this tell all book
5383500	5387260	And so I like I spent time in barcelona and berlin and paris like checked out the startup scenes
5387340	5388700	I didn't go to london by the way
5388700	5395420	But it's like europe does everything right to get startups going like literally they'll take over entire buildings and give them the startups
5395420	5396460	They'll have grants
5396460	5401340	There's a lot of talent in europe like they do everything right and then like nothing happens startup wise in the united states
5401340	5406220	They do literally everything wrong top to bottom and yet you they cannot stop producing
5409660	5410540	Which is incredible
5410540	5415580	But like there's so many taxes here like your your restaurant bill is marked up with some health mandate thing
5415900	5420140	Which isn't even a hard number the restaurant can just randomly mark shit up by like five or ten percent
5420140	5426620	Which is ridiculous and yeah, it's just there's there's so much loss and ridiculousness in california and yet here we are
5427500	5429500	I'm this i'm in san francisco
5429580	5433420	But to me the twitter is a good analogy where ilan could have started a new twitter
5433420	5437020	And we have friends who've tried to start a new twitter and it's it's very difficult network effects are very hard
5437420	5441740	And it's it's much easier although still hard to take over existing twitter and similarly
5441900	5446460	I went to miami a couple years ago thinking that everybody would leave san francisco and also follow
5446860	5449820	And it turns out no matter how bad it gets people aren't leaving
5450060	5456220	And so it's probably a lot easier to move more people to miami to san francisco than to move people out of san francisco into
5456780	5460620	Uh, some other city or some other country where you can get some deal with the government
5460780	5464220	Like like like the whole technology state move network state movement is trying to do
5464860	5471260	So it sounds kind of like totally plausible, right? Like what what why but so quickly the obvious question like why hasn't this happened before?
5472460	5474460	Why hasn't it happened already people?
5476620	5477980	Well, hold on so it
5477980	5479900	I don't know who you're trying to move here
5479900	5485100	But so I mean san francisco. I was here for the first tech boom people should loads of people moved in san francisco
5485100	5487580	Like it's still kind of dead like it is not recovered fully from covet
5487740	5491740	But like circa 2011 the place you want it to be in the western world
5492140	5497180	Was within 10 blocks of where i'm sitting right now, which is where every consumer internet company was literally created
5497580	5503180	Right, like it was happening socially happening business wise. Everything was here. You felt like you were in the center of the world
5503340	5508060	This is that's right. Yeah, this is happening. Yeah, too. So it can happen again. That's the opportunity
5508060	5508620	It can happen
5508620	5512700	But the thing is that people people either stay and they put down roots and they get woke or they make a pile of money
5512700	5516300	And they leave that's it like no one actually invests in san francisco. That's the problem
5517020	5521580	Yeah, it might be changing though. There's a rise in political consciousness in the last few years
5521660	5524220	Like I know entrepreneurs who are now getting into politics full time
5524700	5531500	um, because they see how how fucked things have gotten here and um, and there's there's like a ecosystem around it. Um
5532220	5535820	There's uh, there's it's high status now in a way that it wasn't a few years ago
5536060	5540940	That's true. Things have changed a little bit, right? You can get twitter influenced by posting about san francisco politics in a way that
5541180	5543180	You would never have done 10 years ago. Yeah
5543500	5547100	Solana built his whole his whole you know audience off his media company off that
5548140	5553500	Um, if practical campaigns that you guys think like, you know, so-and-so is going to try and do something and they're a good guy
5554220	5557820	Then obviously like hook me up. I'll be happy to like look at you know, research
5557900	5561980	They're doing or ideas for messaging and stuff like that if I can help in some way
5563180	5564060	Cool
5564060	5566060	Yeah, we'll uh, we'll keep you posted
5566380	5568620	I don't know of anything at the moment outside of grosef
5568700	5572300	But you're in that group chat and I don't think they're they're serious enough
5572700	5573660	um
5573660	5577740	But I'd also be interested. So yeah, we're trying to create that conversation here in the podcast
5577740	5580060	So let's uh, let's keep the conversation going
5580780	5584380	But when the next governor comes up, maybe we should try to find some like, um,
5584700	5589180	legit celeb that we can work with to like the walk or someone to
5589740	5591740	become governor
5592060	5594220	Yeah, totally. It's been it's been done before
5595020	5597020	We're on arrange it
5597500	5603500	Rather mutant via like virus tryout place, right? So let's let's let's get the walk going in calif
5603900	5605900	Before we maybe move into the white house
5606700	5611660	Yeah, exactly. Um, also Dominic. Thanks so much for for coming on and we'll uh, continue the conversation
5612060	5614060	I just love you to talk
