WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
When I was doing all these focus groups last year one of the interesting things that came up all the time was people saying like

00:06.600 --> 00:09.520
Democrats or swing voters not Maga people would say

00:10.160 --> 00:14.900
Yeah, you know what? We do need a wall. We need a wall around California

00:15.300 --> 00:19.820
Stop basic shit escaping and washing over the rest of the country

00:19.820 --> 00:26.000
They see the same videos right if like the homeless people like walking zombies with machetes in their hands and they

00:27.000 --> 00:30.800
Want that we don't want this everywhere. Yeah, this is happening. Yeah, too

00:30.800 --> 00:33.240
So it can happen again that that's the opportunity it can happen

00:33.240 --> 00:37.280
But the thing is that people people either stay and they put down roots and they get woke or they make a pile of money

00:37.280 --> 00:40.980
And they leave that's it like no one actually invests in San Francisco. That's the problem

00:41.640 --> 00:44.120
In one sense like you can't really get

00:44.760 --> 00:52.640
PR or a story stronger than what Hamas did and to me the actual interesting thing there is right

00:52.760 --> 00:55.720
That's like pretty much bad as it gets right

00:55.720 --> 01:01.440
It's like sort of filming the torture to chambers of the NKVD and the Gestapo in Eastern Europe

01:01.440 --> 01:03.440
But within like 10 days, it's basically

01:05.160 --> 01:12.320
The NPCs in the media just go back to the script basically only not the most ripped for you know, like a few new cycles

01:12.320 --> 01:14.320
Like maybe 10 days

01:14.520 --> 01:22.440
It's funny right before this Dominic I tweeted I'm about to talk to Dominic Cummings

01:22.440 --> 01:24.640
What should I ask and someone actually chime in some bigger questions?

01:24.640 --> 01:29.880
So I was just reading those before so I've got some some great follow-ups that I think we want your input on

01:30.640 --> 01:32.720
But yeah, on the right wing left wing thing

01:33.880 --> 01:35.880
I am a bit of a Fukuyama fanboy

01:36.200 --> 01:38.000
and I think

01:38.000 --> 01:42.360
He's he's vast not that I think you are to be clear, but I think he's vastly misunderstood people

01:43.000 --> 01:45.560
Don't read through the 40 chapters of reinterpreted Hegel

01:45.560 --> 01:49.920
They barely even repest the title it and his and of course the best chapter in that book is actually the last chapter

01:50.160 --> 01:52.800
in which he actually he predicts a lot of the sort of

01:53.880 --> 01:55.760
you know

01:55.760 --> 02:00.440
Philosophical on we and melez that we currently see in the West right and he actually predicted in some sense the rise of

02:00.440 --> 02:03.360
Wokeness or sort of perverted liberalism that would turn out turning on itself

02:04.080 --> 02:06.080
You know Fukuyama's point just

02:06.080 --> 02:08.080
Sort of

02:08.360 --> 02:10.360
He goes

02:10.880 --> 02:13.840
That last chapter which I agree with you. I think it's the book

02:14.080 --> 02:18.500
He goes into some detail in in to Nietzsche's critique of modern liberal

02:19.400 --> 02:21.400
and

02:21.400 --> 02:25.280
And that is forgotten. You're right in the way that people talk about that book

02:25.280 --> 02:28.640
They always get the last chapter. Yeah, and just to summarize there

02:28.640 --> 02:31.920
I've done a whole piece on it defending. I'm actually in my in my sub stack

02:32.160 --> 02:34.160
You know when he said the end of history

02:34.160 --> 02:36.720
He didn't mean obviously that that things would stop happening in the world

02:36.880 --> 02:39.800
What he meant is that the the arc of political evolution

02:40.360 --> 02:44.760
However far back you want to draw it from hunter-gatherer tribes to the agricultural revolution

02:45.080 --> 02:50.360
You know middle-aged the theocratic dynasties the imperial age nation whatever whatever that arc is

02:50.360 --> 02:52.520
It kind of ends with liberal capitalism, right?

02:52.520 --> 02:58.120
Because the original Marxist idea Marx originally predicted that communism to come after liberal capitalism had yeah

02:58.120 --> 03:03.320
had triumphed in a way to come up and divide the spoils and deal with the inevitable inequality they had dealt with but the

03:03.920 --> 03:08.520
Fukuyama in charge is like no no no, that's a we're not we're probably not going to regress to a darker age

03:08.520 --> 03:11.760
Although we might but we're definitely not advancing into some sort of socialist utopia

03:11.760 --> 03:13.760
Like this is as good as it gets liberal capitalism

03:14.360 --> 03:21.440
end of story that and and the Nietzschean angle like he he quotes thus bake our a sister a lot in which again to summarize very

03:21.440 --> 03:22.680
Quickly what is a complex work?

03:22.680 --> 03:27.520
There are supposed to be these men with hollow chests who live at the end who have given up the passions

03:27.520 --> 03:33.280
And the mad joys of tribalism war, you know pestilence wars of ethno-nationalic

03:33.280 --> 03:38.280
I you know ethno-nationalist identity which is funny to say in the context of Israel, which I want to get to as well

03:38.280 --> 03:39.600
But in some sense in that book

03:39.600 --> 03:45.960
I think he actually explicitly says the European Union would be the final retirement home of the last man like that the European project in

03:45.960 --> 03:47.960
some sense was the home of the last man and

03:48.400 --> 03:55.880
In some sense with the far right you're seeing it's unwinding potentially exactly also with you know with with the growth of Putin and

03:56.560 --> 03:58.560
You know the way the EU

03:58.600 --> 04:07.080
In lots of ways, I think that's exactly right and Brussels has tried to live out that role in many ways right over the last 10 years. I mean

04:09.520 --> 04:12.160
15 years ago when I would say to people I

04:12.920 --> 04:15.560
Used to live in Russia. I met people like Putin

04:15.720 --> 04:21.920
He is not what you think this whole idea that like he's some kind of like quite moderate reformer and a technocrat and

04:22.640 --> 04:28.040
Russia's going to join the EU in you know in a few decades time. This is all completely insane and

04:28.760 --> 04:33.960
You're all gonna get a terrible shock by this and it was an incredibly at that time

04:34.120 --> 04:37.600
It was a very serious like a very extreme view

04:38.720 --> 04:47.280
Even two or three years ago. No Britain and Europe were basically pretty happy with the state of squo in which London is the laundry for the Russian mafia

04:47.680 --> 04:53.280
Energy keeps flowing to to Germany very cheaply

04:53.960 --> 04:58.840
And we just kind of like draw fail over a lot of the KGB oligarch behavior

04:58.960 --> 05:00.200
People didn't want to face it

05:00.200 --> 05:06.640
So when Trump came over and pointed out some of these things it became a meme with everyone in the EU literally laughing at Trump

05:07.120 --> 05:14.840
About the about the Nord Stream pipeline and warning, right? I mean, of course like now nobody gives Trump any credit for being for being

05:15.440 --> 05:17.440
Be correct about it

05:18.360 --> 05:24.520
But that sort of shows the extent to which I think the Brussels just didn't want to face these kind of issues and still doesn't

05:24.760 --> 05:26.920
Okay, I've got a random question. It's a slight detour Eric

05:26.920 --> 05:31.960
But maybe you'll let me go crazy with the agenda one conversation speaking of the house of the last man

05:31.960 --> 05:35.560
By the way, I love the house of the last bed like the post history is actually pretty cozy

05:35.560 --> 05:41.120
I was in Lisbon recently and I was in Paris recently. My daughter is actually moving to France. She's a Franco

05:41.120 --> 05:43.440
She's a she speaks French. She went to the DC here

05:43.920 --> 05:46.720
I'd be I'd love my child to grow up in Paris, right?

05:46.720 --> 05:49.800
And I think, you know, one of the base that we have in the group is you know

05:49.800 --> 05:52.040
It's kind of around the spread of wokeness that you know

05:52.040 --> 05:57.600
This whole this whole business of things going squishy a total dedication to equality a fallen standards

05:57.600 --> 05:59.480
Like a lot of things are just kind of going soft

05:59.480 --> 06:03.960
What I found interesting for example, and again, I'm actually driving at a point here in the case for example

06:03.960 --> 06:10.280
The Paris rights that happened this this summer that in its contours kind of felt a little bit like the BLM phenomenon in the United States

06:10.280 --> 06:17.080
Which as you know kind of in the in the COVID tizzy became like a whole thing a whole moral panic that kind of sees the West

06:17.160 --> 06:19.000
You saw it explode in the UK

06:19.000 --> 06:24.160
I think the the Anglo-Saxon English speaking world is definitely kind of a thing and I think the UK

06:24.520 --> 06:27.560
Here is the echoes very loudly of the American political zeitgeist

06:27.560 --> 06:33.560
I think those echoes are heard much less loudly on the continent and you saw what happened in Paris that the legendaries would

06:33.560 --> 06:36.480
Showed up and the riot police and they crushed it and that was the end of it

06:36.680 --> 06:43.160
Did not extend from there and I told the group look this Anglo-Protestant software does not run on Latin Catholic hardware

06:43.160 --> 06:46.920
It's just not gonna wokeness is not gonna spread to the continent in the way that you're expecting

06:47.760 --> 06:50.720
Like I is that true or am I am I misreading food?

06:51.720 --> 06:53.720
I

06:54.560 --> 07:00.300
Mean I think you've definitely got something of a point like there's definitely a kind of common Anglo-American

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
Several problems

07:04.360 --> 07:11.440
Partly connected with the fact that our that's that's our universities and our media are much more similar right the media and

07:12.560 --> 07:14.560
Oxford and Harvard

07:14.920 --> 07:16.480
BBC in New York Times

07:16.480 --> 07:22.160
There's just much much more crossover than there is between either Britain and France or America and France

07:22.480 --> 07:26.480
So I think extent it's definitely true on the other hand of course

07:27.560 --> 07:30.720
There's many many layers of irony the whole thing, but

07:31.480 --> 07:32.600
it

07:32.600 --> 07:35.160
To a very large extent the kind of crazy

07:35.840 --> 07:42.640
Philosophical origins of the whole I don't even like using the word woke because I think it's a mistake, but that's phenomenon

07:43.400 --> 07:49.000
It is itself a product of continental philosophy right transported over to America

07:49.200 --> 07:56.600
Christie's post-war and growing particularly in the 60s and then infiltrating humanities departments and social science departments and

07:57.200 --> 08:01.800
Everything else though. Obviously like the the Allen Bloomsburg closing American mind is

08:02.200 --> 08:05.760
It's partly a kind of trace of the if this intellectual current so

08:07.240 --> 08:13.040
In that sense, I think that probably like the long-term trajectory

08:13.040 --> 08:17.640
I think still similar in Europe and you can see it in Brussels

08:18.160 --> 08:23.840
You know, it's still following. We're all basically downstream of the madness of San Francisco like it's different

08:26.400 --> 08:29.960
But you're everywhere in Europe is downstream of

08:30.920 --> 08:36.480
San Francisco's and sciencey. It's just a question. Is is that so true because I I think you're right

08:36.480 --> 08:39.800
But the joke has always been in the United States that San Francisco is five years ahead of the US

08:39.800 --> 08:42.400
And then whatever that madness is is roughly five years ahead of Europe

08:42.400 --> 08:44.600
I think the time scales have actually compressed. It's more like a year

08:44.600 --> 08:47.800
But you still think it's downstream of of the city. I'm speaking to you from

08:49.120 --> 08:51.120
Exactly. Yeah

08:51.520 --> 08:54.600
What do you know that the time to go is this

08:54.600 --> 08:59.960
This kind of insane Petri dish of experimentation

09:02.800 --> 09:09.600
The the Berkeley itself was like, you know, the kind of radical center of a lot of the so 67 68

09:10.680 --> 09:16.760
Craziness, right? And and that kind of that impetus never died away. It's kept pushing

09:17.960 --> 09:19.400
and

09:19.400 --> 09:22.360
these things just have a have an incredible tendency to

09:23.360 --> 09:25.520
Wash East know if you'd said

09:27.160 --> 09:33.040
If you'd started to watch some of the just let's take for example some of the crazy shit on trans right

09:33.840 --> 09:39.160
Now if you'd said a few years ago, okay, there's like a full-stack system in

09:39.680 --> 09:41.560
Northern California

09:41.560 --> 09:43.560
whereby kids are

09:44.200 --> 09:51.560
Brainwashed into this crazy shit and then there's actually like you can go to Stanford Medical Center and they'll and they'll start

09:51.560 --> 09:55.600
Giving you surgery and start talking about taking out ovaries from 12 year olds

09:55.600 --> 09:59.720
And that's in Europe that I said that this is completely insane like that couldn't possibly happen

09:59.720 --> 10:01.720
It actually sounds like child abuse

10:02.360 --> 10:06.040
Ten years later here we all are right with this dealing with the same shit

10:06.840 --> 10:11.480
So speaking of San Francisco one topic I wanted to get to we can't I guess we can just jump to it if we're following this

10:12.040 --> 10:15.640
This you know bizarre sort of this this tour. So

10:16.400 --> 10:19.440
We were talking recently Dominic or I know some of the people

10:19.440 --> 10:22.560
So there's like an SF reform movement going on right there's some people

10:22.560 --> 10:27.280
I think that we all know that who by the way are very well respected in tech more broadly like people like Gary Tan

10:27.440 --> 10:28.680
Who has made quite a name?

10:28.680 --> 10:31.920
He runs Y Combinator which speaking of influential organizations hugely

10:31.920 --> 10:39.440
I went through it myself hugely influential organization people like David Sacks who was early on a PayPal a bunch of companies huge investor are

10:40.040 --> 10:44.120
Putting real money and time into trying to change the politics of San Francisco

10:44.120 --> 10:46.240
I think this is exactly what you just said

10:46.280 --> 10:51.200
Which is the way I've dealt with it having lived here off and on for almost two decades is like it's not really a city

10:51.200 --> 10:58.000
Don't expect saying city behavior. It is a Petri dish in which we will say oh psychedelic drugs game on or rule of law

10:58.000 --> 11:03.560
Who needs it defund the police? Oh, let's see what happens or you know autonomous vehicles, you know, what's gonna happen, right?

11:03.600 --> 11:07.520
Yeah, that said some people do care about seriously, which I support by the way

11:07.800 --> 11:13.440
And they definitely want to reform it and change it and we were kind of studying the reasons as to why

11:13.800 --> 11:17.080
We think it was broken. I I'll just toss that theory out there

11:17.080 --> 11:19.720
You're filled free to disagree on and riff in another direction

11:19.720 --> 11:22.680
But I think part of the problem with San Francisco is twofold

11:23.200 --> 11:27.280
One there's endemic corruption going back decade. I mean going back to the gold rush days

11:27.280 --> 11:30.920
It's always been just a pit of corruption at the city level and it's no different now

11:30.920 --> 11:37.880
It's just masquerading under progressive politics in my opinion. There's a whole homeless industrial SF has the second highest municipal budget in the United States

11:37.880 --> 11:42.680
I think over 11 billion dollars at this point. It's only a city of roughly seven to eight hundred thousand people

11:42.680 --> 11:46.520
It's not a very big city. It has the second biggest municipal budget in the United States after New York

11:46.520 --> 11:50.440
Where does that money go? You look you walk around it doesn't seem as if this is a well-funded city

11:50.440 --> 11:51.760
It looks like a dystopia frankly

11:51.760 --> 11:52.360
It's funny

11:52.360 --> 11:57.960
I retweeted a photo recently someone posted of an autonomous vehicle in front of a homeless guy stealing electricity charges laptop

11:57.960 --> 12:02.640
And that's exactly literally what I've described it as autonomous vehicles navigating around homeless people people think it's a joke

12:02.640 --> 12:04.640
But that's literally what it is when you walk outside

12:04.640 --> 12:09.520
so it's a combination of corruption and I think the other thing is and and to you know

12:10.440 --> 12:14.640
Give a little shade to the tech people tech people fundamentally don't deeply care about politics

12:14.640 --> 12:16.480
I think you have opinions on this

12:16.480 --> 12:20.600
I think they just you know you go to a museum here and whoever funds it funds it

12:20.600 --> 12:23.200
But like there's not a Google hospital or like a Facebook

12:23.200 --> 12:29.240
I mean Zuck gives a fair amount of money you go to New York and even the biggest wall speed asshole has endowed like a wing of

12:29.240 --> 12:33.560
You know Cornell Medical Center or whatever the latest exhibit is at the Met in San Francisco

12:33.560 --> 12:39.480
That's less so people to it's a gold rush town people the miners come in either make a fortune and stick around or move to Marin

12:39.520 --> 12:43.680
Or they leave and that's it. No, no one's kind of from here and no one really invests in a deep way

12:43.680 --> 12:46.160
Although to be clear that's changing people like Gary. I think we're changing that

12:46.520 --> 12:50.160
Any that's just all framing. What do you think it would take to fix San Francisco?

12:50.160 --> 12:54.280
And we come can we maybe convince you to try to help fix it by coming to San Francisco?

12:54.280 --> 12:56.280
I mean

12:56.280 --> 12:59.280
What you say makes sense to me, but I

13:02.480 --> 13:08.200
Guess like the obvious question is like the people who accept obviously is crime gets worse crime is obviously

13:09.520 --> 13:11.520
often a very big issue in politics, right and

13:12.480 --> 13:14.480
logic

13:15.320 --> 13:19.200
San Francisco earlier this year like I turned the wrong corner

13:19.200 --> 13:23.020
I went down a street and then suddenly felt like I've walked into like some kind of a poor leg

13:24.320 --> 13:26.720
And literally had to run back down out the street

13:27.840 --> 13:34.040
Really like 90 seconds for a way. There's like people coming around as if it's like perfectly normal. It's just

13:34.760 --> 13:40.120
Hey, I then went and spoke to some people that night. I had dinner in Palo Alto and they're like

13:40.880 --> 13:44.640
Fucking like you're in San Francisco. Like I haven't been there in like for you for you

13:45.640 --> 13:50.780
I think I know I live in I live in London. I think I visit San Francisco more often than a lot of people in

13:52.440 --> 13:54.440
Which maybe says something about

13:55.680 --> 14:01.960
As you say about the disconnection between the tech world and the city but of the people who were left

14:02.400 --> 14:04.680
Well

14:04.680 --> 14:07.840
What so here's a question why why?

14:08.920 --> 14:10.760
hasn't

14:10.760 --> 14:14.800

16:05.280 --> 16:05.920
I

16:05.920 --> 16:11.040
Think it's so the first time I ever got dog piled on Twitter was I don't know how many years ago

16:11.040 --> 16:14.080
It was I guess in 2015 or 16 when they passed this thing called prop C

16:14.400 --> 16:18.920
That was a tax on gross revenues, which is nuts particularly for tech businesses

16:19.600 --> 16:23.120
To basically give more money to the homeless industrial complex even though it wasn't working

16:23.120 --> 16:25.360
And I think I calculated how much money you would raise

16:25.680 --> 16:32.000
Divided it by the number of homeless people and realized that it was as much money for homeless people as like the base salary as a Google engineer

16:32.000 --> 16:34.440
They were literally put it falling that much money

16:34.440 --> 16:36.040
And I'm like how is this possible?

16:36.040 --> 16:39.160
I got totally dog piled and ripped apart now if you go and

16:39.520 --> 16:42.760
Criticize the homeless industrial complex or even call it that you don't get dog piled

16:42.760 --> 16:45.880
And in fact, there's a whole set of people who are there with you saying yeah

16:45.920 --> 16:51.160
We need to fix this and so I think the the vibe has definitely changed. There's been something like the recall of

16:51.880 --> 16:56.920
Chesa Boudin who was literally the son of communist cop killers

16:57.600 --> 16:59.000
It sounds like I'm making it up

16:59.000 --> 17:03.200
But that actually who works for Chavez in Venezuela like it sounds like a like a punchline

17:03.200 --> 17:09.240
But it's actually his biography and he got elected district a turret like the prop the equivalent of like the prosecutor, right?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.560
And then it was like so outrageous he finally got kicked out

17:14.560 --> 17:19.000
So I think some of that is happening and that was a crime issue. That was literally there is no law in order to get rid of this guy

17:19.600 --> 17:25.640
So yeah, that that is I think that is happening to a certain degree. I guess though that so what one thing that

17:26.360 --> 17:29.720
Possibly behind it. I don't know you tell me is that I found

17:31.280 --> 17:33.600
So when I wrote this thing in 2021 saying

17:35.120 --> 17:39.960
Like we're heading towards Biden Trump to like everyone thinks the Trump's finished and it's not going to come back

17:39.960 --> 17:46.720
But actually we're heading towards Biden Trump to and let's Silicon Valley people decide to intervene and build alternatives

17:48.240 --> 17:54.440
I spent some time talking to people there and the and the basic a problem that I had was people said

17:55.800 --> 18:03.760
We largely agree with what you're saying and we largely agree that if it just ends up doing it as Trump Biden to that's obviously terrible, but

18:06.080 --> 18:09.920
Precisely because politics has got so insane in the ways that you described

18:10.320 --> 18:17.840
It's exactly why it's totally impossible for me and my friends and other people here who've got anything to actually get involved with it

18:18.480 --> 18:21.440
Because it would just be instantly completely destructive and I'd

18:21.840 --> 18:27.520
My family and my friends and my investors and my staff would all think I'd literally lost my fucking mind

18:27.760 --> 18:34.120
If I suddenly said we're gonna build an alternative to Biden, you know, we've got to do something different

18:34.760 --> 18:42.280
So it does seem to be this kind of catch-away to and it's similar catch-away to in Britain. I think that

18:43.760 --> 18:48.600
As political as the kind as establishment politics becomes more insane and

18:49.080 --> 18:54.920
The kind of communist mind virus expands and expands into the mainstream media as well

18:54.920 --> 19:01.200
And they attack and trying to destroy the lives and careers of anyone who gets involved with politics

19:01.200 --> 19:03.960
It doesn't share the kind of approach

19:04.920 --> 19:07.640
Then it then there is this paradox where

19:08.760 --> 19:13.440
Able people entrepreneurs builders people who could do it much better

19:14.760 --> 19:19.760
Want to more and more and the probably more inclined to get involved with politics in one sense

19:19.760 --> 19:23.000
And they were 10 15 years ago whether like politics is we know, whatever

19:23.360 --> 19:27.200
Vote Obama and get on with building my my trillion dollar company

19:28.200 --> 19:33.520
The the more inclined to get involved in one sense, but in another sense the madness is like it is system

19:33.520 --> 19:35.520
Is a great room greater barrier?

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
As I know

19:39.520 --> 19:40.600
I think that makes sense

19:40.600 --> 19:47.000
I think yeah, I think the problem with techies is that not that they can't be political or be operators because they can they end up having

19:47.000 --> 19:50.160
These large organizations, but I think a couple things one

19:51.120 --> 19:58.360
The whole techie vibe just gives a lot of mainstream normie voters the ick to use zoomeries, which is like

19:59.640 --> 20:02.320
It's just a different sort of vibe what it takes to make

20:02.320 --> 20:08.160
I mean look at Mark Zuckerberg who I worked for I was at at Facebook 10 years ago on early members

20:08.160 --> 20:14.880
I actually think very highly of them and I said as much in my memoir, but you know like you know that guy couldn't sell free

20:14.880 --> 20:16.880
beer, I mean, it's just

20:16.880 --> 20:19.080
It's just one of those things. I mean maybe now

20:21.160 --> 20:24.160
Maybe but he also pissed off a lot of people like we raised the question

20:24.160 --> 20:28.920
I could either run for mayor of San Francisco and win and I'm not I'm not sure he could actually even among techies

20:28.920 --> 20:32.160
He may not be able to he actually might have a better chance and like Reno, Nevada

20:32.160 --> 20:36.320
But you know, which is definitely more red than San Francisco than he wanted San Francisco

20:37.600 --> 20:42.280
Yeah, I mean, I think he was a great example of this public right because he got someone who

20:42.640 --> 20:47.960
Was actually a hero to lots of people on the left even just three to five years ago

20:48.600 --> 20:50.400
He was very

20:50.400 --> 20:55.600
Explicitly and openly saying I would change this a bit to you. That's why I'm going to do electric cars

20:55.600 --> 21:00.040
And this is why we're going to do space exploration and etc etc etc and

21:03.240 --> 21:06.080
But even someone with the

21:06.880 --> 21:08.880
success that he had and

21:09.440 --> 21:13.280
the kind of backstory of actually being on the side of the

21:13.880 --> 21:17.600
Progressive supposes like one of the top three biggest causes

21:18.080 --> 21:23.280
As soon as you basically put a couple of feet out of line with the establishment view

21:24.960 --> 21:29.160
They just immediately said oh, you're a Nazi and we've got to start, you know

21:29.160 --> 21:31.700
Having the DOJ investigate you and maybe we should take all your shit

21:33.560 --> 21:40.320
And that's no, I mean I've had to me don't you know, like if if if Elon can go from being like

21:40.800 --> 21:46.960
Global love figure to global hate figure in like 18 months then imagine what they could do to me, right?

21:48.040 --> 21:52.080
And you're seeing it now as a as a side thing. I mean, you know relevant

21:52.560 --> 22:01.100
Elon just went to Israel and inside of Twitter. I Jewish Twitter. It's a whole kerfuffle because a lot of sort of mainstream

22:02.040 --> 22:06.260
bien penson liberal American Jews dislike Elon one for like

22:07.100 --> 22:13.220
Applying snarkily to some vaguely anti-semitic tweet, maybe and also just maintaining a Twitter platform in which I mean to be blunt

22:13.220 --> 22:15.380
There are kind of open anti-Semites on Twitter now

22:15.860 --> 22:18.020
And they haven't been banned, right?

22:18.020 --> 22:22.140
But he's definitely not he's obviously not telling the party line when it comes to content moderation on Twitter

22:22.140 --> 22:24.860
But this is a guy who by the way went some of the places

22:24.860 --> 22:29.740
I went to actually and reported from for tablet magazine like the actual keep it seem right in the Gaza border

22:29.740 --> 22:33.860
He was seen wearing body armor in one of them because it actually is dangerous down like I was down there

22:33.860 --> 22:37.580
It's a war zone. So the guy actually went there I spray set up met with hostages

22:37.940 --> 22:42.100
Accepted a gift that I'm not taking off till you get your hostages back basically said. Yeah, Hamas has to be destroyed

22:42.100 --> 22:49.220
This is this is unacceptable and he's still he's still being pillared as an anti-Semite because of his like content moderation policies on

22:49.220 --> 22:53.940
Twitter, which are definitely not the sort of the sort of policies that the left would want. It's just it

22:54.300 --> 22:56.300
Yeah, you just shaking my head

22:56.460 --> 22:57.580
SMH

22:57.580 --> 23:01.220
Yeah, I don't really think it's to do with content moderation though

23:01.220 --> 23:07.660
I think it's I think it's a I think it's a much broader thing. He just he signaled that he is not with

23:08.380 --> 23:10.380
the main

23:10.860 --> 23:14.500
All right, and the way that the Ukraine war kind of

23:15.500 --> 23:18.660
Coordinated in a very in a pretty unusual way

23:19.740 --> 23:21.740
like establishment position

23:22.140 --> 23:24.140
establishment politicians and media in

23:24.540 --> 23:27.420
Washington and London and across Europe very quickly and

23:28.540 --> 23:30.540
Anyone who stood out against that

23:31.220 --> 23:33.220
I have I have the same thing here like

23:33.860 --> 23:40.400
I've been like I've been like the one one in a thousand or one in ten thousand anti-putin for 20 years

23:40.780 --> 23:44.220
Regarded as madly extreme in my anti-putin this right

23:44.620 --> 23:49.500
Literally the whole thing just flipped because I said I think this war is a fuck up. I don't think there's an actual strategy

23:49.500 --> 23:52.900
It's gonna end in tears. We're gonna get bored and then have to finish it for the news

23:54.260 --> 23:57.260
Well, you're obviously a paid Putin shell your

23:58.100 --> 24:03.620
Fascist Apologies, you're an evil perk the whole thing. So I think

24:05.220 --> 24:11.980
He did he bought Twitter he said I'm pro free speech and he didn't tell the didn't tell the line on on Ukraine

24:11.980 --> 24:15.500
All in short order and that was enough seemed to me

24:16.580 --> 24:20.180
Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors

24:21.780 --> 24:23.780
Compliance doesn't have to be complicated

24:24.140 --> 24:27.580

25:15.180 --> 25:17.180
I

25:18.580 --> 25:24.340
Wasn't so Torrenberg here is actually the son of Israeli Jew and I converted actually just so you know the company you're keeping her down

25:24.340 --> 25:26.340
I

25:26.620 --> 25:32.620
I went to Israel recently and you know, obviously, I'm pretty public about being kind of pro-Israel and what they're doing in the war

25:32.980 --> 25:35.420
one thing that people have commented on and I

25:35.420 --> 25:36.660
I tend to agree with it

25:36.660 --> 25:43.300
Israeli PR is like terrible like they're just not cracking the nut when it comes to the West I have theories as to why but before I

25:43.420 --> 25:46.260
Contaminate the the vibe. I'm curious if you agree with that

25:47.420 --> 25:51.620
What is your take on Israel? What is your take on their PR strategy? Can they even win the PR war?

25:52.260 --> 25:54.260
well, I think so a

25:54.420 --> 25:56.380
Few things right

25:56.380 --> 26:02.580
Ironically like the whole kind of you know Russia was involved with Trump in 2016 story was obviously complete bullshit

26:02.980 --> 26:04.340
right, but

26:04.340 --> 26:10.780
There was a major KGB operation from the 1960s to try and shape Western perception about

26:11.140 --> 26:13.140
Israel in a negative way

26:13.300 --> 26:15.300
that was highly successful and

26:16.060 --> 26:21.860
Ended up influencing all kinds of publications in the West including publications read by people like Jeremy Corbyr, right?

26:21.860 --> 26:24.900
The guy who took over the lay of party here who's like crazy

26:25.740 --> 26:27.460
extreme anti

26:27.460 --> 26:32.340
anti-Israel so you have like almost became and almost became PM to be clear

26:32.620 --> 26:39.860
Yeah, it's within like 12,000 vote 12,000 votes distributed in different seats and and he would have been Prime Minister in 2017

26:39.860 --> 26:41.740
Yeah, exactly um

26:41.740 --> 26:49.300
So there's those like very long-term currents which have programmed the intelligentsia here for

26:49.900 --> 26:57.620
For decades in ways which I think are almost like not one in 10,000 people know the history of this and quite understand

26:57.620 --> 26:59.620
What what like how this actually worked?

27:00.500 --> 27:02.500
You also though have

27:02.980 --> 27:09.100
It's clear talking to people there that the you know Netanyahu does not have a grip of the whole Prime Minister's office

27:09.740 --> 27:15.300
It's chaotic Prime Minister's office does not coordinate well with Mossad and other parts of the deep state in Israel

27:15.300 --> 27:17.900
So like there is no concerted problem messaging

27:19.100 --> 27:20.780
Either

27:20.780 --> 27:24.580
So I think in a kind of tactical operational sense that's in that's important

27:26.020 --> 27:32.420
But also though, I think there's like a psychological problem, which is that they keep they think that

27:35.100 --> 27:37.100
They think

27:37.500 --> 27:41.580
They make what I think is like a common problem, which is they think it's basically about facts

27:41.780 --> 27:46.740
they think oh these we watch this terrible news from the BBC or whatever and

27:49.420 --> 27:55.300
These people don't know the truth and if we explain the actual facts about Hamas and explain blah blah blah

27:56.140 --> 27:58.140
Then it'll suddenly change somehow

27:58.660 --> 28:03.980
And so they keep trying to hammer it with certain PR strategies of the Western media

28:04.500 --> 28:06.500
But I think it's just fundamentally

28:06.940 --> 28:08.180
flawed

28:08.180 --> 28:11.060
because I don't think it's about facts like the

28:12.260 --> 28:17.140
Sad truth is that BBC like all the broadcasters

28:17.940 --> 28:23.700
They have a long-term moral simple moral story about why Israel are

28:24.700 --> 28:27.060
Is an apartheid state and their occupiers

28:28.100 --> 28:33.100
And everything all information filters into this simple story and then filters out

28:33.980 --> 28:38.940
Right, and then and that's it. It doesn't it doesn't require it doesn't work on the basis of facts

28:38.940 --> 28:42.100
It doesn't work on the basis of reason doesn't work on the basis of logic

28:42.220 --> 28:48.380
So I think any PR strategy which tries to combat it with facts and reason and logic is just is doomed

28:49.420 --> 28:51.420
but it's like

28:52.220 --> 28:55.660
It's a bit like in a way like in a small in a small scale obviously

28:55.660 --> 28:58.500
But just in terms of what you were saying before about about Zuckerberg

28:59.060 --> 29:00.660
When the first crazy

29:00.660 --> 29:04.020
Carol card one of the stories came out in 2016 about

29:04.500 --> 29:07.580
Russia and Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and all of that

29:08.220 --> 29:14.100
Facebook sort of thought well, this is all such obvious bullshit and like it doesn't reflect how digital advertising actually works

29:14.500 --> 29:17.540
We'll explain some facts and then everyone will realize what the truth is

29:17.900 --> 29:22.420
They didn't understand that they were actually caught up in them in a in a moral story, right?

29:22.420 --> 29:26.900
But the whole point was evil tech companies have helped the evil fascists

29:27.620 --> 29:34.300
So just explaining to you at times guys like your coverage doesn't actually understand what how digital marketing works

29:34.300 --> 29:39.740
And if we you know, we'll explain to you how digital marketing works and then you know, there's terrible coverage

29:39.740 --> 29:44.980
We'll go away who's that work in Facebook like clearly operating like this for like three years

29:45.300 --> 29:49.380
And then in the end they why don't we just keep getting fucked it like what's going on here?

29:49.700 --> 29:55.300
But that's why right because they're trying to deal with logic in facts about something that's sort about logic in facts

29:56.140 --> 30:01.820
Yeah, and I found that same trap. So my book came out in 2016, which is a memoir, which you know was a very kind of

30:02.260 --> 30:07.660
Inside truthy. What's that? I read it great. Oh, great. Oh, thank you. Great. Thanks. Yeah

30:07.660 --> 30:13.260
And I yeah, I actually met that Carol Calder were a figure once at some festival and yeah

30:13.260 --> 30:18.020
Yeah, and it's worth noting that in her career career before being a journalist

30:18.020 --> 30:21.060
I'm using air quotes for those listening to a podcast. She was a novelist

30:21.060 --> 30:24.380
Which I think is probably where her talent should have remained because given

30:24.980 --> 30:28.980
Literally everything she wrote about Facebook was completely fictional, but I also felt. Oh, yeah

30:28.980 --> 30:31.660
No, no, no, I'm gonna explain how digital marketing works as I've been on the inside

30:31.660 --> 30:33.660
It got nowhere it meant it meant nothing

30:33.660 --> 30:39.220
Everyone still thinks that the Russian influence campaign or that this came to analytical thing was real and yeah, you're right

30:39.220 --> 30:41.220
I mean it was just hopeless at the end

30:42.420 --> 30:45.660
But but getting back to Israel like I mean

30:46.140 --> 30:50.980
Once like kind of argument is that like the videos that first came out of like the barbaric attacks did have some impact

30:50.980 --> 30:55.940
Like there was a window of like one week of grace period in which world-dependent seemed to be kind of pro-Israel as you saw

30:55.940 --> 31:02.140
Literally the most barbaric and heinous atrocities being committed like literally live streamed by the people actually committing it

31:02.300 --> 31:06.180
And I think, you know, I saw the famous 46 minute video

31:06.180 --> 31:12.700
That's even like more gory of what Hamas did as did Douglas Murray and other journalists and they've reacted very strongly to it

31:12.700 --> 31:15.660
I included it in my piece and tablet about what's going on there. So

31:16.220 --> 31:19.340
to some degree I think and I think truth does help but

31:20.140 --> 31:23.940
Getting back to like you're right. It doesn't fit into the narrative like this poster business

31:23.940 --> 31:27.540
Which has driven me crazy right this business of ripping down. I've put kidnapped posters

31:29.260 --> 31:31.500
Just on that point because I think that's an important thing right

31:32.500 --> 31:34.980
In one sense like you can't really get

31:35.620 --> 31:40.420
PR or a story stronger than what Hamas did

31:41.380 --> 31:47.460
And to me the actual interesting thing there is right, that's like pretty much bad as it gets right

31:47.460 --> 31:53.180
It's like sort of filming the torture to chambers of the NKVD and the Gestapo in Eastern Europe

31:55.220 --> 31:57.220
But within like 10 days, it's basically

31:58.900 --> 32:02.180
The NPCs in the media just go back to the script

32:03.180 --> 32:05.180
So even

32:05.900 --> 32:07.420
Mentally

32:07.420 --> 32:12.580
Appalling as that and as powerful as that basically only knocks them off script for you know

32:12.580 --> 32:18.020
Like a few new cycles like maybe 10 days and then they're back to oh Israel's destroyed a hospital in Gaza. I

32:19.100 --> 32:24.100
Know right. It's crazy. It's like imagine the Nazis had like live streamed Auschwitz and then like two weeks later people were like

32:24.100 --> 32:28.180
Wow, I don't know were they really shoved in ovens did this expert of

32:32.420 --> 32:36.260
Exactly, I don't know that they know the dead German civilian count is higher than the British one

32:36.260 --> 32:39.020
I think we should have a ceasefire. That's clearly what we should do now

32:39.020 --> 32:42.820
That was clear the tenor of the conversation in 1943 at 10 downing

32:44.140 --> 32:47.820
Yeah, no, I agree with you. Um, yeah, and that I mean now

32:50.180 --> 32:54.220
To me like like the people in Israel doing the communications

32:55.020 --> 33:01.740
Understand this way. I feel so sorry for them because watching them it looked like it looks increasingly like that

33:02.540 --> 33:08.980
Like doesn't the world sort of knows what Hamas did right, but it seems like we can't get traction with this

33:09.300 --> 33:10.580
so like

33:10.580 --> 33:12.580
repeating it or and

33:12.620 --> 33:14.620
They seem to be like increasingly lost

33:15.180 --> 33:20.900
As there's there's some realized like global opinion and the global media is away from the story

33:20.900 --> 33:27.300
But they don't have like a follow-up plan. No, I think so, you know, I've got lots of Israeli friends

33:27.300 --> 33:29.300
I've Israeli business partners. I was there for a while

33:29.780 --> 33:31.420
Who knows I may move there one these days

33:31.420 --> 33:35.180
I think the problem with Israel and I said this in my piece is like the Israelis

33:35.500 --> 33:40.300
Israel is a fascinating country with the fascinating people. They don't realize how weird they are, right?

33:40.300 --> 33:45.780
Like they're obviously very assimilated to like global American Anglo whatever Western business culture

33:45.780 --> 33:49.180
They've obviously been very very successful as an economy GDP per capita

33:49.860 --> 33:51.860
matching Germany in the UK's which is

33:51.860 --> 33:56.300
More than 10x higher than any neighboring country. It's like they're very good at playing the Western game

33:56.420 --> 34:02.580
But the internal Israeli nation narrative is completely unlike the West right now to the point that like

34:03.180 --> 34:05.080
One of the questions I got from a friend of mine is like

34:05.080 --> 34:10.500
How is it that the Western left is lining up with a theocratic death cult instead of like the Israeli left?

34:10.500 --> 34:14.860
Which is actually super commie by the way, and it's funny like all these kibbutz that were attacked by Hamas

34:15.140 --> 34:18.820
Like European press was calling them settlements. It's like do you have any idea what you're talking about?

34:18.820 --> 34:22.980
This is literally the lefty tree hugging peaceniks who live in literal communism

34:22.980 --> 34:28.140
Where they literally split up the income and live in the only functioning communism one confined in the West

34:28.220 --> 34:33.780
That's who got attacked. That's who you're calling settlers and and and painting as the right, but that's the thing

34:33.780 --> 34:35.780
I think the Israelis

34:36.020 --> 34:39.400
How are they gonna sell the story they're a religious ethno-state like

34:39.900 --> 34:46.300
That's square with a Western narrative in which oh, no, it's borderless. It's universalist anybody can be Norwegian

34:46.300 --> 34:47.580
right like this business of the

34:47.580 --> 34:52.860
You know the Irish the Algerian or whatever it was immigrant who like stabbed the kid in Ireland that they kept on saying

34:52.860 --> 34:57.580
No, no, no, it's it's an Irish man. It's like no it isn't and the fact he isn't it's some of the material to the story

34:57.580 --> 35:01.060
But you can't accept the fact that in fact not everybody can become an Irish man or whatever

35:01.060 --> 35:06.940
And that's that's the collision like I'm not sure that Israel can be sold and at some point like my advice to them would like win

35:06.940 --> 35:08.940
The war and just it doesn't matter what the West

35:10.140 --> 35:14.380
But I mean you can see the kind of madness of the West right

35:16.060 --> 35:19.980
The the most the most perfect example of it

35:20.540 --> 35:27.340
The way that the most insane trans-right activist propaganda people have kind of joined forces

35:29.740 --> 35:32.860
The first people who are all getting thrown off the roof

35:33.700 --> 35:35.300
stat

35:35.300 --> 35:36.580
of

35:36.580 --> 35:40.780
mobilizing most aggressively on behalf of

35:41.500 --> 35:43.500
Hamas and Hezbollah

35:44.020 --> 35:49.340
I understand the madness of Western. I mean to the first Israelis. It is pretty tough to understand that right

35:50.220 --> 35:54.620
I mean, it's like, you know, joke is it's like chickens organizing for KFC. It's like I

35:55.220 --> 35:59.740
Do you understand what the nature of the thing you're talking about is? Yeah

36:01.660 --> 36:05.900
So maybe switching topics slightly to one of the questions and one of the things came up in our group

36:06.940 --> 36:11.780
So, you know Dominic you, you know, I pretty clearly in Britain where things are pretty classic

36:11.780 --> 36:14.540
So at least as far as I understand, I actually don't know the UK deeply well

36:14.540 --> 36:16.700
I've lived in Spain and France, but I don't know the UK well

36:16.700 --> 36:18.700
but but you have hovered in elite circles and

36:19.420 --> 36:22.180
I've kind of dabble. I mean in tech, right?

36:22.900 --> 36:27.060
Well, this is the real core of the question. What is an elite? What is the new elitism that's coming?

36:27.060 --> 36:32.220
There's a lot of people that I think we all know who are from those elite circles are very financially

36:32.700 --> 36:37.060
Capable and endowed and privileged and all that and they're not gonna send their kids to university, right?

36:37.060 --> 36:40.020
Like they're just not gonna go the Harvard Cambridge route or whatever that is

36:40.020 --> 36:43.420
And but they don't they don't have an alternative like they don't know what what's the other thing

36:43.700 --> 36:47.180
So is there a new elite coming does there need to be a new elite like what?

36:47.460 --> 36:51.100
What's your read on all that? I mean you have kids I assume. So this is like a real question for you

36:51.100 --> 36:51.740
I

36:51.740 --> 36:56.020
Mean a lot a lot of different questions bound up in that. I do think that

36:57.900 --> 36:59.900
Was the one thing is you alluded to I

37:00.900 --> 37:04.860
Think it's very interesting about this question like are we gonna send our

37:05.580 --> 37:08.380
Like I've got a seven year old a seven year old kid

37:10.300 --> 37:11.700
You know ten years ago

37:11.700 --> 37:14.460
I would probably not really have even reflected on it much

37:14.460 --> 37:18.980
But just would have assumed that obviously like I wanted to do certain kind of school and then

37:19.780 --> 37:21.780
Ideally get into one of the top

37:22.580 --> 37:27.740
universities in the Western world and I wouldn't have probably reflected on it much. Whereas now I

37:28.980 --> 37:30.980
think

37:31.980 --> 37:36.580
The opposite I think maybe in maybe in like 10 12 years

37:36.780 --> 37:40.420
Like if he really wants to do maths and he's really good at maths

37:40.420 --> 37:46.540
Then maybe he should still go to Cambridge or Harford if he can get into one of those two places, but barring that

37:48.580 --> 37:50.580
It seems to me

37:50.820 --> 37:52.820
Less likely with every day

37:53.620 --> 37:58.900
That that's something that I would want him to go and spend his time in quite the opposite

37:59.740 --> 38:01.740
So I do think that's a big issue

38:02.260 --> 38:03.980
I

38:03.980 --> 38:07.820
Hope that some of the rich people do what their

38:08.660 --> 38:10.660
Forefathers it

38:11.500 --> 38:14.740
And actually go out and start new things. I also hope

38:16.300 --> 38:18.300
It also strikes me that maybe there's an opportunity

38:18.780 --> 38:24.820
To kind of jailbreak the maths and physics departments because a lot of the credibility of these universities

38:24.820 --> 38:28.660
Why doesn't any more come from the history of the English department or whatnot?

38:28.660 --> 38:30.660
Which is all just taken over by

38:31.580 --> 38:37.180
By insane forces the credibility that they have left really comes from doing hard sciences

38:37.820 --> 38:39.500
So maybe

38:39.500 --> 38:44.940
You know one one thing I've been talking to some people about is the idea of could you say

38:46.140 --> 38:48.140
Right, we're going to set up something

38:48.620 --> 38:55.940
An offer faculty from maths physics, maybe computer science and say you only have to move like half a mile away

38:57.260 --> 38:59.260
For work you don't have to move your family

38:59.380 --> 39:03.380
But you can shift to a new institute which we're going to run

39:03.380 --> 39:04.540
It's gonna be running the following ways

39:04.540 --> 39:09.140
There's gonna be actual academic freedom all of the crazy communist shit is going to be completely forbidden

39:09.580 --> 39:11.580
None of it's going to exist

39:11.620 --> 39:13.300
and

39:13.300 --> 39:17.900
Here's the kind of principles on which it will operate you'll get more money you'll get more freedom

39:18.300 --> 39:22.380
You'll be able to move much faster. You know if you're a professor of physics now at Oxford

39:23.260 --> 39:25.260
The amount that you can actually do

39:25.620 --> 39:31.420
In any kind of time frame is like almost zero because the bureaucracy is so completely insane

39:32.140 --> 39:37.260
So I think there are there are possibilities like that maybe for for creating different

39:38.140 --> 39:42.220
For creating different institutions. It doesn't strike me as likely that in like 30 years time

39:45.740 --> 39:49.260
The smartest kids are all going to be keeping going to these universities

39:49.740 --> 39:51.260
And they're going to be

39:51.260 --> 39:53.260
You know as mad as they are now politically

39:53.820 --> 39:57.580
So something's going to something's going to change there. Are they going to break up and fracture?

39:58.220 --> 40:02.060
Or people are going to create new things and pull away high status people

40:03.100 --> 40:05.100
And a little change like that

40:07.580 --> 40:09.580
And obviously

40:09.580 --> 40:13.260
Yeah, so on the on the university front. I think that's but

40:13.740 --> 40:17.820
Politically though the fundamental question is I think goes back to what we were talking about before

40:19.740 --> 40:26.220
We've you know, we've we've seen in the western world this very big shift in elite talent

40:26.940 --> 40:28.220
Where

40:28.220 --> 40:32.540
You know 50 years ago or 70 years ago a huge number of the most able

40:33.180 --> 40:37.420
Smartest people that could actually build things the general groves characters

40:38.620 --> 40:41.020
Of people who built bletchley in britain, right?

40:42.700 --> 40:44.700
These people have

40:44.700 --> 40:47.260
Very largely stopped going into public service

40:47.980 --> 40:52.620
So if you go to the the caliber of top civil servants now in in britain

40:53.420 --> 40:56.220
And in washington is drastically lower

40:56.780 --> 41:01.180
And more and more of the of the most able people are in some combination of maths money

41:02.620 --> 41:03.740
pc

41:03.740 --> 41:05.580
hedge funds

41:05.580 --> 41:07.100
startup world

41:07.100 --> 41:09.100
et cetera et cetera now

41:09.420 --> 41:12.620
That obviously has all kinds of advantages from an economic perspective

41:13.100 --> 41:15.980
But I think it's also disastrous from a government perspective

41:16.780 --> 41:19.020
And some of these people are going to need to have to get

41:19.820 --> 41:24.380
Again, I'm going to move back into politics. I think if it's going to change. We can't just have

41:25.340 --> 41:27.340
all of our great builders

41:28.300 --> 41:31.900
Operating as entrepreneurs in private companies whilst

41:32.940 --> 41:35.260
you know the cia and the nsa and

41:35.980 --> 41:37.980
white haired institutions

41:38.460 --> 41:42.460
Just keep decaying and are less and less able to cope with with problems

41:44.220 --> 41:45.580
But then the

41:45.580 --> 41:49.820
Right, but then the question becomes do you sort of revitalize existing institutions or do you create new ones?

41:51.420 --> 41:53.420
At the end of the day, I mean, I'm

41:53.420 --> 41:56.300
Really in the camp. I mean having having done both in government

41:56.940 --> 41:58.940
I very strongly think that um

41:59.260 --> 42:01.260
The startup model is the way that

42:01.820 --> 42:04.860
To go in government like if you're going to try if if your goal is

42:05.420 --> 42:08.380
if you so if you're the new president you take over january 2025

42:09.100 --> 42:10.220
and by

42:10.220 --> 42:15.580
2030 20 20 20 35 you want a drastically reformed american military

42:16.140 --> 42:17.580
Do you a

42:17.580 --> 42:23.820
Try to do some kind of conventional reform project in the pentagon or b set up new institutions

42:24.380 --> 42:26.380
That will just tunnel

42:26.700 --> 42:28.700
around the bureaucracy

42:28.700 --> 42:34.300
Empowered in different ways legally set up in different ways with completely different freedoms over hr

42:34.700 --> 42:38.620
Over freedom of information over procurement over, you know, all of the bullshit

42:38.940 --> 42:45.580
Which makes it just impossible to do any and it's obvious that you do be right. You don't say to the u.s. Air Force

42:46.140 --> 42:50.780
Um, I mean, I've I'll give you like a classic example that I've actually had experience within government

42:51.980 --> 42:58.220
What do you do with future planes? Well, of course the existing raf in britain doesn't want to do drones

42:59.020 --> 43:03.660
Because the whole institutional structure and the whole way you get promoted is by being in charge of pilots

43:04.460 --> 43:06.460
so

43:06.460 --> 43:08.460
He fights against all

43:09.100 --> 43:14.460
Against actually shifting to modern technology. So instead of trying to convince this old bureaucracy

43:15.180 --> 43:19.180
To do the new thing you just set up as you set up the drone force, right?

43:19.260 --> 43:21.980
You don't try and make the old thing do the new thing

43:22.300 --> 43:25.740
You set up the new thing and you just shift money and power towards the new thing

43:26.220 --> 43:27.420
um

43:27.420 --> 43:29.580
You know, it is possible to reform things

43:30.220 --> 43:36.860
And I've reformed some things. I spent a lot of time in the department of education changing things, but it's incredibly hard

43:37.020 --> 43:39.020
It's incredibly slow

43:39.260 --> 43:40.220
um

43:40.220 --> 43:44.220
The forces against you are so massive and you've got to kind of get everything aligned

43:45.180 --> 43:52.540
Just right. It's it's just much simpler to to to do startups in government that it is to to um

43:53.580 --> 43:55.580
I'll give you a practical example of that as well

43:55.660 --> 43:59.820
So we set up a new data science and ai team in number 10

44:00.940 --> 44:02.700
Because it was new

44:02.700 --> 44:06.140
It was actually much easier to create it seemed much less threatening

44:06.940 --> 44:07.660
um

44:07.660 --> 44:14.460
It didn't seem like it like this terrible challenge to existing power structures the way that telling a lot of existing things

44:14.540 --> 44:16.540
That had to change would have been

44:16.620 --> 44:19.580
Uh, of course now it's actually successful and it's doing all sorts of things

44:19.660 --> 44:24.460
Of course part of the system are desperately trying to close it and destroy it because it shows everyone up

44:24.540 --> 44:27.500
But it's super ours for the old parts of the system

44:27.980 --> 44:29.980
But it certainly was much easier to get

44:30.860 --> 44:32.460
that it was

44:32.460 --> 44:34.460
You know persuade thousands of people to change

44:35.020 --> 44:37.340
What if you're trying to become president?

44:37.900 --> 44:40.620
In the first place you talk about, you know, if you do become president

44:40.620 --> 44:44.380
But if you're trying to win in the first place, do you try to take over the left?

44:44.780 --> 44:49.100
Do the democratic party? Do you try to take over the republican party? Do you start a new party?

44:49.900 --> 44:53.340
How would you how would you think about that? I know you're interested in america 2024

44:54.300 --> 44:55.340
Um

44:55.340 --> 44:57.340
Talk talk about that

44:57.340 --> 44:59.900
I mean, I think practically speaking now in the states like the

45:00.460 --> 45:04.940
I think the the die is cast on the republican side, right? Like trump is going to win the nomination now

45:05.180 --> 45:11.580
This seems like a lot of donors are going to throw a lot of money down the toilet trying to back. Um, hailey. I think, um

45:12.860 --> 45:20.300
She cut there's no campaign that she can run that can win like possibly trunk can blow himself up. Um, but uh

45:21.180 --> 45:23.180
She she got

45:24.300 --> 45:30.540
Time to do that as I said in 2021 was then um, and and and they've left all that too late. Um

45:31.180 --> 45:36.300
I do think it's underrated with biden that uh, the kind of assumption seems to be that

45:36.700 --> 45:38.860
Now he wants to do it. Therefore, he'll just keep doing it

45:39.260 --> 45:43.500
I think an underrated scenario is that he just takes like another mental dip

45:44.220 --> 45:48.140
And the polls blip down enough that it's just clear that trump is going to win

45:49.020 --> 45:56.140
The electoral college and all the focus group reports start pinging back up through the system from the five six key states saying

45:57.100 --> 45:59.500
Yeah, there's all this thing though to say that

46:00.060 --> 46:04.780
Biden doesn't mean biden biden means either we've seen our biden gargar biden

46:04.780 --> 46:10.060
They can't actually be president or it's going to be president kamala and we'd rather have trump than president kamala

46:10.380 --> 46:13.580
So fuck it. We're gonna go for trump and as those focus group reports come back up

46:13.660 --> 46:15.260
You can imagine panicking

46:15.260 --> 46:21.740
Democratic party and they shove him out. So I do think it's underrated that biden could still get the that he could get pushed out

46:22.380 --> 46:23.980
um

46:23.980 --> 46:28.700
I mean it was a setting up a new party. So I did some focus group and polling research on this

46:29.100 --> 46:30.220
um

46:30.220 --> 46:32.220
last year in the states

46:32.940 --> 46:35.180
And it was we we hit a kind of interesting problem like

46:37.020 --> 46:41.340
Figuring out what a new party should say and do to be very popular

46:41.980 --> 46:45.580
Was not so hard right which is generally a lesson of electoral politics

46:45.740 --> 46:47.740
If you actually just listen and you want to figure it out

46:48.220 --> 46:52.540
There's there's usually a way the problem that we found was that people said

46:53.500 --> 46:59.020
Yeah, god, we hate the old parties. It's crazy that they're so shit. It's crazy that they won't change and listen to us

47:00.540 --> 47:02.540
Yes, I want the third party

47:02.540 --> 47:06.940
But I probably wouldn't vote for it and you go but why not like you literally just said all these things and now

47:06.940 --> 47:12.140
We've given you the third party. Here's our policy. We've designed it. We've got your theoretical leader that you like

47:12.700 --> 47:15.100
But then what like why are you not going to vote for it? And they go

47:15.980 --> 47:21.260
Well, because we're just going to be a waste of vote and the crazy people never get in and like the whole from the country

47:22.700 --> 47:29.020
So they kind of that first pass the post problem. I think is it is a real problem and I think

47:29.980 --> 47:35.580
To realistically you like it's so therefore like getting over that. It's either a very long process

47:35.740 --> 47:38.380
You have to resign yourself might take 20 30 years to build

47:39.260 --> 47:40.460
or

47:40.460 --> 47:42.460
You need a kind of global superstar

47:42.700 --> 47:44.700
You need an elon type person

47:45.020 --> 47:53.020
Or can you type person someone of someone of that level of global fame that just like instantly punches through all media

47:53.020 --> 47:54.060
Do you know what I mean?

47:54.060 --> 47:56.300
Yeah, let's say it wasn't too late

47:56.300 --> 48:00.860
It was like a couple years ago and someone like elon had come to you and said hey, you know, I want to run

48:01.100 --> 48:06.300
I want I want to compete. What is sort of the core issues or what is the platform that would that would that would

48:06.700 --> 48:09.180
That would be able to compete that would that would most widely resonate

48:09.260 --> 48:12.140
I think you talked about this a little bit in your podcast with andrew sullivan

48:12.700 --> 48:13.900
um

48:13.900 --> 48:15.900
When you unpack that a little bit

48:16.860 --> 48:18.460
um

48:18.460 --> 48:19.500
well

48:19.500 --> 48:20.540
again, so

48:20.540 --> 48:21.740
so

48:21.740 --> 48:28.300
What issues really simple right and kind of shows the problem if you if you just do regular focus use of people and you chat around

48:30.300 --> 48:35.900
What sort of things that people people want one of the first things that people will spontaneously say is term limits

48:36.700 --> 48:41.740
We've got all of these old people. We've got these like senile people in both parties everywhere

48:42.220 --> 48:45.980
It's it's an it's an embarrassment for us on the world stage

48:46.860 --> 48:52.700
We've got to have term limits and drive these old people out and get new talent in and also we just not just old people

48:52.700 --> 48:54.700
We just don't want the same people there all the time

48:55.340 --> 49:01.820
And it cuts completely across party support. You can aoc fans support it trump fans magus the most

49:02.620 --> 49:03.980
board is like

49:03.980 --> 49:05.980
a total home run

49:06.380 --> 49:07.740
But why do no

49:07.740 --> 49:12.300
But the old parties can't support it right because the old parties are locked into a system where if you say that

49:12.860 --> 49:18.460
That's like that's like calling for like everybody in congress to to be you know, investigated by the irf

49:19.500 --> 49:21.820
It's like it's declaring war on the system

49:22.620 --> 49:28.700
But if you're going to be a third party you didn't care about that you prepared to take risks and and you and you were just openly out

49:28.700 --> 49:30.380
war with the system anyway

49:30.380 --> 49:32.380
then you'd have a bunch of things like

49:33.500 --> 49:36.700
Term limits like much stricter controls on congress

49:37.340 --> 49:41.820
All of their dodgy sharing, you know buy stocks and shares and inside failing all that kind of crazy shit

49:42.060 --> 49:44.060
You have a whole set of things like that

49:44.860 --> 49:46.860
um, I think you'd be

49:47.020 --> 49:52.860
Uh, you'd be very tough on the border very tough on crime like you'd be much closer to trump on that

49:53.420 --> 49:58.620
And it's constantly interested like the democrats are just out of touch with a lot of their own voters on that

49:59.500 --> 50:03.020
Like I can't remember now when I did all this research it was last year and I can't remember the exact numbers

50:03.020 --> 50:10.060
But no there's a good chunk of democrats who uh, uh, um, who supported biden in 2020

50:10.860 --> 50:16.140
Who basically agree with trump on police the border, uh, etc, etc

50:16.780 --> 50:18.300
um

50:18.300 --> 50:24.540
I think you'd be crazy to do a lot of what the republicans trying to do constantly writing on social security and

50:24.940 --> 50:26.940
and um, destroying obama care

50:27.500 --> 50:29.500
again, I would

50:29.660 --> 50:31.660
everything like that, um

50:34.540 --> 50:39.580
Trying to like have some kind of big argument about the overall structure of the healthcare system is just doomed

50:39.820 --> 50:45.500
I've I've run a whole bunch of focus groups on that. There's no way through. There is no like

50:46.380 --> 50:52.380
Great new universal plan that people go. Oh, yeah, okay. This guy's cracked it and this is what we should do

50:52.780 --> 50:57.180
But I think definitely you definitely have um, you definitely avoid that. Um

50:58.620 --> 51:00.620
But I think

51:01.020 --> 51:08.540
A bit like a bit like um, what we did in 2016 and 2019, right? We got attacked by the media constantly as being completely incoherent

51:09.580 --> 51:11.580
uh, um, and it was

51:11.820 --> 51:13.580
Because our agenda

51:13.580 --> 51:18.140
Didn't fit neatly onto the existing party access and it didn't fit onto a left-right thing

51:18.780 --> 51:24.380
So we were much tougher on immigration than the conservatists were but we were actually in the same place as the country was

51:24.860 --> 51:26.860
Like we were with the median voter

51:27.660 --> 51:33.420
We were um to the left so to speak of the conservator party on um healthcare

51:34.060 --> 51:38.460
But we were exactly where the median voter was now in west minster all the media say

51:38.860 --> 51:42.860
Oh, your policy is in go here and no one will pay attention to that doesn't make any sense

51:43.020 --> 51:45.020
But that's not how voters think

51:45.420 --> 51:47.820
So again, if you're constructing if you're constructing

51:48.540 --> 51:52.700
A party in the states and you just were optimizing for winning

51:53.740 --> 51:59.420
Right, not whether or not the pundits say you're smart or whether your strategy makes sense if you're just optimized for winning

52:00.220 --> 52:04.540
It's it's definitely going to look a bit odd like that. It won't fit into the conventional party structure

52:04.540 --> 52:06.540
It won't fit on a left-right axis

52:06.620 --> 52:08.620
And that's partly because like

52:09.420 --> 52:13.900
It is sort of crude caricature terms if you if you do focus groups in research

52:14.620 --> 52:16.620
on swing voters

52:16.620 --> 52:20.620
Whether it's in california or or pennsylvania or in britain

52:21.340 --> 52:24.460
They're kind of nationalist, right? They are

52:26.380 --> 52:28.380
Then they are far to the right

52:29.020 --> 52:36.220
Of most elected representatives on many issues and and to the left of them on many issues at the same time the same person

52:36.780 --> 52:41.740
And this is completely constantly. I think I underrated and and not um

52:43.020 --> 52:47.980
So the whole political punditry world works constantly on this idea of the center ground

52:48.620 --> 52:51.820
Which is regarded as this kind of average of left and right

52:52.620 --> 52:54.620
Oh, there's balloons coming up

52:56.620 --> 52:58.620
Yeah

52:58.620 --> 53:00.620
Um

53:00.620 --> 53:04.220
This idea of the center ground whether where people are kind of average of left and right

53:04.940 --> 53:06.300
And it's just

53:06.300 --> 53:11.820
It all pundits basically believe it and there's endless everyone writes about it in every election

53:12.060 --> 53:16.060
But it just doesn't actually map to the data of how how real voters

53:17.580 --> 53:19.500
Yeah, I mean it's I mean I agree with you, right?

53:19.500 --> 53:23.500
Like it's funny one of the catchphrases you see of san francisco your average san francisco guy is like

53:24.140 --> 53:29.740
I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative. It's like actually most americans are fiscally liberal and socially conservative

53:29.980 --> 53:31.980
As a matter of fact your it's you

53:32.140 --> 53:35.100
I mean that that is an elite view but most americans are actually not like that

53:35.100 --> 53:38.780
They're actually socialists of the core and the government better not touch my medical care

53:39.180 --> 53:41.180
But they're actually to the right and a bunch of other issues

53:41.820 --> 53:43.180
exactly

53:43.180 --> 53:46.940
One thing I I wouldn't I don't know if I pushed back on it because I suspect that party would actually still win

53:47.180 --> 53:53.180
But one thing I've noticed again the eu us difference in the eu however, and again, I mean the the continent for the most part

53:54.220 --> 53:58.940
However broken any political process might be it does seem like things kind of converge

53:59.340 --> 54:03.100
If there is a majority view and to use one particularly hot button issue, but

54:03.580 --> 54:06.940
It's it's a good issue because it's very parameterized abortion, right?

54:07.180 --> 54:12.620
Abortion is actually not a binary thing the real debate is actually at what is the what is the cutoff at which abortion happens

54:12.860 --> 54:17.340
And if you look at most polling in the united states, it's almost exactly where the law dictates in most european

54:17.420 --> 54:20.220
Again, I'm not sure what the laws in the uk, but in germany france and spain

54:20.220 --> 54:24.460
It's basically anywhere between 11 to 13 weeks is the upper bound for abortion

54:24.700 --> 54:28.300
That tends to be where people pull at most people don't want a total ban

54:28.540 --> 54:31.660
Most people don't want an abortion literally two seconds before the child is born

54:31.980 --> 54:35.420
And most people land in that 35 and and americans are the same way by the way

54:35.900 --> 54:38.140
And and yet the narrative in the united states is either

54:38.780 --> 54:43.020
Fully banned no way like the catholic party line or it's the liberal line

54:43.100 --> 54:48.460
Which is any encroachment to abortion is unthinkable never mind that like when disantis for example

54:48.460 --> 54:51.660
I think in his initial platform he had a 15 week limit

54:51.820 --> 54:58.220
Which is more permissive than most european countries and most american liberals like didn't even seem to understand

54:58.700 --> 55:02.620
That actually florida abortion law would be more to the left than france's would

55:03.260 --> 55:05.740
But it didn't matter right but in the u.s. Thing and then

55:06.220 --> 55:11.900
And i could cite examples when it comes to to gun laws to a bunch of other things where in fact most americans are not crazy

55:11.900 --> 55:15.100
I need to own a tank gun nuts nor total banners or somewhere in the middle

55:15.340 --> 55:18.780
And yet in europe policy tends to converge to the democratic meme

55:19.020 --> 55:22.060
But in the u.s. Actually it does it it actually pins to the extremes

55:22.300 --> 55:27.500
And i don't know if that's because of primary first pass post voting or what but it things can be different

55:28.220 --> 55:31.100
Because of the proof because of the primary problem become

55:32.700 --> 55:38.700
On certain things like abortion because as you say it's um, I mean so again, I looked at this issue last

55:42.060 --> 55:44.060
Last year um

55:44.060 --> 55:51.180
And you can see like how you could craft a policy on abortion which would basically be like reasonably popular with people but

55:51.580 --> 55:53.580
It will be attacked

55:53.740 --> 55:58.300
Whether you're a republican or democrat you'd be massively attacked by the people on your own side

55:59.180 --> 56:01.180
for

56:01.180 --> 56:03.180
Proposal if you actually crafted

56:03.740 --> 56:07.180
The like the optimal strategy on abortion for a presidential candidate

56:07.660 --> 56:13.420
As soon as you said it you would be attacked whether you're a republican or democrat by by your own side as like

56:14.060 --> 56:19.340
As a mass traitor, but i've got a theory on this like it's not inconceivable to me

56:20.060 --> 56:24.940
The trump might actually go into the next by like september october 2024

56:25.660 --> 56:31.100
Trump may have a more popular policy on uh, it'd be closer to the median voter and have

56:32.460 --> 56:35.340
Uh a more popular policy on abortion than than biden

56:36.540 --> 56:43.340
Because if you look at his history, he was never a kind of um very far right on this issue. It's from new york. Um

56:44.460 --> 56:46.460
So it's possible

56:46.540 --> 56:48.540
possible

56:48.700 --> 56:54.380
Certainly if you listen to the polls, he will do but it would be a very interesting move for him suddenly to shift

56:56.460 --> 57:00.300
And and here's and here's an alternative like way of how the of how abortion works

57:00.300 --> 57:02.300
Like during 2020 election campaign

57:02.700 --> 57:08.220
Biden actually shifted from a more popular policy on abortion to a less popular policy on abortion

57:08.700 --> 57:10.060
Why did that shift happen?

57:10.060 --> 57:14.460
It happened because the staff in his own campaign revolted and basically

57:14.700 --> 57:21.980
Demanded of him that he changed policy and he didn't feel strong enough at that moment in the campaign when he was still weak

57:22.540 --> 57:27.420
to push back against his own staff and that shows like another dynamic at this point the democrats are

57:28.220 --> 57:34.060
so taken over by very young very elite university educated

57:35.020 --> 57:36.380
staff

57:36.380 --> 57:41.980
That they constantly push their own campaigns to positions which are completely irrational

57:42.540 --> 57:44.540
If you're actually trying to optimize for winning

57:45.100 --> 57:46.220
You know, can you see this?

57:46.220 --> 57:52.860
There's all sorts of vapor out on this right in 2016 something like a third of the ads that hillary ran actually helped trump

57:53.420 --> 57:55.420
and the ads which were most

57:55.900 --> 58:03.180
Popular with democrat activists and donors and got most clicks with them with the most helpful towards trump

58:04.140 --> 58:09.660
Right, this is like a crazy thing which doesn't fit with the conventional wisdom the conventional wisdom is

58:09.740 --> 58:13.580
Okay, politicians may be shittered government, but they are at least trying to win elections

58:14.220 --> 58:16.700
That is not true. It's almost never true

58:17.420 --> 58:22.060
Politicians generally are optimizing for much shorter term things. They're optimizing for internal

58:22.540 --> 58:27.980
Kind of in-group dynamics in their factions and signaling to the media over like a 48 hour window

58:28.460 --> 58:30.460
That's most of what their activity is

58:30.780 --> 58:33.660
And that's what explains this constant weird stuff of wide

58:34.380 --> 58:36.380
wire politicians not actually

58:36.620 --> 58:41.420
Adopting the optimal strategy, which is doesn't make ends basic democratic theory

58:42.540 --> 58:46.700
But is that unique to the u.s. Because like again in the u. Just just to cite the european example

58:47.020 --> 58:49.660
Things have kind of converged to the public will in the u.s. They have it

58:51.020 --> 58:51.980
um

58:51.980 --> 58:58.540
No, I think it's I think it's uh, I mean, I think it's why I think it's I think it's widespread across across democratic

58:59.180 --> 59:04.060
I guess across democratic politics. I think america is a bit odd because of the primary thing

59:04.700 --> 59:09.660
But um britain has definitely been the same, you know, I've watched elections here 20 years

59:13.980 --> 59:21.020
Certainly since 2010 the only election campaign that was actually rational was our campaign in 2019

59:22.540 --> 59:26.060
It's just apart from that both sides constantly run

59:27.020 --> 59:30.220
Run election messages, which are just which clearly don't work

59:30.940 --> 59:33.660
And another example of it, right isn't the referendum

59:35.580 --> 59:44.220
Our strategy was hated by all of the mps and um the most kind of committed activists on our own side

59:45.820 --> 59:47.580
Because these people

59:47.580 --> 59:49.580
They don't really want to listen to the public

59:50.700 --> 59:54.380
What they want to do is is tell the public what they should believe

59:55.260 --> 59:59.100
And they constantly think well if you just shout louder at them and tell them more

59:59.660 --> 01:00:03.660
Then the public's finally going to go all right. Okay. Well, I agree with you. Okay, right

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:10.300
Which is not how things usually work, but they hate listening people importantly hate listening

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.020
Yeah

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:18.460
Can I can I bring up one last thing speaking of alternatives to democracy one topic that came up in in our group chat this morning?

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:20.300
um, I believe uh

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.300
A venture capitalist we both know dominic

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:26.460
Was hanging around with uh king charles. He's king now, right?

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:31.100
Part of my privilege is being an american is not thinking about royals, which is what spurred the debate

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:36.300
He felt that the british the british monarchy has a certain gravitas

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:38.780
And a certain social function to play

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.500
As head of state

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:45.500
I think it's a ridiculous out ofistic throwback to a barbaric age that we should be done away with

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.460
I think one of the most ridiculous things about the australians and the canadiens that they still have a foreign monarch on their coin

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.820
Unlike us crazy americans gun nuts that we are we have no foreign monarch on our coins. Thank you very much

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.420
And in fact my my right as an american is not thinking about which royal waste rule popped out of which royal vagina

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.660
I don't have to think about this crap

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.820
And I think that in fact if there is a liberal democrat

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.980
I mean, I think the role of head of state though is important

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:11.500
And one thing that actually the westminster not the westminster system, I guess but

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.500
Other parliamentary systems have is they have a head of state that's different than the head of government, right?

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.420
Like in israel, for example, um, you know, you've got her's izak herzog

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:24.060
Who's the head of state who meets with douglas murray and the hostages and kind of represents the people?

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:28.700
And then you've got the head of government who everyone hates of course because the head of government always hated who actually operationally runs things

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.900
And um, if there's one thing the american political system gets wrong

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.220
Is the head of government the head of state are basically the same person

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:39.340
Which is why national politics are basically symbolic religious wars when really it should be about who's the best ceo

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.980
But in any case that's a that's a long wind up. But what do you think of the royals dominic? Are they worth keeping around?

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.580
um

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:52.140
I mean obviously the thing is ridiculous in lots of ways, but I think you're being too russian is tantonia. I think you're thinking

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:58.860
But well, it's this weird throwback and it doesn't really make any sense and they all have these

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:04.460
Weird outfits and how can this possibly be a rational way of looking at it? But um

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.700
I would say

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:16.540
Russianism in european politics is uh as often being the path to catastrophe

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.460
um

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:25.980
The people family makes no logical sense, but I would actually be in favor of keeping it and I think that um

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.420
I've got two basic two basic things

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:35.740
One is that I think from a practical point of view if it was replaced

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:41.340
It's almost inconceivable that what replaced it will be an improvement in my

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.220
In my eyes and secondly

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.980
Something that I've noticed which I think is important

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:54.700
Very hard to quantify is I think I think it's it's it's a kind of um

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:01.420
It's a last defense against extremism slash fascism slash communist takeover

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:08.780
And the reason for that is that um the armed forces don't swear an oath to the government. They swear an oath to

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.420
But they did swear an oath to the queen

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.380
Now we'll see this where it goes to the king

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.620
and

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.460
I think that has an oddly

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.260
Stabilizing effect that you can imagine all kinds of political disasters

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.300
Or you can imagine the kind of political things you often see in god who's happening

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.180
If you imagine similar things happening in britain

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:34.300
Because it distributes power in this way

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:38.460
It will be much harder for some kind of like extremist fanatic government

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:45.660
To take over and actually take over the entire state and take over the armed forces and have some kind of Stalinist coup

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.260
Do you know what I mean?

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.740
Because the armed forces are the parts of the state

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:52.540
there's this like residual feeling of

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:58.780
Oh, you're actually basically like some kind of like foreign inspired coup and we're just not going to do what you say

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.540
Yeah, and that and that's literally happened. So in 1981

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:07.500
There was a coup a coup attempt in spain actually in which the wari de civile

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:13.740
Which is like the the paramilitary like the the militarized police literally stormed the parliament and there's a photo of

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.620
Coronel tejero like wavering on a pistol and giving a lecture in front of the

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.140
The in the chamber of deputies in spain and what happened?

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:28.220
King what Carlos the second of spain basically got on tv in his uniform with the flag behind him and said

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.100
Yeah, we're not going back to fascism. This is not going to happen and basically called up every general and said all right

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.140
Pick a side bro

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.940
Me or jail and everyone said okay. Okay. Okay. Everyone come down

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:40.300
Like and then they arrested the coup leaders and like that was the end of it

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:45.100
And so in fact it worked exactly as you said right the embodiment the spirit of the nation kind of arose and said no

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.580
We're not doing this crazy shit. Everyone go back to your room

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:49.980
exactly

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.140
if someone tried to do that in britain and then

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:57.660
Because of this diffuse authority, you know, it is sort of slightly weird like, you know, you sit in number 10

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:04.780
Are you the prime minister says, okay? We're going to do this or you know, sending special forces somewhere or we're going to do this with whatever

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.500
the actual like the

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:10.620
The actual formal powers in lots of ways are

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.700
Not his he is acting on behalf of the queen

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.420
and

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:21.420
It does have a weird effect and it and it does mean that these people

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.940
Would not, you know, if it suddenly went crazy

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.540
or

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:33.980
Or there was some kind of like, you know, weird person managed to take like a Hitler star situation right where someone actually wins an election

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.860
becomes head of state

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.420
In all kinds of rationalist european constitutions

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.980
Well, the whole system now reports up to them including the armed forces and the new person is won the vote

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.820
Well, everyone just has to do what they say sort of thing

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:51.500
That doesn't happen in in the in the weird archaic irrational british constitution

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:56.940
But I think the little bit of friction and absurdity in it is like a good good long-term hedge

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:01.180
Interesting. Yeah, I mean, it's like the second amendment in the united states

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.500
The worst comes to worst everyone's got their rifle

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.780
But yeah, I'm trying to think in the u.s. Who occupies that role of like sanity check

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:11.660
It really is the constitution right the u.s. Constitution is the symbolic thing that embodies the nation

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:17.180
But of course, that's a tax subject interpretation, which is why supreme court almost acts like a rabbinical court, you know

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:21.260
Interpreting the the Torah or something right and so the u.s. Is kind of a religious project

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.980
But yeah in the u.s. There is no embodying of the nation outside of the

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.540
The constitution

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:30.780
About going too far in some ways, isn't that like I always find it interesting how

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.180
um

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.460
If you take like a quite an extreme situation in american politics

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:39.980
Of rusevelt in the 30s after his second win

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:45.020
When he was really like I can't remember exactly what the majority was that they had in congress

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.700
But it was extraordinarily massive and he'd got a massive landslide

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.660
And he could really he could and was

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:55.980
Ripping out washington closing things down reopening things doing all kinds of stuff

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:00.780
But he then made a move on the supreme court and he basically had to back off

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:05.340
It was seen as like just a stepped off. That's a good example

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:09.900
He tried packing the court famously by which meaning putting his cronies in and basically interpreting

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:14.860
You know like the my my polyside professor in high school said what is the u.s. Constitution?

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.180
Whatever nine justices say it is

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:21.100
And so if you control the justices you control the constitution and that that in fact was the step too far

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.540
I mean that was like that would be like imprisoning the queen. That's it. You've lost everybody. Nobody's going to follow you there, right?

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.180
yeah

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.740
Okay, we've been talking

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.660
I'll go for it. It's a

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:38.700
No, I'm just saying I've harassed dominic with all my okay. Ask the smartest bird. I know questions

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:41.980
Dominic you got them all

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.340
I've got a couple more and then we'll get down. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:47.020
well one

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:53.340
So some people use the mental model of thinking about the the left in the u.s. As you know college educated people

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.580
one third of the country plus

01:07:56.060 --> 01:08:01.260
You know certain might you know a large percentage of certain minority groups that those college educated people claim to speak on

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.460
behalf of and and prioritize and and give deference to

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.260
Against on the right non-educated

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.980
uh, or you know non college educated

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.220
What working class white people and that's a crude, you know summarization

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:19.020
but it's a way of the kind of describing the differences and the tensions that emerge where

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.580
sort of one third of the the country

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:27.260
Sort of speaks for two for for the rest of the country in terms of dominating the institutions

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:33.420
That that governed the the rest of the country and best there's sort of this populist outrage that that has the numbers

01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:37.260
But doesn't have the power and thus elect someone like trump

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:43.980
How would you edit that that characterization the u.s. And i'm curious if that same sort of cleaving or something similar to that

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.340
Is what's also happening in other countries where we're seeing

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:53.180
Sort of similar figures like trump or is it all very very different

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.900
No, i mean i think so

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.900
There's definitely something

01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:03.580
Common across the western world in terms of what's happening with educational polarization, right?

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.780
You can see in the data in every country

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:11.820
The story is is sort of similar since since 1945

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.140
graduates

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:15.340
used to be

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.340
much more conservative

01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:22.540
And and and that shifted dramatically

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:30.380
I mean, sorry it shifted gradually for decades and then it's really kind of become turbocharged in the last in the last 10

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.940
10 20 years

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.580
And that's definitely thrown poor

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:42.620
It's definitely confused all of the old system right they don't they haven't quite understood it as part of the reason why

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.940
they

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:51.820
Didn't see brexit coming and didn't see trump coming. I mean just in like one interesting way before brexit

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:56.220
Most of the polling companies didn't wait by education

01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.140
Certainly in britain and i think similar problems happen with the polling in

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.060
In america, um

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.100
They just didn't like so our data science team

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.940
looked at all of these polls in 2015 2016 and they said, you know, like

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.100
The data that we've got is not being is not reflected in the mainstream polls

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:22.460
The fundamental reason is that they don't understand what's happening with education polarization and very similar thing happened, I think

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.940
With trump, so there's no doubt that

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:31.180
establishment parties of being caught on the on

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.740
All on on the part for it by that

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:37.660
I'd like to ask one more question since, um

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.700
Getting to this issue of um, you know education and the and left versus right

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.660
I mean, I forgot who I read it was probably tyler cohen or somebody

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.860
If you mentioned how in the 1950s if you told somebody you're a democratic or republican

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.700
Or to use a slightly more wonky term if it was the input to your you know, your logistic

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.980
Regression model that tried to classify various parts of your lifestyle

01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:00.380
Being republic or democrat wouldn't have told you whether you owned a firearm went hunting

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:05.020
Had a college education. I wouldn't have told you lots of things actually and while now it's almost

01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:06.780
Dispositive, right?

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.660
Literally, it is like a 90-10 split either way for every question

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:13.340
I just said whether you're a republican democrat whether you own a gun went to college, etc

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.740
And so there's just been massive split of just

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:21.020
Beyond politics. I mean in the u.s. It really is a red versus blue tribe sort of issue

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:24.780
um, and I'm not even sure what why that is and I've lived in red states and

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.860
I'd be a hard nut to crack with if you tried based on politics

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.340
You know, whether I own a gun or not or whether I have a college education

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:33.660
But like broadly speaking like why is it?

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:34.940
Here's a better question

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:40.220
Why does the right kind of suck in the sense that like when it comes to like aesthetics when it comes to education

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:44.300
I mean, I think it was david revneck who famously called trump a short-fingered vulgarian

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.300
Which he kind of is and you know

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:47.580
He said many things that were true, right?

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.460
Like his his critique of russia during 2016 was actually correct

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.100
And so not to say that everything trump said was was nonsense

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:55.660
But there's there's an error about him when he has a rally

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:59.740
It's like the pillow guy that shows that it's like people that you wouldn't want your sister to date or

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:05.340
You know media or culture that you yourself wouldn't consume or identify with and yet you're kind of stuck

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.940
Right because on the one hand

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:12.860
Like let's face it anyone with any level of IQ education elite status income is like shopping at Whole Foods

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.900
And living in one of six cities and that's their lifestyle

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.380
And yet if if you kind of reject whole hog the the far left agenda

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.060
Well, what do you do? Are you going to go live in Nashville? Like no

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.980
That said this is someone who's lived in Reno and rural Washington

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:31.260
So I I have made that jump but probably speaking most people are not going to do that

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:35.100
It feels like it feels like the mid-wit mean right whereas the right

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:41.980
You know both has sort of the the the hick but also peter teal and sort of the the new counter-lead or sort of the true intellectual

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:47.100
Yeah, but the but the peter teals are the majority right at the end of the day. That's not that's not, you know, if you

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:51.900
Would a guy from San Francisco even if he had some trump sympathy if they went to a trump rally

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:56.620
Would they look around and say, oh, yeah, we I have a deep sympathy with these people. No, he wouldn't you walk right out of there

01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:59.580
And so what do you do with that? Right? If

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.500
You're not going away. You're not going with the far left agenda and yet you're you know

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.700
The polarization question is

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:10.380
Someone and it does seem I mean I'm not an expert on this now

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.900
In terms of looking across like lots of different countries. So I'm not sure

01:13:14.620 --> 01:13:16.620
how's correct statement

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.980
Certainly relative to Britain. So for example

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.700
in America

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:28.140
These issues as you say have become more and more polarized and more and more identified on a party basis

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.300
So even if you go back to like 1980

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.700
You had far more ticket splitting you had far more people who would like vote for a Democrat senator

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.780
but then maybe vote for Reagan, right?

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:44.460
And you couldn't be as sure by the fact that they voted for Reagan about a whole set of their views

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.180
As you would be now if someone said I voted for Trump. So it's definitely shifted

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.740
um

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.060
Over the last 40 years

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.700
That that kind of process hasn't happened in in Britain

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.220
And I think quite a lot of other European countries in terms of these things being locked into party identities

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:09.020
So there has been educational polarization. That's like a cross-western trend

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:15.100
But that educational polarization is not mapped onto party identification

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:19.020
Across the west in the same way it has in America

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.420
And I don't know what the answer

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.300
It's a very interesting question as to why as to why that's different

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:29.020
Um, again, like is the project is the primary process play some some part of that

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.140
Uh, other structural dynamics in the in the american vote system don't know. Um

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:43.420
But that is a difference for sure between america in europe and also and also britain on that other question

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:48.860
um, I think it comes back to to to what was touched on a couple of times, which is just

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:51.100
um

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.900
Small people on the right have gone out of politics

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.380
so

01:14:56.380 --> 01:15:00.860
If you look at say so everyone hate on the right people like me

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.620
We hate the new york times

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.420
We hate a whole load of like that

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:10.540
Liberal media in quotes, right

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.580
but

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:16.620
Nobody's trying to create an elite thing to take on the new york times in its own terms

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:19.900
As you say like a lot of the media

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:25.260
Kind of entrepreneurial activity like banon type stuff

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:33.340
Is basically just like trashy. It's not trying to create. It's not trying to like beat the new york times in its own game

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.140
Which someone should try and do

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:37.980
but

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:43.260
I think I think a big part of the reason why is is this question of where of where talents

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:44.460
It's gone

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.980
And the left still has a whole load of smart people who are basically on the left go into politics because they want to control these

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:52.060
Old institutions and they want to tell everyone what to do

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:55.340
Whereas people who are as smart on the right

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.540
Are you know, so you have like two kids now age 20

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.940
The one who's left inclined wants to go and work with like larry summers in washington

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:09.420
And then work in the u.s. Treasury you tell everyone what to do and then get rich good work for golden sacks after some spell in dc, right?

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.580
whereas

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.580
the person who

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:16.140
Has read a lot of mesas and hyac

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:17.900
are

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.340
It's probably gonna

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.620
Want to come and work with you guys in in california or on some tech startup, right?

01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:26.540
Maybe go work for angioreal and combine drones and national security

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:30.060
But when they look around at the p and this becomes self-reinforcing

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:35.100
When you when when smart 20 year old? I mean, I've had this myself in terms of recruiting and looking at things

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.860
We have like very smart kids age 20 23

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:45.340
They're looking at options and they go and look and talk to the politicians like I don't want to work with these fucking clowns

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:51.980
They just they they're losers. They're not going to get anything done. They don't really know what they're there for

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.260
Uh, why do I want to go and work with those people?

01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:02.460
So the smart person on the right the hyac fan those often does different things and I think over generations this

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:09.820
This is just compounded and compounded and compounded. I was fascinating. You know when I after just after the election

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:15.580
I wrote a blog and the blog basically said, okay, we're going to rip up government

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:17.660
And we're going to do all of this stuff differently

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:21.340
We're going to break a load of shit and we're going to build a load of new shit

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.660
And if you want to do this if you're a weirdo if you're a misfit if you've got technical

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:31.820
Abilities that you've like never got involved with politics because it's such a shit show get in touch and come and help

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:38.540
And I had a common exact number that but like 50 000 people applied for a job. I mean it was just completely insane

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.180
So you can see there is this untapped

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:45.020
There are a lot of people who actually do want to get involved with politics and government

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.900
who are like not people on the left

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.820
But at the moment they're like largely away doing their own things

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:55.580
And they're not going to drop those things to go work for a conventional

01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.380
conservative thing in washington or london

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:03.340
That they just think is hasn't got an actual plan couldn't execute any way is not going to win

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.500
By the way, I was going to ask you about that ad because that was pretty that was pretty famous and went viral at the time

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.540
Did you actually hire somebody from from the 50 000 applicants?

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.100
We hired some we had some like

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:17.980
Openly and we hired some covertly and was kind of going to get planted them in a deep state

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:21.180
Oh, wow

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:26.380
I uh, I love I love it. I want to close by uh ending or I want to end by

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:33.340
Returning to where we began which is on san francisco. There was one argument earlier that we said hey tech people don't care about san francisco

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.940
There's the counter argument that that uh, mark adresin has publicly made uh, who you know came on the show

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:46.060
Who whose group chat introduced us and he said hey actually they do care and they're um, you know

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.540
Reed Hoffman dustin moskovitz

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:54.700
um and other tech people are some of the biggest donors to the dnc to to the biden campaign and um also to

01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:01.340
In san francisco politics, they're we're actually we've tech has created the situation that they currently exist

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:05.580
They're and they're relatively happy with it or they think that's the best that can be done

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:12.220
With within the limitations and that efforts like gary tan and um, you know others

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:16.060
And by the way, mike solana is trying to create a right wing new york times our good friend

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.900
You know, he's early in that. Well, hopefully he'll he'll be able to do it, but um

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:22.620
Yeah, people like gary tan

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:24.860
Well good intention

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:31.580
Mark's argument that he made on our show is that it um, it actually doesn't help because there because there's no republican party

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:32.940
um

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:41.100
Trying to reform just from within the left will further um incentivize the left to keep going crazy and and and and take control

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:48.060
Whereas the only real solution is to let things get so bad that that a republican party can can emerge

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:54.460
And and no no gary nobody wants to go right wing even 80 percent of elan of san francisco is anti elan

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.900
They think he's too, you know, right winger beyond the pale and so we're caught

01:19:58.620 --> 01:19:59.580
In a rock and a hard place

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:05.420
Which is do we just not do anything and wait till things are so bad that a republican party can emerge or

01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:12.540
Can reform happen from within the the the the the left and people like gary the others kind of take over

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:15.260
Despite the sort of structural

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.340
ratcheting to the most extreme

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.940
That mark mentions happens in kind of one party cities or states

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:26.460
So strikes me as as extremely unlikely that there's going to be a republican

01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:31.420
In any kind of like short-term way like in the next 10

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.900
15 years or so

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:38.460
Because of other national dynamics. I just can't see it's a bit like what we're talking about in terms of is

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:41.020
Israel and like just moral

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.700
signals

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.980
but

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.860
The moral signals of the republican party are such that

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:53.260
Magic whole bunch of people go. Oh, yeah, you know, I listen to what they've got to say in san francisco crime's got so bad

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:55.340
Maybe we should go republican

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.900
I don't think that that's going to happen. However bad things get

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.100
I can sort of understand

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:02.700
mark's

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:09.980
argument about the potential futility of trying to reform inside the democrats, but so my answer to that would be

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.740
Hoping for a republican revival is doomed certainly in the next 10 years

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.460
So forget that

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.980
uh

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:25.740
It's perfectly plausible that trying to like have any kind of reform inside the democrat party isn't going to work

01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:30.540
But why are those unique to alternatives? Why can't you build an independent force?

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:33.420
Which doesn't have the branding of either

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.260
That's what that's where I would start

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.020
and

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.180
So I wouldn't try and spend a lot of my time like

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:45.820
Fighting the internal battle to the democrat party because I think a lot of that is a waste of time

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.700
And an effort and energy and won't work anyway

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:55.500
If if there is a way through and it may not be right sometimes like places and cities and cultures to just like

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.820
Their own secretary and there's nothing you can do about it

01:21:58.220 --> 01:21:59.820
um

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:07.580
Uh, but if there is a way through I'm sure that it it's by building something separate to the two parties in san francisco

01:22:07.900 --> 01:22:09.900
And say right we are san francisco people

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:14.060
We don't like the republicans for that reason. We don't like the democrats for this reason

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:17.900
But here are the things that we believe in and here's what we want to build and if you put us in power

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.140
Well, here's how we'll fight corruption. Here's how we'll fight crime. Here's how we'll do this

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.740
And you know, you just you you market test the message that you know

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:30.540
At least it works with with the voters that you need

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.100
And then you try and find some people to

01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:39.420
To to sell the message and see see see what can be built. That's where that's where I that's where I would start

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:45.740
But the hardest problem I'm sure is going to be people like because of this chicken and egg problem the worst

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:53.180
The worst the worst the better already ends up working. You're like when the real

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.620
When the revolution comes until that it just puts everyone off from getting involved

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:04.940
I and I I would say the black pill on sf politics we saw very recently

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:10.780
Which is that in fact sf could be easily cleaned up. So she I'm literally on second street in soma

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:15.340
About a block away from a high highway that typically has a homeless encampment under it

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:19.420
And it currently doesn't because shishin bing was here and they cleaned up all the streets in san francisco

01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:25.580
And practically overnight practically overnight the city went from the dystopia you saw to something else and I would say

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.540
To quote one of our great american philosophers hl menkin

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:31.900
Democracy is letting the voters choose and then giving it to them good and hard

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:37.180
And I would say that maybe the democrats actually want things to be this way because they amplify the problems

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:40.700
Which they are the solution which is oh no, there's this drug and homelessness problem

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:44.060
And there's this whole thing about it. Again, they could clean it up, but they sort of choose not to

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:46.860
Yeah, I think that

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.180
That makes so

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.900
That makes um a lot of sense to me

01:23:53.580 --> 01:24:00.460
A lot of california, um, I mean california democrat politics is intensely mainly corrupt and for people like usum

01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.660
The current thing

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:09.020
The only way the current thing doesn't work for usum is if he actually wants to go and become a national figure

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:11.100
And I think that's an interesting question right because

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:16.620
When I was doing all these focus groups last year one of the interesting things that came up all the time was people saying

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.220
like

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.940
Democrats or swing voters not maga people would say

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:26.380
Yeah, you know what? We do need a fucking wall. We need a wall around california

01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:31.260
Stop basically shit escaping and washing over the rest of the country

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:38.940
And you know because they see the the same videos right of like the homeless people like walking out like zombies with machetes in their hands and they think

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.380
We don't want this everywhere. Um

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:47.180
And that's a real problem for usum for sure if he wants to become a national

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:54.060
A national figure, but in terms of the internal california politics maybe the democrat party could just

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.660
Doing this for

01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:01.340
For a long time right you you tech people can like keep insulating yourselves

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.620
Like the roman senators in the republic you can build your

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:12.380
Build your your walled gardens the walls of the walled gardens ever higher and your fish ponds ever more magnificent and keep the madness out for

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.260
another 10 years maybe

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:19.820
I mean I I've always suspected my my dark theory by way sf is a tech hub

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:25.420
Is that you need like billion dollar startups to fix some of the problems the city has and it's actually not even a joke right?

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:30.380
Like the public transport here sucks. So we had uber the housing situation hotels completely sucks. We had airbnb

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.420
The dating scene by the way is terrible. So we had dating apps

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:38.860
The social scene is actually not so great either. So we had all the social media like literally every every great consumer tech

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:44.540
Sort of innovation you've seen has been kind of a patch to the sf system from very entrepreneurially minded people

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.980
Company to provide personal security with drones is like

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:52.620
Yeah privately is next. Um

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:57.740
I mean before we go starting a new party. I presume is very difficult

01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.300
You you don't have the infrastructure that the other parties have

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.140
um

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.620
If if that were so obvious why aren't people

01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:08.140
Doing it. What are the big bottlenecks to to making that happen?

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.060
I think the

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:16.380
Overwhelmingly the the biggest bottleneck is just this first pass the post problem that you have to get to some critical mass before you can break

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:21.100
Through uh, and and it's very hard to persuade people to get involved with with something

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:26.220
In a first pass the post system because they think well, you know, I don't want to commit 10 years of my life to building this

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.100
Which may not get

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.780
Where you actually

01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:35.660
Can punch through that's the fundamental

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.220
Uh, and I think it's that's why it's like it's overwhelmingly likely that

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:43.580
If that's solved it'll be because someone

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:49.260
Super duper famous like global like legit globally famous character

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.820
Decides to do it. That's that's the way you could

01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:58.220
Jumpstart it. I don't think lack of info. I think actually the lack of info in lots of ways is actually a great advantage, right? I mean

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.780
Just in our own experience because we were a startup in 2016

01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:08.220
We just did everything better than the established parties did because we just you know use the cloud

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:12.140
We built all this stuff ourselves. We actually built had a proper tech team

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:13.980
um

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:17.180
Whereas as soon as we went in and we took over the conservative party

01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:22.540
We looked around the infrastructure there like the whole thing is just completely rotten and broken and doesn't work is like

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.460
um

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:28.540
A bit like central government. Actually, you know, like people think this is it can't possibly be true

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.540
But when I arrived in number 10

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:33.660
The prime minister of great britain

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:40.460
Has less access to a file sharing system that like a two person startup does

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:46.540
They can at least use google docs and like live edit the same document in different parts of the building or hotel

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:50.460
Or in different parts of the building the british prime minister could not do that

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.780
oh my god

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.860
in tony you mentioned at the beginning of this call how

01:27:55.180 --> 01:28:00.700
San Francisco has like an 11 billion dollar budget or something like that and 700 800 000 residents

01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:06.460
Do we know how that money is spent? Is that is that public and if so are you know, where is it spent?

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:13.020
I mean, I I assume it's public record. Um, I think the the correction is not like literally bags full of cash level of corruption

01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.820
It's the sort of todyism of there's all these ngos, right that are you know

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:21.820
ngos are basically church groups for people who think they're smarter than religion effectively

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:27.020
And so you have all these ngos and it's literally this gravy train in which they throw money at people who make the problems

01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:29.180
worse and

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.900
You know, I forget exactly how much aid you get as a homeless person

01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:35.020
I said, I think it hovers around eight eight hundred to nine hundred dollars a month

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:38.380
You basically get for free just showing up and so I mean one of the

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.100
Shocking not shocking things that if you actually talk to homeless people

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.660
And there's a few twitter accounts in which people go out and chat to almost people

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:45.500
Almost none of them are actually from san francisco

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:50.220
They come from abroad because they know they can get it basically get a free right here and here here's a quick

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:55.820
Here's a quick job interview question dominic if the aid for the homeless person is nine hundred dollars

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:59.820
What is the average fentanyl dose price in san francisco per day?

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:07.020
If you're if you show up if you wash up hopeless in san francisco and you're basically given

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:13.500
Um, you know a nine hundred dollars a month cash grant. What's the average cost of a fentanyl dose on the street?

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:17.660
I guess that's out right like it's basically like

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.780
20 30 dollars a day is what that's how

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:25.660
Because of course it is the markets in equilibrium

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.900
Right, of course it is so and so yeah, I mean, I assume this is all public record, eric

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:34.060
But it's like I don't know. I mean the taxes are incredibly another thing by the way is a shocking thing

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.460
Another random us eu

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.940
Observation because I I thought when I wrote cast monkeys

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:43.180
I actually moved to europe thinking I'd get canceled for other reasons for for writing like this tell all book

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:47.260
And so I like I spent time in barcelona and berlin and paris like checked out the startup scenes

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.700
I didn't go to london by the way

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:55.420
But it's like europe does everything right to get startups going like literally they'll take over entire buildings and give them the startups

01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:56.460
They'll have grants

01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:01.340
There's a lot of talent in europe like they do everything right and then like nothing happens startup wise in the united states

01:30:01.340 --> 01:30:06.220
They do literally everything wrong top to bottom and yet you they cannot stop producing

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:10.540
Which is incredible

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:15.580
But like there's so many taxes here like your your restaurant bill is marked up with some health mandate thing

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:20.140
Which isn't even a hard number the restaurant can just randomly mark shit up by like five or ten percent

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:26.620
Which is ridiculous and yeah, it's just there's there's so much loss and ridiculousness in california and yet here we are

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:29.500
I'm this i'm in san francisco

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:33.420
But to me the twitter is a good analogy where ilan could have started a new twitter

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:37.020
And we have friends who've tried to start a new twitter and it's it's very difficult network effects are very hard

01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:41.740
And it's it's much easier although still hard to take over existing twitter and similarly

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:46.460
I went to miami a couple years ago thinking that everybody would leave san francisco and also follow

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.820
And it turns out no matter how bad it gets people aren't leaving

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:56.220
And so it's probably a lot easier to move more people to miami to san francisco than to move people out of san francisco into

01:30:56.780 --> 01:31:00.620
Uh, some other city or some other country where you can get some deal with the government

01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:04.220
Like like like the whole technology state move network state movement is trying to do

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:11.260
So it sounds kind of like totally plausible, right? Like what what why but so quickly the obvious question like why hasn't this happened before?

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.460
Why hasn't it happened already people?

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.980
Well, hold on so it

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:19.900
I don't know who you're trying to move here

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:25.100
But so I mean san francisco. I was here for the first tech boom people should loads of people moved in san francisco

01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:27.580
Like it's still kind of dead like it is not recovered fully from covet

01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:31.740
But like circa 2011 the place you want it to be in the western world

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:37.180
Was within 10 blocks of where i'm sitting right now, which is where every consumer internet company was literally created

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:43.180
Right, like it was happening socially happening business wise. Everything was here. You felt like you were in the center of the world

01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:48.060
This is that's right. Yeah, this is happening. Yeah, too. So it can happen again. That's the opportunity

01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.620
It can happen

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:52.700
But the thing is that people people either stay and they put down roots and they get woke or they make a pile of money

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:56.300
And they leave that's it like no one actually invests in san francisco. That's the problem

01:31:57.020 --> 01:32:01.580
Yeah, it might be changing though. There's a rise in political consciousness in the last few years

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.220
Like I know entrepreneurs who are now getting into politics full time

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:11.500
um, because they see how how fucked things have gotten here and um, and there's there's like a ecosystem around it. Um

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.820
There's uh, there's it's high status now in a way that it wasn't a few years ago

01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:20.940
That's true. Things have changed a little bit, right? You can get twitter influenced by posting about san francisco politics in a way that

01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:23.180
You would never have done 10 years ago. Yeah

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:27.100
Solana built his whole his whole you know audience off his media company off that

01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:33.500
Um, if practical campaigns that you guys think like, you know, so-and-so is going to try and do something and they're a good guy

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:37.820
Then obviously like hook me up. I'll be happy to like look at you know, research

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:41.980
They're doing or ideas for messaging and stuff like that if I can help in some way

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.060
Cool

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:46.060
Yeah, we'll uh, we'll keep you posted

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.620
I don't know of anything at the moment outside of grosef

01:32:48.700 --> 01:32:52.300
But you're in that group chat and I don't think they're they're serious enough

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:53.660
um

01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:57.740
But I'd also be interested. So yeah, we're trying to create that conversation here in the podcast

01:32:57.740 --> 01:33:00.060
So let's uh, let's keep the conversation going

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:04.380
But when the next governor comes up, maybe we should try to find some like, um,

01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:09.180
legit celeb that we can work with to like the walk or someone to

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.740
become governor

01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.220
Yeah, totally. It's been it's been done before

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.020
We're on arrange it

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Rather mutant via like virus tryout place, right? So let's let's let's get the walk going in calif

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.900
Before we maybe move into the white house

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:31.660
Yeah, exactly. Um, also Dominic. Thanks so much for for coming on and we'll uh, continue the conversation

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.060
I just love you to talk
