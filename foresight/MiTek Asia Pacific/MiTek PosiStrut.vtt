00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome to another MiTeX Building Product Innovation, MiTeX Posistrut.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.800
One of MiTeX's most innovative and most versatile on-site building products is the Posistrut

00:13.800 --> 00:16.000
Roof and Floor Truss System.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.160
MiTeX Posistrut trusses are open webbed, parallel cord trusses that can be used to

00:21.160 --> 00:26.080
construct roofs, floors, even wall bracing panels.

00:26.080 --> 00:31.160
The secret to the popularity and versatility of Posistrut trusses can be found in their

00:31.160 --> 00:33.040
open web design.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.840
Their unique V-shaped steel web with integral teeth, combined with timber top and bottom

00:37.840 --> 00:43.400
cords result in long, strong, lightweight, parallel cord trusses.

00:43.400 --> 00:47.680
Posistrut's combine the strength of steel with the fixing and handling advantages of

00:47.680 --> 00:53.280
timber, plus the ready access they provide for services on-site is an extremely tangible

00:53.280 --> 00:56.840
advantage over solid beams or I-beams.

00:56.840 --> 01:02.160
Plumbing, electrical, even air conditioning ducting can all be installed with ease, making

01:02.160 --> 01:07.000
Posistrut trusses an on-site favourite with builders and trades alike.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.520
Each and every MiTeX Posistrut truss is engineered to meet the specific requirements of your

01:11.520 --> 01:17.480
roof or floor so you can be sure you're getting the right solution for every job.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.600
MiTeX Posistrut floor trusses are the perfect floor joist.

01:21.600 --> 01:26.640
When used with MiTeX's unique, load-sharing, strong back bracing system, Posistrut floor

01:26.640 --> 01:32.320
joists deliver a rigid floor structure that's straight and uniform.

01:32.320 --> 01:38.200
Another inherent advantage of Posistrut floor trusses is they can also be designed and manufactured

01:38.200 --> 01:40.080
for top cord support.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.560
This makes them quick to install and ideal for internal applications where space is at

01:44.560 --> 01:46.160
a premium.

01:46.160 --> 01:51.320
Trust top cord support is a much more practical, more rigid method of fixing than those adopted

01:51.320 --> 01:53.920
with I-beams or timber joists.

01:53.920 --> 01:59.400
Plus, costs are reduced because there's no need for expensive hangers or brackets.

01:59.400 --> 02:04.040
Wide parallel cords mean easier floor fixing and more stable trusses.

02:04.040 --> 02:09.280
It also enables the truss to be placed upright without the need for temporary bracing.

02:09.280 --> 02:14.800
MiTeX Posistrut trusses are manufactured to length so they are ready for immediate installation

02:14.800 --> 02:17.640
on-site, eliminating the need for trimming.

02:17.960 --> 02:24.680
There's none of the material wastage or extra labour on-site you get with timber joists or I-beams.

02:24.680 --> 02:30.240
MiTeX Posistrut trusses are extremely versatile in design and application.

02:30.240 --> 02:35.360
Flexible end shapes and bearing conditions ensure there's a Posistrut solution for almost

02:35.360 --> 02:36.840
any challenge.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.800
They can be designed to support upper load bearing walls, with their wide flanges giving

02:41.800 --> 02:44.720
floor sheathing even greater stiffness.

02:44.720 --> 02:49.640
Posistruts can be supported off top or bottom cords or in between.

02:49.640 --> 02:55.040
Trimable ends can be factored into the design for greater flexibility on-site.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.800
Posistruts can even be cogged into steel beams.

02:58.800 --> 03:03.840
Ribbon plate pocket ends offer yet another option for supporting upper walls.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.720
Concealed beam pockets can also be accommodated with ease.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.880
The advantages don't stop there though.

03:09.880 --> 03:16.440
With MiTeX Posistruts proving ideal for shower recesses and cantilevered balcony step-downs.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.880
These can all be incorporated into a Posistruts design and manufacture.

03:20.880 --> 03:21.920
The result?

03:21.920 --> 03:27.040
Less work for the builder on-site and quicker installation of your flooring solution.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.680
No more time consuming on-site packing for the builder.

03:30.680 --> 03:35.360
It's all done in the prefabrication plant ready to install.

03:35.360 --> 03:39.160
MiTeX Posistrut flooring cassettes.

03:39.160 --> 03:44.080
Many builders and developers, especially those working on large multi-story projects,

03:44.080 --> 03:47.400
are specifying Posistrut flooring cassettes.

03:47.400 --> 03:52.960
MiTeX Posistrut flooring cassettes replicate on-site construction in a factory.

03:52.960 --> 03:57.480
The floor is prefabricated off-site to all the relevant specifications.

03:57.480 --> 04:04.720
Plus it includes allowances or deflections, reactions, plumbing locations, void stacks,

04:04.760 --> 04:10.240
wastes and duct chases, and recessed wet areas all at the design stage.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.520
This ensures there are no interferences when installing on-site.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.440
The cassettes can be topped with just about any flooring surface.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.280
Most opt for particle board but products accommodating wet or dry areas can also be used.

04:24.280 --> 04:29.600
Posistrut flooring cassettes can utilize top-cord support for ease of installation.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.680
This means they can be craned into position on-site and fixed in minutes.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.080
The implications this has on-site are substantial,

04:38.080 --> 04:43.280
with more square metres of flooring laid by less labour in a lot less time.

04:43.280 --> 04:49.880
Storage on-site is minimised too, as the Posistrut flooring cassettes are installed on the same day as delivery.

04:49.880 --> 04:54.000
Plus, once installed and fitted, the cassettes can be walked on,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.800
a great advantage when working at heights.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.200
It also means the next part of the construction process can get underway straight away.

05:02.200 --> 05:08.800
MyTech Posistrut flooring cassettes save time on-site and speed up overall construction time dramatically,

05:08.800 --> 05:13.760
especially on large multi-residential and multi-story constructions.

05:13.760 --> 05:22.760
MyTech Posistrut flooring cassettes, the perfect solution for your next domestic, commercial or light industrial project.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.360
MyTech Posistrut roof trusses.

05:25.360 --> 05:30.520
MyTech Posistruts can be engineered and designed to suit almost any roof application,

05:30.560 --> 05:33.280
with clear spans up to 8 metres,

05:33.280 --> 05:40.800
allowing the architect to introduce some exciting dynamics into their designs and maximise internal dimensions.

05:40.800 --> 05:46.240
With open-planned areas now an integral part of today's domestic and commercial building designs,

05:46.240 --> 05:50.360
Posistruts are the logical choice as a roofing solution.

05:50.360 --> 05:56.360
Low-pitched flat roofs have also increased in popularity as owners seek the appeal of high ceilings,

05:56.360 --> 05:59.520
but are often hampered by building height restrictions.

05:59.520 --> 06:07.080
Height limitations can also be an issue with two-story homes where sloping sites make traditionally truss roofs not viable.

06:07.080 --> 06:12.280
Even cathedral ceilings can be easily accommodated with MyTech Posistruts.

06:12.280 --> 06:19.560
The outer-plane stiffness and wide flanges make Posistruts ideal as purlins and girts in a variety of applications.

06:19.560 --> 06:26.520
Further proof of the versatility of this ingenious prefabricated engineered building solution.

06:26.520 --> 06:30.600
MyTech Posistruts can be used as bracing elements in timber walls,

06:30.600 --> 06:35.440
particularly where large wall openings preclude the use of large bracing panels.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.920
Posibrace panels are prefabricated into the wall frame,

06:38.920 --> 06:46.160
eliminating the sometimes expensive and time-consuming nailing required for the fixing of plywood braced panels.

06:46.160 --> 06:51.720
MyTech Posibrace creates a rigid panel suitable for use in most timber-framed houses,

06:51.720 --> 06:55.960
multi-residential units and commercial projects.

06:55.960 --> 07:02.080
MyTech's Posistruts trusses have been readily adopted on-site because they are so user-friendly.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.120
They're easier to fix, easier to manoeuvre and easier for following trades.

07:07.120 --> 07:11.520
Their open web design makes them much lighter than solid timber beams,

07:11.520 --> 07:15.400
an advantage not lost on those who have to install them.

07:15.400 --> 07:18.040
With OH&S becoming more of an issue,

07:18.040 --> 07:25.240
any product that can reduce stress on workers both in the prefabrication plant and on-site is more than welcome.

07:25.280 --> 07:31.600
Lighter weight design invariably leads to safer handling and faster installation times,

07:31.600 --> 07:35.360
and time definitely relates to money on-site.

07:35.360 --> 07:39.360
Posistruts open web design provides excellent access for plumbing,

07:39.360 --> 07:42.520
electrical, heating and air-conditioning ducting.

07:42.520 --> 07:48.640
It avoids the need for cutting holes through solid timber joists and risking reducing their strength,

07:48.640 --> 07:55.040
possibly even their structural integrity or building expensive bulkheads to accommodate other services.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.800
Plus, the ensuing rectification work can prove expensive.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.520
With MyTech Posistruts, it's not even an issue.

08:02.520 --> 08:08.080
Services are installed simply and quickly, adding to on-site time saving.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.200
MyTech Posistruts aren't just great floor and roof joists,

08:12.200 --> 08:16.360
they also deliver practical advantages and creative solutions

08:16.360 --> 08:19.440
with everything from posistrut flooring cassettes,

08:19.440 --> 08:24.480
step-downs for shower recesses, cantilevered balconies and more.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.880
Freedom of design, right through to time, labour and cost savings on-site,

08:29.880 --> 08:37.920
make Posistruts trusses the perfect solution for your next domestic, commercial or light industrial project.

08:37.920 --> 08:42.400
MyTech Australia, creating the advantage.
