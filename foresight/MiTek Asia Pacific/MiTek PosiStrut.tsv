0	8000	Welcome to another MiTeX Building Product Innovation, MiTeX Posistrut.
8000	13800	One of MiTeX's most innovative and most versatile on-site building products is the Posistrut
13800	16000	Roof and Floor Truss System.
16000	21160	MiTeX Posistrut trusses are open webbed, parallel cord trusses that can be used to
21160	26080	construct roofs, floors, even wall bracing panels.
26080	31160	The secret to the popularity and versatility of Posistrut trusses can be found in their
31160	33040	open web design.
33040	37840	Their unique V-shaped steel web with integral teeth, combined with timber top and bottom
37840	43400	cords result in long, strong, lightweight, parallel cord trusses.
43400	47680	Posistrut's combine the strength of steel with the fixing and handling advantages of
47680	53280	timber, plus the ready access they provide for services on-site is an extremely tangible
53280	56840	advantage over solid beams or I-beams.
56840	62160	Plumbing, electrical, even air conditioning ducting can all be installed with ease, making
62160	67000	Posistrut trusses an on-site favourite with builders and trades alike.
67000	71520	Each and every MiTeX Posistrut truss is engineered to meet the specific requirements of your
71520	77480	roof or floor so you can be sure you're getting the right solution for every job.
77480	81600	MiTeX Posistrut floor trusses are the perfect floor joist.
81600	86640	When used with MiTeX's unique, load-sharing, strong back bracing system, Posistrut floor
86640	92320	joists deliver a rigid floor structure that's straight and uniform.
92320	98200	Another inherent advantage of Posistrut floor trusses is they can also be designed and manufactured
98200	100080	for top cord support.
100080	104560	This makes them quick to install and ideal for internal applications where space is at
104560	106160	a premium.
106160	111320	Trust top cord support is a much more practical, more rigid method of fixing than those adopted
111320	113920	with I-beams or timber joists.
113920	119400	Plus, costs are reduced because there's no need for expensive hangers or brackets.
119400	124040	Wide parallel cords mean easier floor fixing and more stable trusses.
124040	129280	It also enables the truss to be placed upright without the need for temporary bracing.
129280	134800	MiTeX Posistrut trusses are manufactured to length so they are ready for immediate installation
134800	137640	on-site, eliminating the need for trimming.
137960	144680	There's none of the material wastage or extra labour on-site you get with timber joists or I-beams.
144680	150240	MiTeX Posistrut trusses are extremely versatile in design and application.
150240	155360	Flexible end shapes and bearing conditions ensure there's a Posistrut solution for almost
155360	156840	any challenge.
156840	161800	They can be designed to support upper load bearing walls, with their wide flanges giving
161800	164720	floor sheathing even greater stiffness.
164720	169640	Posistruts can be supported off top or bottom cords or in between.
169640	175040	Trimable ends can be factored into the design for greater flexibility on-site.
175040	178800	Posistruts can even be cogged into steel beams.
178800	183840	Ribbon plate pocket ends offer yet another option for supporting upper walls.
183840	187720	Concealed beam pockets can also be accommodated with ease.
187720	189880	The advantages don't stop there though.
189880	196440	With MiTeX Posistruts proving ideal for shower recesses and cantilevered balcony step-downs.
196440	200880	These can all be incorporated into a Posistruts design and manufacture.
200880	201920	The result?
201920	207040	Less work for the builder on-site and quicker installation of your flooring solution.
207040	210680	No more time consuming on-site packing for the builder.
210680	215360	It's all done in the prefabrication plant ready to install.
215360	219160	MiTeX Posistrut flooring cassettes.
219160	224080	Many builders and developers, especially those working on large multi-story projects,
224080	227400	are specifying Posistrut flooring cassettes.
227400	232960	MiTeX Posistrut flooring cassettes replicate on-site construction in a factory.
232960	237480	The floor is prefabricated off-site to all the relevant specifications.
237480	244720	Plus it includes allowances or deflections, reactions, plumbing locations, void stacks,
244760	250240	wastes and duct chases, and recessed wet areas all at the design stage.
250240	254520	This ensures there are no interferences when installing on-site.
254520	258440	The cassettes can be topped with just about any flooring surface.
258440	264280	Most opt for particle board but products accommodating wet or dry areas can also be used.
264280	269600	Posistrut flooring cassettes can utilize top-cord support for ease of installation.
269600	274680	This means they can be craned into position on-site and fixed in minutes.
274680	278080	The implications this has on-site are substantial,
278080	283280	with more square metres of flooring laid by less labour in a lot less time.
283280	289880	Storage on-site is minimised too, as the Posistrut flooring cassettes are installed on the same day as delivery.
289880	294000	Plus, once installed and fitted, the cassettes can be walked on,
294000	296800	a great advantage when working at heights.
296800	302200	It also means the next part of the construction process can get underway straight away.
302200	308800	MyTech Posistrut flooring cassettes save time on-site and speed up overall construction time dramatically,
308800	313760	especially on large multi-residential and multi-story constructions.
313760	322760	MyTech Posistrut flooring cassettes, the perfect solution for your next domestic, commercial or light industrial project.
322760	325360	MyTech Posistrut roof trusses.
325360	330520	MyTech Posistruts can be engineered and designed to suit almost any roof application,
330560	333280	with clear spans up to 8 metres,
333280	340800	allowing the architect to introduce some exciting dynamics into their designs and maximise internal dimensions.
340800	346240	With open-planned areas now an integral part of today's domestic and commercial building designs,
346240	350360	Posistruts are the logical choice as a roofing solution.
350360	356360	Low-pitched flat roofs have also increased in popularity as owners seek the appeal of high ceilings,
356360	359520	but are often hampered by building height restrictions.
359520	367080	Height limitations can also be an issue with two-story homes where sloping sites make traditionally truss roofs not viable.
367080	372280	Even cathedral ceilings can be easily accommodated with MyTech Posistruts.
372280	379560	The outer-plane stiffness and wide flanges make Posistruts ideal as purlins and girts in a variety of applications.
379560	386520	Further proof of the versatility of this ingenious prefabricated engineered building solution.
386520	390600	MyTech Posistruts can be used as bracing elements in timber walls,
390600	395440	particularly where large wall openings preclude the use of large bracing panels.
395440	398920	Posibrace panels are prefabricated into the wall frame,
398920	406160	eliminating the sometimes expensive and time-consuming nailing required for the fixing of plywood braced panels.
406160	411720	MyTech Posibrace creates a rigid panel suitable for use in most timber-framed houses,
411720	415960	multi-residential units and commercial projects.
415960	422080	MyTech's Posistruts trusses have been readily adopted on-site because they are so user-friendly.
422080	427120	They're easier to fix, easier to manoeuvre and easier for following trades.
427120	431520	Their open web design makes them much lighter than solid timber beams,
431520	435400	an advantage not lost on those who have to install them.
435400	438040	With OH&S becoming more of an issue,
438040	445240	any product that can reduce stress on workers both in the prefabrication plant and on-site is more than welcome.
445280	451600	Lighter weight design invariably leads to safer handling and faster installation times,
451600	455360	and time definitely relates to money on-site.
455360	459360	Posistruts open web design provides excellent access for plumbing,
459360	462520	electrical, heating and air-conditioning ducting.
462520	468640	It avoids the need for cutting holes through solid timber joists and risking reducing their strength,
468640	475040	possibly even their structural integrity or building expensive bulkheads to accommodate other services.
475040	478800	Plus, the ensuing rectification work can prove expensive.
478800	482520	With MyTech Posistruts, it's not even an issue.
482520	488080	Services are installed simply and quickly, adding to on-site time saving.
488080	492200	MyTech Posistruts aren't just great floor and roof joists,
492200	496360	they also deliver practical advantages and creative solutions
496360	499440	with everything from posistrut flooring cassettes,
499440	504480	step-downs for shower recesses, cantilevered balconies and more.
504480	509880	Freedom of design, right through to time, labour and cost savings on-site,
509880	517920	make Posistruts trusses the perfect solution for your next domestic, commercial or light industrial project.
517920	522400	MyTech Australia, creating the advantage.
