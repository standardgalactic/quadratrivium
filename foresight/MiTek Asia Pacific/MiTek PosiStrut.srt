00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome to another MiTeX Building Product Innovation, MiTeX Posistrut.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,800
One of MiTeX's most innovative and most versatile on-site building products is the Posistrut

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
Roof and Floor Truss System.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,160
MiTeX Posistrut trusses are open webbed, parallel cord trusses that can be used to

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,080
construct roofs, floors, even wall bracing panels.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,160
The secret to the popularity and versatility of Posistrut trusses can be found in their

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,040
open web design.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,840
Their unique V-shaped steel web with integral teeth, combined with timber top and bottom

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,400
cords result in long, strong, lightweight, parallel cord trusses.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,680
Posistrut's combine the strength of steel with the fixing and handling advantages of

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,280
timber, plus the ready access they provide for services on-site is an extremely tangible

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,840
advantage over solid beams or I-beams.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,160
Plumbing, electrical, even air conditioning ducting can all be installed with ease, making

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,000
Posistrut trusses an on-site favourite with builders and trades alike.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,520
Each and every MiTeX Posistrut truss is engineered to meet the specific requirements of your

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,480
roof or floor so you can be sure you're getting the right solution for every job.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,600
MiTeX Posistrut floor trusses are the perfect floor joist.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,640
When used with MiTeX's unique, load-sharing, strong back bracing system, Posistrut floor

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,320
joists deliver a rigid floor structure that's straight and uniform.

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,200
Another inherent advantage of Posistrut floor trusses is they can also be designed and manufactured

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,080
for top cord support.

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,560
This makes them quick to install and ideal for internal applications where space is at

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,160
a premium.

24
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,320
Trust top cord support is a much more practical, more rigid method of fixing than those adopted

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,920
with I-beams or timber joists.

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,400
Plus, costs are reduced because there's no need for expensive hangers or brackets.

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,040
Wide parallel cords mean easier floor fixing and more stable trusses.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,280
It also enables the truss to be placed upright without the need for temporary bracing.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,800
MiTeX Posistrut trusses are manufactured to length so they are ready for immediate installation

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,640
on-site, eliminating the need for trimming.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:24,680
There's none of the material wastage or extra labour on-site you get with timber joists or I-beams.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,240
MiTeX Posistrut trusses are extremely versatile in design and application.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,360
Flexible end shapes and bearing conditions ensure there's a Posistrut solution for almost

34
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,840
any challenge.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,800
They can be designed to support upper load bearing walls, with their wide flanges giving

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,720
floor sheathing even greater stiffness.

37
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,640
Posistruts can be supported off top or bottom cords or in between.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,040
Trimable ends can be factored into the design for greater flexibility on-site.

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,800
Posistruts can even be cogged into steel beams.

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,840
Ribbon plate pocket ends offer yet another option for supporting upper walls.

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,720
Concealed beam pockets can also be accommodated with ease.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,880
The advantages don't stop there though.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,440
With MiTeX Posistruts proving ideal for shower recesses and cantilevered balcony step-downs.

44
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,880
These can all be incorporated into a Posistruts design and manufacture.

45
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,920
The result?

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040
Less work for the builder on-site and quicker installation of your flooring solution.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,680
No more time consuming on-site packing for the builder.

48
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,360
It's all done in the prefabrication plant ready to install.

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,160
MiTeX Posistrut flooring cassettes.

50
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,080
Many builders and developers, especially those working on large multi-story projects,

51
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,400
are specifying Posistrut flooring cassettes.

52
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,960
MiTeX Posistrut flooring cassettes replicate on-site construction in a factory.

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,480
The floor is prefabricated off-site to all the relevant specifications.

54
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:04,720
Plus it includes allowances or deflections, reactions, plumbing locations, void stacks,

55
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,240
wastes and duct chases, and recessed wet areas all at the design stage.

56
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,520
This ensures there are no interferences when installing on-site.

57
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,440
The cassettes can be topped with just about any flooring surface.

58
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,280
Most opt for particle board but products accommodating wet or dry areas can also be used.

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,600
Posistrut flooring cassettes can utilize top-cord support for ease of installation.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,680
This means they can be craned into position on-site and fixed in minutes.

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,080
The implications this has on-site are substantial,

62
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,280
with more square metres of flooring laid by less labour in a lot less time.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,880
Storage on-site is minimised too, as the Posistrut flooring cassettes are installed on the same day as delivery.

64
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,000
Plus, once installed and fitted, the cassettes can be walked on,

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,800
a great advantage when working at heights.

66
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,200
It also means the next part of the construction process can get underway straight away.

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,800
MyTech Posistrut flooring cassettes save time on-site and speed up overall construction time dramatically,

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,760
especially on large multi-residential and multi-story constructions.

69
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:22,760
MyTech Posistrut flooring cassettes, the perfect solution for your next domestic, commercial or light industrial project.

70
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,360
MyTech Posistrut roof trusses.

71
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,520
MyTech Posistruts can be engineered and designed to suit almost any roof application,

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,280
with clear spans up to 8 metres,

73
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,800
allowing the architect to introduce some exciting dynamics into their designs and maximise internal dimensions.

74
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,240
With open-planned areas now an integral part of today's domestic and commercial building designs,

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,360
Posistruts are the logical choice as a roofing solution.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Low-pitched flat roofs have also increased in popularity as owners seek the appeal of high ceilings,

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,520
but are often hampered by building height restrictions.

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,080
Height limitations can also be an issue with two-story homes where sloping sites make traditionally truss roofs not viable.

79
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Even cathedral ceilings can be easily accommodated with MyTech Posistruts.

80
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,560
The outer-plane stiffness and wide flanges make Posistruts ideal as purlins and girts in a variety of applications.

81
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,520
Further proof of the versatility of this ingenious prefabricated engineered building solution.

82
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,600
MyTech Posistruts can be used as bracing elements in timber walls,

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,440
particularly where large wall openings preclude the use of large bracing panels.

84
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,920
Posibrace panels are prefabricated into the wall frame,

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:46,160
eliminating the sometimes expensive and time-consuming nailing required for the fixing of plywood braced panels.

86
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,720
MyTech Posibrace creates a rigid panel suitable for use in most timber-framed houses,

87
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,960
multi-residential units and commercial projects.

88
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,080
MyTech's Posistruts trusses have been readily adopted on-site because they are so user-friendly.

89
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,120
They're easier to fix, easier to manoeuvre and easier for following trades.

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,520
Their open web design makes them much lighter than solid timber beams,

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,400
an advantage not lost on those who have to install them.

92
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,040
With OH&S becoming more of an issue,

93
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:25,240
any product that can reduce stress on workers both in the prefabrication plant and on-site is more than welcome.

94
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,600
Lighter weight design invariably leads to safer handling and faster installation times,

95
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,360
and time definitely relates to money on-site.

96
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Posistruts open web design provides excellent access for plumbing,

97
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,520
electrical, heating and air-conditioning ducting.

98
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,640
It avoids the need for cutting holes through solid timber joists and risking reducing their strength,

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,040
possibly even their structural integrity or building expensive bulkheads to accommodate other services.

100
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,800
Plus, the ensuing rectification work can prove expensive.

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,520
With MyTech Posistruts, it's not even an issue.

102
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,080
Services are installed simply and quickly, adding to on-site time saving.

103
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,200
MyTech Posistruts aren't just great floor and roof joists,

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,360
they also deliver practical advantages and creative solutions

105
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,440
with everything from posistrut flooring cassettes,

106
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,480
step-downs for shower recesses, cantilevered balconies and more.

107
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,880
Freedom of design, right through to time, labour and cost savings on-site,

108
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,920
make Posistruts trusses the perfect solution for your next domestic, commercial or light industrial project.

109
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,400
MyTech Australia, creating the advantage.
