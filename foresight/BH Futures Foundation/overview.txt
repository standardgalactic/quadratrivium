Checking BH Futures Foundation/Futures Webinar Seriesï¼š Building Artificial General Intelligence - Peter Morgan.txt
1. **AI in Drug Design**: AI is currently accelerating drug discovery by exploring chemical and molecular dynamic spaces faster than traditional manual methods. Deep learning has shown promise in this area, as seen in the DeepMind success at the recent protein folding competition.

2. **Inspirational Media**: Science fiction books and media have been a significant source of inspiration for many professionals in science and technology. Classic authors like Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke are often cited as foundational influences. Modern science fiction also contributes to the imagination and innovation in these fields.

3. **AI Ethics and Laws**: The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will require careful consideration of ethics and law. There will likely be both good and bad actors when it comes to AGI, necessitating the implementation of laws and potentially a 'police' system to oversee its use and prevent misuse or abuse.

4. **Impact on Religion**: With sentient beings emerging from AI, there is potential for them to develop their own religious beliefs and practices. This suggests that AI could affect religions as it will introduce new forms of intelligence capable of engaging with spiritual and religious concepts.

5. **Collaboration and Future Interaction**: The speaker expressed a willingness to collaborate again with the organization hosting the event, indicating a desire for ongoing dialogue and exchange of ideas.

In summary, the presentation highlighted the positive impact of AI in drug discovery, the inspirational role of science fiction in shaping futures in technology, the ethical considerations necessary for the development of AGI, and the potential cultural implications of AI sentience, including its interaction with religious beliefs. The event concluded with a call for continued collaboration and dialogue in the field.
