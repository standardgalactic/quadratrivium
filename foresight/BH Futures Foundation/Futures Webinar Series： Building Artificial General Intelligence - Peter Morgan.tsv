0	16000	Okay, good evening everyone and welcome to Future's webinar series by BH Future's Foundation.
16000	18800	I am Ivana Yevtovich, webinar coordinator.
18800	25200	Tonight we will hear about artificial intelligence, the development of artificial general intelligence
25200	31280	is going to require algorithms that can do things like inductive reasoning, planning and optimal
31280	37760	learning from limited amounts of data. Several efforts are underway to develop these technologies
38560	44640	for deployment in future systems. We are currently witnessing these new approaches being given more
44640	50400	and more attention as we enter the new and perhaps golden age of artificial general intelligence.
51040	57440	In this talk we will present some of the newer more general approaches to solving intelligence
57440	64320	that are really currently under development with the view to deployment in the intelligence system
64320	71360	of the future. Tonight's speaker is our guest Peter Morgan. Peter is author of the popular report
71360	78320	Machine Learning is changing the rules, ways businesses can utilize artificial intelligence
78400	84400	to innovate. Published by O'Reilly, he's passionate about artificial intelligence and the positive
84400	92480	changes in this technology can and is bringing to society. Peter founded the artificial intelligence
92480	98480	consult company, Deep Learning Partnership to carry out his mission of helping to bring artificial
98480	105200	intelligence to the world. He advises and mentors technology startups and is a speaker at artificial
105200	110960	intelligence conferences and meetups. Peter founded the popular London Deep Learning Lab
110960	115920	Meetup. Links for the mentioned companies are listed down below so you can check it out.
116720	120800	Peter, it's an honor to have you here tonight and thank you so much for being with us.
121840	130800	Thanks Havana. Okay, so let's get started. So Havana just introduced me and there is a data
130800	139600	science conference on the 2nd of July at Croatia that I'll just put a little shout out now for.
139600	146080	So if you want to look out for that, tune in for that as well. Okay, so there's a little
146080	155680	book I wrote that Havana mentioned on a practical book on implementing machine learning in real
156240	163680	deployment for companies. That's what I do for living. I'm a consultant, machine learning consultant.
163680	169040	Today's talk is going to be a little more futuristic in that there are no actual deployments yet
170480	178960	but it's a look towards the future where we are now, where we want to get to and how we will get there.
179200	186720	So here's an outline of my talk. What is intelligence? Let's start off with the basic
186720	195120	question we're trying to solve and then look at how the world produces intelligent systems,
195120	199520	either biological or non-biological. We're trying to non-biological route here.
200880	205280	We are the biological, humans are the most intelligent thing that we know of in the
205280	212560	universe so far, although at times it doesn't seem like it, right? And I'll do a very quick recap
212560	222080	of deep learning and just to see if that's part of the journey or not, if it's a dead end or if
222080	227680	that's a step along the way to artificial general intelligence. And hopefully everybody's at that
227680	232000	kind of level, you've heard of deep learning, machine learning, that will probably help understand
232000	236400	the talk but even if you don't it, it doesn't really matter. This is a fairly general talk high
236400	244800	level. And then we'll look at AGI or artificial general intelligence and we'll see maybe how we
244800	249920	might build such a system or if it's possible and then if it is how we might build it and we'll
249920	259600	wrap up. So my talk will be about 40 minutes long and so let's get into it. So I mean why do we even
259600	265840	want to build general intelligence? Well the idea is, and you may have heard DeepMind say that,
265840	271760	it's a company based here in London under the Google umbrella these days, because then we'll
271760	276960	build intelligence and use it to solve everything else, right? That's the big goal, that's the vision.
278400	283520	So at the moment, like I say, we're the most intelligent things around so we're solving
283520	292720	all scientific problems, medicine, climate change, just every problem right now, humans are tackling it
293280	299280	as we have been doing from the beginning of time. So it's a big vision, right, is to build systems
299280	305360	that can basically supersede us and accelerate science. Isn't that an amazing goal, right?
305360	310400	Isn't that an amazing achievement if we could do that? Clearly, it's worth a lot of money so
310400	316480	everyone's working on it, Microsoft, Google, a lot of bunch of startups. So let's see where we are on
316480	322480	that journey. Okay, now first thing I'll mention is that people do get a little bit worried, oh my
322480	326880	god, what happens when, you know, we're no longer the most intelligent things. That's a rather
326880	331040	philosophical question and there's a lot of debate and books been written about that. It's a very hot
331040	336000	topic at the moment. It comes under the umbrella of AI safety and so if you want to look into that,
336800	340640	you know, I encourage you to do that, but we'll focus on the engineering and this talk and the
340640	346720	science. Okay, we'll leave the philosophical problems to the philosophers, I'm afraid,
346720	352480	or that that's a topic for another talk, which I could give too, but I won't on this one. So
353440	358960	again, you know, what is intelligence? Is it, you know, beating go? Is it, you know, winning
358960	364640	at Starcraft, you know, beating the best, go play at the best players in all of these games,
364640	371360	basically, go Starcraft, chess, Jeopardy. Well, as amazing achievements as all of those were,
371360	376640	like breathtaking, you know, when it happened at the moment, I remember, you know, watching
376640	381280	all of them actually and just, you know, put my breath away. But no, it's not actually general
381280	385680	intelligence. Those are examples of very narrow intelligence and pressure as they may be,
386640	395600	because the system, the clever system that beat Gary Gatt, Casper Robert, chess, it can't,
396720	401360	you know, beat Lisa Doll that go, it's essentially dumb outside of its very narrow domain,
402080	406560	in which it's superhuman intelligence. Okay, so they're not generally intelligent machine systems.
408000	412880	Okay, so they're all examples of narrow AI. So what is intelligence? Well,
413840	419680	Howard Gardner at Harvard, a couple of decades ago, you know, it seems so obvious now,
419680	423520	but at the time, you know, no one had kind of thought about this or written it down,
423520	430800	which I, you know, it's one of those things. But he did, and I like it because it sort of says
430800	435120	there's about nine different components to intelligence, right? So, you know, the go,
435120	440560	the chess, that's a logical mathematical component that's superhuman at the moment.
440560	447200	I mean, a calculator that we can buy for five bucks or whatever, you know, can do long multiplication,
447760	453360	you know, far faster than we can. Okay, so there's clearly superhuman in that domain.
453360	459360	But what about the others? Musical, nature, spatial, you know, robots maneuvering, navigating
459360	464480	through space, time, self-driving cars, that kind of thing. Intrapersonal, now these are the harder
464480	470480	ones, aren't they? The personal intelligence, social intelligence, and intro knowing ourselves,
470480	475760	and then enter knowing about others. Okay, so that those are probably, you know, the most
475760	482080	challenging thing. And the was that, you know, people say, you know, a lot of skeptics know,
482080	485760	will never have, you know, be able to build systems like that. Well, I'm going to argue,
485760	491280	there's nothing in physics, laws of physics that says we can't. And clearly, biology has done it,
491280	496720	right? And so that's, we're a physical system. There are people, and, you know, it's fine,
496720	502160	80% of the world believes in some religion, that's fine too. But I would argue that,
502880	507360	you know, once you get the right physical systems that, you know, they will be capable,
507360	512560	have the capacity of, you know, believing in higher powers and stuff like that too. So, you know,
512560	517120	there's all these philosophical questions come up as well. But they can be, you know, I will try to
517120	521520	reason to scientific questions, engineering questions. There's linguistic language,
522240	529120	natural language processing, translation, you know, Siri, Google translate, you know, these are
529120	534960	amazing systems, but they're not quite there yet. They're not quite superhuman. Go is, you know,
534960	541200	calculators are, but, you know, all of these are the types of intelligence we are working on. Okay,
541200	545680	we're not there yet. We're not human level intelligence, but we're certainly working on them.
545680	554400	You know, the bodily kinesthetic, you know, you watch, is it Atlas, the Boston Robotics,
554400	558960	Boston Dynamics, whatever they're called company, you know, doing flips now, you know,
558960	563920	like a gymnast. So we're making a lot of progress on many of the, on most, on all of them, actually.
564560	569040	And it's essentially, why are we here? You can imagine a robot sitting there going, hmm,
569040	573520	why am I here? You know, that's how we'll know we've got to learn intelligence, probably.
574480	579760	And there's a nice beautiful picture of one right there. And so how far have we come?
580480	585520	I've covered all these, you know, we've got the calculation, but they're not creative. We have
585520	591360	to tell them what to do. These systems, they're not self aware. They don't have subjective
591360	598560	experience. So the existential down the bottom is zero. They don't ponder, you know, as far as I
598560	604240	know, my laptop's not wondering, you know, why it's here. Maybe, maybe it is. And just not telling
604240	612320	me, but I don't think so. Okay, so, um, so how will we get to AGI then? Well, it will take a village
612320	619120	to create, you know, it takes a village to create a child. The well known saying in psychology will
619120	624080	the same thing. It's going to take a village to create artificial general intelligence. And in that
624080	629680	village will basically comprise of computer scientists, physicists, neuroscientists, of course,
629680	635680	because we are the example and colleges, sociologists. So general intelligence is general,
635680	640960	right? We're trying to, you know, basically build human liberal intelligence and then suppress it.
640960	645680	So it's going to take, not just computer scientists set in sight of Google anymore, it's
645680	652480	going to take physicists and neuroscientists and psychologists. No doubt, you know, Microsoft,
652480	660400	Google, they have teams like this in place. Okay, so it's a little early, they don't talk about it,
660400	666560	but yeah, but people are working on this stuff right now. So we'll have a look at some of the
666560	673040	efforts and some of the history and some of the future of that, which is what this talks about.
673040	680560	Okay, so physical systems, what have we got? So we've got biological, you know, I can argue that
680640	687600	plants, bacteria, insects, mammals, us, we're all natures full of, you know, intelligent systems.
687600	693680	How many species are there? You know, absolutely millions. And, you know, locus is intelligent,
693680	701600	it's adapted to its environment. You know, it can overcome and reproduce. It doesn't really
701600	707360	make goals and accomplish them, though. It doesn't consciously do that. You know, mammals are the
707360	713440	only things that do that. And so there are various levels of intelligence, too. So we're trying to
713440	720640	build the human level intelligence, the mammalian intelligence. And, you know, perhaps we'll start
720640	726960	off with an ape intelligence and then, you know, progress to human level and then superhuman. So
726960	733120	that's where we are. And so what are we, what, physically, what do we have? We have CPUs,
733120	740320	processors, we have GPUs, FPGA, ASICs. And we also, those are all digital, examples of digital
740960	747760	processing systems, okay. And those of you who have done a computer science degree or
747760	751680	electrical engineering degree, you'll be familiar with all of those. And then we have
751680	758640	something called neuromorphic, which is, which processes based on biology, okay. And those are
758640	764880	very interesting. Those exist today. And they're quite large as well. We're up to about a billion
765680	772560	neurons, okay, artificial neurons. And that's like a mouse. So we could argue we have mouse level
772560	779840	intelligence today. And we'll see a little bit of that later on. And so that's exciting. Digital,
779840	784960	it's always going to be an emulation neuromorphic, it's going to be more of a direct simulation,
784960	788560	okay. So there's the difference between an emulation, which is something that you run on
788560	795360	a digital processor and an emulation, which is an actual physical or simulation rather,
795360	801120	which is an actual simulation of the actual physical system, which is the brain. So neuromorphic,
801120	805600	we can do simulations, we can run it on real time, just like the brain or artificial neurons,
806160	813120	all the rest, emulations on digital processors, which actually takes a lot more energy and time.
813120	820240	It's, it's not, you know, we can get there, but it's, it's just, it's not a direct way of getting
820240	824720	there, whereas neuromorphic is. And then we have quantum. Is there any, is quantum
825680	829680	processors, you've all, we've all heard of quantum computing nowadays is catching the news.
829680	836640	Is that a part of the journey or not? We don't know, maybe the brain uses quantum physics
836640	841200	at the level of microtubules. Roger Penrose would argue it does,
842320	848240	who's to argue with him, he's very clever physicist there in Oxford. But, you know,
849920	855520	the fact is, you know, we don't know. Okay, so we'll look at it, we'll look a little bit
855520	859520	deeper into all of those and then we'll wrap up at the end and I'll tell you where we are today.
860160	867520	So biology is what I mentioned from the lowest little, you know, single celled amoeba to the,
868320	875120	you know, C. elegans, that little worm there with 137 neurons. We can count them. We built
875120	880640	that system actually. So we can actually, we built that little guy there. B, we haven't built.
880640	885840	That's got about a million neurons and that tiny little brain there. It's a little nervous
885840	890080	system, central nervous system. And then the human brain, that's a hundred billion neurons that,
890080	894240	you know, that's clearly a tough one to crack. That's what we're trying to go.
895520	902640	So a little bit of the big picture, you know, the brain is a system at what level do we attack this
902640	908000	on? Do we attack it at the level of atoms and molecules like, you know, Roger Penrose is doing,
908000	914240	that's where the quantum physics is after all. Or do we start at synapses? Or do we start,
914240	921120	you know, at a collection of neurons and synapses like the Kinectome? Is that a better level to
921120	925600	start? Or do we have to start right down at the molecular level? So these are very fundamental
925600	930560	questions that need to be sort of asked and experimented with some pro. This is a science. So,
930560	934480	you know, there's theory, but there's also experiment and test ideas out.
937120	942160	If we just start at the neuron, this is what we have to build. Now that's a very complex system,
942160	946800	right? But this is quite wonderful because this is how nature does intelligence. Like who were
946800	953440	the guests, right? We needed such a complex thing to come up with conscious creatures,
953440	957920	you know, like ourselves. I mean, this is very fundamental, you know, it's a neuron
957920	965440	of intelligence, one could argue. Now, do we have to actually recreate that? Or can we do it some
965440	972320	other way? Okay, that's, that's a very good question. Clearly, if we could just reproduce,
972320	977920	we would just be recreating nature, right? So a lot of this is these artificial neurons are not
977920	984960	this complex, the simplified versions. Can they, you know, can that give rise to consciousness?
984960	991520	Yeah, we don't know yet. Okay, so clearly, it's a tough problem. So it'd be a tough engineering
991520	998400	problem to build something like that. Okay, so the next level up really is, you know, we have
998400	1003200	about 2 million cortical columns made up of these neurons in the brain, there's 100 billion neurons,
1003200	1010240	so you do the math, and you see, you know, there's 10,000 neurons per cortical column or something
1010240	1016080	like that, maybe 50,000. So, but there's basically 2 million, maybe these are the fundamental units,
1016080	1022640	maybe this is, if we build 2 million of these, this, this is all we'd need to do to build consciousness
1022640	1028000	and human level intelligence. So, I mean, neuroscience, as a science has been around
1028000	1032880	150 years, I mean, a lot of progress has been made in understanding the brain, right, with the
1032880	1038960	hippocampus, all those different parts. And so, you know, we know a heck of a lot actually about
1038960	1043840	intelligence, biological intelligence. So, you know, the question we've got to ask ourselves is,
1043840	1047280	you know, what level do we start at, what level is needed, and then how do we build,
1047280	1052800	is a lot of this comes down to an engineering problem. So, there's a connectome, there's a
1052800	1059520	next level up. So, we started with neuron, next level up, these cortical columns in the slightly
1059520	1064480	high level, we mentioned earlier, the connectome. And so, that's, you know, from one side of the
1064480	1072880	brain to the other, you know, our emotions, you know, creativity, poetry, painting, you know,
1073600	1080560	sculpture, engineering structures, you know, is this, you know, is this the level it's kind of
1080560	1085680	happening at, you know, or does it happen at cortical column or the neuron, you know, or can
1085680	1091040	we just start here, the kind of bigger conceptual. So, these are good questions. These are all good
1091040	1097840	engineering questions. And then, of course, you know, if we want to embody this stuff, not just
1097840	1101920	have it running in our laptop or data, we need to, you know, we'll need a central nervous system,
1101920	1106400	basically. So, if we're going to build robots like Atlas, you know, we're going to have to connect,
1106400	1115040	you know, CPU, but it also reaches out in a very complex central nervous system as well.
1115840	1121440	The beautiful thing, nature, you know, we've been, the Earth's been here 4.5 billion years,
1121440	1126880	first life was about a billion years ago, that single cell protozoa, you know, so we've had about
1126960	1133600	a billion years to develop this, you know, evolution, dead end, branching, 99% of species
1133600	1140160	are extinct. You know, evolution just tries everything, okay, the laws of physical try
1140160	1145600	everything, intelligent, you know, survivor, the fittest, the things that are well adapted to the
1145600	1154160	environment, they get to survive. And, you know, over time, you know, what was it a million years
1154160	1159440	ago, the Neanderthal, and then they developed a bigger neocortex, which enabled them to think a
1159440	1165440	bit better than the next type of ape. And all the rest kind of basically went extinct, right? So,
1165440	1174880	we want homo sapiens, and we don't, you know, trying to build ourselves, okay, replicate nature.
1174880	1182800	So, and then the last level up is social systems. So, you know, if we build a, you know, a few robots,
1182800	1188320	they've got to get on. You know, we have our social systems, you know, we're a lot more peaceful,
1188320	1193520	maybe than we used to be. We still have the capacity to go to war, but maybe there's less war.
1194320	1200400	So, you know, we want to build these higher level structure, hierarchy, societal structures, okay.
1201360	1206800	And two side people say utopia, dystopia, what's it going to be? Are we going to all get along
1206800	1210800	these super intelligent machines? Are they going to show us how to live in harmony and,
1210800	1215040	you know, solve science and cancer and everything? Or are they going to be like the terminator and
1215040	1219840	come and just get it, wipe us out? Because they see us as kind of destructive and kind of stupid
1219840	1228800	in a way, okay. Good philosophical questions, right? So, we're not there yet. So, but one day
1228800	1237920	we will be, and the people give kind of serious attention. So, biological hardware, okay, so
1237920	1242880	there's the CPUs, GPUs and something called the IP intelligent processing, you know, there's a
1242880	1250480	company called Graphcore based of the UK. It just got 200 million or 500 million dollars
1250480	1257200	funding every day, it seems to go up to build this new type of processor. Basically, it's not
1257200	1262800	really intelligent, it just does matrix multiplication much farther than the GPU. So, it's kind of,
1263600	1270400	I probably shouldn't know, it's specialized to do deep learning, it's very good at artificial,
1270400	1274800	you know, deep learning calculation. I'm going to argue deep learning won't get us a general
1274800	1280960	intelligence, but they're very good at classifying and, you know, drawing graphs, that kind of stuff.
1282080	1287200	They're not intelligent though, they'll never become conscious. But this is just basically
1287200	1293760	showing you the CPU, GPU, IP, digital processors, and there they are, that's what they look like.
1293760	1299840	They build them, they ship them, they get paid money for them. So, maybe some of you didn't
1299840	1304320	know that, you know, where we are with the ASICs. It's kind of a very, they're calling it like the
1304320	1309520	Cambrian Explosion and processors. There's a hundred different companies building these ASIC
1309520	1317280	processors, but they're all designed to optimize the deep learning calculations.
1317280	1323600	Okay, so we had the CPU there, the Intel, we had the Nvidia GPU, AMD make them too,
1323600	1328960	but now there's the Google make the GPU, Graphcore make the bottom two ASICs.
1329920	1334240	They're really good at deep learning, but they're not going to get us to general intelligence.
1334240	1342560	Again, they're narrow, what I would call narrow AI. And, but yeah, there's a lot of money going
1342560	1346800	into building these things right now. A lot of these startups are raising a lot of money
1346800	1350720	to build these for the deep learning. So basically we're solving deep learning, okay,
1350720	1355840	which is not general intelligence, but we're well on the way to optimizing the hell out of that.
1355840	1360560	Okay, but it will not get us to general intelligence. So that's what a cloud TPU looks like.
1360560	1366000	So today we can log into these things. They're a little bit more expensive than a GPUs,
1366000	1369680	which we can also log into. So say I want to do a deep learning calculation,
1369680	1375520	I go to Google Cloud, you know, I just say, you know, you go to Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
1375520	1380240	Azure, the three main cloud providers, only Google have the TPU. That's what they look like.
1380240	1386800	That's a hundred petaflops. Okay, so that's incredible. I mean, the biggest supercomputer in
1386800	1392320	the world is about a hundred, is a thousand petaflops. And they take up more than 10 times
1392320	1398000	the space. These are very powerful things, but they're very domain specific. They narrow AI,
1398000	1403200	but they're, they're hugely powerful thing and super impressive. And if you're, if you're into
1403200	1408800	hardware, these things, you know, Google hired 10 years ago, some guys to the best in the world,
1408800	1414000	to build these things for them. And they kept them secret for a while. That's how DeepMind
1414560	1421360	AlphaGo, by the way, they, they use these. Okay, so those are TPUs. Again, this is a
1421360	1426560	larger supercomputer, but it's as dumb as a brick, okay? It can multiply to very large numbers or
1426560	1434240	factor something very quickly in the, you know, flash of an eye, but they don't, they're no
1434240	1440720	consciousness, there's no creativity, there's nothing, okay? So these things, they, they're
1440720	1444880	good at number crunching, but that's about it. But they're hugely impressive and they
1444880	1450240	cost a lot of money. They also use a lot of power. This thing, the summit supercomputer by IBM.
1450880	1456640	So it's not just a matter of raw compute, right? This thing uses 13 million watts of power. The,
1456640	1465760	the brain uses 30 watts. So it's almost a factor of a million more efficient, okay? The brain,
1465760	1471280	and then we do a heck of a lot more biology is very clever, isn't it? So, you know, what these,
1471280	1474480	that just gives me more and more respect for biology when I see things like this.
1475920	1482800	So yeah, there it is. There is the creation. 1.1 million, or you could say 4.5 billion years of
1482800	1491120	evolution is optimized to this, to us here today. You know, Einstein, Picasso, Van Gogh, you know,
1492080	1497600	Leonardo da Vinci, who's the smartest guy on the planet today, maybe Ed Whitton at Princeton,
1497600	1503360	he's a physicist. We can do a lot, which computers cannot. So how the heck do we do it, right?
1503360	1509840	It's 30 watts. It's, it's just, you know, fits in the skull. It's, it's 1.5 kilo. So what's going
1509840	1518800	on? What are we missing? Okay, this is where neuromorphic computing comes in. And there's a
1518800	1525360	project called Spinnaker. So this guy called Steve Furber up in Manchester, he helped build the arm
1526000	1534160	processor, which is a CPU, and recently sold to SoftBank, I think for 20 billion.
1537040	1542880	Now he, out of that 20 years ago, he started to build neuromorphic computing. And so Spinnaker is
1542880	1547920	his effort. It's now part of the human brain project. So these things are, my point is that,
1547920	1551920	you know, these things are real. You may not have heard of them, but, you know, they've been
1551920	1557920	going 20 years now. IBM have an effort called True North. So these things are based, these
1557920	1563920	processes are based on how the brain works. Okay, they're not like the summit, they're not, not
1564560	1569040	emulation. They're actually direct simulation of how the brain, so they're basically building
1569040	1576240	artificial neurons and silicon. Okay, artificial neurons and silicon. And we're up to about a billion,
1576240	1582480	which is about a mouse. Okay, today, 20 years ago, we had one right now. Everything's on a
1582480	1588560	Moore's Law. So yeah, we're up to about a billion. Maybe we need just to scale it another 100 times
1588560	1593600	and have a human brain. That's quite possible, actually, it's in the human brain project. It has
1593600	1600000	a billion euro funding. So that's that's that's moving as fast as it can move. Okay, it's a big
1600000	1608160	European project now. So yeah, and it's available today in the cloud. IBM have theirs. Intel also
1608160	1616560	have something called the Ohi, the Hawaiian word. There are many startups as well. So again,
1616560	1620560	there are, you know, maybe 50 startups, neuromorphic, just Google it, neuromorphic computing.
1621600	1627440	There are bigger efforts, brain scales is another human brain project one study started in Germany.
1627520	1634320	It's been a Chrissy UK one true north is IBM and Intel have one. And then there's all the startups
1634320	1642800	as well. Exciting times, we live in exciting times. So, so basically, you know, we have the
1642800	1648880	digital processing, which I showed you, including the ASICs, TPUs, the Graphcore, we have neuromorphic,
1648880	1654560	which is biologically inspired computing, and we have quantum computing. Okay, so, you know,
1654560	1660000	20 years ago, we just really had the digital. Today, we have three different types of computing.
1660000	1664320	And so things are going to get interesting. And we live in interesting times the next 20 years
1664320	1669680	are going to be very interesting in terms of computation. Because we now have this neuromorphic,
1669680	1674240	which is like biology, and we also have quantum computing. So things are going to get very,
1674240	1679040	very interesting. So that's what it looks like. There's five cabinets, we're up to 10 now.
1679840	1687200	And this is how it scales, you start off with 1000 neurons in the core, you put 18 cores on
1687200	1692160	a chip, then you put 48, this is all engineering at this point, it goes to a fab and it gets built.
1692160	1698320	You have 48 chips on the board, 24 boards in a rack, and then you put five racks per cabinet and 10
1698320	1704880	cabinets. That's the intelligence of a mouse right there. That's a billion artificial neurons,
1704880	1711120	much bigger than a biological neuron. But again, all of this is on Moore's law when they first
1711120	1718320	we had 1000 remember in 1970, I think we had 1024, the first processor that ever built. And it was
1718320	1727280	the size of a one inch by one inch 1000. Now we can fit 10 billion neurons on a one inch by one
1727280	1734000	inch. Okay, it's Moore's law. So these things are shrinking. You know, so, you know, it's on a
1734000	1739200	trajectory. So that will scale down nicely in 10, 20 years, that will be the size of the mouse brain.
1740080	1744240	Okay, so that's what they look like. That's on brain scales on the left, that's a
1746080	1753120	human brain project from Germany. And then there's Google GTPs on the right. So analog versus digital,
1753120	1758320	I'm arguing that we need the newer, we need the neuromorphic on the left to get us to general
1758320	1763920	intelligence. The one on the right will do it, we can simulate it, but it's like a thousand
1763920	1769760	time classification is impressive as an engineering fee is that is, but it's very good at deep learning.
1771040	1778800	Okay, what about quantum? Maybe we're making progress there, we're up to about 100 qubits,
1778800	1783600	quantum bits, that's on its own Moore's law. So, you know, within 10 years, we're on 1000,
1783600	1790160	then we'll start doing interesting calculations. And does the brain use quantum? Roger Penrose
1790160	1797280	would argue yes. Yeah, we don't know if we have to go to that level. Roger Penrose actually argues
1797280	1806160	that, you know, consciousness comes, is the only way to get a conscious thing is system is to go
1806160	1812080	down to the quantum level. Interesting, huh? Okay, so there we have it. Those are the four
1812080	1816480	types of compute, we have digital, we have neuromorphic, we have quantum, and we have biology.
1819280	1827520	Okay, and that's what they look like at the microscopic level. So in some sense, you know,
1828080	1833360	their computation, you know, the physics of computation is called information processing,
1833360	1840320	okay. And in some sense, you know, when you get down to it, you know, the equations are the same
1841040	1845440	for the three classical systems. For the quantum computing, they're different, they obey the laws
1845440	1851280	of quantum mechanics. But theoretically, if you're interested, you could just Google information
1851280	1857520	processing. Eventually, you wind up here. But the trick is to build them, right? Okay, so that's
1857520	1862320	what the data center of the future is going to look like. Right now, that's just almost, you know,
1862320	1869760	99% classical digital computing. You know, there's a few spinnaker machines, you can buy that spinnaker
1869760	1877600	processor, you know, you can actually buy them. So, but not many data centers have them. But the
1877600	1882400	point is you can buy them. Quantum computing, you can also buy or you can buy that you can log
1882400	1887040	into the cloud today and log into an IBM machine, they have 20 quantum computers on the cloud as
1887040	1895840	of today, and also log into a regati machine. Amazon and Azure, Microsoft and their cloud
1895840	1901280	are also going to offer quantum computing as a service soon. You can log into spinnaker at the
1901280	1906000	human brain project, but I think you have to be an academic to do that. It won't be long before
1906000	1911680	they commercialize that too. But you can see the road ahead. I'm arguing that probably neuromorphic
1911680	1915840	is the way to get us a different intelligence. Quantum is going to be very useful for
1916480	1923200	simulating molecules, molecular dynamics, drug discovery, in classical will be good for, you
1923440	1929760	know, the internet, our iPhones, etc. So, each type of computing has its own specific use. I'm
1929760	1935520	going to argue neuromorphic is probably the one for AGI. Okay, so deep learning, what about deep
1935520	1942880	learning? I'll end the time here, 30 minutes. Okay, probably be another 15 minutes. Okay,
1942880	1951200	probably two thirds through the talk. So, we keep on this call, everyone's heard of deep learning.
1951520	1956080	You know, I make a living out of it. I've been doing it for six years, seven years now.
1957760	1962320	That's, you know, it's not going to get us a general intelligence. So, I basically put that in
1962320	1967920	here to just point that out. It's good at classifying images. It does some sort of language
1967920	1974320	translation and text to speech, etc. There's neural network, deep learning optimized chip
1974320	1981760	in all phones now, or you see all laptops, okay. Yeah, they're called system on a chip. You have
1981760	1985680	your CPU, you have your GPU, but you also have a neural networking deep learning
1985680	1991440	processor as well these days, okay. So, they're used to some things, mostly, you know, to do
1991440	1997920	with image recognition, classification and language. Okay, so it just swaps over to whatever
1997920	2004000	processor is best for the time. So, if you have an application on your phone that requires
2004000	2009040	deep learning, it will swap over to the deep learning processor. And these are known as
2009040	2014560	co-processors. So, the CPU is always the main core processor. But if it has something that
2014560	2019840	needs to offload on the GPU or the neural deep learning processor, it will do. And then the
2019840	2027200	back and forth between CPU, GPU, they call it co-processors. So, you know, these neural network
2027920	2032640	are on all devices these days, okay. Probably in the last five years, they've started putting
2032640	2037200	them on all devices, because deep learning is a thing now, right. There's no neuromorphic
2037200	2042640	processors yet. Maybe that's to come. Okay, they're too big, right. They won't fit in the phone yet.
2043360	2047760	You have to use them on the cloud. And so, you know, we've all heard of the different
2047760	2053120	framework. TensorFlow is the most popular. PyTorch has become quite popular as well. The two main
2053120	2057520	deep learning frameworks are TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are interesting. And that's it.
2057520	2062960	This isn't a talk about deep learning, or TensorFlow or PyTorch. But I just put it in there
2062960	2068160	to see whether, you know, deep learning is getting all the press, you know, is it part of the journey?
2068160	2081200	No. It doesn't give you what a neuron does. No. It can do, like I say, image classification language,
2081200	2085520	but it will not do the other types of intelligence. Remember, the creativity of moving around
2085520	2090160	navigations through space, interpersonal, interpersonal won't give you that at all.
2091760	2097440	Zilch zero. Okay. So we're going to need something else. I mentioned neuromorphic. But what about
2097440	2103200	the theory? Okay, so let's have a quick look at that now. Okay, so general reason of intelligence.
2103200	2107280	So, you know, what do we need? What are the different approaches? I'll cover them.
2108480	2113360	There's called active inference, which I'm going to really focus on. And then what do we need to
2113360	2122240	build an AGI processor? Okay, so what do we need? So what we do is we turn to physics, right? We're
2122240	2131680	a physical system, the human brain of a fly, a snake, a monkey, you know, these are all physical
2131680	2138560	systems. And so what do we need to understand in physics? There's no easy way out. There's no magic.
2138560	2144240	We've got to go down. We've got to do the math, right? So, you know, are we missing anything in
2144240	2149760	physics? Well, there's everything we know about the universe right there. And all of that can be
2149760	2156000	described as a very fundamental principle called the principle of least action. Now, about two or
2156000	2161520	three years ago, this book published two years ago, in fact, became a university press called the
2161520	2167440	principle of least action. All the physics can be actually reframed as, you know, this principle,
2167440	2171920	which basically says, now it gets mathematical for the next couple of slides, switch off if you
2171920	2177120	want to. But conceptually, what we do is we write down something called the action, which we denote
2177120	2184720	as s. And we write down that equation, it basically goes back to Hamilton Lagrange, about 150 years
2184720	2190720	ago. And, you know, it's quite common if you're a physicist to formulate things in terms of Lagrangians,
2190720	2197600	Hamiltonians, the action is a function of these Lagrangians. And, you know, you do some scary math
2197600	2205520	and basic point, I can formulate any system in the world, whether it's a brain, or a car going down
2205520	2211600	the road, a couple of billiard balls on a billiard table, anything like atomic quantum physics,
2212640	2218880	classical physics, the universe cosmology, turns out there's this very unifying principle called
2218880	2226480	the principle of least action. Okay. So maybe we could start there. Okay. So what we have to do,
2226480	2231280	what's different about the brain compared to say, you know, a black hole, or, or, you know,
2231280	2238640	a system of galaxies, or, you know, a chemical interaction, okay, what's different here? So
2238640	2244880	we got to understand the system we're trying to model, right? So we need to, we need to build a
2244880	2251280	system that can model the world. Hmm. Okay. Just like a mouse makes a little model of the maze, or
2251280	2255920	we make a model of how we're going to make money, or get up and go to work, or, you know,
2255920	2259760	get in the car and go on a holiday, you know, we're always modeling the world crossing the road
2259760	2265280	without getting one over, et cetera, et cetera. You know, finding a mate, getting married, having
2265280	2271920	kids, you know, we're modeling all the time, you know, solving, you know, problem in chemistry,
2271920	2274960	we're modeling, modeling, modeling, we're always trying to model the world. So
2274960	2279440	we need to build a system that can do that using the principle of least action. That to me is
2279440	2283200	general. That would be a generally intelligent system. Okay. So how do we go about doing that?
2283760	2289280	Just so happens that a lot of very smart people in the world have been working on this for the last
2289280	2295200	30 years or so and doing the math. Okay. They've been writing papers, publishing them, writing
2295200	2300480	the equations down, building prototype systems. Okay. But it's got to, these systems have to be
2300560	2307360	able to explain and understand what they see, play all these board games, go chess, Sudoku,
2307360	2311120	but also, you know, cross the street without getting run over. They have to be able to model
2311120	2316080	their world. Okay. If you build a robot, no use having it just walk in front of a car, right?
2316080	2321600	It has to be modeling its environment. I mean, that Atlas robot doing flips. I mean, that's
2321600	2326160	mind boggling. So that's a robot modeling its world that it can do that.
2327040	2331520	But also it has, that's physical and it also has to be smart, right? That
2332160	2335680	Atlas is dumb as a brick, you can't play chess. We have to have the whole thing,
2335680	2340480	like we have, you know, 1.5 kilos, 30 watts, we have to make the whole thing,
2340480	2345440	which is where the neuromorphic process would come in. So it can plan problem solve,
2345440	2350080	build new models as they learn more about the world, update their prior knowledge,
2350080	2355600	you know, just like we do imagining things, have imagination into personal skills. Okay. So here's
2355600	2360000	some approaches. I mentioned some very clever people who work on this. There's a guy called
2360000	2365840	Karl Friston here at the UCL in London. There's a guy, Tishby in Israel, Bialek at Princeton,
2365840	2374000	Hooter is in Australia at the moment. He started in Germany, I think, Schmidt-Huber is in India,
2374000	2379600	in Switzerland. He's, he's set up a company called Golden Machine with lots of patents.
2379600	2384480	He's very smart guy. So, and there's many more. So these are very clever people being,
2385200	2390160	you know, trying to solve intelligence for their life. I mean, you know, as children,
2390160	2393920	they were going, you know, how do I solve intelligence? You know, some of us say, well,
2393920	2398320	yeah, how do I get up at nine and come home at five? I mean, these guys, you know,
2398320	2403280	just like Einstein, natural born with this thing, right? I want to solve intelligence.
2404160	2408960	So these are the guys. Okay, so let's focus in on Karl Friston.
2409280	2418400	So basically, he's using the principle of least action. It's, I call it the free energy principle,
2418400	2423200	but it's the same thing, basically, it uses physics. Okay, so basically, his stance is that
2423200	2428240	systems, you know, operate in a world to minimize your free energy, something called free energy.
2428800	2434880	And, you know, that will cause them to explore, you know, you get the explore exploit tradeoff,
2434880	2438640	they will explore their environment. How else do we learn? Remember, as little kids,
2438640	2443280	baby, watch a baby, they just roam around, crawl around exploring their environment,
2443280	2448720	putting things in their mouth. Yeah, this is how we learn. Okay, so the principle of free energy,
2449920	2454960	you know, this is what basically our brains are doing. They're just minimizing the free
2454960	2459840	energy the whole time. If there's uncertainty, we want to minimize it, right? That maybe that's
2459840	2463760	what the best definition of intelligence is, minimizing uncertainty as quickly as possible
2463760	2469760	and effectively as possible. Okay, how do we, you know, solve chemistry or physics or figure
2469760	2473600	out the universe? Well, these are uncertainties, we're just trying to minimize them as quickly as
2473600	2478560	possible. And it turns out the brain, we're not separate from the universe, okay, we're a physical
2478560	2484080	system within the universe, which, you know, our environment. So, you know, they're interacting
2484080	2489680	the whole time. So it's just physics, okay, basically, I say just in quotation marks. So
2489680	2494240	you can write down equations for these interactions and how our system might minimize
2494240	2500080	this free energy in the areas that's called first and I mean,
2504320	2510560	we could listen to him for two seconds.
2550080	2576320	So I guess technical quite quickly, a lot to do with probability, Bayesian influence,
2576320	2583040	he mentioned the word influence. Yeah, so the brain, it's always, there's always sensory input,
2583040	2587920	right? Even when we're sleeping, you know, we have dreams, there's subconscious, there's conscious,
2587920	2594640	I mean, you know, there's internal sensory perception that is perception from our environment.
2595600	2600400	You know, there's mental illness, schizophrenia, where the information processing goes awry.
2601360	2605520	You know, it's a complex system, there's 100 billion neurons all different parts, layers upon
2605520	2610960	layers, it's true evolution. The neocortex is what enables us to come up with things like
2610960	2615920	a theory of relativity and build cars and, you know, solve physics and chemistry problems and
2615920	2621280	mathematics. So yeah, it's a complex system, but it's basically a system that's based on the
2621280	2626080	free energy principle, which you heard Professor Friston explaining a little bit there. That's
2626080	2630880	what it looks like in a diagram. These other guys like Schmidt-Huber, they have their own systems,
2630880	2635280	but I think they will all basically boil down to, you know, the free energy principle,
2636000	2640640	the equations, you know, they look kind of similar. They may use different terminology
2640640	2645440	vocabulary, but physics is physics, right? Okay, so they're all trying to model a physical system
2645440	2651760	called the brain. Right, so we have external states, internal states, and there's only a few
2651760	2657680	more slides now. And something called Markov-Lanker, which kind of delineates the two, the internal
2657680	2664480	from the external environment, but there's no real, you know, there's no fixed thing, right? I mean,
2664480	2669920	things enter and we take action, enter our brain and we take action, right, all the time. We're
2669920	2676320	always interacting with our environment throughout pores and our skin. There is no fixed line,
2676320	2683120	but it's a theoretical construct to help us through the max. Okay, and it's completely
2683120	2689440	general. It works for cells. Cells are intelligent. They reproduce, you know, they survive in their
2689440	2697840	environment right up to brains. Okay, and this is the math, pretty ugly. Okay, so last few slides.
2697840	2703200	Can we build general intelligence? Okay, very clever math. These guys might end up getting
2703200	2708080	Nobel Prizes and whatnot, because, you know, one could argue it is maybe the defining problem about
2708240	2713600	time, right? Build intelligence, you know, solve climate change, solve cancer, build intelligence,
2713600	2719120	you know, these are the big problems. If someone solves it and builds the system, you know,
2719120	2723920	they're going to get a lot of money and a lot of prizes. So, I mean, a lot of these guys have a
2723920	2730640	super lot of recognition already if you're in the field. So, and, you know, it's a combination of,
2730640	2734880	like I showed before, computer science, so a lot of them are computer science, physics,
2734880	2740560	and neuroscience. So, a lot of them are neuroscientists, but some are more computer science, but
2740560	2744960	with a little neuroscience, some are neuroscientists with a little computer science, you know,
2744960	2749520	a little physics. But yeah, the one thing is they're all really, really good at math. Okay,
2749520	2756800	so can we build? The answer is yes. We have candidate theories. We have some algorithm
2756800	2762320	software, some math. We have the hardware now, and we have masses of data sets. So,
2763280	2769280	when, right, basically, the question is, how about if it's when? It's going to be like a
2769280	2773600	TensorFlow for general intelligence, just to kind of touch base with something we're familiar with.
2774160	2778720	And we're going to need a lot of software engineers to actually build these systems
2778720	2783920	and hardware engineers to build the neural network processors. It's a big project. I mean,
2783920	2787280	the human brain project, you know, is an Apollo project of our time.
2787280	2793760	You know, it's going to require funding. There's a lot of funding going into this stuff at the
2793760	2799680	moment. And you've got the human brain project, DeepMind, you've got the US brain project, China's
2799680	2804960	working on this, everyone's working on it. Should we build AGI? Again, that comes back to the
2804960	2812320	philosophy, philosophical question, you know, safety, ethics, singularity. But that's for another
2812320	2820000	time. Okay, so here are some AGI projects I mentioned from countries all over the world,
2820000	2827680	all very, very viable projects, in my opinion, all of them. No clear winner. All good stuff.
2829040	2836160	Okay, so in conclusion, it's obvious that deep learning is lacking the foundations to build
2836160	2841600	general intelligence. It's based on statistics, not physics. It's a statistical hack. It's very
2841600	2847120	clever. But it takes a million times as much energy as the brain to do, you know, about one
2847120	2852160	percent of what the brain does. So clearly, that's a no. Research groups are looking into
2852160	2859120	bio plausible models. That's the way to get there. That's, you know, in terms of theory and hardware.
2859680	2865840	So the real question is when, right? So we've got prototypes now, Schmidt-Huber,
2865840	2871760	you know, he's building stuff, commercializing it. Oh, Friston, you know, has a huge code base,
2872400	2877200	you know, hundreds of papers. So we were on our way. We're at the beginning of an
2877200	2884560	exponential curve, I'd say, right? So yeah, it's not a when, it's not a defining moment. It's a
2884560	2888640	continuum. We're at the beginning. We've got a, we've got a billion neurons,
2889280	2893680	artificial neurons in a human brain project. We've got the brain of a mouse that could do
2893680	2898320	Sudoku puzzles that can solve stuff that humans can solve that deep learning would never be able
2898320	2904560	to solve at a thousand times less energy. So we've got the hardware that's on its own Moore's law.
2905760	2911680	And what else? So finally, even Jeff Hinton, he's a godfather of deep learning, right? Won
2911680	2919360	a Turing Award with Jan Lacoon and Yoshua Benjo last year for deep learning. He's saying, assuming,
2919360	2924880	you know, he knows as much about anybody about deep learning. He's one of the founders. Assuming
2924880	2928800	that the computer industry can keep producing better hardware, I think business issues are
2928800	2933600	going to take us a long way. He's talking about the TPUs, the Graphcore, all of that. Obviously,
2933600	2940160	if we get the big conceptual breakthroughs, probably from neuroscience, it'll take us further. I think
2940240	2943840	one of the big breakthroughs that's going to come is we're going to understand the brain.
2944880	2950720	Yeah, it's all about understanding how nature has done it. And nature is used to laws of physics.
2950720	2960640	And Carl Friston, this act of inference, formulates that beautifully in some beautiful mathematics.
2970160	2995280	Okay, so was this your final word? Can we move on to questions?
2996160	3007360	Yeah, so any questions? Thank you. Okay, we have a few questions. It was a really enthusiastic
3007360	3014080	speech of yours. And so these are the questions. If we managed to create artificial general
3014080	3023760	intelligence, what would be the odds of the AGI being sentient? Yeah, so that will fall out naturally.
3024160	3030400	So sentience is part of intelligence. Remember the types of intelligence? So that's the existential
3030400	3038320	part. That's what that meant. So yeah, they have to be sentient. Okay, they have to be sentient.
3039040	3043040	I mean, first of all, we'll build ape-like intelligence. Apes are sentient, right? They
3043040	3048160	know what's going on in that level. Okay, so they will be sentient. And as we get more and more
3048160	3053600	intelligent, they'll become more and more sentient. Yeah, we haven't seen that movie here. That's a
3053600	3060400	beautiful movie with Joachim Phoenix. Have you seen it here? The thing on the iPhone gets smarter
3060400	3066640	and smarter, more and more sentient until it goes off into its hyper universe somewhere. I mean,
3066640	3071200	that's the kind of thing. It will start kind of like human level, ape level, then get the human
3071200	3078480	level, but then go into, you know, they'll be more sentient than us. Okay, and together with this
3078480	3085120	question, if it grasps the concept of the humor, it controls us by giving us false predictions.
3085680	3091440	Can you trust it and secure it? Is that slavery? Yeah, so that's a good question too.
3091440	3095920	No, they'll have rights like us, right? Just like, you know, there's animal rights,
3095920	3103040	animal cruelty is a no-no, right? You go to prison if you harm an animal, right? It's not right.
3104080	3108800	So yeah, that comes down to ethics and law. Yeah, they'll have their own rights.
3112240	3113040	They will have rights.
3113040	3128000	Okay, and okay, what do you think about artificial intelligence in drug design?
3130080	3135600	Yeah, so it's going to help a lot. So right now we took a question because we're using deep learning
3135600	3142960	to help us discover drugs to explore the chemically molecular dynamic space
3143920	3147840	much quicker than we can if, you know, we do it ourselves. Okay, so deep learning is actually
3147840	3152800	accelerating drug discovery right now. Okay, the idea is to accelerate it even further by
3152800	3158080	using an artificially journal intelligence system. So yes, right now deep learning is
3158080	3162480	absolutely accelerating drug discovery and has witnessed in the deep mind-winning,
3162960	3166960	particular in competition recently, which is, you know, molecular dynamics, which is
3166960	3174560	similar to drug discovery. Okay, so there's just one comment. A lot of science fiction's work have
3175360	3181680	gave rise and inspiration to many great technologies and research. So they want to know
3182480	3188640	which science fiction or any other general books have gave you inspiration and helped
3188640	3191680	you shape yourself towards the professional that you are today?
3193680	3198720	Yeah, so science fiction is, you know, when I was younger, I always read science fiction and
3198720	3205680	watched Star Trek, you know, huge science fiction fan, really. So yeah, I mean, as the most foundation
3205680	3212800	series, Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, those are kind of the, but yeah, there's
3213120	3218720	new guys around right now with, you know, different science fiction series. Always good
3218720	3225840	for the imagination to read science fiction. There's nothing wrong with the fact that it's
3225840	3231120	encouraged, right, to, science fiction is a great thing. That's, you know, it's the start of all
3231120	3239200	sciences in science fiction. So yeah, you can encourage it. Okay. And if we ever reach artificial
3239200	3245680	general intelligence, do you think laws would be implemented on time, or we would firstly see
3245680	3252080	abuse of artificial general intelligence in daily life? You partially gave the answer on this.
3253360	3257280	Yeah, so, you know, there's always going to be good actors and bad actors, right? So yeah, we're
3257280	3261920	going to have to come up with laws and try to find ways of enforcing it. There's going to be some
3261920	3267120	silly things happen, of course, you know, decide with nuclear energy, right? Very, all very powerful
3267120	3272960	technologies can get misused by bad actors. And so we are, we're going to have to keep an eye out
3272960	3278560	for that. We have to enforce it. We have to have police at that point, right? Yeah, of course.
3279200	3288400	And the last final question, as far as I can see, how, oh, okay, one more. Okay, how artificial
3288400	3296960	general intelligence could affect religions? What's that? Okay, how the artificial general
3297200	3303440	intelligence could affect religions? Oh, yeah, so I did mention that, I think
3304480	3311200	sentient being will have the capacity for religion and religious and spirituality and all that good
3311200	3319520	stuff. You know, so yeah, it just comes along with a religion. It's a type of intelligence,
3319840	3325120	intelligence is a type of intelligence. Yeah, of course. Okay, as far as I can see,
3325120	3333040	that those are all questions, but we'll wait a few minutes more. Thank you so much for answers and
3333040	3339600	for this presentation and being with us tonight. It was really enthusiastic and inspiring to watch
3339600	3349040	this and to understand it a bit more. So we really thank you. Thank you so much, me and all the people
3349120	3360080	from Foundation. Sure, I look forward to watching it on YouTube. Yeah, and we hope to collaborate
3360080	3367440	again with you, of course. So thank you so much. There are no more questions, so I would call it.
3368960	3376240	And okay, thank you everyone for watching. See you on the next webinar.
