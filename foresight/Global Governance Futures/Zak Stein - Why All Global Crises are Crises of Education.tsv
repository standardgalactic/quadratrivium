0	7280	Hi and welcome to Global Governance Futures based out of the Global Governance Institute
7280	13440	at University College London. This is a podcast about the challenges facing humanity
14000	20000	and possible global responses. If you're new to the show and you want to get a list of our favorite
20000	30880	books, other resources, listen to past shows and join our community, go to ucl.ac.uk forward slash
30880	41600	global dash governance. We're really excited to have Dr Zach Stein join us today. Zach is a writer,
41600	49440	a futurist, a transformative educator, working to bring a greater sense of justice and sanity
49440	57520	to education. Alongside Daniel Schmackenberger who featured in episode 12, Zach is also a founding
57520	64480	member of the Consilience Project, a non-profit media organization aiming to improve public
64480	72560	sense-making and democratic dialogue. Zach received his PhD in education from Harvard
72560	78800	University where he studied educational neuroscience, human development and the philosophy
78800	86880	of education. He's published dozens of articles and two books, his most recent book and one which
86880	93520	really caught my attention is called Education in a Time Between Worlds and Grapples with the
93520	102880	Dangers posed by a profound learning and capacity deficit in the face of civilization-wide transformations.
103440	110080	It really is an incredibly rich and thought-provoking work and at the risk of oversimplifying,
110080	117600	Zach argues that the world as we have known it is rapidly disappearing and as a result,
117600	126480	radical transformation of our legacy education systems is now an urgent, even existential imperative.
127200	135120	As he puts it, we can no longer assume, if we ever could, the unproblematic intergenerational
135120	140000	transmission of essential human capacities for reasoning and reflection.
142480	148800	So, in the spirits of the philosopher John Dewey, we're going to discuss today why Zach believes
148800	154800	that at roots all current global crises might be best understood as crises of education
155040	163600	and why as educators, learners and concerned planetary inhabitants, we should all care about that.
164240	169360	So, we're super excited to get into this with you, Zach. Thanks so much for taking the time to
169360	175920	speak with us. It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for inviting me. And before we get started,
175920	183120	I'll just ask the poll crew to say hello. Hi, I'm Jessica. I work on the research and
183120	186560	I'm very looking forward to hearing what Dr. Stein has to say today.
189680	195280	Hi, my name is Sam. I do the audio and the video editing and hopefully some of the thinking.
197360	200640	Hi, I'm Zoe. I help with the social media and running of the YouTube channel.
203520	211680	Great. Okay. So, to open, Zach, perhaps you can help us set the scene. You describe in the book
211680	219920	the years 2000 to 2050 as a critical turning point in the history of humanity and the planet.
220640	227600	So, what is so special about this 50-year stretch and how does this this interregnum,
227600	231440	how does this turning relate to the educational crisis?
233520	240560	Yeah, so that specific time period. I took that on the cue of Immanuel Wallerstein,
240560	245840	who was the creator of World Systems Analysis, which is this fascinating kind of approach to
245840	252080	doing big history, specifically long-term stretches of the development of the capitalist
252080	257840	world system. And he was actually following from complex dynamical system theory, like
257840	267120	prigazine and things like that. And he saw this kind of like rhythm of changing in the basic
267200	274000	organization of capitalism, this transformation of the hegemonic structure, as he called it.
274640	282000	And so, you know, one occurred when we went from having capitalism being rooted in basically Venice
282000	288320	to it being rooted with the Dutch and then from the Dutch to the British and then from the British
288320	294560	to the United States. And each time that kind of hegemonic world system transformation, as Wallerstein
294560	300960	would call it, occurred, whole swaths of culture, whole swaths of political life, whole swaths of
301840	310800	the ecology and the humanity were changed. And he saw this in several other kind of like people
310800	316000	doing actually quantitative analysis of large historical swaths of time, like Peter Turchin
316000	321200	more recently have seen these actual, their rhythms, their cycles of historical transformation.
321200	327680	And so Wallerstein says, Hey, we're about to be in one of these, we're about to be in a situation
327680	334000	where, you know, the British kind of and then the Americans and now the Americans and now what
334000	341360	basically is what Wallerstein saying is like the, the end of America as the dominant hegemonic force
341360	348000	in the capitalist world system, he's predicting. And he's saying that for the first time the system
348080	353520	is global. And that means that it's not clear that the hegemon can just move geographically,
353520	360720	that we may be approaching something that looks more like a transformation of a deeper, more
360720	364800	profound nature at the structure of the economic system itself. So this is where I got the idea.
365680	369600	And then I started looking around at other thinkers who are also like even, you know,
369600	378400	New Age thinkers and like futurists and, you know, anthropologists and other people pointing at the
378400	385840	same kind of time period, basically. And so yeah, I brought that I pulled that in there and put it
385840	391440	in the book just to make people aware that when I say we're in a time between worlds, like it's a,
391440	396320	it's a technical phrase. Like if there's a, there's poetics in it, but it's actually a technical
396320	403280	phrase. And it's referring to this basically almost inevitable historical unfolding of a very
403280	411200	significant transformation in the techno economic and political base of our world. And the argument
411200	416560	that I weave in there is that, hey, don't forget education. Like Wallerstein doesn't mention
416560	421520	education. And my argument is basically that all those other things, economics, politics,
421520	426880	warfare, technology, you don't get those without education. And it's interesting to me that people
426880	435200	neglect that insight, it shows how taken for granted, much of the processes of intergenerational
435200	440640	transmission have been. And so that's invisible when they become problematized in our society,
440640	445200	because we take it for granted. Each time the capitalist world system changed, the nature of
445200	453360	education itself changed. And so yeah, so that's, I'm pulling that bit out. And one thing that's
453360	463440	interesting is that great historian, again, of capitalism, Jason Moore, his book, Capitalism
463440	470000	and the Web of Life. It's an incredible book. He talks about not just like capitalist world systems,
470000	478800	but world ecologies, which is to say the way that capital shapes the nature of the planetary
478800	487840	biosphere, literally dams and canals and all of these things. And of course now, emissions and
487840	495840	transformations in weather as a result of this. So we're having, and I know this in the book,
496720	503200	we're having these crazy hockey stick patterns of major ecological transformation. At the same
503200	509040	time, the underlying techno economic base is fundamentally transforming at the same time
509600	514320	education is transforming. And I'm pointing at education as the thing that needs to be worked
514320	521120	on basically first or as most primary, or at least not put on the back burner, like it's going to
521120	528080	take care of itself. When in fact, most of the problems as you mentioned in the intro that we're
528080	534800	looking at are our issues of skill deficit, capacity deficit, personality disorganization,
535840	544560	low grade ubiquitous psychopathology. And so it's a complex psychological crisis, as much as it's
544560	550720	an ecological or technological or political or economic crisis. So that's a little bit about
550800	556960	that where that period came from. And I've been saying we were between worlds for,
557600	562640	you know, five or six years. And then when the pandemic hit, people were like, oh,
562640	566880	that's what you mean. I was like, yes. I was like, it's everything is fundamentally,
566880	571360	we're in a liminal space, we can't go back or stabilize the prior system.
573200	578400	We're going to be in a disequilibrated state. And this is Wallerstein's notion he's getting it
578400	583360	from privileging complex open dynamical systems, right, they go through periods of turbulence
583360	589120	before they restabilize. So we're in that period of turbulence and will remain in that period of
589120	596720	turbulence, I'm saying for, for decades, until something new locks in. And the concern we have
596720	601920	is that what's going to lock in is not going to be good. So there's a way to solve this problem that
602000	606880	looks, for lack of a better word, like totalitarian or authoritarian.
609040	612800	So, you know, the Consilience Project and my other work is trying to find a way to solve these
612800	620320	problems that result in an open society on the other side of this kind of reorganization of the
620320	626160	world system. So it's kind of like the broadest framing. Yeah, that's super helpful, Zach. Thank
626160	632320	you. So maybe we'll sort of drill down a bit now into a concrete example. So thinking about climate
632320	638880	change, I've been doing quite a bit of research recently on climate change. And there's a real
638880	646400	sort of focus on, I'd even say fetish for CO2 metrics. We have this kind of war on carbon.
647200	654080	And the solution ontology is really about sort of technology. So carbon capture storage, net
654080	660640	zero, very current at the moment, very lively debate there. But also, you know, state multilateral
660640	664880	agreement. This is a collective action problem. It's a political problem. If we can just,
665520	672000	if we just see our way through that impasse, we can solve climate change. But we're 30 years down
672000	678800	the road from Rio 1992, carbon emissions are yet to peak. And you argue in the book that the climate
678800	685280	crisis is at root, not a problem of pollution or habitat destruction is actually a crisis of human
685280	694960	decision making. So if you were speaking to some of our most highly educated elite decision makers,
694960	701680	experts, and there I said, academics, what is it that we're not getting right?
701680	710880	Yeah, there's at least kind of two ways to answer the question. One is that one of the things we're
710880	718000	not getting right is the communication and education of those people who are not academics
718000	725040	and who are not high level policy decision makers. So like, this is in part a decision making crisis
725120	731520	and a capacities crisis among those epistemic elites, let's call them, and decision makers,
732080	739120	who are laying out this solution ontology, right, inadequately. So there's something I'll get to
739120	744240	that point, like what's wrong with the highest level models about the global situation and why
744240	752400	those are inadequate. But prior to that, there's actually this issue that the degree of polarization
752400	760000	around climate change, for example, in the United States, the degree of intensity, even though it's
760000	767600	low grade, it will emerge again around escalating economic inequality. Like there's a series of
767600	775280	things that require really complex educational initiatives, not involving the most elite decision
775280	780960	makers, involving every citizen in an open society's understanding of the global situation.
782560	787760	That we have not provided educational systems that brought people up and into a mature and
787760	796560	complex view of the global situation. At least in the United States, you know, we're being entertained.
797680	802240	We should be being informed and educated by the media, we're being entertained and brought into
802880	811600	basically cultural war as a form of entertainment and catharsis. And so that's the first thing that
811600	821280	these epistemic elites need to consider is that the people, so-called, can't just simply be told
821280	827040	what to do when you figure out what the right policy is. This is the, remember, the scary
828160	834080	lockdown of excuse the terminology on the other side of being between worlds is the option where
834080	840480	we figure out the climate policy that works. We can't explain it to the people, quote unquote,
840480	847680	the masses. So we have coercive legislation that basically mandates their behavior change
847680	853120	without their understanding why the behavior change is necessary. And we saw this with the
853120	858560	pandemic a little bit because of the information warfare around science, right? So you get a
858560	864320	situation where people are being requested to do things that are reducing their quality of life,
864400	871840	but they don't actually have the epistemic insight. They don't have the knowledge they need to have
871840	878080	the law be understandable, justified. This goes way back in legal theory to like
878640	883760	Kant, if you will, you know, and forgive Kant his transgressions. But he did say that if you're
883760	890720	going to have a legal framework in something like a democracy, an open society, if you will,
891280	896800	it needs to be both, you know, have the force of law, which is to say you get punished if you
896800	900560	don't follow it, even if you don't understand it. But you also need to be able to be in a position
900560	904480	to understand that you need to have all the information you need as a citizen to see why this
904480	913920	law is valid, just appropriate. So if we don't solve that problem, which is to say, really educating
914240	920880	folks, the everyday person, and that requires changing the nature of the media. I'm getting
920880	925520	to the Consilience Project here, the nature of the media, the nature of how we understand
925520	929680	public sense making, public dialogue around complex scientific topics, for example.
931200	935840	Then we could be in a position where even if the epistemic elite get themselves in order
935840	941120	and start using much more comprehensive, you know, global frames and, you know, multicast
941440	944720	decision making procedures with second and third order effects and all these things we'd
944720	953200	like to see, even if they do that, if the people, as it were, the masses, are still in a media
953200	959200	environment that's completely saturated with disinformation and advertising and information
959200	965360	extraction, predatory social media, then we're going to end up basically being in a situation
965360	970320	where the epistemic elite feel that they have no choice but to coerce the vast majority of the
970320	975200	global population into following the laws necessary for humanity to survive. And then
975200	981840	we have a civilization which may not be worth actually living in, even though it's sustainable,
982960	988320	even though it is within planetary boundaries. So that's the first place where decision making
988320	992880	is key is that it's, yeah, we can be concerned about the epistemic elites, but until they become
992880	997120	more concerned with actually educating people instead of propagandizing them and entertaining
997120	1002560	them and extracting profit from them, there'll be no way that we can actually navigate the
1003600	1009360	crisis in the context of an open society. If we turn to the epistemic elites,
1010240	1013840	then it becomes clear that we're still dominated by short-term thinking.
1015600	1025360	We're still dominated by certain ideologies that privilege reductive epistemics over
1026240	1032880	comprehensive and open epistemics, if I can put it that way. So reducing in all the carbon
1032880	1041040	emissions, for example, seeking only those approaches that can be measured in quantitative
1041040	1048480	terms, reducing the problem to a technical and scientific problem. This folds already into
1048480	1055920	what I explained, that they're mostly being worked on as a technological solution, often
1055920	1062000	somehow a technological solution that's actually going to come about as a result of competition
1062000	1069200	between entrepreneurial forces and the interest of seeking profit. So this is, again, a high-level
1069200	1075360	frame about the kinds of contexts in which basic research should be taking place to solve the problem
1075920	1082640	and a lack of coordinated effort, like, for example, we had around, let's say, the Manhattan
1082640	1087120	Project, where it wasn't like, oh, let's let private industry solve this problem. It was like,
1087120	1095840	no, this is a problem that needs the concerted effort of everybody. Note that they didn't
1095840	1104640	solve the basic problem that I mentioned earlier, which was a secret project. So I think
1104640	1110960	there's those two issues. There's a lot more to say about the kind of absence of comprehensive
1110960	1118000	epistemics among the elite decision makers and policymakers. And somehow that discourse often
1118000	1124960	feels captured to me or insincere to me. And at some point, you know, I don't know how to quite
1124960	1129600	get in there and look at that. But that's, I think, a deep issue. I remember Jonathan Ross and my
1129600	1138880	colleague at Perspectiva talking about finance. Just finance as one of the major profit centers
1138880	1144880	of our civilization is basically the manipulation of fictitious capital. And the way these things
1144880	1150880	down propagate into how people make decisions about very concrete things involving the ecology
1150880	1158080	of the planet, or even just local ecologies. So yeah, so there's some form of motivated reasoning
1158640	1170320	or kind of a very astute and studied blindness to certain issues, the like conspicuous absence of
1170320	1179120	comprehensive approaches. So anyway, we have to get more specific about certain models. And again,
1179120	1185440	I'm not an educator. So I'm thinking about the errors and they're thinking at a deeper level,
1185440	1190400	not about like, oh, they've got these statistics wrong about CO2, or they haven't thought through
1190400	1195760	the, you know, how difficult it is to actually make solar panels or all those technical questions
1195760	1201360	are important. I'm looking at the underlying structure of their arguments and epistemics,
1201360	1206400	essentially, and saying these are kind of flawed to begin with. So I'll leave it there.
1208000	1215280	Yeah, I think it's very helpful to actually dive down and expose those underlying structural
1215280	1220000	assumptions. Because it's very easy. I mean, I find myself doing all the time just getting
1220000	1227680	captured by an interest in, in a part of the problem to compartmentalizing, siloing. So to
1227680	1232960	actually step back and to try and get a sense of what are these larger macro structural forces in
1232960	1238560	play is crucial. And I'm not sure we're very good at doing that. But I just want to hand over to
1238560	1245360	Sam. Sam, Sam's got a question. Hi, thanks, Tom. And thank you, Zach. I just wanted to ask if we
1246400	1253520	say in a perfect word, we realize the two issues that you very articulately put. And so we have
1253520	1258400	an open society, let's say, for example, the United States of America, we have an open, educated
1258400	1265520	society, finance capitalism is the thing of the past. How do we move that out of the confines
1265520	1272160	of a kind of national paradigm? And could you talk a bit about obviously climate change is a
1272160	1278640	collective action problem, a global collective action problem? And is there a space for more
1278640	1287280	cosmopolitan education and working in a kind of global capacity or a cosmopolitan capacity
1287280	1291600	to solve some of these collective action problems so that we don't have one society that is,
1291680	1298880	you know, really clued up, but then constantly hitting up against brick walls around it?
1300720	1305840	Yeah, I mean, I would point to nationalism, at least certain forms of nationalism,
1305840	1311360	as one of those flaws and the highest level epistemic models that are plaguing the epistemic
1311360	1315280	elites. It's a lot of epistemics in there. But you see what I'm saying, like there's a
1315840	1321440	there's a bias towards certain ways of thinking about what the world situation is that makes
1321440	1326160	it seem like the Brenton Woods agreements are still completely relevant and stuff when they're
1326160	1331360	absolutely not, right? Or as if the UN actually somehow imposed a global order when it completely
1331360	1338960	didn't. So there's a misunderstanding of what the actual real politic is at the level of what's
1338960	1347280	going to take to solve these problems. And so it this isn't like, you know, we can't be naive
1347280	1352080	and think that there will be international cooperation. But we do need to think about
1352080	1360720	the forms of judgment, like as I was articulating, the forms of judgment that allow
1361600	1368000	certain people within certain nations to be truly cosmopolitan actors, to not say they're
1368000	1372400	acting in the interest of everyone, but actually be interesting, acting national interests,
1372960	1378320	but that certain countries will actually have to sacrifice their advantages, right? They'll
1378320	1384320	actually have to sacrifice their advantages in order to secure any possible viable future for
1384320	1387680	other countries who don't have an opportunity to actually save themselves because of the position
1387680	1393200	they've been put in by those countries who need to make a sacrifice, right? So there can't be
1393200	1397040	anything like good faith conversation between the global north and the global south,
1397040	1400560	until the global north is like, hey, we're going to make some sacrifices for you guys.
1402240	1407680	And so and that story can be said, you know, east west, like north south, like this is a
1408720	1414800	very complex situation. And so it requires a form of, let's just say, moral judgment,
1414800	1422320	post-conventional, post-formal operational, cosmo-centric, cosmopolitan moral judgment,
1422320	1428000	which is a rare human trait. I point to it in my book when I say, I can literally, as a human
1428000	1433040	development expert, I can point at those capacities that we're going to need, right? We're going to
1433040	1440400	need very complex forms of ethical self understanding, which position you within a local bioregion,
1440400	1444400	within some kind of national structure, within some kind of global structure,
1444400	1450800	probably within some kind of larger structure of universal value, ultimately. And that is not
1450800	1454960	something you get from the American public education system as it stands now, for example.
1455600	1464000	Like, we're not preparing post-conventional, dialectically thinking global citizens. We're
1464000	1470560	preparing basically simple minded consumers, sometimes consumers of cultural warfare, so
1470560	1476400	that they can participate in the entertainment of the culture wars. And so that's obviously an
1476400	1481040	adequate that's going to lead us to further into some kind of self terminating tribalization.
1481040	1487600	So you're pointing to the cosmopolitan consciousness as key. And it's going to be, like I said,
1487600	1498080	unequally distributed in terms of the cascade effects of risk, right? And Ulrich back pointed
1498080	1502080	this out in his work on the risk society, like that the risks are inevitably distributed.
1502080	1508240	Some people are kind of safe. Some people are relatively unsafe, right? And then the need for
1509040	1512880	getting out of your position of advantage and putting your position in a position of
1512880	1517120	basically sacrificing for the whole, that's going to be unequally distributed, right?
1518400	1527840	So it's become a very delicate situation where we need to avoid the pitfalls of those prior attempts
1528720	1537120	by the north and the west to try to like help out in the global south and elsewhere.
1537120	1545840	Well, we're going to need a way to flip that kind of relationship. And so, yeah, some of what's
1545840	1552560	taking place with social justice and kind of issues of race in the United States,
1553520	1559280	you know, these conversations will need to be expanded. Again, this is part of what I mean by
1559280	1563680	it's fundamentally an educational crisis. Even if we solve the technological problems,
1563680	1567600	we still have to resolve this history of injustice that we're living with.
1569360	1575440	Or else, who's going to want to join your future sustainable, super technologically awesome society?
1576480	1579600	Like it just doesn't make sense. Like we have to, there's a certain
1580240	1587360	healing at the level of culture and a willingness to somehow reengage in good faith again.
1589440	1593120	And so I don't know the kind of crisis that will ensue that will allow that
1593760	1599280	transformation of self understanding to unfold with a broad enough swath of people.
1600640	1609120	But yeah, I know as a human development person that it is, it is crises. It is crises and tragedy
1609120	1615600	often that can break the psyche open enough to actually transform.
1616960	1620240	So that would be one way to think about that.
1622240	1628880	I think it's incredibly helpful and important to bring history into this conversation.
1630160	1633360	Global history, which is something which has been somewhat missing from
1634160	1640320	the international relations scholarship in recent years. And there is a certain resurgence now
1640320	1644800	of a historical sensibility in the current scholarship. And the importance, of course,
1644800	1651040	of acknowledging militarism and economic imperialism. And I think what you just said, Zach,
1651040	1656560	there's a bracing clarity in understanding the ethical core of the challenge. And it reminds
1656560	1662640	me of Henry Shu, a prominent human rights scholar, writing in 1992 about the unavoidability of
1662640	1667760	justice when it comes to climate change and the crucial distinction between luxury emissions
1667760	1675200	and survival emissions. And that conversation has sort of crept in from time to time,
1675200	1680000	but it's rarely been at the foreground of how we actually deal with climate change,
1680000	1685920	the climate emergency. But I was curious to pick up on this idea of biases and the way
1685920	1691760	that we see the world. We're now almost halfway through this 50 year critical turning point.
1691760	1699120	So riffing on Wallerstein, but also say Gramski, is there more to what's going on right now
1699120	1706400	in the midst of COVID as well, than a host of morbid symptoms? You write in the book,
1707120	1713040	or you quote actually HG Wells, that the future is a race between catastrophe and education.
1713760	1719760	And you hold out the prospect of good educational futures emerging out of the present.
1720720	1727200	But it often seems to me or feels like there's not much space in the culture for exploring the
1727200	1736320	upside of risks and uncertainties. There's a certain sort of catastrophesism, that's the word.
1737680	1745280	And that in itself might be a kind of educational deficit. But I wonder then, how do we even get
1745360	1751680	started if our collective aversion to risk closes off the possibility of
1752960	1757600	accelerating in the direction of healthy radical transformation?
1760160	1765840	Yeah, this is interesting because I think there's two ways that there's two reactions
1765840	1772080	when you start to become aware of the existential risk landscape. I'll call them techno-optimist
1772080	1783920	and techno-pessimist. The techno-optimist basically talks themselves out of the idea that
1783920	1790720	there actually is a risk and puts a tremendous amount of faith in human problem-solving capacity.
1790720	1800240	And this is not an error. We're still here. We should maybe not be probabilistically
1800240	1807120	on many ledgers. It's actually a question, I think, for people who study existential risk.
1807120	1814160	Why are we still here? But that's a separate question. So with that, I think is a way to
1814160	1824080	avoid looking at the risk, really just having an overtly optimistic view of our ability to
1824080	1829440	solve these problems, usually with technology. The other way is also a way of averting looking
1829440	1833360	at the risk because you basically say there's nothing we can do about it and you go to the
1833360	1841200	techno-optimist view, which basically says it's over. It's done. Get ready basically to die.
1841200	1849600	Maybe we can reboot somehow after everything goes away, but technology has done us in.
1853600	1857600	And the truth is that when you look at the probabilities and you look at the extra landscape,
1857600	1864240	it's hard not to be pessimistic. So there's a huge moment of truth in the views. So there's
1864240	1872000	something about both of those extremes, which is partially right and partially wrong. And the bit
1872000	1876080	about education is a great example because this is what I'm doing my thinking. So right now,
1876080	1882720	I believe we have the most sophisticated communication technologies ever for delivering
1882720	1890640	propaganda directly into people's minds. Those very same tools could be used to make the most
1890640	1897120	powerful educational infrastructure that has ever been created. And so this is this notion of we're
1897120	1902720	getting exponential information technology in particular. It's disrupting the educational
1903360	1908640	dynamics of intergenerational transmission. It's making us go insane right now. We're all going
1908720	1913280	insane because we're being deeply propagandized by these things we're holding in the palm of
1913280	1918880	our hand that are basically making us addicted to staring at them. All of that same infrastructure,
1918880	1925840	were we to retool it, could be used to actually customize the delivery of truly educational
1925840	1932400	material. This is basically the crux of my argument that we're misusing the potentialities of the
1932400	1939040	digital. And we could potentially wield them in the interest of unprecedented education and
1939040	1945040	unprecedented kind of capacities for having a complex open society. And so many of the technologies
1945040	1952560	that we have have this double-sided nature to them. Artificial intelligence is another one.
1953600	1957680	You can go techno-optimist or techno-pessimist on the artificial intelligence thing.
1958640	1963680	And both of those are right and wrong. And the truth of the matter is that
1966240	1971840	yeah, there's always going to be
1975600	1984000	a lack of determinism around what the outcome of a technological innovation is. So this is my view,
1984080	1988640	like following Mumford and Marshall McLuhan and others. There are certain things that are laid out
1988640	1993760	that are that come with the technology. And then there's this space of freedom around the technology
1993760	1999920	as to where and how and when the technology gets used. And so I think right now we're not even close
1999920	2004000	to doing what the digital could do in the realm of education because we're using it for entertainment
2004000	2012640	and propaganda because it's profitable. But at a certain point, we're a group to decide like a
2013120	2018720	country-sized group or even like a city-state where a group decide to retool these things
2018720	2024160	precisely for education. They would have a tremendous asymmetric advantage very rapidly,
2024960	2029600	epistemically over the entire rest of the world who's misusing the tools.
2032080	2037440	So that's like a glimmer. And there's many of these glimmers of hope right at the heart of the
2037440	2043600	darkness like right in the place where all of the propaganda is coming from. It's like right in
2043600	2051120	there that there's actually the potential for profound educational possibilities. And I end
2051120	2056240	amending up sounding a lot like a Marxist here. I'm not a Marxist. But that idea that capitalism
2056240	2061440	builds out this massive global structure of technology and then right as it's about to lock in,
2062080	2068720	it flips and that same technology becomes the infrastructure of freedom. That's a very
2068720	2078320	interesting idea. So yeah, that's one way I think. Again, just one way to think about that.
2079600	2086720	Yeah, fantastic. Thanks Zach. Hope right in the darkness. That's a phrase to ponder I think.
2087440	2094400	Okay, I'm going to hand over to Jess. Jess, please. Yes. Thanks so much Zach for everything
2094400	2101920	you've shared so far. Coming off this idea of propaganda and the tech tools that deliver it to
2101920	2111360	us as a foremost teacher-lead authority in our society right now. How and if it is retooled
2111920	2119440	to become a source of mass delivery for education, how will it be established in a culture which is
2119440	2126240	often suspicious of authority claims? I mean, as a child growing up when the internet was just
2126240	2130720	becoming widespread, we were always told not to believe what you read on the internet. And I think
2130720	2135440	some kids have maybe lost that as it's become more and more ubiquitous throughout our lives.
2135440	2140080	But if it does in the future become something positive, quote unquote, or
2141360	2147120	you know, dependable, how do you think the population would react to that and will it be a
2147120	2153920	smooth transition? It's very interesting. And yeah, I have this term teacher-lead authority,
2153920	2160480	which I use a lot in my book and it hinges on this. It hinges on what's the nature of legitimate
2160480	2165440	teacher-lead authority and how do you know when you've got it in a context that's
2166320	2171600	saturated with illegitimate teacher-lead authority. And so the classic example is a school, right?
2171600	2176480	The school and their students and teachers, right? Students have to be there because they're forced
2176480	2182160	to be there. The teachers are there because they get paid. The teachers have teacher-lead authority
2182160	2187840	by virtue of their bureaucratic position in relation to the student, right? So most students
2187840	2193760	experience teachers as teachers, not necessarily because they're super smart and like really good
2193760	2199200	at being teachers, but because this is their job. And so we're in an environment where there's an
2199200	2205920	inorganic, let's call it inorganic, bureaucratically mediated teacher-lead authority, right? Now,
2205920	2214160	sometimes in those contexts, your high school teacher is a teacher. Like, he's brilliant and
2214160	2219680	he's really good at teaching you. And you've kind of fallen in love with the idea that like this man
2219680	2222800	can like change your whole mind. I'm speaking about one teacher, I'm remembering this teacher,
2222800	2228320	I had an high school, right? And so all of a sudden in this bureaucratically mediated teacher-lead
2228320	2232880	authority, where often you encounter a teacher who's lazy and you don't understand them and you
2232880	2237360	don't know why they became a teacher and you think it's bullshit. There is actually a beacon of
2237360	2241520	legitimate teacher-lead authority. And you can recognize legitimate teacher-lead authority
2241520	2248080	because one of the main things it's doing is trying to make itself obsolete. It wants you
2248080	2254160	to be able to do what it does. Like by definition, a good teacher is trying to get you up to their
2254160	2259680	level and maybe actually get you to go beyond their level. So one of the ways you know when
2259680	2265760	you're looking at like the media or you're looking at a pundit or someone who's speaking is,
2266480	2275520	are they actually encouraging you and giving you what you need to detach yourself from being
2275520	2282240	their student forever, right? Or are they addicting to you to them, excuse me, are they
2282240	2286320	are you becoming addicted to them as the only source of information you can trust and use,
2287120	2291840	right? So this becomes a very interesting dynamic when you look at the media landscape.
2292720	2299920	And when you look specifically at the discussion of science in the media and the disconnect between
2299920	2305280	the stories the media tell and the complexity of the science that's happening and their attempt to
2305280	2311120	run interference on readers so that you don't go to the primary source material, that you're not
2311120	2316720	actually equipped to be able to be smarter about the issue than this random journalist who actually
2316720	2322080	isn't a virologist, right? It's journalist, not a virologist. It's never studied vaccines, right?
2323280	2325920	Are they putting me in a position to actually understand the issue?
2326880	2333360	Are the actual major institutions involved giving me the information I need to be truly
2333360	2338320	informed about the issue or not? Or are they just basically telling me what to do pretending to be a
2338320	2346880	teacherly authority? So you're right, we've become suspicious of teacherly authority because we have
2346880	2355680	good reason to be. Most of what takes place in the fourth estate, which is supposed to be, you
2355680	2361360	know, journalism and the press and supposed to be an educational institution, most of what's
2361360	2368480	taking place there is not by any definition looking like legitimate teacherly authority.
2370640	2377280	And so, but the saving grace, and this gets to your point, the saving grace is that when that
2377280	2383520	high school teacher appears, he gets a posse, like students are like, that's the real deal.
2384880	2388960	Like that's someone who actually cares and is actually trying to empower us, like actually
2388960	2393520	trying to give us the capacities and the skills that we could become our own teachers, right?
2394880	2404800	So I do think that if you build the system correctly, and you have the kind of stepwise access
2404800	2410160	to deeper and deeper and deeper information and empowerment epistemically, where there's no
2410160	2416560	invisible ceiling of a epistemic asymmetry, where the populace is like, all right, on the other side
2416640	2422960	of this, those guys know what's going on, which is what it feels right now. Most people feel
2422960	2427520	like no one really trusts the media. We do what the media tells us because we're socially pressured
2427520	2432880	to use certain words and to have certain beliefs, especially in social media. But if you look at
2432880	2437120	the statistics, most people just simply don't trust the media. They have allegiance to certain
2437120	2442240	ones because they're useful in cultural warfare, but they don't actually really trust what's being
2442240	2448400	said by the media. And so when you have this kind of duplicity and this deep sense that, well,
2448400	2454400	somebody must know what's actually going on. And so there's this deep suspicion and this lays,
2454400	2458640	of course, the groundwork for much of the cultural dysfunction we're seeing around, you know, so-called
2458640	2463280	conspiracy theories and things of that nature, which emerge from the sense of somehow there's a
2463280	2472160	ceiling of epistemic asymmetry, that the main kind of media, like news media, social media,
2472160	2478960	the ways we're supposed to get up and into understanding the world, don't give or don't
2478960	2485680	kind of work in context of legitimate teacherly authority. So it's a widespread and deep problem
2485680	2490000	because now we're cynical about the idea that there could even be teacherly authority. So I
2490000	2493120	think to your point where someone said, don't believe what you read online. I don't think
2493760	2498240	kids forgot that. I think it's that they don't believe what they read online, which means they
2498240	2502080	don't believe anything because all they do is read online. So it becomes, it moves from like,
2502080	2507120	there's a true story and then there's this crazy online stuff to just like, there's just crazy
2507120	2513200	online stuff. And the idea that there's a true story somewhere, that's not even really an idea
2513200	2519760	anymore. I'm telling you, like, when you look at the epistemologies of people under 20, what you
2519760	2527680	end up getting is a kind of widely diffuse epistemic nihilism, you know, where there's this fusion
2527680	2535280	between entertainment and belief, and a fusion between a need to have in-group membership in a
2535280	2542560	cultural war and motivated reasoning to believe certain things. So the sense of like having
2543520	2550320	an integrist truth and an orientation towards ongoing learning and having access to stuff
2550320	2556320	that would allow you to do that and that would encourage doing that. These are cultures like
2556320	2562480	that are few and far between right now and hard to find, but they need to be created. And I think
2562480	2568960	when they are, I do think people will be attracted to them because most people don't trust the media,
2568960	2573120	but they want to know what's going on. Like people want to know, it's not that people don't want to
2573120	2579840	know, it's that there's a certain cynicism or nihilism about the prospect of success of knowing
2580400	2585600	that we've been disadvantaged in our ability to know. And there's a lot to say there, some of the
2585600	2591040	research I'm doing now is on the nature and the history of propaganda and information warfare
2591040	2597760	and communication sciences. And it's a long history, you know, decades and decades and decades,
2597760	2603920	we've been working on how to kind of like manipulate large populations through communication
2603920	2612080	science, often with a kind of technocratically benevolent notion that the masses need to be
2612080	2617920	helped in making the right decision. And that brings us back to that prior point I made about
2617920	2621360	the relation between the epistemic elites and the so-called people.
2621360	2631680	Yes, that point really resonated with me, especially it gave me the idea that it seems
2631680	2638320	that true education, where everyone can have access to a primary source, is mutually exclusive
2638320	2645280	from control and power. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that and whether the epistemic
2645280	2651840	elite or high-level policymakers would ever be motivated to relinquish control and power that
2651840	2658080	has been designed and fueled through this structure of propaganda and entertainment media?
2659440	2666640	It's a very, very good question. The relationship between power and education and the relationship
2666640	2674720	between power and teacherly authority in particular. It's funny because I say teacherly
2674720	2678960	authority and everyone thinks like a school and I use that context, but actually it's the mother and
2678960	2686160	the child or the parent, the parenting one and the child, where you get that most basic, actually
2686160	2696960	most kind of like anthropologically primordial case of teacherly authority. And what you see in
2696960	2705440	that relationship is in fact the power, like the power of the mother over the child. Let's
2705440	2713040	talk about that. What kind of power is that? It's not the same power as what Roy Baskar and others
2713040	2719120	would call power over, like the political power, having access to the legitimate use of force
2719120	2726560	or the legitimate use of bureaucratic mechanism to punish basically. So the power of the mother
2726560	2734080	over the infant is actually the power of care. And so it's a legitimate asymmetry. The mother's
2734080	2741040	larger, stronger, literally provides sustenance to the child and then teaches the child all kinds of
2741040	2746240	things without even intending to do so. The child instinctively puts itself in relationship to the
2746240	2755600	mother as teacher. And so it's not about the absence of power that you get legitimate teacherly
2755600	2761680	authority. It's about a particular kind of power, a power of care or a power of love that binds people
2761680	2767280	in a relationship that's completely non-coercive. It's completely non-coercive. We associate power
2767280	2773680	with coercion and that's what most political power is. But there's actually a power, Habermas would
2773680	2778880	call it, like the unforced force of the better argument. That's an example of legitimate teacherly
2778880	2783280	authority. Or it's like, why do I agree with you? I'm not agreeing with you because you're going to
2783280	2789680	beat me up or because I get in trouble or I get shunned from my in-group. I'm agreeing with you
2789680	2795280	because that is a better argument than the arguments I've heard, the force of logic, right?
2795280	2801440	The force of reason compels me, not the force of physical. So the power of a strong argument
2801440	2806560	is an example of the power that's in legitimate teacherly authority. Now, when you try to merge
2806560	2812560	teacherly authority with bureaucratic power, that's when you get that situation where now you can't
2812560	2817760	tell. Am I doing what this teacher tells me because I respect them the way I might respect
2817760	2822240	my mother and am I vibing with them through love and teacherly authority? Or is it I have
2822240	2826880	to do this because otherwise I get punished? They have the legitimate use of bureaucratic force over
2826880	2833920	me as a student. And similarly with the media and social media, things of that nature. And of
2833920	2840640	course, political speeches and the communication scientists that kind of roll out political
2840640	2849200	platforms. There's always this question about the form of power that's in play. And
2851920	2857520	the degree to which we can say that we are consenting with full knowledge of what our
2857520	2867920	situation is or not. And so yeah, I think in an ideal world, you would have conditions of education
2867920	2873920	where there wasn't the opportunity to confuse those two forms of power. Where you gravitated to
2873920	2881760	particular teachers and you gravitated to particular courses of study because of the power of the
2882800	2888560	teacherly, of the power of the true argument, the power of the curiosity, the power of the
2888560	2895760	attraction between teacher and student, the epistemic humility and these kinds of qualities.
2896720	2900960	Whereas now it's often the case and has been with the public schools that
2902160	2907200	there is a certain, there's a certain coercion that takes place in just getting a kid to go to school.
2908480	2914080	You know, like literally you have to kid, like even if you don't want to. So yeah, so I think
2914960	2923760	those, the kind of like the power over the political power and then this other form of power
2923760	2928880	which we, which we're not as familiar with, like power gets a bad name and what I'm trying to say
2928880	2934400	is like there's actually this, there is this form of power. You know, like when you see Martin
2934400	2939840	Luther King speak, for example, it's a different kind of power, like there's a power of persuasion
2939840	2946080	that's not coercion or there's a power to educate that's not propaganda. And so these kinds of
2946080	2949520	distinctions are some of the stuff I'm working on for the Consilience Project because it becomes
2949520	2953600	essential as the information environment gets more complex for people who'd be able to tell
2953680	2958800	what's the difference here. Is this person sincerely trying to educate me or are they just
2958800	2965120	doing one of their shticks and trying to, you know, basically, so yeah, so this is a good question.
2965120	2969440	And again, I'm just like touching on it. There's, there's a lot of, a lot of complexity there.
2970960	2977440	Yeah, fantastic. Fascinating. Yeah, definitely. This idea of power as protein,
2978160	2983520	it's really something which often is difficult to grasp. There's a certain
2985680	2993120	allergic reaction to shifting the focus away from, say, the material, the tangible,
2993120	2998640	but clearly it's absolutely vital. Perhaps just to rip a bit on Jesse's personal reflection,
2999600	3006640	you know, as, as an academic, as a child of Fukuyama, I sometimes do wonder,
3007440	3013280	who are we as educators to tell future generations what to think or what to do
3014080	3023200	with this world that we're sort of leaving them? And as educators, what if our ideas about the
3023200	3033280	future are no longer relevant, which is a pretty disconcerting thought? And I wonder, how can we
3033280	3043440	distinguish between those legacy ideas and frames that must be salvaged and those that really we
3043440	3051280	should consider relinquishing? And it's disconcerting not only because it, because it leaves you
3051280	3056960	disorientated, but also perhaps because it feels disempowering to consider that it kind of undercuts
3058880	3062880	the conviction that you can change things for the better.
3066000	3069600	Yeah, this is, is a very foundational question in the philosophy of education,
3070960	3076960	which is, you know, what is the knowledge and skill and capacity, even the disposition,
3077600	3080880	dispositions and forms of personality? Like, what are those things that we should be
3081760	3090320	handing on to the next generation? It's a book by Margaret Mead. I want to say 61. I don't remember
3090320	3094400	exactly culture and commitment. It's the name of the book. And it's amazing. It's a fascinating book.
3094400	3097920	She talks about these three forms of culture, which is really talking about three forms of
3097920	3102960	intergenerational transmission. There's a post figurative culture. This is what human cultures
3102960	3108000	were forever. That's when what your dad-dads did, your dad did. That's what you're going to do.
3108560	3116080	Like, you can just know as an elder, like I will hand on to my kids what basically they need,
3116080	3120480	and things just don't change. And the kids can be like, they really know how the world works.
3121760	3125760	And it's a post figurative, right? And then there are what are called
3126160	3130880	configurative cultures. And that's where you have some of the post figurative stuff
3131440	3136000	and stuff going on within generations where you're changing what your parents gave you a little bit.
3136800	3143040	So you're getting peer-to-peer changes in technology, which slightly augment intergenerational
3143040	3149520	transmission. And so not just the sheer tradition of the post figurative, a certain amount of
3149520	3155440	innovation. And that's what began when, especially and took off with, again, back to Wallerstein,
3155440	3160720	the birth of the capitalist world system. Her argument is that there's a thing called a prefigurative
3160720	3168640	culture. And that's where basically, like, those bets are off because things are changing so rapidly
3169280	3175840	that the world that the children will inhabit is not understandable by the elders today.
3176320	3183200	Right? So it's a very, very novel situation in the evolution of human culture now. It happened
3183200	3188720	occasionally in the past when there was an invading army, or there was a massive storm,
3188720	3194800	or there was desertification. And in a generation or two, the entire life, you know, of a culture
3194800	3199920	changed when that was a rare cataclysmic event. Our technological development and economic development
3199920	3206880	and political development is such that now we are generating those types of total world
3206880	3212560	transformation within a single generation. And so what that means is that, to your point,
3212560	3215920	we have no idea really what to tell the kids about what Tamara is going to be like.
3217200	3222640	We actually need to find ways to have them listen to the future and then give them the
3222640	3229520	help that they realize that they need. So, and this has been seen by educators since the 60s,
3229520	3235280	when it became clear that you all are preparing these kids for jobs that will not be there in 20
3235280	3241440	years when they graduate. And that problem has compounded to the sense of that we can no longer
3241440	3249040	think simply about that form. But at an even deeper level, the intergenerational crisis is one of
3249040	3255200	both the children not thinking that the elders know how the world works, right, and being skeptical
3255200	3260080	that, well, aren't you the guys that messed up this world? Like, why should we learn from you?
3260080	3265760	You created this mess. But it's also the elders realizing that is the elders saying,
3266480	3271920	we're a failed, we're failed beings, like we're a failed species, like what have we done? How can
3271920	3277600	we teach the kids what to do? And so, and that's part of that prefigurative culture, like those
3277600	3284400	reflections are correct, but they're not quite fair to each side of the generational gap that
3284400	3293600	there's a situation that's emerged that came unplanned, but has basically left the youth kind
3293600	3299600	of stranded at the edge of history without any elders to tell them what tomorrow will look like
3299600	3304720	or how to handle it. So the elders, what they need to do is step in and hold education in a
3304720	3309040	completely different way. And this is kind of the argument of my book, that we need to
3310000	3316160	reground education of the youth in the communities that they live and in the concrete problems of
3316160	3324960	those communities, right, which is to say something a little bit more like guild systems and skill and
3324960	3331760	time sharing networks and non-age segregated classrooms and a whole bunch of other stuff
3331760	3339520	that allow the education system to be responsive to the novel insights of youth who
3340640	3346080	know more about what might emerge in the future than the elders can pretend to know.
3347120	3353120	And so I think that's, it's a lot to swallow, but it's completely necessary. And it doesn't mean
3353120	3357600	that there isn't a role for intergenerational transmission. It means that of the skills that
3357600	3365360	we have as elders, let the kids tell us which ones they believe are relevant. And so that's,
3365360	3373120	that's, I think, I think that's key. And then some of it's also the shifting of focus away from,
3374240	3379600	again, technical skills and into what might be called skills of wisdom or skills of ethics,
3380560	3389120	that a lot of what is needed from the elders is that, like, don't tell us how to solve these
3389120	3396080	problems or how to organize our future economic lives or anything like that, but please share
3396080	3407280	stories of human suffering, of human love, of human overcoming difficulty. The continuity of the human
3407360	3415760	is at risk. It's a strange way to say it, but this is has been reflected upon by technologists
3415760	3422560	and others that if the generation gap becomes acute enough, it becomes almost like a speciation
3422560	3430640	event where the youth become a new kind of being that almost can't be understood, that we can't.
3430640	3436000	Like if we were to genetically engineer superhumans, this would be the situation we would have
3436640	3442080	extincted ourselves by virtue of giving birth to a new species and that would be an intergenerational
3442080	3449120	gap that's unbridgeable. So that, you know, with the rate of technological change and specifically
3449120	3455120	the information technology and the neurological effects and the cascades of all those on human
3455120	3463600	physiology, yeah, the generation gap approaches almost unbridgeable speciation event. So that
3463600	3470240	means that, yeah, how do we educate those who will come after us who are not like us? It looks like
3470240	3478000	I said creating very different contexts and allowing more epistemic humility on the part of
3478000	3485760	the elders, but it's risky because the kids, they're just, they're still youth. It's not like,
3485760	3491280	I'm also not making an argument of like, you know, the indigo kids are like that they're instantly,
3491360	3495920	you know, adapting to the technology and that the millennials are like way smarter than any
3495920	3500320	other generation. They're going to figure it out. I'm also not saying that. Like there needs to be
3500320	3505600	intergenerational transmission. The prefigure of culture that I mentioned doesn't just throw its
3505600	3509840	hands up and say, let the kids do whatever it wants. It says no, it's we're in a fundamentally
3509840	3515200	different situation of intergenerational transmission. It's actually more attention is needed. We need
3515200	3522000	to be more careful to pulling out the responsiveness and the kind of native intelligence of the youth
3523520	3528080	than just giving them rote curriculum that we've been giving for a decade. So there's some asking
3528080	3532960	for more attentiveness on the part of the elders and the youth, more intergenerational
3532960	3540560	transmission, just of a different kind. And it's not the case that the youth are prepared
3540560	3549600	or instantly adapted or evolved for it. They're not. So yeah, the nature of our responsibility
3549600	3556480	as educators has changed. I think the the question of differences of generation is such an
3556480	3561600	interesting one. And I was wondering if we think of a hypothetical new generation in a
3561600	3568000	utopian society that is not a generation of knowers. So a generation that's been raised on
3568000	3573680	knowing stuff, knowing things, but a generation of thinkers, I think we've skirted around and
3573680	3578160	we've addressed as well some of the real benefits of that, you know, a generation of thinkers,
3578160	3582560	but I just wanted to red team for a second and think of what are some of the challenges
3583200	3588480	of having a generation of thinkers, because the instruments we have at our disposal
3589920	3594240	aren't geared towards a generation of thinkers. And I was just really interested to
3594240	3599360	get the kind of red team assessment of a generation of thinkers and how that might
3600480	3608880	what a diagnosis of that. That's interesting. I mean, there's a long so I've read a lot of the
3608880	3614480	history of education, you know, and, and some histories of education are triumphant, especially
3614480	3621120	about the American education system that, you know, we were made into a society of thinkers
3621120	3627680	and etc. Then you get other people like John Taylor Gatto, and like Jonathan Cozel and others,
3628400	3633440	even Chomsky and some foods, who would look at the American public education system as basically
3633440	3639840	doing the opposite. And so the argument there, you know, and even goes to the Dowdy Ching,
3639840	3645440	right, keep the people's bellies full, but their minds empty. I think that's how you govern
3645760	3652480	it by precisely not really educating. And I'm not saying that that view is true. I'm saying
3652480	3659200	there's enough people writing that history to suggest that at least one of the kind of like
3660160	3666480	functions of the educational system as we have known it is to simplify the range of diversity
3666480	3671600	of thought in the populace, right? Like, you can think about preparing them for the workforce,
3671680	3676000	you can think about preparing them to be consumers, but you need to basically be able to predict
3677280	3681120	what people are going to think. And part of that is to weave the culture together.
3681840	3687680	But part of that is to simplify the human side of the equation. And so it started
3687680	3692480	to happen with the internet, and it continues to happen, although the marketers have figured out
3692480	3698560	how to do a standardized differentiation. Instead of like the early modern one size fits all
3698560	3703040	homogenization, now we have the late modern or postmodern standardized differentiation,
3703040	3706400	where there's two dozen advertising groups that think you're unique, but you're not.
3707280	3715040	So they figured that out. But it's still the case that if you promote a culture of learning,
3715040	3722080	and you promote a culture not of ingesting and regurgitating, or in a culture of knowing and
3722080	3728160	knowing and resisting change of thought, but a culture where people are truly interested
3728160	3734160	in learning and thinking, then you better have a culture that's ready to have truly an open society
3734160	3739360	for governance and decision making, and an economic system that has true transparency
3739360	3743840	and visibility around commodity supply chains, and ethical responsibilities of corporations,
3743840	3749280	and the society that got transparency around law enforcement, and the criminal justice system.
3749280	3755120	There's a whole bunch of stuff that you can kind of keep a mess, like not in good order,
3755120	3759680	if you've got a society of folks who really aren't equipped to be paying attention,
3760640	3764960	but if you equip people to pay attention, then they're going to start paying attention.
3765840	3769120	And so that's part of the arguments that have been unfolding for such a long time
3770400	3777280	around this kind of negative view of education, that there's been a manufacturing of consent,
3777280	3785920	and kind of an arrangement of selective inattention, which is like a psychological defense mechanism,
3785920	3790720	right? So if I'm a neurotic person, and let's say I'm just not very nice to the people who
3790720	3796080	look close to me, I will selectively not attend to those behaviors, which disconfirm my view of
3796080	3799520	myself as being a good person. And so I'm so frustrating to be with someone who has these
3799520	3804080	neuroses, because it's so clear that you're doing this, that you can't see, because you're
3804080	3808320	defending yourself. It's a defense mechanism, selective inattention. And so similarly at the
3808320	3817200	cultural level, we're taught not to think about certain things. We're taught to studiously ignore
3817840	3824480	certain ways of framing problems. Selective inattention is part of the education system.
3824480	3828560	So if we start to remove those defense mechanisms, that's what you're talking about,
3828560	3830960	which is what you want to do in psychotherapy, but when that happens,
3831200	3837760	you know, you get a divorce, you change your job, like you move, like start having crazy dreams,
3837760	3842960	like your whole life changes, right? And so this is what we need. We need some kind
3842960	3847840	of cultural renaissance, if we need the equivalent of a midlife crisis or a resolution of the
3847840	3853920	adolescent identity crisis for the whole culture. But it will be, there'll be a reckoning,
3854480	3861440	there'll be a reckoning. And so that kind of has to happen. So that would be the downside,
3861440	3867360	it would be the reckoning, and that you can't predict what will happen,
3868240	3872640	in the way you can predict what will happen when you're systematically nudging everybody into
3872640	3877280	particular groups and then predicting what those groups will be, which is what's happening now.
3878160	3887440	Yeah, that question, what am I studiously ignoring? Maybe that's one to open up a seminar with.
3889440	3895680	So we're rolling, I think, to the close, that so much more we could discuss. I hope we might be
3895680	3900880	able to continue this conversation at some time down the road. But I'd like to hand over to Zoe
3901600	3908480	to lead us out. So I think my questions are still very much percolating in my mind.
3908480	3914080	So if I'm not as coherent or eloquent as the rest of you, I apologize. So we've kind of talked
3914080	3921200	about a society or like a generation of thinkers and knowers. But I'm also quite interested in
3921200	3927520	pulling on what you mentioned about the power through love. And so thinking about generations
3927520	3933600	of feelers, because I feel like, I mean, even in generations of people or like relatives, cousins,
3933600	3938800	and whatnot younger than myself, you mentioned nihilism, and it's almost like there's a competition
3938800	3944080	to see who can care the least. And caring and feeling is seen as sort of a weakness and something
3944080	3951040	that's that should be weeded out. So I guess my question is sort of, how do we make those younger
3951040	3955760	generations feel cared for and loved, in a way that they're not going to reject and be like,
3955760	3960320	oh, this is this is cringy. And I you don't understand me. So it's also into
3960880	3966640	tying into intergenerational gap. But I guess also across, you mentioned an epistemic elite.
3966640	3973760	And that's, in my mind, also, we are hoarding in the epistemic elites, the potential for intergenerational
3973760	3979040	transmission of these essential human capacities. And I do, for me, anyway, I do feel like a lot of
3979040	3984000	that will come from better handling of your emotions, and maybe de-celebritizing, actually
3984000	3988960	caring about things and being very vocal about caring without worrying that you would be seen as,
3989520	3995040	I don't know, vulnerable or weak or irrelevant. Sorry, if that's a bit all over the place.
3995040	3999280	Now, that's a very profound question. I mean, the one thing you said in passing was that the
3999280	4004720	epistemic elite were hoarding a certain command. That's a that's like a key insight that and there
4004720	4014320	has been for a long time, a false scarcity of cognitive supply, false scarcity of cognitive
4014320	4020560	resources, a artificially generated scarcity. And so that's important to get. And some of what has
4020560	4025920	been made scarce are the conditions for the possibility of love. I mean, this is one of the
4025920	4031600	main reasons in my book, I talk about these social miracles. It's really about creating a society
4032480	4038960	where people are don't have to be courageous to love one another, right? Because like,
4040320	4047040	if you don't love anyone, then you can't get hurt. Full stop. Like, if I love you a lot and you die,
4047680	4052960	I'm in a lot of pain. If I love you a lot and you do something that disappoints me, I'm in a lot
4053520	4058880	of pain. So there's a kind of defense mechanism psychologically to in a world where you can't
4058960	4063040	predict what's going to happen to the people that you love, right? Well, you can you don't even know
4063040	4066960	if you can get up to where you want to go to be economically or whatever, or to get the skills
4066960	4075920	you want to have the self understand, like, because of the sense of precarity that many people feel.
4077120	4081600	There is a and most of that I believe is economic and politically generated.
4081840	4089680	There is a there's a tendency, yes, to withdraw into the isolated atomized individual and take a
4089680	4095120	cynical view towards anything that would deepen connection and love because of the risk that's
4095120	4101680	there. So one of the things the elders can do is actually demonstrate the courage that it takes
4101680	4108480	to love in a world that's well, in a world that in an unworlded world, if I can say that,
4109040	4114160	in a time between worlds, right? And it's when you're in a world it's easier to love because you
4114160	4119840	can say, oh, here's how the world works. It's safe to love you because I've got this many years
4119840	4124960	before my life is disrupted or whatever, right? But right now, there's this danger. So we need
4124960	4132720	to do the opposite. And and and so the I do not like the phrase emotional intelligence. So I talk
4132720	4139360	about like emotional self regulation and emotional self awareness and the languages of emotional
4139360	4146080	self description and emotional connection. And these are as essential, if not more essential,
4146080	4151120	and especially to notions of ethical identity. So right, if you think about the situation we're
4151120	4157920	going to end up in, as the wheels start to come off, I talk a lot about, you know, that parable
4157920	4165520	of the Good Samaritan, like what do you do when you meet someone a stranger on the road between
4165520	4170240	civilizations, which means you're not beholden to the law of either of those civilizations or on the
4170240	4175040	road or in the wilderness, there's no cops going to show up, right? No one's going to come and tell
4175040	4181120	you you disobey the laws of the city, you're just a stranger in need on the road, just you and him.
4181680	4188080	And in the Bible, God, what do you do, right? We're going to be confronted with that kind of
4188080	4194320	situation, where we're meeting strangers on the road, and sometimes with those strangers that we
4194320	4202560	numerous. And it's not a it's not a cognitive question. It's not a calculation or a game
4202560	4208240	theoretic relationship that needs to be taken up. It's a problem of feeling. That's a problem of
4208240	4216560	the human heart and the ability of the human to see another human as a human. And so, yeah, those
4216560	4224080	are the deeper, the deeper kind of strata of the personality, which are also in play right now. So
4224080	4230320	I'm glad you raised that. And, you know, the approaches that I've seen in this area, social
4230320	4235760	emotional skills, mindfulness, education and things like those nature are good and important.
4236560	4242640	But again, to speak to them kind of psychotherapeutic context, we're going to need to learn how to
4242640	4251280	process intense emotion to not just to be calm, but to figure out how to deal with grief, sorrow,
4251920	4258640	tragedy, righteous anger, there's a whole bunch of stuff that we need to be able to work with,
4259360	4265360	aside from just like staying calm and I meditate a lot. But the point is that you need to be able to
4265600	4271120	to move emotion through you in a complex way. So, yeah, so that's a whole other,
4271920	4277040	whole other, you open to giant can of emotional worms there, but it's an important one. And I
4277040	4282560	can't see a way out of it without. And again, I've listed in my book, I can't remember which page,
4282560	4290800	but it's post-conventional ethics, but also like, you know, these really, really,
4291440	4296480	robust forms of emotional self-regulation and emotional self-understanding,
4296480	4302800	which allow for actual real empathy. So, yeah, thank you for, for bringing that up.
4304240	4308320	Well, thank you for such a comprehensive answer and just a really thought-provoking conversation.
4308320	4312640	It just stirred a lot of things in my mind and I'm sure I'll, I'll go in,
4313200	4317280	tell my mumble about it because I feel like she's very much, she's very much on the emotional
4317280	4320960	spectrum of things with, with me as so, so yeah, thank you very much.
4322400	4326160	Yeah, I'd like to echo that. Thanks so much for that. It's really a, kind of,
4326160	4332480	a very grounded, profound heartfelt conversation. We really appreciate it. And, you know, end on
4332480	4338880	that note that this is also a problem of feeling or of emotion. There is this tendency, I know,
4338880	4343680	well, to slide into kind of a full sense of objective detachment from these questions.
4344080	4350240	And, of course, as complexity science reminds us, there is actually no view from nowhere.
4351120	4358880	So, also, perhaps just to, just to end as to where we might go next in future conversations.
4358880	4363600	There clearly are insights and lessons to be drawn from other cultures here and what you
4363600	4370080	just reflected remind me a bit of Martin Prechtel's work, the Guatemalan spiritual teacher and his
4370080	4377120	impression of Western culture as drowning in kind of atomistic alienation. So, I think lots more
4377120	4384720	to explore there. And, yeah, there's a beautiful way to end this conversation on, on education
4384720	4391600	as, as the core challenge of our time. So, thank you. And look forward to picking this up again.
