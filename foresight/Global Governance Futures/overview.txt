Checking Global Governance Futures/Daniel Schmachtenberger â€“ Existential Risk and Phase Shifting to a New World System.txt
1. The conversation begins with a discussion about finding purpose beyond personal gain, focusing on the intrinsic value of protecting and preserving the beauty of the natural world and the importance of serving it out of love and appreciation rather than for what one can receive in return.

2. Daniel describes three modes of being: the mode of being (enjoying life, appreciating nature), the mode of doing (engaging in activities that contribute meaningfully to the world), and the mode of becoming (developing one's capacity to appreciate and contribute to the world).

3. He emphasizes the importance of discerning which mode one is operating in throughout the day or week and ensuring that actions align with personal values and contribute positively to the world.

4. Daniel shares that his work involves a blog called Civilization Emerging, which contains podcasts and older content, and introduces The Concliators Project (conciliatorsproject.org), an initiative aimed at guiding the decentralized innovation of social technologies to employ and guide exponential technology.

5. He invites listeners to engage with his work further by visiting his website or the project's site and expresses hope for future contributions and collaborations.

6. The episode concludes with a reminder for listeners to subscribe, leave comments, and stay tuned for more content from Imperfect Utopias, including Zoom calls, workshops, and events related to global governance and related topics.

Checking Global Governance Futures/Zak Stein - Why All Global Crises are Crises of Education.txt
 In this conversation, we discussed the importance of social-emotional skills, mindfulness, and post-conventional ethics in addressing the challenges of global governance. The participants highlighted that as the world becomes more interconnected, individuals must develop a deeper understanding of themselves and others to navigate complex emotional landscapes and act empathetically towards strangers, much like in the parable of the Good Samaritan.

The discussion underscored the significance of emotional regulation and self-understanding for genuine empathy, which is crucial in our increasingly interdependent world. The conversation also touched upon the potential insights from other cultures, particularly the work of Martin Prechtel, who has observed Western culture's struggles with atomistic alienation.

The overarching theme was that education is at the core of our time's challenges, and there is much more to explore in understanding how different cultural perspectives can inform and enhance our approach to global governance issues. The call concluded with a commitment to continuing the conversation and exploring these topics further in future Zoom calls, workshops, and events.
