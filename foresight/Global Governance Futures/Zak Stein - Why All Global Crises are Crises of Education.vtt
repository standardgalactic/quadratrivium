Hi and welcome to Global Governance Futures based out of the Global Governance Institute

00:07.280 --> 00:13.440
at University College London. This is a podcast about the challenges facing humanity

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
and possible global responses. If you're new to the show and you want to get a list of our favorite

00:20.000 --> 00:30.880
books, other resources, listen to past shows and join our community, go to ucl.ac.uk forward slash

00:30.880 --> 00:41.600
global dash governance. We're really excited to have Dr Zach Stein join us today. Zach is a writer,

00:41.600 --> 00:49.440
a futurist, a transformative educator, working to bring a greater sense of justice and sanity

00:49.440 --> 00:57.520
to education. Alongside Daniel Schmackenberger who featured in episode 12, Zach is also a founding

00:57.520 --> 01:04.480
member of the Consilience Project, a non-profit media organization aiming to improve public

01:04.480 --> 01:12.560
sense-making and democratic dialogue. Zach received his PhD in education from Harvard

01:12.560 --> 01:18.800
University where he studied educational neuroscience, human development and the philosophy

01:18.800 --> 01:26.880
of education. He's published dozens of articles and two books, his most recent book and one which

01:26.880 --> 01:33.520
really caught my attention is called Education in a Time Between Worlds and Grapples with the

01:33.520 --> 01:42.880
Dangers posed by a profound learning and capacity deficit in the face of civilization-wide transformations.

01:43.440 --> 01:50.080
It really is an incredibly rich and thought-provoking work and at the risk of oversimplifying,

01:50.080 --> 01:57.600
Zach argues that the world as we have known it is rapidly disappearing and as a result,

01:57.600 --> 02:06.480
radical transformation of our legacy education systems is now an urgent, even existential imperative.

02:07.200 --> 02:15.120
As he puts it, we can no longer assume, if we ever could, the unproblematic intergenerational

02:15.120 --> 02:20.000
transmission of essential human capacities for reasoning and reflection.

02:22.480 --> 02:28.800
So, in the spirits of the philosopher John Dewey, we're going to discuss today why Zach believes

02:28.800 --> 02:34.800
that at roots all current global crises might be best understood as crises of education

02:35.040 --> 02:43.600
and why as educators, learners and concerned planetary inhabitants, we should all care about that.

02:44.240 --> 02:49.360
So, we're super excited to get into this with you, Zach. Thanks so much for taking the time to

02:49.360 --> 02:55.920
speak with us. It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for inviting me. And before we get started,

02:55.920 --> 03:03.120
I'll just ask the poll crew to say hello. Hi, I'm Jessica. I work on the research and

03:03.120 --> 03:06.560
I'm very looking forward to hearing what Dr. Stein has to say today.

03:09.680 --> 03:15.280
Hi, my name is Sam. I do the audio and the video editing and hopefully some of the thinking.

03:17.360 --> 03:20.640
Hi, I'm Zoe. I help with the social media and running of the YouTube channel.

03:23.520 --> 03:31.680
Great. Okay. So, to open, Zach, perhaps you can help us set the scene. You describe in the book

03:31.680 --> 03:39.920
the years 2000 to 2050 as a critical turning point in the history of humanity and the planet.

03:40.640 --> 03:47.600
So, what is so special about this 50-year stretch and how does this this interregnum,

03:47.600 --> 03:51.440
how does this turning relate to the educational crisis?

03:53.520 --> 04:00.560
Yeah, so that specific time period. I took that on the cue of Immanuel Wallerstein,

04:00.560 --> 04:05.840
who was the creator of World Systems Analysis, which is this fascinating kind of approach to

04:05.840 --> 04:12.080
doing big history, specifically long-term stretches of the development of the capitalist

04:12.080 --> 04:17.840
world system. And he was actually following from complex dynamical system theory, like

04:17.840 --> 04:27.120
prigazine and things like that. And he saw this kind of like rhythm of changing in the basic

04:27.200 --> 04:34.000
organization of capitalism, this transformation of the hegemonic structure, as he called it.

04:34.640 --> 04:42.000
And so, you know, one occurred when we went from having capitalism being rooted in basically Venice

04:42.000 --> 04:48.320
to it being rooted with the Dutch and then from the Dutch to the British and then from the British

04:48.320 --> 04:54.560
to the United States. And each time that kind of hegemonic world system transformation, as Wallerstein

04:54.560 --> 05:00.960
would call it, occurred, whole swaths of culture, whole swaths of political life, whole swaths of

05:01.840 --> 05:10.800
the ecology and the humanity were changed. And he saw this in several other kind of like people

05:10.800 --> 05:16.000
doing actually quantitative analysis of large historical swaths of time, like Peter Turchin

05:16.000 --> 05:21.200
more recently have seen these actual, their rhythms, their cycles of historical transformation.

05:21.200 --> 05:27.680
And so Wallerstein says, Hey, we're about to be in one of these, we're about to be in a situation

05:27.680 --> 05:34.000
where, you know, the British kind of and then the Americans and now the Americans and now what

05:34.000 --> 05:41.360
basically is what Wallerstein saying is like the, the end of America as the dominant hegemonic force

05:41.360 --> 05:48.000
in the capitalist world system, he's predicting. And he's saying that for the first time the system

05:48.080 --> 05:53.520
is global. And that means that it's not clear that the hegemon can just move geographically,

05:53.520 --> 06:00.720
that we may be approaching something that looks more like a transformation of a deeper, more

06:00.720 --> 06:04.800
profound nature at the structure of the economic system itself. So this is where I got the idea.

06:05.680 --> 06:09.600
And then I started looking around at other thinkers who are also like even, you know,

06:09.600 --> 06:18.400
New Age thinkers and like futurists and, you know, anthropologists and other people pointing at the

06:18.400 --> 06:25.840
same kind of time period, basically. And so yeah, I brought that I pulled that in there and put it

06:25.840 --> 06:31.440
in the book just to make people aware that when I say we're in a time between worlds, like it's a,

06:31.440 --> 06:36.320
it's a technical phrase. Like if there's a, there's poetics in it, but it's actually a technical

06:36.320 --> 06:43.280
phrase. And it's referring to this basically almost inevitable historical unfolding of a very

06:43.280 --> 06:51.200
significant transformation in the techno economic and political base of our world. And the argument

06:51.200 --> 06:56.560
that I weave in there is that, hey, don't forget education. Like Wallerstein doesn't mention

06:56.560 --> 07:01.520
education. And my argument is basically that all those other things, economics, politics,

07:01.520 --> 07:06.880
warfare, technology, you don't get those without education. And it's interesting to me that people

07:06.880 --> 07:15.200
neglect that insight, it shows how taken for granted, much of the processes of intergenerational

07:15.200 --> 07:20.640
transmission have been. And so that's invisible when they become problematized in our society,

07:20.640 --> 07:25.200
because we take it for granted. Each time the capitalist world system changed, the nature of

07:25.200 --> 07:33.360
education itself changed. And so yeah, so that's, I'm pulling that bit out. And one thing that's

07:33.360 --> 07:43.440
interesting is that great historian, again, of capitalism, Jason Moore, his book, Capitalism

07:43.440 --> 07:50.000
and the Web of Life. It's an incredible book. He talks about not just like capitalist world systems,

07:50.000 --> 07:58.800
but world ecologies, which is to say the way that capital shapes the nature of the planetary

07:58.800 --> 08:07.840
biosphere, literally dams and canals and all of these things. And of course now, emissions and

08:07.840 --> 08:15.840
transformations in weather as a result of this. So we're having, and I know this in the book,

08:16.720 --> 08:23.200
we're having these crazy hockey stick patterns of major ecological transformation. At the same

08:23.200 --> 08:29.040
time, the underlying techno economic base is fundamentally transforming at the same time

08:29.600 --> 08:34.320
education is transforming. And I'm pointing at education as the thing that needs to be worked

08:34.320 --> 08:41.120
on basically first or as most primary, or at least not put on the back burner, like it's going to

08:41.120 --> 08:48.080
take care of itself. When in fact, most of the problems as you mentioned in the intro that we're

08:48.080 --> 08:54.800
looking at are our issues of skill deficit, capacity deficit, personality disorganization,

08:55.840 --> 09:04.560
low grade ubiquitous psychopathology. And so it's a complex psychological crisis, as much as it's

09:04.560 --> 09:10.720
an ecological or technological or political or economic crisis. So that's a little bit about

09:10.800 --> 09:16.960
that where that period came from. And I've been saying we were between worlds for,

09:17.600 --> 09:22.640
you know, five or six years. And then when the pandemic hit, people were like, oh,

09:22.640 --> 09:26.880
that's what you mean. I was like, yes. I was like, it's everything is fundamentally,

09:26.880 --> 09:31.360
we're in a liminal space, we can't go back or stabilize the prior system.

09:33.200 --> 09:38.400
We're going to be in a disequilibrated state. And this is Wallerstein's notion he's getting it

09:38.400 --> 09:43.360
from privileging complex open dynamical systems, right, they go through periods of turbulence

09:43.360 --> 09:49.120
before they restabilize. So we're in that period of turbulence and will remain in that period of

09:49.120 --> 09:56.720
turbulence, I'm saying for, for decades, until something new locks in. And the concern we have

09:56.720 --> 10:01.920
is that what's going to lock in is not going to be good. So there's a way to solve this problem that

10:02.000 --> 10:06.880
looks, for lack of a better word, like totalitarian or authoritarian.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.800
So, you know, the Consilience Project and my other work is trying to find a way to solve these

10:12.800 --> 10:20.320
problems that result in an open society on the other side of this kind of reorganization of the

10:20.320 --> 10:26.160
world system. So it's kind of like the broadest framing. Yeah, that's super helpful, Zach. Thank

10:26.160 --> 10:32.320
you. So maybe we'll sort of drill down a bit now into a concrete example. So thinking about climate

10:32.320 --> 10:38.880
change, I've been doing quite a bit of research recently on climate change. And there's a real

10:38.880 --> 10:46.400
sort of focus on, I'd even say fetish for CO2 metrics. We have this kind of war on carbon.

10:47.200 --> 10:54.080
And the solution ontology is really about sort of technology. So carbon capture storage, net

10:54.080 --> 11:00.640
zero, very current at the moment, very lively debate there. But also, you know, state multilateral

11:00.640 --> 11:04.880
agreement. This is a collective action problem. It's a political problem. If we can just,

11:05.520 --> 11:12.000
if we just see our way through that impasse, we can solve climate change. But we're 30 years down

11:12.000 --> 11:18.800
the road from Rio 1992, carbon emissions are yet to peak. And you argue in the book that the climate

11:18.800 --> 11:25.280
crisis is at root, not a problem of pollution or habitat destruction is actually a crisis of human

11:25.280 --> 11:34.960
decision making. So if you were speaking to some of our most highly educated elite decision makers,

11:34.960 --> 11:41.680
experts, and there I said, academics, what is it that we're not getting right?

11:41.680 --> 11:50.880
Yeah, there's at least kind of two ways to answer the question. One is that one of the things we're

11:50.880 --> 11:58.000
not getting right is the communication and education of those people who are not academics

11:58.000 --> 12:05.040
and who are not high level policy decision makers. So like, this is in part a decision making crisis

12:05.120 --> 12:11.520
and a capacities crisis among those epistemic elites, let's call them, and decision makers,

12:12.080 --> 12:19.120
who are laying out this solution ontology, right, inadequately. So there's something I'll get to

12:19.120 --> 12:24.240
that point, like what's wrong with the highest level models about the global situation and why

12:24.240 --> 12:32.400
those are inadequate. But prior to that, there's actually this issue that the degree of polarization

12:32.400 --> 12:40.000
around climate change, for example, in the United States, the degree of intensity, even though it's

12:40.000 --> 12:47.600
low grade, it will emerge again around escalating economic inequality. Like there's a series of

12:47.600 --> 12:55.280
things that require really complex educational initiatives, not involving the most elite decision

12:55.280 --> 13:00.960
makers, involving every citizen in an open society's understanding of the global situation.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.760
That we have not provided educational systems that brought people up and into a mature and

13:07.760 --> 13:16.560
complex view of the global situation. At least in the United States, you know, we're being entertained.

13:17.680 --> 13:22.240
We should be being informed and educated by the media, we're being entertained and brought into

13:22.880 --> 13:31.600
basically cultural war as a form of entertainment and catharsis. And so that's the first thing that

13:31.600 --> 13:41.280
these epistemic elites need to consider is that the people, so-called, can't just simply be told

13:41.280 --> 13:47.040
what to do when you figure out what the right policy is. This is the, remember, the scary

13:48.160 --> 13:54.080
lockdown of excuse the terminology on the other side of being between worlds is the option where

13:54.080 --> 14:00.480
we figure out the climate policy that works. We can't explain it to the people, quote unquote,

14:00.480 --> 14:07.680
the masses. So we have coercive legislation that basically mandates their behavior change

14:07.680 --> 14:13.120
without their understanding why the behavior change is necessary. And we saw this with the

14:13.120 --> 14:18.560
pandemic a little bit because of the information warfare around science, right? So you get a

14:18.560 --> 14:24.320
situation where people are being requested to do things that are reducing their quality of life,

14:24.400 --> 14:31.840
but they don't actually have the epistemic insight. They don't have the knowledge they need to have

14:31.840 --> 14:38.080
the law be understandable, justified. This goes way back in legal theory to like

14:38.640 --> 14:43.760
Kant, if you will, you know, and forgive Kant his transgressions. But he did say that if you're

14:43.760 --> 14:50.720
going to have a legal framework in something like a democracy, an open society, if you will,

14:51.280 --> 14:56.800
it needs to be both, you know, have the force of law, which is to say you get punished if you

14:56.800 --> 15:00.560
don't follow it, even if you don't understand it. But you also need to be able to be in a position

15:00.560 --> 15:04.480
to understand that you need to have all the information you need as a citizen to see why this

15:04.480 --> 15:13.920
law is valid, just appropriate. So if we don't solve that problem, which is to say, really educating

15:14.240 --> 15:20.880
folks, the everyday person, and that requires changing the nature of the media. I'm getting

15:20.880 --> 15:25.520
to the Consilience Project here, the nature of the media, the nature of how we understand

15:25.520 --> 15:29.680
public sense making, public dialogue around complex scientific topics, for example.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.840
Then we could be in a position where even if the epistemic elite get themselves in order

15:35.840 --> 15:41.120
and start using much more comprehensive, you know, global frames and, you know, multicast

15:41.440 --> 15:44.720
decision making procedures with second and third order effects and all these things we'd

15:44.720 --> 15:53.200
like to see, even if they do that, if the people, as it were, the masses, are still in a media

15:53.200 --> 15:59.200
environment that's completely saturated with disinformation and advertising and information

15:59.200 --> 16:05.360
extraction, predatory social media, then we're going to end up basically being in a situation

16:05.360 --> 16:10.320
where the epistemic elite feel that they have no choice but to coerce the vast majority of the

16:10.320 --> 16:15.200
global population into following the laws necessary for humanity to survive. And then

16:15.200 --> 16:21.840
we have a civilization which may not be worth actually living in, even though it's sustainable,

16:22.960 --> 16:28.320
even though it is within planetary boundaries. So that's the first place where decision making

16:28.320 --> 16:32.880
is key is that it's, yeah, we can be concerned about the epistemic elites, but until they become

16:32.880 --> 16:37.120
more concerned with actually educating people instead of propagandizing them and entertaining

16:37.120 --> 16:42.560
them and extracting profit from them, there'll be no way that we can actually navigate the

16:43.600 --> 16:49.360
crisis in the context of an open society. If we turn to the epistemic elites,

16:50.240 --> 16:53.840
then it becomes clear that we're still dominated by short-term thinking.

16:55.600 --> 17:05.360
We're still dominated by certain ideologies that privilege reductive epistemics over

17:06.240 --> 17:12.880
comprehensive and open epistemics, if I can put it that way. So reducing in all the carbon

17:12.880 --> 17:21.040
emissions, for example, seeking only those approaches that can be measured in quantitative

17:21.040 --> 17:28.480
terms, reducing the problem to a technical and scientific problem. This folds already into

17:28.480 --> 17:35.920
what I explained, that they're mostly being worked on as a technological solution, often

17:35.920 --> 17:42.000
somehow a technological solution that's actually going to come about as a result of competition

17:42.000 --> 17:49.200
between entrepreneurial forces and the interest of seeking profit. So this is, again, a high-level

17:49.200 --> 17:55.360
frame about the kinds of contexts in which basic research should be taking place to solve the problem

17:55.920 --> 18:02.640
and a lack of coordinated effort, like, for example, we had around, let's say, the Manhattan

18:02.640 --> 18:07.120
Project, where it wasn't like, oh, let's let private industry solve this problem. It was like,

18:07.120 --> 18:15.840
no, this is a problem that needs the concerted effort of everybody. Note that they didn't

18:15.840 --> 18:24.640
solve the basic problem that I mentioned earlier, which was a secret project. So I think

18:24.640 --> 18:30.960
there's those two issues. There's a lot more to say about the kind of absence of comprehensive

18:30.960 --> 18:38.000
epistemics among the elite decision makers and policymakers. And somehow that discourse often

18:38.000 --> 18:44.960
feels captured to me or insincere to me. And at some point, you know, I don't know how to quite

18:44.960 --> 18:49.600
get in there and look at that. But that's, I think, a deep issue. I remember Jonathan Ross and my

18:49.600 --> 18:58.880
colleague at Perspectiva talking about finance. Just finance as one of the major profit centers

18:58.880 --> 19:04.880
of our civilization is basically the manipulation of fictitious capital. And the way these things

19:04.880 --> 19:10.880
down propagate into how people make decisions about very concrete things involving the ecology

19:10.880 --> 19:18.080
of the planet, or even just local ecologies. So yeah, so there's some form of motivated reasoning

19:18.640 --> 19:30.320
or kind of a very astute and studied blindness to certain issues, the like conspicuous absence of

19:30.320 --> 19:39.120
comprehensive approaches. So anyway, we have to get more specific about certain models. And again,

19:39.120 --> 19:45.440
I'm not an educator. So I'm thinking about the errors and they're thinking at a deeper level,

19:45.440 --> 19:50.400
not about like, oh, they've got these statistics wrong about CO2, or they haven't thought through

19:50.400 --> 19:55.760
the, you know, how difficult it is to actually make solar panels or all those technical questions

19:55.760 --> 20:01.360
are important. I'm looking at the underlying structure of their arguments and epistemics,

20:01.360 --> 20:06.400
essentially, and saying these are kind of flawed to begin with. So I'll leave it there.

20:08.000 --> 20:15.280
Yeah, I think it's very helpful to actually dive down and expose those underlying structural

20:15.280 --> 20:20.000
assumptions. Because it's very easy. I mean, I find myself doing all the time just getting

20:20.000 --> 20:27.680
captured by an interest in, in a part of the problem to compartmentalizing, siloing. So to

20:27.680 --> 20:32.960
actually step back and to try and get a sense of what are these larger macro structural forces in

20:32.960 --> 20:38.560
play is crucial. And I'm not sure we're very good at doing that. But I just want to hand over to

20:38.560 --> 20:45.360
Sam. Sam, Sam's got a question. Hi, thanks, Tom. And thank you, Zach. I just wanted to ask if we

20:46.400 --> 20:53.520
say in a perfect word, we realize the two issues that you very articulately put. And so we have

20:53.520 --> 20:58.400
an open society, let's say, for example, the United States of America, we have an open, educated

20:58.400 --> 21:05.520
society, finance capitalism is the thing of the past. How do we move that out of the confines

21:05.520 --> 21:12.160
of a kind of national paradigm? And could you talk a bit about obviously climate change is a

21:12.160 --> 21:18.640
collective action problem, a global collective action problem? And is there a space for more

21:18.640 --> 21:27.280
cosmopolitan education and working in a kind of global capacity or a cosmopolitan capacity

21:27.280 --> 21:31.600
to solve some of these collective action problems so that we don't have one society that is,

21:31.680 --> 21:38.880
you know, really clued up, but then constantly hitting up against brick walls around it?

21:40.720 --> 21:45.840
Yeah, I mean, I would point to nationalism, at least certain forms of nationalism,

21:45.840 --> 21:51.360
as one of those flaws and the highest level epistemic models that are plaguing the epistemic

21:51.360 --> 21:55.280
elites. It's a lot of epistemics in there. But you see what I'm saying, like there's a

21:55.840 --> 22:01.440
there's a bias towards certain ways of thinking about what the world situation is that makes

22:01.440 --> 22:06.160
it seem like the Brenton Woods agreements are still completely relevant and stuff when they're

22:06.160 --> 22:11.360
absolutely not, right? Or as if the UN actually somehow imposed a global order when it completely

22:11.360 --> 22:18.960
didn't. So there's a misunderstanding of what the actual real politic is at the level of what's

22:18.960 --> 22:27.280
going to take to solve these problems. And so it this isn't like, you know, we can't be naive

22:27.280 --> 22:32.080
and think that there will be international cooperation. But we do need to think about

22:32.080 --> 22:40.720
the forms of judgment, like as I was articulating, the forms of judgment that allow

22:41.600 --> 22:48.000
certain people within certain nations to be truly cosmopolitan actors, to not say they're

22:48.000 --> 22:52.400
acting in the interest of everyone, but actually be interesting, acting national interests,

22:52.960 --> 22:58.320
but that certain countries will actually have to sacrifice their advantages, right? They'll

22:58.320 --> 23:04.320
actually have to sacrifice their advantages in order to secure any possible viable future for

23:04.320 --> 23:07.680
other countries who don't have an opportunity to actually save themselves because of the position

23:07.680 --> 23:13.200
they've been put in by those countries who need to make a sacrifice, right? So there can't be

23:13.200 --> 23:17.040
anything like good faith conversation between the global north and the global south,

23:17.040 --> 23:20.560
until the global north is like, hey, we're going to make some sacrifices for you guys.

23:22.240 --> 23:27.680
And so and that story can be said, you know, east west, like north south, like this is a

23:28.720 --> 23:34.800
very complex situation. And so it requires a form of, let's just say, moral judgment,

23:34.800 --> 23:42.320
post-conventional, post-formal operational, cosmo-centric, cosmopolitan moral judgment,

23:42.320 --> 23:48.000
which is a rare human trait. I point to it in my book when I say, I can literally, as a human

23:48.000 --> 23:53.040
development expert, I can point at those capacities that we're going to need, right? We're going to

23:53.040 --> 24:00.400
need very complex forms of ethical self understanding, which position you within a local bioregion,

24:00.400 --> 24:04.400
within some kind of national structure, within some kind of global structure,

24:04.400 --> 24:10.800
probably within some kind of larger structure of universal value, ultimately. And that is not

24:10.800 --> 24:14.960
something you get from the American public education system as it stands now, for example.

24:15.600 --> 24:24.000
Like, we're not preparing post-conventional, dialectically thinking global citizens. We're

24:24.000 --> 24:30.560
preparing basically simple minded consumers, sometimes consumers of cultural warfare, so

24:30.560 --> 24:36.400
that they can participate in the entertainment of the culture wars. And so that's obviously an

24:36.400 --> 24:41.040
adequate that's going to lead us to further into some kind of self terminating tribalization.

24:41.040 --> 24:47.600
So you're pointing to the cosmopolitan consciousness as key. And it's going to be, like I said,

24:47.600 --> 24:58.080
unequally distributed in terms of the cascade effects of risk, right? And Ulrich back pointed

24:58.080 --> 25:02.080
this out in his work on the risk society, like that the risks are inevitably distributed.

25:02.080 --> 25:08.240
Some people are kind of safe. Some people are relatively unsafe, right? And then the need for

25:09.040 --> 25:12.880
getting out of your position of advantage and putting your position in a position of

25:12.880 --> 25:17.120
basically sacrificing for the whole, that's going to be unequally distributed, right?

25:18.400 --> 25:27.840
So it's become a very delicate situation where we need to avoid the pitfalls of those prior attempts

25:28.720 --> 25:37.120
by the north and the west to try to like help out in the global south and elsewhere.

25:37.120 --> 25:45.840
Well, we're going to need a way to flip that kind of relationship. And so, yeah, some of what's

25:45.840 --> 25:52.560
taking place with social justice and kind of issues of race in the United States,

25:53.520 --> 25:59.280
you know, these conversations will need to be expanded. Again, this is part of what I mean by

25:59.280 --> 26:03.680
it's fundamentally an educational crisis. Even if we solve the technological problems,

26:03.680 --> 26:07.600
we still have to resolve this history of injustice that we're living with.

26:09.360 --> 26:15.440
Or else, who's going to want to join your future sustainable, super technologically awesome society?

26:16.480 --> 26:19.600
Like it just doesn't make sense. Like we have to, there's a certain

26:20.240 --> 26:27.360
healing at the level of culture and a willingness to somehow reengage in good faith again.

26:29.440 --> 26:33.120
And so I don't know the kind of crisis that will ensue that will allow that

26:33.760 --> 26:39.280
transformation of self understanding to unfold with a broad enough swath of people.

26:40.640 --> 26:49.120
But yeah, I know as a human development person that it is, it is crises. It is crises and tragedy

26:49.120 --> 26:55.600
often that can break the psyche open enough to actually transform.

26:56.960 --> 27:00.240
So that would be one way to think about that.

27:02.240 --> 27:08.880
I think it's incredibly helpful and important to bring history into this conversation.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.360
Global history, which is something which has been somewhat missing from

27:14.160 --> 27:20.320
the international relations scholarship in recent years. And there is a certain resurgence now

27:20.320 --> 27:24.800
of a historical sensibility in the current scholarship. And the importance, of course,

27:24.800 --> 27:31.040
of acknowledging militarism and economic imperialism. And I think what you just said, Zach,

27:31.040 --> 27:36.560
there's a bracing clarity in understanding the ethical core of the challenge. And it reminds

27:36.560 --> 27:42.640
me of Henry Shu, a prominent human rights scholar, writing in 1992 about the unavoidability of

27:42.640 --> 27:47.760
justice when it comes to climate change and the crucial distinction between luxury emissions

27:47.760 --> 27:55.200
and survival emissions. And that conversation has sort of crept in from time to time,

27:55.200 --> 28:00.000
but it's rarely been at the foreground of how we actually deal with climate change,

28:00.000 --> 28:05.920
the climate emergency. But I was curious to pick up on this idea of biases and the way

28:05.920 --> 28:11.760
that we see the world. We're now almost halfway through this 50 year critical turning point.

28:11.760 --> 28:19.120
So riffing on Wallerstein, but also say Gramski, is there more to what's going on right now

28:19.120 --> 28:26.400
in the midst of COVID as well, than a host of morbid symptoms? You write in the book,

28:27.120 --> 28:33.040
or you quote actually HG Wells, that the future is a race between catastrophe and education.

28:33.760 --> 28:39.760
And you hold out the prospect of good educational futures emerging out of the present.

28:40.720 --> 28:47.200
But it often seems to me or feels like there's not much space in the culture for exploring the

28:47.200 --> 28:56.320
upside of risks and uncertainties. There's a certain sort of catastrophesism, that's the word.

28:57.680 --> 29:05.280
And that in itself might be a kind of educational deficit. But I wonder then, how do we even get

29:05.360 --> 29:11.680
started if our collective aversion to risk closes off the possibility of

29:12.960 --> 29:17.600
accelerating in the direction of healthy radical transformation?

29:20.160 --> 29:25.840
Yeah, this is interesting because I think there's two ways that there's two reactions

29:25.840 --> 29:32.080
when you start to become aware of the existential risk landscape. I'll call them techno-optimist

29:32.080 --> 29:43.920
and techno-pessimist. The techno-optimist basically talks themselves out of the idea that

29:43.920 --> 29:50.720
there actually is a risk and puts a tremendous amount of faith in human problem-solving capacity.

29:50.720 --> 30:00.240
And this is not an error. We're still here. We should maybe not be probabilistically

30:00.240 --> 30:07.120
on many ledgers. It's actually a question, I think, for people who study existential risk.

30:07.120 --> 30:14.160
Why are we still here? But that's a separate question. So with that, I think is a way to

30:14.160 --> 30:24.080
avoid looking at the risk, really just having an overtly optimistic view of our ability to

30:24.080 --> 30:29.440
solve these problems, usually with technology. The other way is also a way of averting looking

30:29.440 --> 30:33.360
at the risk because you basically say there's nothing we can do about it and you go to the

30:33.360 --> 30:41.200
techno-optimist view, which basically says it's over. It's done. Get ready basically to die.

30:41.200 --> 30:49.600
Maybe we can reboot somehow after everything goes away, but technology has done us in.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.600
And the truth is that when you look at the probabilities and you look at the extra landscape,

30:57.600 --> 31:04.240
it's hard not to be pessimistic. So there's a huge moment of truth in the views. So there's

31:04.240 --> 31:12.000
something about both of those extremes, which is partially right and partially wrong. And the bit

31:12.000 --> 31:16.080
about education is a great example because this is what I'm doing my thinking. So right now,

31:16.080 --> 31:22.720
I believe we have the most sophisticated communication technologies ever for delivering

31:22.720 --> 31:30.640
propaganda directly into people's minds. Those very same tools could be used to make the most

31:30.640 --> 31:37.120
powerful educational infrastructure that has ever been created. And so this is this notion of we're

31:37.120 --> 31:42.720
getting exponential information technology in particular. It's disrupting the educational

31:43.360 --> 31:48.640
dynamics of intergenerational transmission. It's making us go insane right now. We're all going

31:48.720 --> 31:53.280
insane because we're being deeply propagandized by these things we're holding in the palm of

31:53.280 --> 31:58.880
our hand that are basically making us addicted to staring at them. All of that same infrastructure,

31:58.880 --> 32:05.840
were we to retool it, could be used to actually customize the delivery of truly educational

32:05.840 --> 32:12.400
material. This is basically the crux of my argument that we're misusing the potentialities of the

32:12.400 --> 32:19.040
digital. And we could potentially wield them in the interest of unprecedented education and

32:19.040 --> 32:25.040
unprecedented kind of capacities for having a complex open society. And so many of the technologies

32:25.040 --> 32:32.560
that we have have this double-sided nature to them. Artificial intelligence is another one.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.680
You can go techno-optimist or techno-pessimist on the artificial intelligence thing.

32:38.640 --> 32:43.680
And both of those are right and wrong. And the truth of the matter is that

32:46.240 --> 32:51.840
yeah, there's always going to be

32:55.600 --> 33:04.000
a lack of determinism around what the outcome of a technological innovation is. So this is my view,

33:04.080 --> 33:08.640
like following Mumford and Marshall McLuhan and others. There are certain things that are laid out

33:08.640 --> 33:13.760
that are that come with the technology. And then there's this space of freedom around the technology

33:13.760 --> 33:19.920
as to where and how and when the technology gets used. And so I think right now we're not even close

33:19.920 --> 33:24.000
to doing what the digital could do in the realm of education because we're using it for entertainment

33:24.000 --> 33:32.640
and propaganda because it's profitable. But at a certain point, we're a group to decide like a

33:33.120 --> 33:38.720
country-sized group or even like a city-state where a group decide to retool these things

33:38.720 --> 33:44.160
precisely for education. They would have a tremendous asymmetric advantage very rapidly,

33:44.960 --> 33:49.600
epistemically over the entire rest of the world who's misusing the tools.

33:52.080 --> 33:57.440
So that's like a glimmer. And there's many of these glimmers of hope right at the heart of the

33:57.440 --> 34:03.600
darkness like right in the place where all of the propaganda is coming from. It's like right in

34:03.600 --> 34:11.120
there that there's actually the potential for profound educational possibilities. And I end

34:11.120 --> 34:16.240
amending up sounding a lot like a Marxist here. I'm not a Marxist. But that idea that capitalism

34:16.240 --> 34:21.440
builds out this massive global structure of technology and then right as it's about to lock in,

34:22.080 --> 34:28.720
it flips and that same technology becomes the infrastructure of freedom. That's a very

34:28.720 --> 34:38.320
interesting idea. So yeah, that's one way I think. Again, just one way to think about that.

34:39.600 --> 34:46.720
Yeah, fantastic. Thanks Zach. Hope right in the darkness. That's a phrase to ponder I think.

34:47.440 --> 34:54.400
Okay, I'm going to hand over to Jess. Jess, please. Yes. Thanks so much Zach for everything

34:54.400 --> 35:01.920
you've shared so far. Coming off this idea of propaganda and the tech tools that deliver it to

35:01.920 --> 35:11.360
us as a foremost teacher-lead authority in our society right now. How and if it is retooled

35:11.920 --> 35:19.440
to become a source of mass delivery for education, how will it be established in a culture which is

35:19.440 --> 35:26.240
often suspicious of authority claims? I mean, as a child growing up when the internet was just

35:26.240 --> 35:30.720
becoming widespread, we were always told not to believe what you read on the internet. And I think

35:30.720 --> 35:35.440
some kids have maybe lost that as it's become more and more ubiquitous throughout our lives.

35:35.440 --> 35:40.080
But if it does in the future become something positive, quote unquote, or

35:41.360 --> 35:47.120
you know, dependable, how do you think the population would react to that and will it be a

35:47.120 --> 35:53.920
smooth transition? It's very interesting. And yeah, I have this term teacher-lead authority,

35:53.920 --> 36:00.480
which I use a lot in my book and it hinges on this. It hinges on what's the nature of legitimate

36:00.480 --> 36:05.440
teacher-lead authority and how do you know when you've got it in a context that's

36:06.320 --> 36:11.600
saturated with illegitimate teacher-lead authority. And so the classic example is a school, right?

36:11.600 --> 36:16.480
The school and their students and teachers, right? Students have to be there because they're forced

36:16.480 --> 36:22.160
to be there. The teachers are there because they get paid. The teachers have teacher-lead authority

36:22.160 --> 36:27.840
by virtue of their bureaucratic position in relation to the student, right? So most students

36:27.840 --> 36:33.760
experience teachers as teachers, not necessarily because they're super smart and like really good

36:33.760 --> 36:39.200
at being teachers, but because this is their job. And so we're in an environment where there's an

36:39.200 --> 36:45.920
inorganic, let's call it inorganic, bureaucratically mediated teacher-lead authority, right? Now,

36:45.920 --> 36:54.160
sometimes in those contexts, your high school teacher is a teacher. Like, he's brilliant and

36:54.160 --> 36:59.680
he's really good at teaching you. And you've kind of fallen in love with the idea that like this man

36:59.680 --> 37:02.800
can like change your whole mind. I'm speaking about one teacher, I'm remembering this teacher,

37:02.800 --> 37:08.320
I had an high school, right? And so all of a sudden in this bureaucratically mediated teacher-lead

37:08.320 --> 37:12.880
authority, where often you encounter a teacher who's lazy and you don't understand them and you

37:12.880 --> 37:17.360
don't know why they became a teacher and you think it's bullshit. There is actually a beacon of

37:17.360 --> 37:21.520
legitimate teacher-lead authority. And you can recognize legitimate teacher-lead authority

37:21.520 --> 37:28.080
because one of the main things it's doing is trying to make itself obsolete. It wants you

37:28.080 --> 37:34.160
to be able to do what it does. Like by definition, a good teacher is trying to get you up to their

37:34.160 --> 37:39.680
level and maybe actually get you to go beyond their level. So one of the ways you know when

37:39.680 --> 37:45.760
you're looking at like the media or you're looking at a pundit or someone who's speaking is,

37:46.480 --> 37:55.520
are they actually encouraging you and giving you what you need to detach yourself from being

37:55.520 --> 38:02.240
their student forever, right? Or are they addicting to you to them, excuse me, are they

38:02.240 --> 38:06.320
are you becoming addicted to them as the only source of information you can trust and use,

38:07.120 --> 38:11.840
right? So this becomes a very interesting dynamic when you look at the media landscape.

38:12.720 --> 38:19.920
And when you look specifically at the discussion of science in the media and the disconnect between

38:19.920 --> 38:25.280
the stories the media tell and the complexity of the science that's happening and their attempt to

38:25.280 --> 38:31.120
run interference on readers so that you don't go to the primary source material, that you're not

38:31.120 --> 38:36.720
actually equipped to be able to be smarter about the issue than this random journalist who actually

38:36.720 --> 38:42.080
isn't a virologist, right? It's journalist, not a virologist. It's never studied vaccines, right?

38:43.280 --> 38:45.920
Are they putting me in a position to actually understand the issue?

38:46.880 --> 38:53.360
Are the actual major institutions involved giving me the information I need to be truly

38:53.360 --> 38:58.320
informed about the issue or not? Or are they just basically telling me what to do pretending to be a

38:58.320 --> 39:06.880
teacherly authority? So you're right, we've become suspicious of teacherly authority because we have

39:06.880 --> 39:15.680
good reason to be. Most of what takes place in the fourth estate, which is supposed to be, you

39:15.680 --> 39:21.360
know, journalism and the press and supposed to be an educational institution, most of what's

39:21.360 --> 39:28.480
taking place there is not by any definition looking like legitimate teacherly authority.

39:30.640 --> 39:37.280
And so, but the saving grace, and this gets to your point, the saving grace is that when that

39:37.280 --> 39:43.520
high school teacher appears, he gets a posse, like students are like, that's the real deal.

39:44.880 --> 39:48.960
Like that's someone who actually cares and is actually trying to empower us, like actually

39:48.960 --> 39:53.520
trying to give us the capacities and the skills that we could become our own teachers, right?

39:54.880 --> 40:04.800
So I do think that if you build the system correctly, and you have the kind of stepwise access

40:04.800 --> 40:10.160
to deeper and deeper and deeper information and empowerment epistemically, where there's no

40:10.160 --> 40:16.560
invisible ceiling of a epistemic asymmetry, where the populace is like, all right, on the other side

40:16.640 --> 40:22.960
of this, those guys know what's going on, which is what it feels right now. Most people feel

40:22.960 --> 40:27.520
like no one really trusts the media. We do what the media tells us because we're socially pressured

40:27.520 --> 40:32.880
to use certain words and to have certain beliefs, especially in social media. But if you look at

40:32.880 --> 40:37.120
the statistics, most people just simply don't trust the media. They have allegiance to certain

40:37.120 --> 40:42.240
ones because they're useful in cultural warfare, but they don't actually really trust what's being

40:42.240 --> 40:48.400
said by the media. And so when you have this kind of duplicity and this deep sense that, well,

40:48.400 --> 40:54.400
somebody must know what's actually going on. And so there's this deep suspicion and this lays,

40:54.400 --> 40:58.640
of course, the groundwork for much of the cultural dysfunction we're seeing around, you know, so-called

40:58.640 --> 41:03.280
conspiracy theories and things of that nature, which emerge from the sense of somehow there's a

41:03.280 --> 41:12.160
ceiling of epistemic asymmetry, that the main kind of media, like news media, social media,

41:12.160 --> 41:18.960
the ways we're supposed to get up and into understanding the world, don't give or don't

41:18.960 --> 41:25.680
kind of work in context of legitimate teacherly authority. So it's a widespread and deep problem

41:25.680 --> 41:30.000
because now we're cynical about the idea that there could even be teacherly authority. So I

41:30.000 --> 41:33.120
think to your point where someone said, don't believe what you read online. I don't think

41:33.760 --> 41:38.240
kids forgot that. I think it's that they don't believe what they read online, which means they

41:38.240 --> 41:42.080
don't believe anything because all they do is read online. So it becomes, it moves from like,

41:42.080 --> 41:47.120
there's a true story and then there's this crazy online stuff to just like, there's just crazy

41:47.120 --> 41:53.200
online stuff. And the idea that there's a true story somewhere, that's not even really an idea

41:53.200 --> 41:59.760
anymore. I'm telling you, like, when you look at the epistemologies of people under 20, what you

41:59.760 --> 42:07.680
end up getting is a kind of widely diffuse epistemic nihilism, you know, where there's this fusion

42:07.680 --> 42:15.280
between entertainment and belief, and a fusion between a need to have in-group membership in a

42:15.280 --> 42:22.560
cultural war and motivated reasoning to believe certain things. So the sense of like having

42:23.520 --> 42:30.320
an integrist truth and an orientation towards ongoing learning and having access to stuff

42:30.320 --> 42:36.320
that would allow you to do that and that would encourage doing that. These are cultures like

42:36.320 --> 42:42.480
that are few and far between right now and hard to find, but they need to be created. And I think

42:42.480 --> 42:48.960
when they are, I do think people will be attracted to them because most people don't trust the media,

42:48.960 --> 42:53.120
but they want to know what's going on. Like people want to know, it's not that people don't want to

42:53.120 --> 42:59.840
know, it's that there's a certain cynicism or nihilism about the prospect of success of knowing

43:00.400 --> 43:05.600
that we've been disadvantaged in our ability to know. And there's a lot to say there, some of the

43:05.600 --> 43:11.040
research I'm doing now is on the nature and the history of propaganda and information warfare

43:11.040 --> 43:17.760
and communication sciences. And it's a long history, you know, decades and decades and decades,

43:17.760 --> 43:23.920
we've been working on how to kind of like manipulate large populations through communication

43:23.920 --> 43:32.080
science, often with a kind of technocratically benevolent notion that the masses need to be

43:32.080 --> 43:37.920
helped in making the right decision. And that brings us back to that prior point I made about

43:37.920 --> 43:41.360
the relation between the epistemic elites and the so-called people.

43:41.360 --> 43:51.680
Yes, that point really resonated with me, especially it gave me the idea that it seems

43:51.680 --> 43:58.320
that true education, where everyone can have access to a primary source, is mutually exclusive

43:58.320 --> 44:05.280
from control and power. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that and whether the epistemic

44:05.280 --> 44:11.840
elite or high-level policymakers would ever be motivated to relinquish control and power that

44:11.840 --> 44:18.080
has been designed and fueled through this structure of propaganda and entertainment media?

44:19.440 --> 44:26.640
It's a very, very good question. The relationship between power and education and the relationship

44:26.640 --> 44:34.720
between power and teacherly authority in particular. It's funny because I say teacherly

44:34.720 --> 44:38.960
authority and everyone thinks like a school and I use that context, but actually it's the mother and

44:38.960 --> 44:46.160
the child or the parent, the parenting one and the child, where you get that most basic, actually

44:46.160 --> 44:56.960
most kind of like anthropologically primordial case of teacherly authority. And what you see in

44:56.960 --> 45:05.440
that relationship is in fact the power, like the power of the mother over the child. Let's

45:05.440 --> 45:13.040
talk about that. What kind of power is that? It's not the same power as what Roy Baskar and others

45:13.040 --> 45:19.120
would call power over, like the political power, having access to the legitimate use of force

45:19.120 --> 45:26.560
or the legitimate use of bureaucratic mechanism to punish basically. So the power of the mother

45:26.560 --> 45:34.080
over the infant is actually the power of care. And so it's a legitimate asymmetry. The mother's

45:34.080 --> 45:41.040
larger, stronger, literally provides sustenance to the child and then teaches the child all kinds of

45:41.040 --> 45:46.240
things without even intending to do so. The child instinctively puts itself in relationship to the

45:46.240 --> 45:55.600
mother as teacher. And so it's not about the absence of power that you get legitimate teacherly

45:55.600 --> 46:01.680
authority. It's about a particular kind of power, a power of care or a power of love that binds people

46:01.680 --> 46:07.280
in a relationship that's completely non-coercive. It's completely non-coercive. We associate power

46:07.280 --> 46:13.680
with coercion and that's what most political power is. But there's actually a power, Habermas would

46:13.680 --> 46:18.880
call it, like the unforced force of the better argument. That's an example of legitimate teacherly

46:18.880 --> 46:23.280
authority. Or it's like, why do I agree with you? I'm not agreeing with you because you're going to

46:23.280 --> 46:29.680
beat me up or because I get in trouble or I get shunned from my in-group. I'm agreeing with you

46:29.680 --> 46:35.280
because that is a better argument than the arguments I've heard, the force of logic, right?

46:35.280 --> 46:41.440
The force of reason compels me, not the force of physical. So the power of a strong argument

46:41.440 --> 46:46.560
is an example of the power that's in legitimate teacherly authority. Now, when you try to merge

46:46.560 --> 46:52.560
teacherly authority with bureaucratic power, that's when you get that situation where now you can't

46:52.560 --> 46:57.760
tell. Am I doing what this teacher tells me because I respect them the way I might respect

46:57.760 --> 47:02.240
my mother and am I vibing with them through love and teacherly authority? Or is it I have

47:02.240 --> 47:06.880
to do this because otherwise I get punished? They have the legitimate use of bureaucratic force over

47:06.880 --> 47:13.920
me as a student. And similarly with the media and social media, things of that nature. And of

47:13.920 --> 47:20.640
course, political speeches and the communication scientists that kind of roll out political

47:20.640 --> 47:29.200
platforms. There's always this question about the form of power that's in play. And

47:31.920 --> 47:37.520
the degree to which we can say that we are consenting with full knowledge of what our

47:37.520 --> 47:47.920
situation is or not. And so yeah, I think in an ideal world, you would have conditions of education

47:47.920 --> 47:53.920
where there wasn't the opportunity to confuse those two forms of power. Where you gravitated to

47:53.920 --> 48:01.760
particular teachers and you gravitated to particular courses of study because of the power of the

48:02.800 --> 48:08.560
teacherly, of the power of the true argument, the power of the curiosity, the power of the

48:08.560 --> 48:15.760
attraction between teacher and student, the epistemic humility and these kinds of qualities.

48:16.720 --> 48:20.960
Whereas now it's often the case and has been with the public schools that

48:22.160 --> 48:27.200
there is a certain, there's a certain coercion that takes place in just getting a kid to go to school.

48:28.480 --> 48:34.080
You know, like literally you have to kid, like even if you don't want to. So yeah, so I think

48:34.960 --> 48:43.760
those, the kind of like the power over the political power and then this other form of power

48:43.760 --> 48:48.880
which we, which we're not as familiar with, like power gets a bad name and what I'm trying to say

48:48.880 --> 48:54.400
is like there's actually this, there is this form of power. You know, like when you see Martin

48:54.400 --> 48:59.840
Luther King speak, for example, it's a different kind of power, like there's a power of persuasion

48:59.840 --> 49:06.080
that's not coercion or there's a power to educate that's not propaganda. And so these kinds of

49:06.080 --> 49:09.520
distinctions are some of the stuff I'm working on for the Consilience Project because it becomes

49:09.520 --> 49:13.600
essential as the information environment gets more complex for people who'd be able to tell

49:13.680 --> 49:18.800
what's the difference here. Is this person sincerely trying to educate me or are they just

49:18.800 --> 49:25.120
doing one of their shticks and trying to, you know, basically, so yeah, so this is a good question.

49:25.120 --> 49:29.440
And again, I'm just like touching on it. There's, there's a lot of, a lot of complexity there.

49:30.960 --> 49:37.440
Yeah, fantastic. Fascinating. Yeah, definitely. This idea of power as protein,

49:38.160 --> 49:43.520
it's really something which often is difficult to grasp. There's a certain

49:45.680 --> 49:53.120
allergic reaction to shifting the focus away from, say, the material, the tangible,

49:53.120 --> 49:58.640
but clearly it's absolutely vital. Perhaps just to rip a bit on Jesse's personal reflection,

49:59.600 --> 50:06.640
you know, as, as an academic, as a child of Fukuyama, I sometimes do wonder,

50:07.440 --> 50:13.280
who are we as educators to tell future generations what to think or what to do

50:14.080 --> 50:23.200
with this world that we're sort of leaving them? And as educators, what if our ideas about the

50:23.200 --> 50:33.280
future are no longer relevant, which is a pretty disconcerting thought? And I wonder, how can we

50:33.280 --> 50:43.440
distinguish between those legacy ideas and frames that must be salvaged and those that really we

50:43.440 --> 50:51.280
should consider relinquishing? And it's disconcerting not only because it, because it leaves you

50:51.280 --> 50:56.960
disorientated, but also perhaps because it feels disempowering to consider that it kind of undercuts

50:58.880 --> 51:02.880
the conviction that you can change things for the better.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.600
Yeah, this is, is a very foundational question in the philosophy of education,

51:10.960 --> 51:16.960
which is, you know, what is the knowledge and skill and capacity, even the disposition,

51:17.600 --> 51:20.880
dispositions and forms of personality? Like, what are those things that we should be

51:21.760 --> 51:30.320
handing on to the next generation? It's a book by Margaret Mead. I want to say 61. I don't remember

51:30.320 --> 51:34.400
exactly culture and commitment. It's the name of the book. And it's amazing. It's a fascinating book.

51:34.400 --> 51:37.920
She talks about these three forms of culture, which is really talking about three forms of

51:37.920 --> 51:42.960
intergenerational transmission. There's a post figurative culture. This is what human cultures

51:42.960 --> 51:48.000
were forever. That's when what your dad-dads did, your dad did. That's what you're going to do.

51:48.560 --> 51:56.080
Like, you can just know as an elder, like I will hand on to my kids what basically they need,

51:56.080 --> 52:00.480
and things just don't change. And the kids can be like, they really know how the world works.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.760
And it's a post figurative, right? And then there are what are called

52:06.160 --> 52:10.880
configurative cultures. And that's where you have some of the post figurative stuff

52:11.440 --> 52:16.000
and stuff going on within generations where you're changing what your parents gave you a little bit.

52:16.800 --> 52:23.040
So you're getting peer-to-peer changes in technology, which slightly augment intergenerational

52:23.040 --> 52:29.520
transmission. And so not just the sheer tradition of the post figurative, a certain amount of

52:29.520 --> 52:35.440
innovation. And that's what began when, especially and took off with, again, back to Wallerstein,

52:35.440 --> 52:40.720
the birth of the capitalist world system. Her argument is that there's a thing called a prefigurative

52:40.720 --> 52:48.640
culture. And that's where basically, like, those bets are off because things are changing so rapidly

52:49.280 --> 52:55.840
that the world that the children will inhabit is not understandable by the elders today.

52:56.320 --> 53:03.200
Right? So it's a very, very novel situation in the evolution of human culture now. It happened

53:03.200 --> 53:08.720
occasionally in the past when there was an invading army, or there was a massive storm,

53:08.720 --> 53:14.800
or there was desertification. And in a generation or two, the entire life, you know, of a culture

53:14.800 --> 53:19.920
changed when that was a rare cataclysmic event. Our technological development and economic development

53:19.920 --> 53:26.880
and political development is such that now we are generating those types of total world

53:26.880 --> 53:32.560
transformation within a single generation. And so what that means is that, to your point,

53:32.560 --> 53:35.920
we have no idea really what to tell the kids about what Tamara is going to be like.

53:37.200 --> 53:42.640
We actually need to find ways to have them listen to the future and then give them the

53:42.640 --> 53:49.520
help that they realize that they need. So, and this has been seen by educators since the 60s,

53:49.520 --> 53:55.280
when it became clear that you all are preparing these kids for jobs that will not be there in 20

53:55.280 --> 54:01.440
years when they graduate. And that problem has compounded to the sense of that we can no longer

54:01.440 --> 54:09.040
think simply about that form. But at an even deeper level, the intergenerational crisis is one of

54:09.040 --> 54:15.200
both the children not thinking that the elders know how the world works, right, and being skeptical

54:15.200 --> 54:20.080
that, well, aren't you the guys that messed up this world? Like, why should we learn from you?

54:20.080 --> 54:25.760
You created this mess. But it's also the elders realizing that is the elders saying,

54:26.480 --> 54:31.920
we're a failed, we're failed beings, like we're a failed species, like what have we done? How can

54:31.920 --> 54:37.600
we teach the kids what to do? And so, and that's part of that prefigurative culture, like those

54:37.600 --> 54:44.400
reflections are correct, but they're not quite fair to each side of the generational gap that

54:44.400 --> 54:53.600
there's a situation that's emerged that came unplanned, but has basically left the youth kind

54:53.600 --> 54:59.600
of stranded at the edge of history without any elders to tell them what tomorrow will look like

54:59.600 --> 55:04.720
or how to handle it. So the elders, what they need to do is step in and hold education in a

55:04.720 --> 55:09.040
completely different way. And this is kind of the argument of my book, that we need to

55:10.000 --> 55:16.160
reground education of the youth in the communities that they live and in the concrete problems of

55:16.160 --> 55:24.960
those communities, right, which is to say something a little bit more like guild systems and skill and

55:24.960 --> 55:31.760
time sharing networks and non-age segregated classrooms and a whole bunch of other stuff

55:31.760 --> 55:39.520
that allow the education system to be responsive to the novel insights of youth who

55:40.640 --> 55:46.080
know more about what might emerge in the future than the elders can pretend to know.

55:47.120 --> 55:53.120
And so I think that's, it's a lot to swallow, but it's completely necessary. And it doesn't mean

55:53.120 --> 55:57.600
that there isn't a role for intergenerational transmission. It means that of the skills that

55:57.600 --> 56:05.360
we have as elders, let the kids tell us which ones they believe are relevant. And so that's,

56:05.360 --> 56:13.120
that's, I think, I think that's key. And then some of it's also the shifting of focus away from,

56:14.240 --> 56:19.600
again, technical skills and into what might be called skills of wisdom or skills of ethics,

56:20.560 --> 56:29.120
that a lot of what is needed from the elders is that, like, don't tell us how to solve these

56:29.120 --> 56:36.080
problems or how to organize our future economic lives or anything like that, but please share

56:36.080 --> 56:47.280
stories of human suffering, of human love, of human overcoming difficulty. The continuity of the human

56:47.360 --> 56:55.760
is at risk. It's a strange way to say it, but this is has been reflected upon by technologists

56:55.760 --> 57:02.560
and others that if the generation gap becomes acute enough, it becomes almost like a speciation

57:02.560 --> 57:10.640
event where the youth become a new kind of being that almost can't be understood, that we can't.

57:10.640 --> 57:16.000
Like if we were to genetically engineer superhumans, this would be the situation we would have

57:16.640 --> 57:22.080
extincted ourselves by virtue of giving birth to a new species and that would be an intergenerational

57:22.080 --> 57:29.120
gap that's unbridgeable. So that, you know, with the rate of technological change and specifically

57:29.120 --> 57:35.120
the information technology and the neurological effects and the cascades of all those on human

57:35.120 --> 57:43.600
physiology, yeah, the generation gap approaches almost unbridgeable speciation event. So that

57:43.600 --> 57:50.240
means that, yeah, how do we educate those who will come after us who are not like us? It looks like

57:50.240 --> 57:58.000
I said creating very different contexts and allowing more epistemic humility on the part of

57:58.000 --> 58:05.760
the elders, but it's risky because the kids, they're just, they're still youth. It's not like,

58:05.760 --> 58:11.280
I'm also not making an argument of like, you know, the indigo kids are like that they're instantly,

58:11.360 --> 58:15.920
you know, adapting to the technology and that the millennials are like way smarter than any

58:15.920 --> 58:20.320
other generation. They're going to figure it out. I'm also not saying that. Like there needs to be

58:20.320 --> 58:25.600
intergenerational transmission. The prefigure of culture that I mentioned doesn't just throw its

58:25.600 --> 58:29.840
hands up and say, let the kids do whatever it wants. It says no, it's we're in a fundamentally

58:29.840 --> 58:35.200
different situation of intergenerational transmission. It's actually more attention is needed. We need

58:35.200 --> 58:42.000
to be more careful to pulling out the responsiveness and the kind of native intelligence of the youth

58:43.520 --> 58:48.080
than just giving them rote curriculum that we've been giving for a decade. So there's some asking

58:48.080 --> 58:52.960
for more attentiveness on the part of the elders and the youth, more intergenerational

58:52.960 --> 59:00.560
transmission, just of a different kind. And it's not the case that the youth are prepared

59:00.560 --> 59:09.600
or instantly adapted or evolved for it. They're not. So yeah, the nature of our responsibility

59:09.600 --> 59:16.480
as educators has changed. I think the the question of differences of generation is such an

59:16.480 --> 59:21.600
interesting one. And I was wondering if we think of a hypothetical new generation in a

59:21.600 --> 59:28.000
utopian society that is not a generation of knowers. So a generation that's been raised on

59:28.000 --> 59:33.680
knowing stuff, knowing things, but a generation of thinkers, I think we've skirted around and

59:33.680 --> 59:38.160
we've addressed as well some of the real benefits of that, you know, a generation of thinkers,

59:38.160 --> 59:42.560
but I just wanted to red team for a second and think of what are some of the challenges

59:43.200 --> 59:48.480
of having a generation of thinkers, because the instruments we have at our disposal

59:49.920 --> 59:54.240
aren't geared towards a generation of thinkers. And I was just really interested to

59:54.240 --> 59:59.360
get the kind of red team assessment of a generation of thinkers and how that might

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:08.880
what a diagnosis of that. That's interesting. I mean, there's a long so I've read a lot of the

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.480
history of education, you know, and, and some histories of education are triumphant, especially

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:21.120
about the American education system that, you know, we were made into a society of thinkers

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:27.680
and etc. Then you get other people like John Taylor Gatto, and like Jonathan Cozel and others,

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:33.440
even Chomsky and some foods, who would look at the American public education system as basically

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:39.840
doing the opposite. And so the argument there, you know, and even goes to the Dowdy Ching,

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:45.440
right, keep the people's bellies full, but their minds empty. I think that's how you govern

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:52.480
it by precisely not really educating. And I'm not saying that that view is true. I'm saying

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:59.200
there's enough people writing that history to suggest that at least one of the kind of like

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.480
functions of the educational system as we have known it is to simplify the range of diversity

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.600
of thought in the populace, right? Like, you can think about preparing them for the workforce,

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.000
you can think about preparing them to be consumers, but you need to basically be able to predict

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.120
what people are going to think. And part of that is to weave the culture together.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.680
But part of that is to simplify the human side of the equation. And so it started

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.480
to happen with the internet, and it continues to happen, although the marketers have figured out

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:38.560
how to do a standardized differentiation. Instead of like the early modern one size fits all

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.040
homogenization, now we have the late modern or postmodern standardized differentiation,

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.400
where there's two dozen advertising groups that think you're unique, but you're not.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:55.040
So they figured that out. But it's still the case that if you promote a culture of learning,

01:01:55.040 --> 01:02:02.080
and you promote a culture not of ingesting and regurgitating, or in a culture of knowing and

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:08.160
knowing and resisting change of thought, but a culture where people are truly interested

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:14.160
in learning and thinking, then you better have a culture that's ready to have truly an open society

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:19.360
for governance and decision making, and an economic system that has true transparency

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.840
and visibility around commodity supply chains, and ethical responsibilities of corporations,

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.280
and the society that got transparency around law enforcement, and the criminal justice system.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:35.120
There's a whole bunch of stuff that you can kind of keep a mess, like not in good order,

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.680
if you've got a society of folks who really aren't equipped to be paying attention,

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.960
but if you equip people to pay attention, then they're going to start paying attention.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.120
And so that's part of the arguments that have been unfolding for such a long time

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:57.280
around this kind of negative view of education, that there's been a manufacturing of consent,

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:05.920
and kind of an arrangement of selective inattention, which is like a psychological defense mechanism,

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.720
right? So if I'm a neurotic person, and let's say I'm just not very nice to the people who

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.080
look close to me, I will selectively not attend to those behaviors, which disconfirm my view of

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.520
myself as being a good person. And so I'm so frustrating to be with someone who has these

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.080
neuroses, because it's so clear that you're doing this, that you can't see, because you're

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:28.320
defending yourself. It's a defense mechanism, selective inattention. And so similarly at the

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:37.200
cultural level, we're taught not to think about certain things. We're taught to studiously ignore

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.480
certain ways of framing problems. Selective inattention is part of the education system.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.560
So if we start to remove those defense mechanisms, that's what you're talking about,

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.960
which is what you want to do in psychotherapy, but when that happens,

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.760
you know, you get a divorce, you change your job, like you move, like start having crazy dreams,

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.960
like your whole life changes, right? And so this is what we need. We need some kind

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.840
of cultural renaissance, if we need the equivalent of a midlife crisis or a resolution of the

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.920
adolescent identity crisis for the whole culture. But it will be, there'll be a reckoning,

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:21.440
there'll be a reckoning. And so that kind of has to happen. So that would be the downside,

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:27.360
it would be the reckoning, and that you can't predict what will happen,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.640
in the way you can predict what will happen when you're systematically nudging everybody into

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:37.280
particular groups and then predicting what those groups will be, which is what's happening now.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:47.440
Yeah, that question, what am I studiously ignoring? Maybe that's one to open up a seminar with.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:55.680
So we're rolling, I think, to the close, that so much more we could discuss. I hope we might be

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.880
able to continue this conversation at some time down the road. But I'd like to hand over to Zoe

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:08.480
to lead us out. So I think my questions are still very much percolating in my mind.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.080
So if I'm not as coherent or eloquent as the rest of you, I apologize. So we've kind of talked

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:21.200
about a society or like a generation of thinkers and knowers. But I'm also quite interested in

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:27.520
pulling on what you mentioned about the power through love. And so thinking about generations

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:33.600
of feelers, because I feel like, I mean, even in generations of people or like relatives, cousins,

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.800
and whatnot younger than myself, you mentioned nihilism, and it's almost like there's a competition

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:44.080
to see who can care the least. And caring and feeling is seen as sort of a weakness and something

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:51.040
that's that should be weeded out. So I guess my question is sort of, how do we make those younger

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:55.760
generations feel cared for and loved, in a way that they're not going to reject and be like,

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.320
oh, this is this is cringy. And I you don't understand me. So it's also into

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:06.640
tying into intergenerational gap. But I guess also across, you mentioned an epistemic elite.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:13.760
And that's, in my mind, also, we are hoarding in the epistemic elites, the potential for intergenerational

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:19.040
transmission of these essential human capacities. And I do, for me, anyway, I do feel like a lot of

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.000
that will come from better handling of your emotions, and maybe de-celebritizing, actually

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.960
caring about things and being very vocal about caring without worrying that you would be seen as,

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:35.040
I don't know, vulnerable or weak or irrelevant. Sorry, if that's a bit all over the place.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.280
Now, that's a very profound question. I mean, the one thing you said in passing was that the

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:44.720
epistemic elite were hoarding a certain command. That's a that's like a key insight that and there

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:54.320
has been for a long time, a false scarcity of cognitive supply, false scarcity of cognitive

01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:00.560
resources, a artificially generated scarcity. And so that's important to get. And some of what has

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.920
been made scarce are the conditions for the possibility of love. I mean, this is one of the

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:11.600
main reasons in my book, I talk about these social miracles. It's really about creating a society

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:18.960
where people are don't have to be courageous to love one another, right? Because like,

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:27.040
if you don't love anyone, then you can't get hurt. Full stop. Like, if I love you a lot and you die,

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.960
I'm in a lot of pain. If I love you a lot and you do something that disappoints me, I'm in a lot

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.880
of pain. So there's a kind of defense mechanism psychologically to in a world where you can't

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.040
predict what's going to happen to the people that you love, right? Well, you can you don't even know

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.960
if you can get up to where you want to go to be economically or whatever, or to get the skills

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:55.920
you want to have the self understand, like, because of the sense of precarity that many people feel.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.600
There is a and most of that I believe is economic and politically generated.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:09.680
There is a there's a tendency, yes, to withdraw into the isolated atomized individual and take a

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.120
cynical view towards anything that would deepen connection and love because of the risk that's

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:21.680
there. So one of the things the elders can do is actually demonstrate the courage that it takes

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.480
to love in a world that's well, in a world that in an unworlded world, if I can say that,

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.160
in a time between worlds, right? And it's when you're in a world it's easier to love because you

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.840
can say, oh, here's how the world works. It's safe to love you because I've got this many years

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:44.960
before my life is disrupted or whatever, right? But right now, there's this danger. So we need

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:52.720
to do the opposite. And and and so the I do not like the phrase emotional intelligence. So I talk

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:59.360
about like emotional self regulation and emotional self awareness and the languages of emotional

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:06.080
self description and emotional connection. And these are as essential, if not more essential,

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:11.120
and especially to notions of ethical identity. So right, if you think about the situation we're

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:17.920
going to end up in, as the wheels start to come off, I talk a lot about, you know, that parable

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:25.520
of the Good Samaritan, like what do you do when you meet someone a stranger on the road between

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.240
civilizations, which means you're not beholden to the law of either of those civilizations or on the

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.040
road or in the wilderness, there's no cops going to show up, right? No one's going to come and tell

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:41.120
you you disobey the laws of the city, you're just a stranger in need on the road, just you and him.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:48.080
And in the Bible, God, what do you do, right? We're going to be confronted with that kind of

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:54.320
situation, where we're meeting strangers on the road, and sometimes with those strangers that we

01:09:54.320 --> 01:10:02.560
numerous. And it's not a it's not a cognitive question. It's not a calculation or a game

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:08.240
theoretic relationship that needs to be taken up. It's a problem of feeling. That's a problem of

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:16.560
the human heart and the ability of the human to see another human as a human. And so, yeah, those

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:24.080
are the deeper, the deeper kind of strata of the personality, which are also in play right now. So

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.320
I'm glad you raised that. And, you know, the approaches that I've seen in this area, social

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.760
emotional skills, mindfulness, education and things like those nature are good and important.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.640
But again, to speak to them kind of psychotherapeutic context, we're going to need to learn how to

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:51.280
process intense emotion to not just to be calm, but to figure out how to deal with grief, sorrow,

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:58.640
tragedy, righteous anger, there's a whole bunch of stuff that we need to be able to work with,

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.360
aside from just like staying calm and I meditate a lot. But the point is that you need to be able to

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.120
to move emotion through you in a complex way. So, yeah, so that's a whole other,

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.040
whole other, you open to giant can of emotional worms there, but it's an important one. And I

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:22.560
can't see a way out of it without. And again, I've listed in my book, I can't remember which page,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:30.800
but it's post-conventional ethics, but also like, you know, these really, really,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:36.480
robust forms of emotional self-regulation and emotional self-understanding,

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:42.800
which allow for actual real empathy. So, yeah, thank you for, for bringing that up.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.320
Well, thank you for such a comprehensive answer and just a really thought-provoking conversation.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.640
It just stirred a lot of things in my mind and I'm sure I'll, I'll go in,

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.280
tell my mumble about it because I feel like she's very much, she's very much on the emotional

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.960
spectrum of things with, with me as so, so yeah, thank you very much.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:06.160
Yeah, I'd like to echo that. Thanks so much for that. It's really a, kind of,

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.480
a very grounded, profound heartfelt conversation. We really appreciate it. And, you know, end on

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.880
that note that this is also a problem of feeling or of emotion. There is this tendency, I know,

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.680
well, to slide into kind of a full sense of objective detachment from these questions.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:30.240
And, of course, as complexity science reminds us, there is actually no view from nowhere.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:38.880
So, also, perhaps just to, just to end as to where we might go next in future conversations.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:43.600
There clearly are insights and lessons to be drawn from other cultures here and what you

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:50.080
just reflected remind me a bit of Martin Prechtel's work, the Guatemalan spiritual teacher and his

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:57.120
impression of Western culture as drowning in kind of atomistic alienation. So, I think lots more

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:04.720
to explore there. And, yeah, there's a beautiful way to end this conversation on, on education

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:11.600
as, as the core challenge of our time. So, thank you. And look forward to picking this up again.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.320
