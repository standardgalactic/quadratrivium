0	5920	Recently, this amazing AI called GPT chat came out that will generate text based on your prompts.
5920	10160	And the whole world is still kind of getting used to it because it's just so powerful.
10160	13760	The neat thing is it can write Python scripts for Blender as well.
13760	17520	The workflow is very different, so I've seen a lot of people experimenting,
17520	22960	but today I will show you three examples that are actually useful for speeding up your routine
22960	27760	and improving your art in Blender. If you find this interesting, please consider leaving a
27760	31120	like on this video and let me know what you think of GPT chat.
31120	34800	And you can also subscribe to stay updated on future tutorials.
34800	38400	So to start, you're going to go to this website, chat.openair.com,
38400	41440	and you need to make an account to use this chatbot.
41440	44720	Once you log in, you get this screen where you can type your prompts over here.
44720	49440	And it also gives you some examples, explains about the capabilities and the limitations.
49440	54720	I'm also going to explain about the limitations and troubleshooting later in this video.
54720	59680	But we're going to start with the first example, and that is scattering objects around your scene.
59680	61920	We're going to create our first prompt for the AI.
61920	66640	And I'm going to ask it specifically to write a Python script for Blender.
66640	71120	And to just start out simply, let's create 10 cubes and scatter them around our scene
71120	74480	with a maximum distance to the world origin of 10.
78320	82480	Once you've tied your prompt, you can simply hit enter and it will output something.
82480	86480	This usually takes a few seconds, but you can see it's already generating
86480	90160	a text and here it's generating a Python script.
90160	94080	So it's now done with the script and we can actually see that it creates a new scene
94080	95840	and sets the world origin and everything.
95840	100160	And it will also create an explanation of your script right here.
100160	104560	So let's test it out by going into Blender and opening the text editor over here.
105360	107440	And we will create a new text file.
108080	111360	And we're just going to paste the code that the AI just gave us.
111360	113920	We're going to go to text and run the script.
113920	116240	You can also press alt P and see what happens.
117360	118240	Here we go.
118240	120480	Okay, so we have I think 10 cubes.
120480	124640	Yes, there are 10 over here and they are scattered around the scene.
125280	127360	This one is actually still at the world origin.
127360	131280	So I wonder if this is the original cube or yeah,
131280	134880	it must be because it can't just be randomly at the starting point.
134880	138320	We can also scatter the objects in a non-random way.
138320	143520	Going back to GPT chat, I'm going to ask it to make a circular array of circles.
144240	148400	Again, we're going to ask it to write a Python script in Blender to do this.
151280	152960	Also, you want to be specific.
152960	156160	So I'm going to ask for 16 individual circles.
156160	160320	And the main circle that it's going to be scattered along,
160320	162400	I'm going to specify the radius.
165040	166560	So let's see what it comes up with now.
167520	170960	We can actually see that it's adding a primitive curve.
170960	172480	So it understands that.
172480	174880	So our AI is done writing the code.
174880	179200	Again, it gives a full explanation also at every line of the code.
179200	182240	It gives a small explanation, which is very useful.
182240	185760	We're just going to copy the code and paste it into our text editor.
185760	187600	Let's run our script and see what happens.
189120	193120	All right, so it's pretty hard to see, but there is definitely a circular array.
193360	200640	Yeah, if we select all of them, wow, this is actually pretty perfect because they align here.
203200	205840	This actually turned out better than I even imagined.
205840	208400	I just expected any size whatsoever,
208400	212080	but it made it the size so that they perfectly line up with each other.
212080	216080	To be honest, I wouldn't even know how to do this in Blender, let alone this quickly.
216640	222080	Going on to the next example, this might be the most useful use case for GPT chat.
222080	223840	And that is bulk actions.
225840	227600	So let's say we've imported this character,
227600	231360	but we can see every object has a different material,
231360	233760	even though some objects have the same color.
234400	236480	Where there are only four colors in this character,
236480	239120	but there are a bunch of materials.
239120	242560	This can happen sometimes when you switch objects between programs,
242560	245840	or especially when you import a bunch of vector graphics.
245840	250400	This is a prime example where GPT chat can save us hours of time.
250400	252720	Going back to our GPT chat window,
252720	255520	I'm going to ask the AI to look through all the materials
255520	260240	and see which materials have the same hex color value in their base color.
260240	263440	If it has the same hex value, it means it's the same color.
263440	268000	And then I'll ask it to combine those duplicate materials into one combined material
268000	270240	and then apply that material to the objects.
271120	272800	All right, the script is done.
272800	275920	And it says the script will iterate over every material
275920	277920	and get the base color of the material
277920	281520	and then convert it to a hex string and create a dictionary out of it.
281520	282880	Next time it finds a material,
282880	285040	it checks if it's already in the dictionary.
285040	288320	And if yes, it will add it to the list of materials with the same color.
288320	292080	And if it's not, it will create a new entry in the dictionary with a different color.
292080	294320	Then the script will iterate over all those colors
294320	297360	and see if there are colors with multiple materials.
297360	299920	If yes, it will create a combined material,
299920	302880	so a new material, and then apply that to the objects.
303520	308560	So let's go back to our text editor and just paste our script here
308560	310320	and run this and see what it does.
312240	318560	Okay, so we can see that it tries to delete all the materials at the very end
318560	319840	and something is going wrong.
321120	324400	Function material is expected a material type, not list.
324400	328080	I guess it's going wrong because it's trying to make a list called materials,
328080	330640	but maybe that term is already taken somewhere else.
330640	333040	So we're just going to get rid of that last sentence.
335840	338160	Nevertheless, if we now go to our object,
338160	341280	we can see that it has the correctly combined material.
341280	345920	So all these objects with the same color now have a combined material.
345920	349840	So we don't have to go through every object and select our material right here
349840	351680	because that saves a lot of time.
351680	354800	So for the last portion of this video, I want to get creative.
354800	358880	I want to ask the AI to actually generate a mesh for us.
358960	363040	One thing that's pretty complicated to generate normally in Blender is a fractal.
363040	365440	So we're going to create a Mandelbrot set.
365440	371120	And once again, it's as simple as creating a specific prompt for GPT chat.
371120	374880	I've been experimenting with creating fractals using GPT chat.
375920	378320	And it's a hit or miss situation.
378320	380240	Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
380240	383360	I haven't managed to create an actual 3D fractal yet,
383360	386320	but I have managed to create this 2D fractal.
386320	390000	Trying to get it to actually create a mesh itself,
390000	392000	it seems to have a lot of trouble with that.
392000	393760	You'd have to try this in the future though,
393760	396480	because this chatbot is constantly being updated.
396480	400560	So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a fractal using a point cloud.
400560	404640	It's similar to the method from bad normals and his whole fractal machine add-on.
404640	407200	So it's not like there's no other way to create them,
407200	410640	but it's just really cool to see how simple it is.
410640	414160	So I'm once again asking it to create a Python script for Blender.
414160	419200	I'm going to ask it to make a Mandobrot set out of points that is one layer thick.
419840	422320	I'm also asking it to convert points to vertices
422320	424640	so we can instantly see what the shape looks like.
430320	433360	GPT chat needs a little more time than usual to create this,
433360	437600	but we can see that it is now creating something.
437600	442080	It's very interesting because it's using a completely different method than before.
443040	446400	But yeah, it's still working with complex numbers
446400	451200	and doing all sorts of math that I am not qualified enough to understand.
451200	454640	So it's now creating the point cloud Mandobrot set.
454640	457200	It's even naming everything. It's so cool.
457200	458960	Okay, so our script seems to be done.
458960	461040	Let's copy it and see if it works.
462640	464000	It's the moment of truth. Let's see.
464720	472240	Okay, so I don't know what this is,
473200	478080	but it doesn't really resemble anything close to a Mandobrot set.
478080	480800	It just looks like an array of random points,
480800	484000	but that's no problem. We're just going to ask GPT chat again.
484000	488800	I also like to specify what happened because maybe the AI will see what went wrong.
488800	491920	So let's try to specify it as clearly as possible.
492880	498160	Currently, I can't get it to actually create the script that I got yesterday.
498160	501040	I'm just going to show you what it came up with yesterday.
501040	505200	Unfortunately, I have no footage of me giving the prompt and getting back that response.
505200	508320	So you'd have to trust me on the fact that I don't know anything about coding
508320	510080	and that the AI just made it for me.
510800	514720	So running the script actually takes quite a long time
514720	518160	and it will create this Mandobrot pillar.
518160	522080	It's actually a 3D shape, but it's just a bunch of 2D Mandobrot
522080	524160	slices stacked on top of each other.
524160	527040	You could definitely change the script so it outputs one slice,
527040	529840	but I just deleted every slice but one.
529840	533760	We're going to quickly hop into geometry notes and actually make something cool out of this.
533760	536160	So a quick way to make this look interesting is just
536160	538480	instancing cubes on every point.
538480	540720	We're going to grab an instance on points node
541840	545600	and just add them right here, and then we're going to create a cube as well.
546000	553840	And set the size to 0.01 and let's just connect this to our mesh.
554800	558400	And yeah, we have this pretty nice looking grid.
558400	560480	Obviously, this is just a static mesh.
560480	562320	It doesn't grow or anything.
562320	565680	If you want to change the parameters, you'd have to generate a new one.
565680	568080	Over here, I have this Mandobob as well.
568080	571360	We can quickly give it the geometry nodes group.
571360	572320	Yeah, there we go.
572640	576480	Of course, we can also use these points to create a mesh.
576480	580800	Let's again create a new geometry nodes group and let's add a mesh to points node
580800	583840	because these are actually vertices and not points.
583840	586560	Next, we're going to add a points to volume node.
587920	590000	And let's just play around with these settings a little bit.
590000	595280	The radius is way too high, so let's put it at 0.1 is too small, maybe 0.2.
596080	601520	We can still barely see it, so let's just create a volume to mesh node next.
602560	607120	If we want a more detailed shape, let's up the voxel threshold to 500.
607120	607680	There we go.
607680	610640	That's already looking more like a fractal.
610640	615200	And we can also play with the threshold of the volume to mesh node a little bit if we want to.
615840	617760	So yeah, we have a very quick Mandobob set.
617760	621200	I suggest just try asking a lot of questions to the AI.
621200	626000	Ask them in different ways and it will give you some surprising stuff.
626000	629440	Actually, one thing that I can't even explain is this thing.
629680	634800	It was a similar kind of point cloud setup and then change it into a mesh.
634800	637200	But what is even going on here?
637200	644720	We can maybe see this inflection point right here, but I couldn't tell you how this shape works
644720	646240	or what it looks like.
646240	650480	If you recognize this shape, if it has a name, let me know in the comments below
650480	654240	because it just looks so asymmetrical and abstract.
654240	656400	And yeah, the AI just generated this.
656880	661120	It generated a point cloud and then I just did the same as we did before with the Mandobob
661120	661440	set.
661440	664960	Just converted it to a mesh and yeah, pretty neat.
664960	666800	Couldn't have made this myself for sure.
667600	670480	So yeah, that concludes our introduction to GPT Chat.
670480	673040	It has some very interesting use cases.
673040	677520	Let me know in the comments what is the craziest response you got from GPT Chat.
677520	678960	I would love to know.
678960	681360	Without further ado, I'll catch you next time.
681360	685200	Leave a like on this video if you find it interesting and subscribe for future tutorials.
685920	687520	There are building something here.
687520	691760	It's been a hell to actually make this video, but I'll see you next time.
691760	692400	Bye bye.
