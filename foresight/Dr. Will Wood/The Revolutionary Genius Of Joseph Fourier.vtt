00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Joseph Fourier changed mathematics forever. He was the first person to really understand how

00:05.680 --> 00:11.680
heat works and he needed some radical maths to be able to deal with it. That's how Fourier series

00:11.680 --> 00:20.000
were first discovered. But this was still a long way away in 1795 when 27 year old Fourier had spent

00:20.000 --> 00:24.800
the last month in prison. This video was sponsored by Brilliant.

00:30.480 --> 00:35.360
You see, for the past few years this mathematics teacher turned revolutionary

00:35.360 --> 00:40.560
had been involved in the reign of terror, a movement which had seen thousands sent to the

00:40.560 --> 00:47.280
guillotine. But as political tensions eased for a short while, Fourier got a second chance and

00:47.280 --> 00:52.800
for the next few years his life was pretty calm. He got back into teaching and it seems like

00:52.800 --> 00:59.040
Fourier was a great teacher. In two years he became chair of analysis and mechanics at the

00:59.120 --> 01:08.480
coal polytechnique replacing the eminent Joseph Louis Lagrange. This ended abruptly in 1798 when

01:08.480 --> 01:14.240
a letter said his talents were needed for the sake of public service and he should prepare to leave

01:14.240 --> 01:21.840
immediately. This public service it turns out was the invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte.

01:22.800 --> 01:29.520
Here Fourier was put in charge of the Corrie de l'Egypt, a newspaper basically promoting

01:29.520 --> 01:35.520
propaganda for Napoleon. He was also made secretary for the Institute of Egypt which was

01:35.520 --> 01:42.960
founded by Napoleon to carry out scientific and historical research. It's said that at one point

01:42.960 --> 01:48.400
Fourier was the unofficial governor of large parts of Egypt while Napoleon was way fighting.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.080
When he finally got back to France about three years later Fourier was given another powerful

01:54.080 --> 02:00.240
political position as prefect of his heir, handed to him by Napoleon. But more importantly for us

02:00.800 --> 02:06.720
this is where he started work on what would become some of the biggest ideas in mathematics history.

02:06.720 --> 02:14.000
In the early 1800s he was a mystery. What it was and more crucially a mathematical description of how

02:14.000 --> 02:19.040
it works was at the top of the agenda for all the top scientists and mathematicians.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
When Fourier turned his attention to the problem of heat there were two well-established principles.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.560
First there was Newton's law of cooling where heat flux from an object is a constant the heat

02:32.560 --> 02:39.360
transfer rate times the surface area times the difference in temperature. And secondly

02:39.360 --> 02:45.280
pioneering experiments by Lavoisier and Laplace in which they built the first calorimeters

02:45.280 --> 02:50.480
showed that different materials had different capacities for heat storage. They worked out

02:50.480 --> 02:56.640
that an increment of heat dq it takes to raise the temperature of a mass m by an increment dT

02:57.360 --> 03:04.800
is equal to a constant c called the specific heat capacity of the material times m. A material with

03:04.800 --> 03:10.960
a high specific heat capacity therefore takes more heat to raise its temperature. Since an

03:10.960 --> 03:17.760
object's mass is its density rho multiplied by its volume v we can also write this as equal to c

03:17.760 --> 03:24.480
times rho times v which will turn out to be more useful later. Fourier wanted to calculate the flow

03:24.480 --> 03:30.480
of heat through solid objects. You see every point in space has its own temperature so temperature

03:30.480 --> 03:36.160
is a function of space but heat will flow from hotter regions to colder regions and so it changes

03:36.160 --> 03:44.640
of time. This means temperature is also a function of time. His brilliant insight was that if these

03:44.640 --> 03:50.800
two laws are true on the objects as a whole it should also be true within small pieces of the

03:50.800 --> 03:59.200
object. So he could use Newton Laplace and Lavoisier's laws to calculate heat flow within an object

03:59.200 --> 04:06.400
by breaking it up into infinitesimally small pieces. Take Newton's law for instance which

04:06.400 --> 04:12.880
tells us how heat flows across a surface area. Well if we imagine some tiny piece of surface

04:12.880 --> 04:21.520
area ds and suppose it's perpendicular to the x-axis and is at x equals a heat flow through it dq

04:22.240 --> 04:28.880
is Newton's law with the area replaced by ds and the temperature difference is the derivative

04:28.880 --> 04:35.920
of the temperature with respect to x evaluated at x equals a. This is now called Fourier's law.

04:37.440 --> 04:43.520
Now let's take a volume dv which is a tiny cube of material with sides of length dx

04:43.520 --> 04:50.880
and each face has an area ds. The heat flux into it per unit time will be the amount going in from

04:50.880 --> 04:58.160
one side dq1 minus the amount leaving from the other side dq2. Although I should say that we're not

04:58.160 --> 05:03.680
actually making assumptions about which way heat is going this is about the amount of flow in the

05:03.680 --> 05:14.160
x direction dq1 and dq2 can be positive or negative. Fourier's law applied to this volume gives us

05:14.160 --> 05:21.920
heat flux in and out but we can make things easier with some work on this dt by dx at a plus dx term.

05:22.640 --> 05:32.160
Rather than dt by dx at a plus dx we want something involving dt by dx at x equals a since dx is small

05:32.160 --> 05:39.840
we can assume that dt by dx is approximately a straight line over this range. We know that the

05:39.840 --> 05:49.440
dt by dx term at x equals a plus dx will be whatever it was at x equals a plus however much it's

05:50.400 --> 05:58.560
increased over the range dx which we'll call dt. From basic calculus we can get dt as the second

05:58.560 --> 06:10.080
derivative of t with respect to x evaluated at a multiplied by dx. So finally we have dt by dx at

06:10.080 --> 06:19.120
x equals a plus dx is the derivative of t at a plus the second derivative of t at a multiplied

06:19.200 --> 06:25.600
by dx. If you know Taylor series you might recognize this as the first order Taylor expansion.

06:26.160 --> 06:33.040
This is an important step because if we put that back into the equation for dq we find that the dt by

06:33.040 --> 06:42.800
dx terms cancel and so we're left with k times d squared t by dx squared times ds times dx times

06:42.880 --> 06:51.600
dt. This is where the specific heat capacity comes in. One thing to notice is that we have ds dx on

06:51.600 --> 06:58.880
the left hand side and dv on the right but these are the same thing and so they also cancel. If we

06:58.880 --> 07:06.160
divide both sides by dt we're left with the temperature by dt is a constant alpha and I've

07:06.160 --> 07:12.160
simplified things by combining the previous constants times the second derivative of temperature

07:12.160 --> 07:21.040
with respect to x. This is now what we call the heat equation. Actually this is the one-dimensional

07:21.040 --> 07:27.360
heat equation because we're only considering heat along the x-axis but if we want to add

07:27.360 --> 07:33.280
extra dimensions all we need to do is add the second derivative terms for each axis because

07:33.280 --> 07:41.040
we can think of heat flow happening independently in x, y and z. What it does is given the current

07:41.040 --> 07:47.920
temperature as a function of x it says where the second derivative that's the curvature is negative

07:47.920 --> 07:54.160
temperature will decrease as heat flows away from this region and where the second derivative is

07:54.160 --> 08:00.000
positive so the function is curving upwards the temperature will increase as heat flows in.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.560
This makes intuitive sense because the negatively curved regions represent local hot spots and

08:06.640 --> 08:14.000
positively curved regions represent local cold spots. This was a huge breakthrough for Fourier.

08:14.640 --> 08:20.320
Not only is it still the best model of heat we have today but it's also been applied in many

08:20.320 --> 08:25.520
other scenarios including the diffusion of molecules in liquids and the movement of stock

08:25.520 --> 08:32.000
market prices but the problem was now that Fourier had discovered the heat equation how do you actually

08:32.000 --> 08:39.840
solve it. Solving the heat equation means finding a function t of the spatial variables x, y and z

08:39.840 --> 08:46.400
if we're working in 3d and time t that you can plug into both sides and the equality holds

08:47.280 --> 08:52.720
but this is a partial differential equation meaning it has derivatives in more than one

08:52.720 --> 08:59.360
variable and these are notoriously hard to solve. Laplace had been studying a simpler

08:59.360 --> 09:04.720
partial differential equation and had found a solution that was useful to Fourier. For some

09:04.720 --> 09:11.280
function u we have the sum of its second derivatives is equal to zero. You might notice

09:11.280 --> 09:16.960
that it's likely heat equation but it's got no time component. Some of you who have studied

09:16.960 --> 09:23.680
vector calculus might also know there's a shorthand for this equation the Laplacian of u equals zero.

09:24.320 --> 09:30.080
Trying to solve the two-dimensional version Laplace found a useful approach was to look for

09:30.080 --> 09:38.960
solutions of the form of some function f of x only times some function g of y only. For example

09:38.960 --> 09:48.160
if we have u of x and y is equal to e to the minus kx times cosine of ky we can plug this

09:48.160 --> 09:57.600
into Laplace's equation and show that it is a solution. Laplace also found that if you have

09:57.600 --> 10:04.320
more than one solution you can combine them in a series with arbitrary constants that I've written

10:04.320 --> 10:12.560
here as a, b and c etc this is called a linear combination of solutions. So for example taking

10:12.560 --> 10:19.520
the earlier general solution we can form a new one by taking a linear combination of a set of them

10:19.520 --> 10:30.160
with different coefficients k1, k2, k3 etc. Now back to Fourier. He realized that Laplace's equation

10:30.160 --> 10:36.880
was useful for the 2d heat equation. He imagined a metal sheet which was infinitely long in the x

10:36.880 --> 10:44.240
direction and went from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2 in the y direction. It sounds very arbitrary

10:44.240 --> 10:50.400
but he did have a good reason. If we imagine fixing the temperature at 1 at x equals zero like it's

10:50.400 --> 10:56.560
being heated at this end and on the other edges y equals plus or minus pi over 2 the temperature is

10:56.560 --> 11:04.000
fixed at zero. These are the boundary conditions. Now the sheet would heat up for a period of time

11:04.000 --> 11:08.480
and then settle at a steady state that is the temperature would stop changing.

11:09.120 --> 11:15.200
What Fourier realized is that in the steady state the temperature stops changing with time.

11:15.200 --> 11:21.600
The derivative of the temperature with respect to time goes to zero and the heat equation becomes

11:21.600 --> 11:28.880
Laplace's equation. That means we already have a solution for the steady state. We can use Laplace's

11:28.880 --> 11:35.360
general solution. This is why Fourier made the sheet with these particular dimensions. He thought

11:35.360 --> 11:41.360
he might be able to find the right values for the coefficients to make the solution fit the boundary

11:41.360 --> 11:50.400
conditions. Firstly, since cosine of y is zero only when y is an odd number multiplied by plus

11:50.400 --> 11:58.720
or minus pi over 2 we can say that the values k1, k2 etc are just the odd numbers. This gives us

11:58.720 --> 12:06.480
the right values along the t equals zero edges but we need to make sure that t is always equal to 1

12:06.480 --> 12:14.720
when x is zero. At x equals zero all the exponential components become 1 which means Fourier was left

12:14.720 --> 12:21.280
with finding the coefficients such that this infinite series is equal to 1. Remember that y

12:21.280 --> 12:28.320
varies between minus pi over 2 to pi over 2 so this is the same of finding an infinite series

12:28.320 --> 12:35.120
of cosines such that they always add up to 1. But how do you go about finding these coefficients?

12:39.040 --> 12:45.680
Fourier's approach was genius. Realising that integrating cosine of mx times cosine of nx is

12:45.680 --> 12:53.760
zero if m is not equal to n and pi over 2 if n equals n. If you want to have a go about proving

12:53.760 --> 13:02.240
this try using the product identity for cosines. This gave Fourier a way to calculate any coefficient

13:02.240 --> 13:09.040
he wanted. Suppose you want to calculate c the coefficient of cosine of 5y. You can multiply

13:09.040 --> 13:17.360
both sides by cosine 5y and integrate from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2. Using the laws of

13:17.360 --> 13:23.360
integration we can distribute the integral. Now all of the integrals with different cosines we

13:23.360 --> 13:29.520
know will be zero. This leaves only the one we're interested in and we know the right hand side

13:29.520 --> 13:40.720
integral is pi over 2 from our product rule already. The left hand integral we can work out to give 2

13:40.720 --> 13:50.800
over 5 and this means that c is equal to 4 over 5pi. Working out the other coefficients gives

13:50.800 --> 13:58.320
an expression for 1 in the form of an infinite trigonometric series. Now Fourier knew this idea

13:58.320 --> 14:04.480
went way beyond just solving the heat equation. In fact when he published his book The Analytical

14:04.480 --> 14:11.120
Theory of Heat in 1822, Fourier dedicated large sections just to the study of these

14:11.120 --> 14:17.760
trigonometric series. What he recognised was the generality of the method. He said using this approach

14:17.760 --> 14:24.560
we can find a trigonometric series expansion for all possible functions including discontinuous ones

14:24.560 --> 14:31.120
and he gives us the method of finding the coefficients. This method is of course what we

14:31.120 --> 14:36.960
now know as Fourier series. That is given a function defined on some range usually minus

14:36.960 --> 14:43.840
pi to plus pi. Any range is acceptable but there has to be some scaling. We can write f of x as a

14:43.840 --> 14:51.440
series of sines and cosines with the coefficients a sub n equal to 1 over pi times the integral of f

14:51.440 --> 14:59.520
of x times cosine of nx and b sub n as 1 over pi times the integral of f of x times sine nx.
