0	5680	Joseph Fourier changed mathematics forever. He was the first person to really understand how
5680	11680	heat works and he needed some radical maths to be able to deal with it. That's how Fourier series
11680	20000	were first discovered. But this was still a long way away in 1795 when 27 year old Fourier had spent
20000	24800	the last month in prison. This video was sponsored by Brilliant.
30480	35360	You see, for the past few years this mathematics teacher turned revolutionary
35360	40560	had been involved in the reign of terror, a movement which had seen thousands sent to the
40560	47280	guillotine. But as political tensions eased for a short while, Fourier got a second chance and
47280	52800	for the next few years his life was pretty calm. He got back into teaching and it seems like
52800	59040	Fourier was a great teacher. In two years he became chair of analysis and mechanics at the
59120	68480	coal polytechnique replacing the eminent Joseph Louis Lagrange. This ended abruptly in 1798 when
68480	74240	a letter said his talents were needed for the sake of public service and he should prepare to leave
74240	81840	immediately. This public service it turns out was the invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte.
82800	89520	Here Fourier was put in charge of the Corrie de l'Egypt, a newspaper basically promoting
89520	95520	propaganda for Napoleon. He was also made secretary for the Institute of Egypt which was
95520	102960	founded by Napoleon to carry out scientific and historical research. It's said that at one point
102960	108400	Fourier was the unofficial governor of large parts of Egypt while Napoleon was way fighting.
109040	114080	When he finally got back to France about three years later Fourier was given another powerful
114080	120240	political position as prefect of his heir, handed to him by Napoleon. But more importantly for us
120800	126720	this is where he started work on what would become some of the biggest ideas in mathematics history.
126720	134000	In the early 1800s he was a mystery. What it was and more crucially a mathematical description of how
134000	139040	it works was at the top of the agenda for all the top scientists and mathematicians.
140000	146000	When Fourier turned his attention to the problem of heat there were two well-established principles.
146000	152560	First there was Newton's law of cooling where heat flux from an object is a constant the heat
152560	159360	transfer rate times the surface area times the difference in temperature. And secondly
159360	165280	pioneering experiments by Lavoisier and Laplace in which they built the first calorimeters
165280	170480	showed that different materials had different capacities for heat storage. They worked out
170480	176640	that an increment of heat dq it takes to raise the temperature of a mass m by an increment dT
177360	184800	is equal to a constant c called the specific heat capacity of the material times m. A material with
184800	190960	a high specific heat capacity therefore takes more heat to raise its temperature. Since an
190960	197760	object's mass is its density rho multiplied by its volume v we can also write this as equal to c
197760	204480	times rho times v which will turn out to be more useful later. Fourier wanted to calculate the flow
204480	210480	of heat through solid objects. You see every point in space has its own temperature so temperature
210480	216160	is a function of space but heat will flow from hotter regions to colder regions and so it changes
216160	224640	of time. This means temperature is also a function of time. His brilliant insight was that if these
224640	230800	two laws are true on the objects as a whole it should also be true within small pieces of the
230800	239200	object. So he could use Newton Laplace and Lavoisier's laws to calculate heat flow within an object
239200	246400	by breaking it up into infinitesimally small pieces. Take Newton's law for instance which
246400	252880	tells us how heat flows across a surface area. Well if we imagine some tiny piece of surface
252880	261520	area ds and suppose it's perpendicular to the x-axis and is at x equals a heat flow through it dq
262240	268880	is Newton's law with the area replaced by ds and the temperature difference is the derivative
268880	275920	of the temperature with respect to x evaluated at x equals a. This is now called Fourier's law.
277440	283520	Now let's take a volume dv which is a tiny cube of material with sides of length dx
283520	290880	and each face has an area ds. The heat flux into it per unit time will be the amount going in from
290880	298160	one side dq1 minus the amount leaving from the other side dq2. Although I should say that we're not
298160	303680	actually making assumptions about which way heat is going this is about the amount of flow in the
303680	314160	x direction dq1 and dq2 can be positive or negative. Fourier's law applied to this volume gives us
314160	321920	heat flux in and out but we can make things easier with some work on this dt by dx at a plus dx term.
322640	332160	Rather than dt by dx at a plus dx we want something involving dt by dx at x equals a since dx is small
332160	339840	we can assume that dt by dx is approximately a straight line over this range. We know that the
339840	349440	dt by dx term at x equals a plus dx will be whatever it was at x equals a plus however much it's
350400	358560	increased over the range dx which we'll call dt. From basic calculus we can get dt as the second
358560	370080	derivative of t with respect to x evaluated at a multiplied by dx. So finally we have dt by dx at
370080	379120	x equals a plus dx is the derivative of t at a plus the second derivative of t at a multiplied
379200	385600	by dx. If you know Taylor series you might recognize this as the first order Taylor expansion.
386160	393040	This is an important step because if we put that back into the equation for dq we find that the dt by
393040	402800	dx terms cancel and so we're left with k times d squared t by dx squared times ds times dx times
402880	411600	dt. This is where the specific heat capacity comes in. One thing to notice is that we have ds dx on
411600	418880	the left hand side and dv on the right but these are the same thing and so they also cancel. If we
418880	426160	divide both sides by dt we're left with the temperature by dt is a constant alpha and I've
426160	432160	simplified things by combining the previous constants times the second derivative of temperature
432160	441040	with respect to x. This is now what we call the heat equation. Actually this is the one-dimensional
441040	447360	heat equation because we're only considering heat along the x-axis but if we want to add
447360	453280	extra dimensions all we need to do is add the second derivative terms for each axis because
453280	461040	we can think of heat flow happening independently in x, y and z. What it does is given the current
461040	467920	temperature as a function of x it says where the second derivative that's the curvature is negative
467920	474160	temperature will decrease as heat flows away from this region and where the second derivative is
474160	480000	positive so the function is curving upwards the temperature will increase as heat flows in.
480000	486560	This makes intuitive sense because the negatively curved regions represent local hot spots and
486640	494000	positively curved regions represent local cold spots. This was a huge breakthrough for Fourier.
494640	500320	Not only is it still the best model of heat we have today but it's also been applied in many
500320	505520	other scenarios including the diffusion of molecules in liquids and the movement of stock
505520	512000	market prices but the problem was now that Fourier had discovered the heat equation how do you actually
512000	519840	solve it. Solving the heat equation means finding a function t of the spatial variables x, y and z
519840	526400	if we're working in 3d and time t that you can plug into both sides and the equality holds
527280	532720	but this is a partial differential equation meaning it has derivatives in more than one
532720	539360	variable and these are notoriously hard to solve. Laplace had been studying a simpler
539360	544720	partial differential equation and had found a solution that was useful to Fourier. For some
544720	551280	function u we have the sum of its second derivatives is equal to zero. You might notice
551280	556960	that it's likely heat equation but it's got no time component. Some of you who have studied
556960	563680	vector calculus might also know there's a shorthand for this equation the Laplacian of u equals zero.
564320	570080	Trying to solve the two-dimensional version Laplace found a useful approach was to look for
570080	578960	solutions of the form of some function f of x only times some function g of y only. For example
578960	588160	if we have u of x and y is equal to e to the minus kx times cosine of ky we can plug this
588160	597600	into Laplace's equation and show that it is a solution. Laplace also found that if you have
597600	604320	more than one solution you can combine them in a series with arbitrary constants that I've written
604320	612560	here as a, b and c etc this is called a linear combination of solutions. So for example taking
612560	619520	the earlier general solution we can form a new one by taking a linear combination of a set of them
619520	630160	with different coefficients k1, k2, k3 etc. Now back to Fourier. He realized that Laplace's equation
630160	636880	was useful for the 2d heat equation. He imagined a metal sheet which was infinitely long in the x
636880	644240	direction and went from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2 in the y direction. It sounds very arbitrary
644240	650400	but he did have a good reason. If we imagine fixing the temperature at 1 at x equals zero like it's
650400	656560	being heated at this end and on the other edges y equals plus or minus pi over 2 the temperature is
656560	664000	fixed at zero. These are the boundary conditions. Now the sheet would heat up for a period of time
664000	668480	and then settle at a steady state that is the temperature would stop changing.
669120	675200	What Fourier realized is that in the steady state the temperature stops changing with time.
675200	681600	The derivative of the temperature with respect to time goes to zero and the heat equation becomes
681600	688880	Laplace's equation. That means we already have a solution for the steady state. We can use Laplace's
688880	695360	general solution. This is why Fourier made the sheet with these particular dimensions. He thought
695360	701360	he might be able to find the right values for the coefficients to make the solution fit the boundary
701360	710400	conditions. Firstly, since cosine of y is zero only when y is an odd number multiplied by plus
710400	718720	or minus pi over 2 we can say that the values k1, k2 etc are just the odd numbers. This gives us
718720	726480	the right values along the t equals zero edges but we need to make sure that t is always equal to 1
726480	734720	when x is zero. At x equals zero all the exponential components become 1 which means Fourier was left
734720	741280	with finding the coefficients such that this infinite series is equal to 1. Remember that y
741280	748320	varies between minus pi over 2 to pi over 2 so this is the same of finding an infinite series
748320	755120	of cosines such that they always add up to 1. But how do you go about finding these coefficients?
759040	765680	Fourier's approach was genius. Realising that integrating cosine of mx times cosine of nx is
765680	773760	zero if m is not equal to n and pi over 2 if n equals n. If you want to have a go about proving
773760	782240	this try using the product identity for cosines. This gave Fourier a way to calculate any coefficient
782240	789040	he wanted. Suppose you want to calculate c the coefficient of cosine of 5y. You can multiply
789040	797360	both sides by cosine 5y and integrate from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2. Using the laws of
797360	803360	integration we can distribute the integral. Now all of the integrals with different cosines we
803360	809520	know will be zero. This leaves only the one we're interested in and we know the right hand side
809520	820720	integral is pi over 2 from our product rule already. The left hand integral we can work out to give 2
820720	830800	over 5 and this means that c is equal to 4 over 5pi. Working out the other coefficients gives
830800	838320	an expression for 1 in the form of an infinite trigonometric series. Now Fourier knew this idea
838320	844480	went way beyond just solving the heat equation. In fact when he published his book The Analytical
844480	851120	Theory of Heat in 1822, Fourier dedicated large sections just to the study of these
851120	857760	trigonometric series. What he recognised was the generality of the method. He said using this approach
857760	864560	we can find a trigonometric series expansion for all possible functions including discontinuous ones
864560	871120	and he gives us the method of finding the coefficients. This method is of course what we
871120	876960	now know as Fourier series. That is given a function defined on some range usually minus
876960	883840	pi to plus pi. Any range is acceptable but there has to be some scaling. We can write f of x as a
883840	891440	series of sines and cosines with the coefficients a sub n equal to 1 over pi times the integral of f
891440	899520	of x times cosine of nx and b sub n as 1 over pi times the integral of f of x times sine nx.
