00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Joseph Fourier changed mathematics forever. He was the first person to really understand how

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,680
heat works and he needed some radical maths to be able to deal with it. That's how Fourier series

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,000
were first discovered. But this was still a long way away in 1795 when 27 year old Fourier had spent

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,800
the last month in prison. This video was sponsored by Brilliant.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
You see, for the past few years this mathematics teacher turned revolutionary

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,560
had been involved in the reign of terror, a movement which had seen thousands sent to the

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,280
guillotine. But as political tensions eased for a short while, Fourier got a second chance and

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,800
for the next few years his life was pretty calm. He got back into teaching and it seems like

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,040
Fourier was a great teacher. In two years he became chair of analysis and mechanics at the

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:08,480
coal polytechnique replacing the eminent Joseph Louis Lagrange. This ended abruptly in 1798 when

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,240
a letter said his talents were needed for the sake of public service and he should prepare to leave

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,840
immediately. This public service it turns out was the invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte.

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:29,520
Here Fourier was put in charge of the Corrie de l'Egypt, a newspaper basically promoting

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,520
propaganda for Napoleon. He was also made secretary for the Institute of Egypt which was

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,960
founded by Napoleon to carry out scientific and historical research. It's said that at one point

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Fourier was the unofficial governor of large parts of Egypt while Napoleon was way fighting.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,080
When he finally got back to France about three years later Fourier was given another powerful

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,240
political position as prefect of his heir, handed to him by Napoleon. But more importantly for us

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,720
this is where he started work on what would become some of the biggest ideas in mathematics history.

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,000
In the early 1800s he was a mystery. What it was and more crucially a mathematical description of how

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,040
it works was at the top of the agenda for all the top scientists and mathematicians.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
When Fourier turned his attention to the problem of heat there were two well-established principles.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,560
First there was Newton's law of cooling where heat flux from an object is a constant the heat

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,360
transfer rate times the surface area times the difference in temperature. And secondly

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,280
pioneering experiments by Lavoisier and Laplace in which they built the first calorimeters

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,480
showed that different materials had different capacities for heat storage. They worked out

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,640
that an increment of heat dq it takes to raise the temperature of a mass m by an increment dT

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,800
is equal to a constant c called the specific heat capacity of the material times m. A material with

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,960
a high specific heat capacity therefore takes more heat to raise its temperature. Since an

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,760
object's mass is its density rho multiplied by its volume v we can also write this as equal to c

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,480
times rho times v which will turn out to be more useful later. Fourier wanted to calculate the flow

32
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,480
of heat through solid objects. You see every point in space has its own temperature so temperature

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,160
is a function of space but heat will flow from hotter regions to colder regions and so it changes

34
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,640
of time. This means temperature is also a function of time. His brilliant insight was that if these

35
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,800
two laws are true on the objects as a whole it should also be true within small pieces of the

36
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:59,200
object. So he could use Newton Laplace and Lavoisier's laws to calculate heat flow within an object

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,400
by breaking it up into infinitesimally small pieces. Take Newton's law for instance which

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,880
tells us how heat flows across a surface area. Well if we imagine some tiny piece of surface

39
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:21,520
area ds and suppose it's perpendicular to the x-axis and is at x equals a heat flow through it dq

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,880
is Newton's law with the area replaced by ds and the temperature difference is the derivative

41
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,920
of the temperature with respect to x evaluated at x equals a. This is now called Fourier's law.

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,520
Now let's take a volume dv which is a tiny cube of material with sides of length dx

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,880
and each face has an area ds. The heat flux into it per unit time will be the amount going in from

44
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,160
one side dq1 minus the amount leaving from the other side dq2. Although I should say that we're not

45
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,680
actually making assumptions about which way heat is going this is about the amount of flow in the

46
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:14,160
x direction dq1 and dq2 can be positive or negative. Fourier's law applied to this volume gives us

47
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:21,920
heat flux in and out but we can make things easier with some work on this dt by dx at a plus dx term.

48
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:32,160
Rather than dt by dx at a plus dx we want something involving dt by dx at x equals a since dx is small

49
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,840
we can assume that dt by dx is approximately a straight line over this range. We know that the

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:49,440
dt by dx term at x equals a plus dx will be whatever it was at x equals a plus however much it's

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:58,560
increased over the range dx which we'll call dt. From basic calculus we can get dt as the second

52
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:10,080
derivative of t with respect to x evaluated at a multiplied by dx. So finally we have dt by dx at

53
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:19,120
x equals a plus dx is the derivative of t at a plus the second derivative of t at a multiplied

54
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,600
by dx. If you know Taylor series you might recognize this as the first order Taylor expansion.

55
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,040
This is an important step because if we put that back into the equation for dq we find that the dt by

56
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:42,800
dx terms cancel and so we're left with k times d squared t by dx squared times ds times dx times

57
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,600
dt. This is where the specific heat capacity comes in. One thing to notice is that we have ds dx on

58
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,880
the left hand side and dv on the right but these are the same thing and so they also cancel. If we

59
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,160
divide both sides by dt we're left with the temperature by dt is a constant alpha and I've

60
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,160
simplified things by combining the previous constants times the second derivative of temperature

61
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:21,040
with respect to x. This is now what we call the heat equation. Actually this is the one-dimensional

62
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:27,360
heat equation because we're only considering heat along the x-axis but if we want to add

63
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,280
extra dimensions all we need to do is add the second derivative terms for each axis because

64
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:41,040
we can think of heat flow happening independently in x, y and z. What it does is given the current

65
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,920
temperature as a function of x it says where the second derivative that's the curvature is negative

66
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,160
temperature will decrease as heat flows away from this region and where the second derivative is

67
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,000
positive so the function is curving upwards the temperature will increase as heat flows in.

68
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,560
This makes intuitive sense because the negatively curved regions represent local hot spots and

69
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:14,000
positively curved regions represent local cold spots. This was a huge breakthrough for Fourier.

70
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,320
Not only is it still the best model of heat we have today but it's also been applied in many

71
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,520
other scenarios including the diffusion of molecules in liquids and the movement of stock

72
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,000
market prices but the problem was now that Fourier had discovered the heat equation how do you actually

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,840
solve it. Solving the heat equation means finding a function t of the spatial variables x, y and z

74
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,400
if we're working in 3d and time t that you can plug into both sides and the equality holds

75
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,720
but this is a partial differential equation meaning it has derivatives in more than one

76
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,360
variable and these are notoriously hard to solve. Laplace had been studying a simpler

77
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,720
partial differential equation and had found a solution that was useful to Fourier. For some

78
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,280
function u we have the sum of its second derivatives is equal to zero. You might notice

79
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,960
that it's likely heat equation but it's got no time component. Some of you who have studied

80
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,680
vector calculus might also know there's a shorthand for this equation the Laplacian of u equals zero.

81
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,080
Trying to solve the two-dimensional version Laplace found a useful approach was to look for

82
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,960
solutions of the form of some function f of x only times some function g of y only. For example

83
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:48,160
if we have u of x and y is equal to e to the minus kx times cosine of ky we can plug this

84
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:57,600
into Laplace's equation and show that it is a solution. Laplace also found that if you have

85
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,320
more than one solution you can combine them in a series with arbitrary constants that I've written

86
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,560
here as a, b and c etc this is called a linear combination of solutions. So for example taking

87
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,520
the earlier general solution we can form a new one by taking a linear combination of a set of them

88
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:30,160
with different coefficients k1, k2, k3 etc. Now back to Fourier. He realized that Laplace's equation

89
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,880
was useful for the 2d heat equation. He imagined a metal sheet which was infinitely long in the x

90
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,240
direction and went from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2 in the y direction. It sounds very arbitrary

91
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,400
but he did have a good reason. If we imagine fixing the temperature at 1 at x equals zero like it's

92
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,560
being heated at this end and on the other edges y equals plus or minus pi over 2 the temperature is

93
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,000
fixed at zero. These are the boundary conditions. Now the sheet would heat up for a period of time

94
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,480
and then settle at a steady state that is the temperature would stop changing.

95
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,200
What Fourier realized is that in the steady state the temperature stops changing with time.

96
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,600
The derivative of the temperature with respect to time goes to zero and the heat equation becomes

97
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,880
Laplace's equation. That means we already have a solution for the steady state. We can use Laplace's

98
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,360
general solution. This is why Fourier made the sheet with these particular dimensions. He thought

99
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,360
he might be able to find the right values for the coefficients to make the solution fit the boundary

100
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:50,400
conditions. Firstly, since cosine of y is zero only when y is an odd number multiplied by plus

101
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:58,720
or minus pi over 2 we can say that the values k1, k2 etc are just the odd numbers. This gives us

102
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,480
the right values along the t equals zero edges but we need to make sure that t is always equal to 1

103
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,720
when x is zero. At x equals zero all the exponential components become 1 which means Fourier was left

104
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,280
with finding the coefficients such that this infinite series is equal to 1. Remember that y

105
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,320
varies between minus pi over 2 to pi over 2 so this is the same of finding an infinite series

106
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,120
of cosines such that they always add up to 1. But how do you go about finding these coefficients?

107
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,680
Fourier's approach was genius. Realising that integrating cosine of mx times cosine of nx is

108
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,760
zero if m is not equal to n and pi over 2 if n equals n. If you want to have a go about proving

109
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,240
this try using the product identity for cosines. This gave Fourier a way to calculate any coefficient

110
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,040
he wanted. Suppose you want to calculate c the coefficient of cosine of 5y. You can multiply

111
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:17,360
both sides by cosine 5y and integrate from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2. Using the laws of

112
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,360
integration we can distribute the integral. Now all of the integrals with different cosines we

113
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,520
know will be zero. This leaves only the one we're interested in and we know the right hand side

114
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:40,720
integral is pi over 2 from our product rule already. The left hand integral we can work out to give 2

115
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:50,800
over 5 and this means that c is equal to 4 over 5pi. Working out the other coefficients gives

116
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,320
an expression for 1 in the form of an infinite trigonometric series. Now Fourier knew this idea

117
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,480
went way beyond just solving the heat equation. In fact when he published his book The Analytical

118
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,120
Theory of Heat in 1822, Fourier dedicated large sections just to the study of these

119
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,760
trigonometric series. What he recognised was the generality of the method. He said using this approach

120
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,560
we can find a trigonometric series expansion for all possible functions including discontinuous ones

121
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,120
and he gives us the method of finding the coefficients. This method is of course what we

122
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,960
now know as Fourier series. That is given a function defined on some range usually minus

123
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,840
pi to plus pi. Any range is acceptable but there has to be some scaling. We can write f of x as a

124
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:51,440
series of sines and cosines with the coefficients a sub n equal to 1 over pi times the integral of f

125
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,520
of x times cosine of nx and b sub n as 1 over pi times the integral of f of x times sine nx.

126
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,040
