0	6880	So today we're very happy to have Daniel Robbins from Albany, who is going to tell us about the
6880	12400	composition of defaults, content symmetries, and anomalies. Please, Daniel, take it away.
12400	17840	Thanks, yeah. So it's the usual, you know, title, form, the recollection of random terms, but
18880	23760	really, it's basically about a bunch of work I've been doing over the past couple of years. So a
23760	29040	paper a couple of years ago with my student Thomas Vandermillen, and then four papers and counting
30160	34720	together with Eric Sharp from this year, where we're really starting to uncover
35680	38080	a fairly interesting structure. At the end of the day,
40880	44560	we may or may not be getting anything, you know, really new, we're not getting new constructions
44560	49520	exactly. But I want to claim that we're, we've got sort of new ways of thinking of anomalies and how
49520	55360	they fit together when you, when you gauge things. And in particular, in the presence of trivially
55440	62640	acting symmetries. So, and I also just want to say, with all of this, my student Thomas has
62640	66480	put in a lot of work and he's on the market this year. So if you enjoy the story we're telling,
66480	74240	then consider keeping an eye out for his applications. All right, so I want to talk
74240	79920	about two dimensional CFTs and global symmetries and taking orbifolds. So basically gauging those
79920	87680	symmetries. This is an old story, of course, a slightly more modern way to think about these
87680	95120	things I would claim is through the language of topological defect lines. So in this picture,
95840	101920	any global symmetry, so if you've got a global symmetry group gamma, any given element g of
101920	108480	gamma, you can think of g, you know, the action of that group on your, on your theory in terms of some
109040	114240	line, line operator g. So if you've got the cylinder here, you've got some state coming in from below.
115840	119440	If you put that line around the cylinder and then fuse it down here,
120480	127840	you just get the action of g on that state. These lines are topological. So the corresponding
128960	132880	line operators commute with the stress tensor. And that means we can freely deform
