00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
So today we're very happy to have Daniel Robbins from Albany, who is going to tell us about the

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,400
composition of defaults, content symmetries, and anomalies. Please, Daniel, take it away.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,840
Thanks, yeah. So it's the usual, you know, title, form, the recollection of random terms, but

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,760
really, it's basically about a bunch of work I've been doing over the past couple of years. So a

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,040
paper a couple of years ago with my student Thomas Vandermillen, and then four papers and counting

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,720
together with Eric Sharp from this year, where we're really starting to uncover

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,080
a fairly interesting structure. At the end of the day,

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,560
we may or may not be getting anything, you know, really new, we're not getting new constructions

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,520
exactly. But I want to claim that we're, we've got sort of new ways of thinking of anomalies and how

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,360
they fit together when you, when you gauge things. And in particular, in the presence of trivially

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,640
acting symmetries. So, and I also just want to say, with all of this, my student Thomas has

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,480
put in a lot of work and he's on the market this year. So if you enjoy the story we're telling,

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,240
then consider keeping an eye out for his applications. All right, so I want to talk

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,920
about two dimensional CFTs and global symmetries and taking orbifolds. So basically gauging those

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,680
symmetries. This is an old story, of course, a slightly more modern way to think about these

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,120
things I would claim is through the language of topological defect lines. So in this picture,

17
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,920
any global symmetry, so if you've got a global symmetry group gamma, any given element g of

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,480
gamma, you can think of g, you know, the action of that group on your, on your theory in terms of some

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,240
line, line operator g. So if you've got the cylinder here, you've got some state coming in from below.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,440
If you put that line around the cylinder and then fuse it down here,

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,840
you just get the action of g on that state. These lines are topological. So the corresponding

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,880
line operators commute with the stress tensor. And that means we can freely deform
