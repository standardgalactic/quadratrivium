00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to Gresham College, and to this book launch of my number theory, a very short introduction.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's one of the latest in the popular series of very short introductions, which Oxford University Press has produced over the past 25 years.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I was also fortunate to have been invited to write the very short introduction to combinatorics, which appeared in 2016.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've always been interested in the history of mathematics, and in the book and in this lecture you'll meet four of the prime figures who feature throughout my story.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria top right, who wrote his classic text The Elements in the third century BC, and who probably didn't look like this.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Pierre Fermat, on the left, a lawyer in southern France in the early 17th century.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Leonard Euler, an 18th century Swiss mathematician who was probably the most prolific mathematician of all time,

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician who published a classic text on number theory in the year 1801.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It was Gauss who claimed that mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So what is number theory?

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Basically, it's the branch of mathematics that's primarily concerned with our ordinary counting numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sometimes called the positive integers.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And it's concerned with whether they're odd or even, or are perfect squares or cubes,

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
or can be divided exactly by seven or some other number, or have some other such property.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Particularly important throughout the subject of the prime numbers, which we can think of as the building blocks of the subject,

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
like atoms in chemistry, and which are the only numbers whose only factors are itself and one.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
For example, 11, 13, 17 and 19 are all prime, we can't split them up into factors.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But 15 and 18 are not, because 15 is three times five, and 18 is two times nine,

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
which we can then write as two times three times three.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But we must be careful, because some numbers that look as though they might be prime numbers, such as 91 and 323 are not,

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
because 91 is seven times 13, and 323 is 17 times 19.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So it's not always easy to spot whether a given number is prime.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For example, how about the three numbers at the bottom of the screen?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll tell you about these ones later on.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So here are some of the questions that I'll be talking about today.

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The first ones are clearly about numbers, such as whether that last number is prime,

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
whether any number made entirely of ones is a perfect square,

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and various problems arising from the calendar.

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But number theory also expands into other areas, such as the geometry of right-angled triangles,

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and the construction of regular shapes.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You'll also see applications to the shuffling of cards,

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and even to more practical matters, such as the security of your credit cards,

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
which is based on a result on prime numbers that dates back to the 18th century.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Number theory, once an abstract branch of pure mathematics that was studied for its own sake,

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
is now also central to the study of cryptography and to other subjects of practical importance.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So here are the subjects I'll be talking about today.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
First, prime numbers. How many are there? How are they distributed?

38
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And how do they arise in geometry?

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Next, perfect squares. How can we recognise them?

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What do they tell us about right-angled triangles?

41
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I'll also show you two results related to Fermar.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Third is clock arithmetic and the mathematics of the calendar.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And finally, yet another result of Fermar is generalisation by Euler,

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and applications to the counting of necklaces, the shuffling of cards,

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and, as promised, protecting your credit cards.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And if you find any of these topics too technical,

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
just hold on as I'll soon switch back to more straightforward topics.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So let's start with prime numbers.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Here's a table of the primes up to 100.

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's been produced by an ancient Greek method called the sieve of eratosnes,

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
where we first list all the numbers up to 100,

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
then cross out the multiples of 2, that is 4, 6, 8, etc.

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Then the multiples of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Actually, 6 and 12 have already been crossed out.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then those are 5, and then 7,

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
until we get the numbers that appear in yellow here.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
These are the primes.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You may ask why one isn't a prime.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The answer relies on a fundamental property of our number system,

60
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that we can get every number by multiplying primes together.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
For example, 60 is 2 times 2 times 3 times 5,

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and that this can be done in only one way,

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
apart from the order that the primes appear.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So we could have written 60 as 2 times 5 times 3 times 2,

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
or some other order,

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
but there must always be 2 2s, 1 3 and 1 5.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But if we took 1 to be a prime,

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
we could then write 6 as 2 times 3,

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
or 2 times 3 times 1,

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or 2 times 3 times 1 times 1, and so on.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We'd lose this fundamental property of factorisation into primes in only one way.

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That would be a great loss,

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
so we choose to make 1 not a prime.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But we can never list all the primes because the list goes on forever.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But how would we prove this?

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Unfortunately, given any prime,

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
there's no rule for listing the next one.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
For example, what's the next prime after 997?

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's not at all obvious that it's 109.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But Euclid, in his book The Elements,

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
came up with a very different approach.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Here it is in the earliest surviving copy of The Elements

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
from AD 888 in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And here's an English version of Euclid's proof.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The thing to note is that it's a geometric argument.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Instead of numbers, he used the lengths of various lines.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So how did his proof go?

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Here it is in modern language.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's make the assumption that the list does not go on forever,

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and that these are the only primes.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We've called them P1, P2, P3 and so on up to Pn.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're assuming there are no others.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We'll now create a new number by multiplying them all together

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and adding one.

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we'll call this capital N.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Then each of our primes divides the quantity in brackets,

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
the product, and so none of them can divide the number N,

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
which is got by adding one to it.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So what can we say about N?

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because it's not divisible by any of our primes,

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it must itself be a new prime,

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
or possibly be made up of new primes.

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So in either case, there's a new prime,

104
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and this contradicts our assumption that we've listed all of the primes.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So our assumption must have been wrong.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We cannot list all the primes,

107
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and so the list must go on forever.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Incidentally, both of these possibilities for N can occur.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If the only primes that we knew were 2, 3, 5 and 7,

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
then N would be their product, that's 210 plus 1,

111
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
which is 211,

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and this is a prime that we didn't have before.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But if the only primes that we knew were the ones up to 13,

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
then multiplying them together and adding one

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
to N is 30,031,

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
which actually isn't prime, it's 59 times 509,

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so here we get two new primes we didn't have before.

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But we can say more.

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We can adapt Euclid's proof to prove that the list of primes

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
of the four N plus three goes on forever.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
These are the primes which have three more than a multiple of four,

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
such as three itself,

123
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
or seven, which is four plus three,

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
or eleven, which is two fours plus three, and so on.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So these are all primes of the four and four N plus three.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We can also prove that there are infinitely many primes

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
that are one more than a multiple of four.

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The primes of the four and four N plus one, such as five,

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
that's four plus one,

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
thirteen, three fours plus one,

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and seventeen, four fours plus one, and so on.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So there are infinitely many primes of the four and four N plus one,

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and four N plus three.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But we obviously can't say the same for numbers of the four and four N plus two,

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
because these numbers are all even,

136
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and so none of them can be prime apart from two itself.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And the general result along these lines

138
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
was proved by the German mathematician Lejeune Dirichlet

139
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in 1837.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In this tour de force,

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
he showed that there are infinitely many primes of the four N plus B

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
for any numbers A and B,

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
as long as A and B have no factors in common.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This result was, and still is,

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
extremely difficult to prove.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But it includes the cases four N plus one and four N plus three,

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
because four has no factors in common with one or three.

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And if we now take A to be ten and B to be nine,

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
which also have no factors in common,

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
we see there are infinitely many primes of the four and ten N plus nine.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That is infinitely many prime numbers ending with nine.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And in the same way,

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
there are infinitely many prime numbers ending with one,

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
or with three,

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
or with seven.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's now turn to something different.

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Numbers that are one less than a power of two.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They're named after Mariam Meir Sen,

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
a French mathematician and friar

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
who investigated them in the 17th century.

161
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If we look at these Meir Sen numbers,

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we'll see that some of them are prime.

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Two squared minus one is three.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Two cubed minus one is seven.

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Two to the fifth minus one is 31.

166
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And two to the seventh minus one is 127.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And these are all primes.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But other Meir Sen numbers are not prime.

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Two to the fourth minus one is 15, which isn't prime.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And two to the sixth minus one is 63.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Two to the eighth minus one is 255.

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And two to the ninth minus one is 511.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And none of these is prime.

174
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So looking at the powers of two that appear here,

175
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
it's very tempting to believe that two to the N minus one is always prime

176
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
when the exponent, the power N, is prime.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Here they're two, three, five and seven.

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And that it's never prime when the exponent N isn't prime.

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And here they're four, six, eight and nine.

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But is this always the case?

181
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The answer is partly.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's not difficult to show that if N is not prime,

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
then two to the N minus one isn't prime either.

184
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But if N is prime, we have to be more careful.

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
For example, if we take the next prime, 11,

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
we have two to the 11 minus one, which is 2047.

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Now this may look prime, but it isn't.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's 23 times 89.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So if N is prime, then two to the N minus one may or may not be prime.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mersen himself came up with a list of primes of this form,

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
which is why they're named after him.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He made a few false claims and he left out a couple of them,

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
but it was an impressive list for the time,

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
especially because he correctly included two to the 127 minus one,

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
which is a prime number with 39 digits.

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So why are these numbers of interest,

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
or are they simply a curiosity?

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It turns out that if we're looking for new primes,

199
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
then Mersen primes turn out to be our best bet.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
For example, the last 17 primes that have been found

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
have all been of this kind,

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
including the most recently discovered one in December 2018,

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
which is two to the 82,589,933 minus one,

204
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
a prime number with almost 25 million digits.

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But another reason for looking at Mersen primes

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
is that they turn up in connection with a problem

207
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that dates from ancient Greek times.

208
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The Greeks were interested in numbers,

209
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
which they called perfect numbers,

210
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
whose factors, apart from the number itself, add up to the original number.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
For example, six is perfect because it's factors of one, two and three,

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
and these add up to six.

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And 28 is perfect because it's factors of one, two, four, seven and fourteen,

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and these add up to 28.

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The next two, also known to the Greeks,

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
were 496 and 8128,

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and then there aren't any more of them until 33,550,366.

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So how did the Greeks find these perfect numbers?

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
To see why they found them, let's factorise them.

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We find that six is two times three,

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
which we can write as two to the one times two squared minus one.

222
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
28 is four times seven, which we can write as two squared,

223
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
times two cubed minus one.

224
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
496 is 16 times 31,

225
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
which is two to the fourth times two to the fifth minus one.

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
8128 is 64 times 127,

227
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
which is two to the sixth times two to the seventh minus one.

228
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And the other one, 33,550,336,

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
is 4,096 times 8,191,

230
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
which is two to the twelfth times two to the thirteenth minus one.

231
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So in each case, it's a power of two,

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
multiplied by a mercen prime, in fact, the next one.

233
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, all of this is known to Euclid,

234
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
whose book, The Elements, includes a proof

235
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
that the product of two to the n minus one

236
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and two to the n minus one is a perfect number,

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
as long as the second of these numbers is prime.

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The next question is, does this give us all the perfect numbers?

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
2,000 years after Euclid,

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
then did Euler prove that every even perfect number is of Euclid's type?

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But are there any odd perfect numbers?

242
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Euler didn't know, and nor indeed does anyone.

243
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If there are any odd perfect numbers,

244
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
there'll be absolutely huge, more than 10 to the power of 1,500,

245
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
so they probably don't exist, but who knows?

246
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Before we leave prime numbers, let's explore one more type.

247
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This time introduced by Fermat.

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Instead of looking at prime numbers of the form 2 to the n minus one,

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
let's consider primes of the form 2 to the n plus one.

250
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It turns out that these can be prime only when n is itself a power of two,

251
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
two to the two to the n plus one.

252
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So let's look at some of these.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Fermat found the first few.

254
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Two to the one plus one, which is three.

255
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Two to the two plus one, which is five.

256
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Two to the four plus one, which is 17.

257
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Notice that the exponents are powers of two.

258
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Two to the eighth plus one is 257,

259
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and two to the sixteenth plus one, which is 65,537.

260
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Fermat noticed that these are all prime,

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and he made the conjecture that every number of this form must be prime.

262
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So the next one to test is two to the 32 plus one.

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that prime?

264
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well, unfortunately, it's a ten digit number over four billion,

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and Fermat's pocket calculator didn't go that far.

266
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So Fermat never found out whether his conjecture was true or not.

267
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But once again, Leonard Euler came to the rescue.

268
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
After doing many calculations, he discovered that two to the 32 plus one

269
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
can be evenly divided by 641.

270
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And later he found a method that gave this answer more quickly.

271
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But even Euler was stuck with the next one, two to the 64th plus one,

272
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
which was a 20 digit number, which also turns out not to be prime.

273
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But its smallest prime factor is over 200,000,

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so it's not surprising that Euler missed it.

275
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But worse was to come.

276
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Many other Fermat numbers are now known,

277
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and none of them has turned out to be prime.

278
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So Fermat's conjecture has turned out to be rather an unfortunate one.

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But all is not lost as Fermat primes turned up again,

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
but in the most unexpected place, the drawing of regular polygons.

281
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
These are polygons where all the size and all the angles are equal.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The ancient Greeks were very interested in trying to construct these,

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
whereby constructing, they allow themselves to use only an unmarked ruler,

284
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
no measuring allowed, and a pair of compasses.

285
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Here's how Euclid constructed an equilateral triangle.

286
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Starting with a line AB,

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
use the compasses to draw the circle on the left,

288
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
where the centre is A and the radius is AB.

289
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So that gives you the left-hand circle.

290
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Then draw the circle on the right by taking the centre to be B,

291
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and the radius is BA.

292
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And then you have two circles.

293
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
These two circles intersect at the point C.

294
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Now the length AB is the same as AC

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because each is a radius of the left-hand circle,

296
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and the length BA is equal to the length BC

297
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
because each is a radius of the right-hand circle,

298
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
so all three sides are equal, and we have an equilateral triangle.

299
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And constructing a regular hexagon is even easier.

300
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Draw a circle with centre O and some radius OA.

301
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Then with a compass point A and the same radius,

302
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
mark off the point B on the circle.

303
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Then with a compass point B and the same radius,

304
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
mark off the point C,

305
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and then in the same way the points D, E and F.

306
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And if you join these six points together,

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
that gives us a regular hexagon.

308
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What other polygons can we draw?

309
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Euclid also showed how to construct a square

310
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and a regular pentagon using just an unmarked rule and compasses,

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and he also showed how to double the number of sides

312
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
of a regular polygon.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So starting with an equilateral triangle,

314
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
with three sides,

315
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
we can draw a regular hexagon,

316
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and we can draw a regular hexagon.

317
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The triangle, with three sides,

318
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
we can construct regular polygons with six, 12 and 24 sides.

319
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And starting with a square, then doubling,

320
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
we can construct regular polygons with eight, 16 and 32 sides.

321
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And starting with a regular pentagon,

322
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
we can construct ones with 10, 20 and 40 sides.

323
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And also by combining the constructions for three and five sides,

324
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Euclid constructed a regular polygon with 15 sides.

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But neither Euclid nor anyone else

326
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
was able to construct regular polygons

327
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
with seven, nine, 11, 13, 14, 18 or 19 sides.

328
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Are any of these possible?

329
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Enter Gauss.

330
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
When ageed only 18,

331
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
he first showed how to construct a regular polygon with 17 sides.

332
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He then answered the construction question completely

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
by proving a remarkable result.

334
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That a regular polygon with n sides

335
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
can be constructed by ruler and compasses

336
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
if and only if n is obtained by taking some power of two

337
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
multiplied by unequal Fermat primes,

338
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
which is I remind you of the five listed here.

339
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So for example, we can construct polygons with 30 sides

340
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
because 30 is two times three times five.

341
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We can do 32 sides because that's the power of two

342
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
or 34 sides because that's two times 17

343
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
or 40 sides because that's two cubed times five.

344
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But we cannot construct regular polygons with 35 sides

345
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
because 35 is five times seven and seven is not allowed.

346
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Or 36 sides because 36 is two squared times three squared

347
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and we're not allowed to use three twice.

348
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Or 37, which is not a Fermat prime anyway,

349
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
or 100 because the factor five occurs twice.

350
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So to answer the question I mentioned at the beginning,

351
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
we cannot draw a regular polygon with 100 sides,

352
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but it's remarkable that these Fermat primes occur in such a problem.

353
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's now leave prime numbers for a while

354
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and look at perfect squares.

355
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The first 10 of these are listed here.

356
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
One squared is one, two squared is four,

357
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
three squared is nine, and so on.

358
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,000
And you notice that none of these squares ends with two, three, seven or eight.

359
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And this is true in general because if we square in a larger number like 27,

360
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
it must end with the same digit as if we'd squared seven.

361
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So no perfect square can end in two, three, seven or eight.

362
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
One interesting result about perfect squares

363
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
is if we add up the first few positive odd numbers,

364
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
then we always get a square.

365
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
One is one squared.

366
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
One plus three is four, which is two squared.

367
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
One plus three plus five is nine, which is three squared, and so on.

368
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We can prove this quite easily by arithmetic,

369
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
but more informative is this geometric picture,

370
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
which was supposedly known to the Pythagoreans of Ancient Greece,

371
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
that shows why it's true.

372
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Here each L shape has an odd number of dots,

373
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
one dot, three dot, five dots, seven dots, and so on.

374
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And they all fit together to make a perfect square.

375
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We also notice that every square is either a multiple of four, such as 16,

376
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
or is one more than the multiple of four, such as 25.

377
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
No perfect square has a form four n plus two or four n plus three.

378
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And this is because if n is even, say it's twice k,

379
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
then n squared is four times something.

380
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And if n is odd, equal to two k plus one, say,

381
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
then n squared is four times something plus one.

382
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So numbers made up entirely of ones, such as 11,

383
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
111, 111, and so on, cannot be perfect squares,

384
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
because they are all three more than a multiple of four,

385
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and that's not allowed.

386
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Another nice result is if n is odd,

387
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
then its square must be one more than a multiple of eight.

388
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And we can see this from our earlier result.

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If n is two k plus one,

390
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
then n squared is four times k times k plus one plus one.

391
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But k times k plus one is the product of two consecutive numbers.

392
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And if you had two consecutive numbers, one must be odd,

393
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and the other must be even.

394
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So that product is even, giving us eight times something plus one.

395
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But a much more attractive way of illustrating this result

396
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
is to draw a picture like the one here.

397
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Where there are eight triangles of dots,

398
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
plus an extra one in the middle.

399
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So in this case, we have nine squared dots,

400
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
are made of eight lots of ten dots, plus one,

401
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and so has the form eight n plus one.

402
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And this works whatever number n is.

403
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Perfect squares also feature prominently

404
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
in the geometry of right-angled triangles.

405
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
From our school days,

406
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
we remember the Pythagorean theorem,

407
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
which was probably not due to Pythagoras himself,

408
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and was originally a result about areas.

409
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
But it tells us that if A, B, and C are equal,

410
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
then they are equal,

411
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and they are equal,

412
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
but it tells us that if A, B, and C are the lengths

413
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
of the sides of a right-angled triangle,

414
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
with C the longest side, or hypotenuse,

415
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
then A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

416
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And today I'm interested in when these side lengths

417
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
are all whole numbers,

418
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
such as the 3, 4, 5 triangle,

419
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
where 3 squared plus 4 squared is 5 squared.

420
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's 9 plus 16 is 25.

421
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The 5, 12, 13 right-angled triangle

422
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
with 5 squared plus 12 squared is 13 squared.

423
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
25 plus 144 is 169.

424
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And the 15, 8, 17 triangle

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
with 15 squared plus 8 squared is 17 squared.

426
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Well, 225 plus 64 is 289.

427
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
What are the examples are there,

428
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
and can we find them all?

429
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, we can easily get more examples

430
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
by scaling out the size of these triangles.

431
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
For example, from the 3, 4, 5 triangle,

432
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
we can scale up by 10 to get a 30, 40, 50 triangle

433
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
with 30 squared plus 40 squared is 50 squared.

434
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Or from 3, 4, 5 we can scale up by 2

435
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
to get a 6, 8, 10 triangle

436
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
with 6 squared plus 8 squared equals 10 squared.

437
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But these scaling aren't very interesting,

438
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
so we'll assume that no scaling have taken place

439
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and that A, B and C have no common factors.

440
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And in fact, we can assume that any two of them

441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
have no common factor because any such factor

442
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
will then have to divide the third.

443
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So we can assume that A and B cannot both be even.

444
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We can also assume that they cannot both be odd

445
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
because then A squared and B squared

446
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
would be one more than a multiple of four.

447
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So that C squared would be two more than a multiple of four

448
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
and squares cannot be two more than a multiple of four

449
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
as we've seen.

450
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
So one of A, B and C is odd

451
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and the other is even, as in our first examples.

452
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Three and four, one odd, one even,

453
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
five and 12, 15 and eight, one odd, one even.

454
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And to be definite, we'll always take A to be odd

455
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and B to be even.

456
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Well, by using similar arguments

457
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
which I won't go into,

458
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
we can eventually prove that A, B and C

459
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
have the forms shown here

460
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for some whole numbers X and Y.

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
A is X squared minus Y squared,

462
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
B is two XY

463
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and C is X squared plus Y squared.

464
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You can check that with these expressions

465
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
A squared plus B squared is indeed C squared.

466
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And moreover, we can show that X is greater than Y,

467
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
that X and Y have no common factors

468
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
and that one is even and the other is odd.

469
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So let's see some examples of this.

470
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Here's what we had before.

471
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
A has this form, X squared minus Y squared,

472
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
B is two XY, C is X squared plus Y squared

473
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
where X and Y have these properties.

474
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So let's take some examples for X and Y.

475
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
If X is two and Y is one,

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
then A is two squared minus one squared which is three.

477
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
B is two times two times one which is four

478
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and C is two squared plus one squared which is five.

479
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So we get the right angle triangle with size three, four, five.

480
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
If X is three and Y is two,

481
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
then A is three squared minus two squared which is five,

482
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
B is two times three times two which is 12

483
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
and C is three squared plus two squared which is 13

484
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and we get the triangle with size five, 12, 13.

485
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And if X is five and Y is two,

486
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
then A is five squared minus two squared which is 21,

487
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
B is two times five times two which is 20

488
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and C is five squared plus two squared which is 29

489
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and we get the right angle triangle with size 21, 20 and 29.

490
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
And using these formulas we can compile a list

491
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
that would eventually include all right angle triangles.

492
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Now earlier I asked for all right angle triangles

493
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
with a side of length 29 and we just found one.

494
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
As we've just seen by taking X to be five and Y to be two,

495
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we found the triangle with size 21, 20 and 29.

496
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But are there any others?

497
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Well because 29 is a prime number,

498
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
the size can have no common factor

499
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and so we can again use expressions for A, B and C

500
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
when there's no scaling involved.

501
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But 29 cannot be two X, Y cannot be B because that's even.

502
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And so 29 must either be C which is X squared plus Y squared

503
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
or 29 must be A which is X squared minus Y squared.

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But if 29 is X squared plus Y squared,

505
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
then the only possibility is X is five and Y is two

506
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and we had the solution we had before.

507
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And if 29 is X squared minus Y squared,

508
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
we can factorize that into two factors as shown here.

509
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And because 29 is prime,

510
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
one of those factors must be 29 and the other must be one.

511
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So X plus Y is 29, X minus Y is one

512
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
and we can solve those equations to give X is 15 and Y is 14.

513
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It then follows that A is 15 squared minus 14 squared

514
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
which is 29 as we expected.

515
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
B is two times 15 times 14 which is 420

516
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and C is 15 squared plus 14 squared which is 421.

517
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So this is the only other right-angled triangle

518
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
with a side of length 29.

519
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Sides of 29, 420 and 421.

520
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Those are the only two right-angled triangles

521
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
with 29 as one of the sides.

522
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Before we leave perfect squares,

523
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'd like to show you a couple of results named after Fermat.

524
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
In our study of right-angled triangles,

525
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
we've been looking at sums of two squares

526
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and we might ask what numbers can be written

527
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
as the sum of two squares.

528
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
For example, 41 is 5 squared plus 4 squared

529
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
but 42 cannot be written as the sum of two squares.

530
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
How do we look at this?

531
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Well, because all squares have the form 4n or 4 plus 1,

532
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
4n plus 1, the sum of two squares must be of the form 4n

533
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
or 4n plus 1 which is got by adding a 4n and a 4n plus 1

534
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
or 4n plus 2 adding two of those odd numbers.

535
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So we can rule out any numbers of the form 4n plus 3 such as 43.

536
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
We notice also that sums of squares in more than one way.

537
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
For example, 65 is 64 plus 1 but it's also 49 plus 16.

538
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It turns out that we can deal with the general question

539
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
of which numbers can be written as the sum of two squares

540
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
if we can first decide which prime numbers are the sum of two squares.

541
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We've just ruled out all the primes of the form 4n plus 3

542
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
but as claimed by Fermat and later proved by Euler,

543
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
every prime number of the form 4n plus 1 can be written as the sum of two squares.

544
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Moreover, this can happen in only one way.

545
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So here are some examples.

546
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
5 is a prime of the form 4n plus 1.

547
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
5 is 4 plus 1.

548
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
13 is 9 plus 4.

549
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
17 is 16 plus 1.

550
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
29 is 25 plus 4.

551
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
41 is 25 plus 16 and you can make up some more for yourself.

552
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But it's a remarkable result proved all those years ago by Euler

553
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and conjectured by Fermat.

554
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But the other result of Fermat I want to mention is his famous last theorem

555
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
because it was the last of his theorems to be proved.

556
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
This is a very famous result in mathematics.

557
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
When we're looking at right-angled triangles,

558
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
we found positive numbers a, b and c with a squared plus b squared is c squared.

559
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
But what about higher powers such as cubes or fourth powers?

560
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Can we find positive numbers a, b and c with a squared plus b squared equals c

561
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
with a cubed plus b cubed equals c cubed

562
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
or a to the fourth plus b to the fourth is c to the fourth.

563
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Fermat himself found an ingenious argument to show that there are no solutions for the fourth powers.

564
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,000
In his method of infinite descent, he showed that if there were a solution,

565
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
it would give rise to another solution with smaller numbers.

566
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And then that in turn would give rise to yet another solution with yet smaller numbers and so on forever.

567
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But you can't keep on reducing the numbers forever and ever.

568
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So the original equation couldn't have had a solution.

569
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Now Fermat believed that there are no positive number solutions to a to the n plus b to the n is c to the n

570
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
for any power n larger than 2.

571
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And he claimed to have a truly marvellous proof but the margin is too small to present it.

572
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I too have a truly marvellous proof but this lecture is too short for me to give it to you.

573
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
In any case, Fermat's conjecture was eventually proved in 1995,

574
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:49,000
350 years after he first mentioned it by Andrew Wiles then at Princeton University and now at Oxford.

575
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let's now leave squares and look at some clock arithmetic.

576
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:06,000
If it's nine o'clock and six hours pass, then it's three o'clock.

577
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So we can write nine plus six is three.

578
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And writing mod twelve reminds us that we're using a twelve hour clock.

579
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Similarly, if it's ten o'clock and seven hours pass, then it's five o'clock.

580
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So ten plus seven is five mod twelve.

581
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It actually turns out to be more convenient to write zero rather than twelve.

582
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So eight plus four is twelve o'clock.

583
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
In other words, eight plus four is zero mod twelve.

584
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
This way of calculating is called modular arithmetic or clock arithmetic

585
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and is introduced by Gauss in his number theory book of 1801.

586
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
More generally, we say that A is the same as B mod n

587
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
if A and B leave the same remainder when divided by n.

588
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So fifteen, nine plus six is fifteen, fifteen is three mod twelve

589
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
because they leave the same remainder when you divide by twelve.

590
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And seventeen is five mod twelve.

591
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
And another way of saying this is that A minus B can be divided by n.

592
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Gauss worked out all the rules for this type of arithmetic.

593
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But we don't have to stick to arithmetic mod twelve.

594
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
We can also use it for the seven days of the week.

595
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
For example, if it's Thursday, then in four days it would be Monday.

596
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And if it's Saturday, then in three days it would be Tuesday.

597
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,000
If we number the days of the week from day zero Sunday, day one is Monday,

598
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
up to day six, which is Saturday, we can then write these statements

599
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
as Thursday plus four days is Monday, four plus one is one mod seven.

600
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Saturday plus three days is Tuesday, six plus three is two mod seven.

601
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Well, using this idea, we can carry out calculations on the calendar.

602
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Several people have produced methods for finding the day of the week

603
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
for a given date, including Gauss himself

604
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and also the mathematician John Conway, who died earlier this year.

605
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Here's a method devised by Charles Dodgson, better known as Lewis Carroll,

606
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
the author of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,

607
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and it was published under his pen name.

608
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So let's see how it works in detail, first quickly in general

609
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
and then more slowly for a specific date.

610
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So let's have a look at this.

611
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Carroll's method is based on four numbers,

612
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
which are then added mod seven.

613
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
The first number is the century number.

614
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What century we in?

615
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
To find this, we divide the first two digits of the year,

616
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
in our case 20, by four,

617
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
subtract the remainder from three and double the result.

618
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Next is the year number.

619
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Here Carroll's rule is to divide the last two digits of the year by 12,

620
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
and then add the quotient, the remainder,

621
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and the number of times that four divides into the remainder.

622
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You'll see how this works in a minute.

623
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Third is the month number, where Carroll gave a complicated rule,

624
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
but it's easier just to memorise this table of numbers.

625
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And last is the day number, which is just the day of the month.

626
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And there's also an extra condition which we won't need today.

627
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So let's see how this works in practice.

628
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And if it seems rather complicated,

629
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Carroll himself claimed to be able to apply it in his head in around 20 seconds.

630
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So let's see how it works for today's date,

631
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
the 28th of September 2020, as you can see on the right.

632
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So here the general method is on the left,

633
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and we'll work through it, and the example is on the right.

634
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
For the century number, we take the first two digits of the year.

635
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The year is 2020, so the first two digits are 20,

636
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and divide it by four, giving a remainder of zero.

637
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Subtracting this remainder zero from three gives three,

638
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and doubling the result gives six.

639
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So six is our century number.

640
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
For the year number, we take the last two digits of the year,

641
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
which is also 20 for 2020,

642
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
divide it by 12, giving one remainder eight.

643
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Also four divides into eight two times,

644
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
so we have one plus eight plus two, and that's 11.

645
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
For the month number, the number for September is five.

646
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And for the day number, the 28, it's 28.

647
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And if you add all these numbers together,

648
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
you get six plus 11 plus five plus 28, which is 50.

649
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And 50 is one more than a multiple of seven.

650
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So the answer is one, which is Monday, which is correct.

651
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
How about the question I posed earlier?

652
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
In which years of the century does February have five Sundays?

653
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
For this to happen, February must have 29 days,

654
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
so it must be a leap year.

655
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Now the first of January 2001 was a Monday,

656
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
or you can start with any other date whose day you know.

657
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So you can easily check that the first of February was a Thursday.

658
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Now the number of days in any non-leap year is 365,

659
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
which is one more than a multiple of seven.

660
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So the first of February 2001 was a Thursday,

661
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
first of February 2002 is a Friday,

662
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
first of February 2003 is a Saturday,

663
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
and first of February 2004 is a Sunday.

664
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So that's one answer, 2004.

665
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Also the cycle of days repeats every 28 years,

666
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
because the total number of days in 28 years

667
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
is 28 times 365 plus seven leap days,

668
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
and this is exactly divisible by seven.

669
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So adding 28 years to 2004 gives 2032, 2060, 2088.

670
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So the only years in the century where February has five Sundays

671
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,000
is 2004, 2032, 2060 and 2088.

672
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
For my final topic, I want to look at another result of Fermat

673
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and the generalisation of it by Euler.

674
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
If parts of this get too technical,

675
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
don't worry about the details,

676
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
but try to follow the general story.

677
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
One form of Fermat's little theorem, as it's often called,

678
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
tells us that if you choose any whole number A

679
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and any prime number P

680
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
and calculate A to the power P minus A,

681
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
then the result is always exactly divisible by P.

682
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
For example, if we choose A to be eight

683
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and the prime P to be 37,

684
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
then we find without calculating it

685
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that eight to the 37 minus eight is exactly divisible by 37.

686
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And we can also get another version of Fermat's result,

687
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
which we'll need in a moment, by dividing by A,

688
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and we can do this if P doesn't divide A.

689
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And it tells us that eight to the P minus one,

690
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
minus one, is also exactly divisible by P.

691
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
For example, when A is two and P is 53,

692
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
we see that two to the power 52 minus one

693
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
is exactly divisible by 53,

694
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
which we can also write using our clock arithmetic

695
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
as two to the 52 is one mod 53.

696
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And I'm going to use that result in a minute.

697
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But before that, how do we prove Fermat's little theorem?

698
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We can do so using algebra,

699
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
but here's a different method that I rather like

700
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
by counting necklaces, coloured necklaces.

701
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Our necklaces will have P beads

702
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and there are A colours available,

703
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
and in our colourings we're going to use at least two colours.

704
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
First of all, notice, as you can see on the left,

705
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
that necklaces can be rotated.

706
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So the necklace on the left,

707
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
which is red, blue, red, red, yellow,

708
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
is the same as if we start with blue,

709
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
blue, red, red, yellow, red,

710
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and also the same as the other ones shown on the left.

711
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Now how many strings of coloured beads can there be?

712
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, the total number is you've got A colours for the first bead,

713
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
A for the second bead, A for the third and so on.

714
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
So that gives us a total of A to the power P for P beads.

715
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
But we must exclude all the strings in just one colour,

716
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
such as red, red, red, red, red,

717
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
and there are A of these, one for each colour.

718
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So this seems to give us A to the P minus A strings of beads.

719
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But we're taking these and making them into necklaces,

720
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
and for necklaces each one is counted P times over.

721
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So we have to divide that number by P.

722
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So the number of different coloured necklaces

723
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
is A to the P minus A divided by P.

724
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But the number must be, it must be a whole number.

725
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So A to the P minus A must be exactly divisible by P,

726
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
as we wanted to prove.

727
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And we can use this result to tell us about the shuffling of cards.

728
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Starting with a normal pack of cards we can do a riffle shuffle,

729
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
that is we divide into two piles as shown in the middle,

730
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and then shuffle it so the cards in the two piles alternate

731
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
as shown on the right.

732
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Now if you carry on shuffling the pack in the same way,

733
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
how many shuffles do you need

734
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
before every card returns to its original position?

735
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
We can answer this with Fermat's little theorem.

736
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Where does each card move after the first shuffle?

737
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You can check that the card originally in position X

738
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
moves to position 2X,

739
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
or to position 2X mod 53 when 2X is larger than 52.

740
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
For example, the card that starts in position 1

741
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
ends up in position 2.

742
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And the card that starts in position 27

743
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
moves to position 54,

744
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
which mod 53 is position 1.

745
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So the new ordering of the cards, as shown on the right,

746
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
is 271, 282, 293 and so on,

747
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
to 51, 25, 52, 26.

748
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So after one shuffle,

749
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
the card in position X

750
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
has moved to position 2X mod 53.

751
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:26,000
And after two shuffles, it then moves to position 4X mod 53 and so on.

752
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So after n shuffles, it moves to position 2 to the nX mod 53.

753
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And if the pack has now returned to its original order,

754
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
this must be the same as position X.

755
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And that's true for each card.

756
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So 2 to the n times X is the same as X mod 53 for each card, in each case.

757
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
If we now divide by X, this tells us that 2 to the n is 1 mod 53.

758
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And we want to find the numbers n for which this is true.

759
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
But as we saw before, with Fermat's little theorem,

760
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
2 to the 52 is 1 mod 53.

761
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So the pack is returned to its original order after 52 shuffles.

762
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But is that the smallest possible number of shuffles?

763
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Well, if it happened after fewer shuffles,

764
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
then the number of shuffles would have to divide 52, it turns out.

765
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And you can check, as I've done below, that none of them works.

766
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So the answer to this question is 52.

767
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But the question I posed at the beginning of the lecture

768
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
was involved shuffling a pack with two jokers.

769
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So we now have 54 cards.

770
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And doing what we did earlier tells us that 2 to the n is now 1 mod 55 instead of mod 53.

771
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
But this time we can't use Fermat's little theorem

772
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
to deduce that the smallest number of shuffles is 54

773
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
because 55 isn't a prime number.

774
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So how do we get round this difficulty?

775
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Well, if 55 divides exactly into 2 to the n minus 1,

776
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
then so do 5 and 11, and these are both primes.

777
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So we can apply Fermat's little theorem to each one,

778
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
telling us that 2 to the 4 is 1 mod 5.

779
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
And 2 to the 10 is 1 mod 11.

780
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
How do we combine these?

781
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Raising the first one to the fifth power tells us that 2 to the 20 is 1 mod 5,

782
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and squaring the second one tells us 2 to the 20 is also 1 mod 11.

783
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And combining these, which we're allowed to do,

784
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
tells us that 2 to the 20 is 1 mod 55.

785
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So the pack is restored to its original order after 20 shuffles.

786
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And we can check as before that no smaller number of shuffles works.

787
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So the answer to our original problem is 20 shuffles.

788
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Raymond, can you possibly add a piece of paper?

789
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
We've just used Fermat's result that the prime p does not divide the number a,

790
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
then h to the p minus 1 can be divided exactly by p.

791
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That is, h to the p minus 1 is 1 mod p.

792
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But what can we say if we replace p by a number that isn't prime?

793
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Unlikely, as it may seem, and we'll see in a minute,

794
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
our answer, which is due to Euler, arises in cryptography,

795
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
which will be our final example and is fundamental in such security issues

796
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
as how our credit cards be kept safe.

797
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So number theory can be used to solve problems

798
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
that are even more important than the shuffling of cards.

799
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Now, just as Fermat's result tells us that the number a raised to the power p minus 1

800
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
is 1 mod multiple p.

801
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
So Euler's more general formula tells us that for two numbers a and n,

802
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
a raised to some power is 1 more than the multiple of n.

803
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
But what is this power?

804
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It's called Euler's totion function, or phi function,

805
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
denoted at Gauss's suggestion by the Greek letter phi.

806
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Given any whole number n,

807
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
phi of n counts the numbers up to n that have no factors in common with n.

808
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
For example, if n is 10, the number with factors in common with 10

809
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
are the even numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8, and the numbers 5 and 10 itself.

810
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So the only numbers with no factors in common with 10

811
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
are 1, 3, 7 and 9, and there are four of them.

812
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So phi of 10 is 4.

813
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Likewise, if n is 12, then the numbers who count are 1,

814
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,000
not 2, 3 or 4, 5, not 6, 7, not 8, 9 or 10, 11, not 12,

815
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
so phi of 12 is also 4.

816
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And we can easily check that for any prime number p,

817
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
phi of p is p minus 1 because we don't count p itself.

818
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And this tells us that if p is prime,

819
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
then Euler's theorem reduces to Fermat's theorem, which we had above.

820
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And we can also prove that if p and q are both primes,

821
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
then phi of their product, pq, is p minus 1 times q minus 1.

822
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
For example, and we'll need this in a minute,

823
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
1,073 is the product of the primes 29 and 37.

824
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
So phi of 1,073 is 29 minus 1 times 37 minus 1,

825
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
28 times 36 or 1,08.

826
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So now at last, in the last five minutes, to our credit cards.

827
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
RSA cryptography is named after the initials of Revesh,

828
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Shamir, a Edelman, who found it in 1978,

829
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
not knowing that it had earlier been invented at Bletchley Park

830
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
by Cliff Cox, but kept secret.

831
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Now this may look daunting,

832
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
but don't worry too much about the details just yet.

833
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The main points are that the whole process of securing your credit cards

834
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
appears on this one page,

835
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
and that at one stage it uses Euler's theorem.

836
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It also relies on the fact that we can easily multiply

837
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
two prime numbers together,

838
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
but we can't usually go the other way around.

839
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Even we can multiply 7 and 13 to give 91,

840
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
but turning it around, factorising 91 and 7 plus times 13,

841
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
wasn't immediately obvious.

842
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And for large primes,

843
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
multiplying is effectively a one-way process,

844
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
like squeezing toothpaste from a tube

845
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
or breaking eggs to make an omelet.

846
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So let me now just explain why your credit cards are safe.

847
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Suppose that Alice wishes to send a secret message to Bob

848
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
in such a way that it cannot be intercepted by an eavesdropper,

849
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
sometimes called Eve.

850
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Bob first selects two prime, large primes,

851
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
with maybe 200 digits each,

852
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
and multiplies them to give the number N is PQ.

853
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
In our simplified example,

854
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
P and Q were 29 and 37,

855
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
and N is their product 1,073.

856
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Bob then calculates 5N, as we did earlier,

857
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and we got 1,088.

858
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
And he then chooses a number E with no factors in common with it.

859
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Here he's chosen E to be 11.

860
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
He then publicly announces the two numbers,

861
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
capital N and E,

862
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
but not P and Q, its factors, which only he knows.

863
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So N and E are the public key,

864
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
which is known to anyone who wants to find it out.

865
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Now, to encode her message, Alice first converts it to numerical form,

866
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
for example, by taking A as 1, B as 2, and so on,

867
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and calls it capital M.

868
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So M is the message.

869
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
When E and capital N,

870
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
she then calculates M to the power E,

871
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
and takes the result mod N and causes capital E.

872
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This is her coded message, which she sends to Bob.

873
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So she knows E and N,

874
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
and she knows her own message M,

875
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
she calculates N to the E mod N,

876
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
and that's the message that she sends to Bob.

877
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Bob now has to decode it,

878
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
because E and phi of N have no factors in common,

879
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
it can be shown that there are numbers...

880
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Whoops.

881
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because E and phi of N have no factors in common,

882
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
it can be shown that there are numbers little M and little N,

883
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
satisfying this equation here,

884
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
so that M times E is 1 mod phi N,

885
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
and from this, he can calculate M.

886
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So, basically, there's a method of calculating this number, little M.

887
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
In our example, 11M was 1 mod 1008,

888
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
and Bob can then calculate M to be 275.

889
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And this is where Euler's theorem comes in.

890
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
M to the power phi N is 1 mod phi N.

891
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And it follows from this by a line of algebra,

892
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
which I won't go into,

893
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
that calculating E to the M mod N gives Alice's message M.

894
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Alice's message is E to the, in this case, 2 to the 75 mod 1073.

895
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Don't worry about the details.

896
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
The important thing is that the whole process simply relies on two calculations.

897
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Alice calculates N to the E mod N,

898
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Bob calculates E to the M mod N,

899
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,000
and that is the whole of the reason that your credit card is secure.

900
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And I hope you'll remember that next time you use your credit card.

901
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And if not, then the obvious place to look it up,

902
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
and all the other topics and problems I've been talking about,

903
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and much else besides, is in the book I've been launching today.

904
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
May I encourage you to give it to all your friends for Christmas

905
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
in order to solve your Christmas present problems for this year?

906
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Moreover, you'll probably lose all your friends as a result,

907
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
so this will solve your Christmas present problems next year too.

908
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Thank you for listening.
