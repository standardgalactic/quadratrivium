0	13280	It's a great pleasure and privilege to be here with you today and to share some thoughts
13280	19680	on the 30 years and more that I've been working in the area of autism and reflect on how our
19680	23920	understanding of autism has changed over that time. And I really look forward to your questions
23920	26720	where I will get to learn from you.
26720	30560	The Gresham College lecture that you're listening to right now is giving you knowledge
30560	36240	and insight from one of the world's leading academic experts. Making it takes a lot of time,
36240	39680	but because we want to encourage a love of learning, we think it's well worth it.
40560	45280	We never make you pay for lectures, although donations are needed. All we ask in return
45280	50080	is this, send a link to this lecture to someone you think would benefit and if you haven't already,
50080	53600	click the follow or subscribe button from wherever you're listening right now.
54560	56320	Now, let's get back to the lecture.
60640	65680	So autism is perhaps more present in everyone's consciousness than ever before,
66480	72320	and you can see autism being reflected in news articles like the one today about employment
72320	76880	and also in fiction, in books and films. Some of the coverage is very misleading,
76880	83440	of course, and some of it perpetuates myths, but I think there's great awareness of autism
83440	88240	than any time during the 30 or decades that I've been working in the area,
88240	94400	and most people, when I tell them what I do, will say, oh, yes, I have a friend whose child
94400	101200	is autistic or some sort of connection. But what is autism? Well, you can answer that question
101200	106160	in lots of different ways. We know that autism has a strong genetic component in most cases,
106800	111520	but we don't have a genetic or blood test for autism, and we're still defining and
111520	116640	diagnosing autism on the basis of behavior. So we're talking about a behavioral syndrome,
116640	122320	a pattern of behavior, characterized by social and communication differences,
122320	128480	and sometimes difficulties, by rigid and repetitive behavior, which now includes sensory
128480	136000	sensitivities also, and something characteristic that is present from early in life,
136800	141440	even though the diagnosis may come much, much later, and as I'll go on to talk about later,
141440	145200	we have some people coming for first diagnosis in their 50s or in their 70s,
146000	149680	but the characteristics of autism were always present from very early on.
151680	157040	So the first way that autism has changed is from being considered rather narrowly,
157040	164160	defined rather narrowly, to a much broader definition. So in the 1980s, the diagnosis
164160	170080	was called infantile autism, reflecting, again, a very different history where initially,
170080	176480	autism was distinguished and talked about as childhood schizophrenia, and some of the
176480	181840	diagnostic criteria were pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people, so being oblivious
181840	187120	of others, gross deficits in language development, often an individual who didn't speak or only
187120	192640	spoke a few words, and absence of delusions and hallucinations, and you can see that that is
192640	198320	an attempt to distinguish autism from schizophrenia or from psychosis spectrum.
199600	205120	Now, most of us, when we think about our autistic friends and relatives, they may not fit those
205840	210800	criteria at all, certainly not pervasively unresponsive to other people, for example,
210800	216560	and they may have very good language. Our current diagnostic criteria for what we now call autism
216560	223520	spectrum disorder include things like persistent deficits, some people would rather say differences
223520	228240	in social communication and social interaction, restricted repetitive patterns of behavior,
228240	232960	interests or activities, and as I said, that now includes sensory sensitivities,
234080	239920	and importantly, in our current conception, you can have an autism diagnosis and a diagnosis of
240000	246720	ADHD or of anxiety or depression, and surprisingly, that was only allowed from 2013
247440	252720	in the current diagnostic criteria. Before that, if you were anxious and autistic, your anxiety was
252720	256880	put down to your autism, which obviously isn't helpful, and I'll talk more about mental health
256880	264080	later on. So a great widening of those diagnostic criteria, incorporating many more people,
264080	270800	when I started in the field, most autistic children were in special school, many almost
270800	276960	had intellectual disability, language difficulties, and we were really fighting a lot of under
276960	283200	diagnosis. Now, most autistic children are in mainstream school, that may not always be the
283200	288640	best place for them if they're not well supported, but most are in mainstream, most will have pretty
288720	294800	good intellectual functioning and serviceable or good or excellent language. So the picture,
294800	301920	the autistic population has really changed, and as autism has changed from being narrowly defined
301920	308480	to much more broadly defined, it's also changed from being a rare condition to a common condition.
309280	315760	So in the 1980s, we talked about between four and six in every 10,000 individuals meeting
315760	321040	diagnostic criteria for autism, but today we talk about one percent of people, or maybe even two
321040	328480	percent of people, and sometimes studies in the States saying even higher numbers. What happened
328480	336080	between 1980s and today, well, one thing that happened was that in the mid-90s, a new diagnostic
336080	342240	label, Asperger's Syndrome, was introduced, and it was introduced to capture people who didn't
342240	347840	have a language delay or cognitive delay, but still had those social communication difficulties
347840	352880	and the regional repetitive traits. And I think for the first time then in the 90s,
353760	360000	if a parent had a child diagnosed with more classic or obvious autism, they might read around the
360000	365120	topic and they might find descriptions of Asperger's Syndrome and think, ah, that might be me, or that
365120	370880	might be my father, the grandfather of the child who's just had a diagnosis of autism. Before that,
370880	377120	when the picture was very much about autism with language delay, with intellectual disability, parents
377120	383280	weren't likely to read about autism and think that's me as well. So we see a big expansion there,
383920	389840	but I also want to point out that there probably hasn't been a real increase in the rates of
389840	395360	autism. We can't be sure because we can't go back retrospectively and apply our current diagnostic
395360	402960	criteria. But what I've shown you on the slide is the smooth, smooth blue curve that is often used
402960	408720	by autism charities and campaigners, particularly in the States, to say, look at this huge rise
408720	415120	in the rates of autism, please give more resources, please give more intervention and support.
415760	426320	But in set, I put the rates of autism in 2002 and in 2006 in different States in America.
426880	432880	And remember that in America, the code, the diagnostic code you have on your health insurance
432880	438240	claim determines how much money you get and what resources and services you get. And it happens
438240	444320	that you get more for autism, thanks to the campaigning of hard-working advocates and parents,
444320	448560	you get more for autism than for a diagnosis, for example, of intellectual disability.
449280	456400	So the very different rates and the very different degrees of change in that inset bar graph
456400	462080	in different States is unlikely to be telling us that actually in Arizona,
462960	469760	there has, in 2006, there was a change in what was in the water so that more people were autistic.
469840	474880	It's much more likely that services have changed, awareness has changed, provision has changed.
475440	480400	And the other thing that helps us to understand the change in the rates of autism, apart from
480400	486240	the broadening of the diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness and understanding
487040	491920	is diagnostic substitution. So as the rates of autism have gone up, the rates of intellectual
491920	498880	disability as a sole diagnosis have gone down. So I don't think there's a change in the numbers
498880	503200	of people who are autistic, although I can't prove that, but there are lots of other possible
503200	512400	explanations. So that's data from America, and we have that proviso about medical insurance records.
513520	519600	Here's some recent data from the UK. And what I want to highlight are two things.
520160	526400	First, note that these graphs show the percentage increase. It's not the numbers of people with
526400	532800	autism diagnosis. It's the percentage increase over time. So if you start off with very, very
532800	539280	few diagnoses in a particular age group or in, say, females versus males, you will get a big
539280	544880	percentage increase, even if there are still fewer females being diagnosed than males, for example.
545440	551520	But it's still informative, I think, because it shows that the big increase has been in first
551600	559280	diagnosis in adulthood, over the age of 19, and in women and girls rather than in men and boys.
560080	566400	And the authors of that work, Ginny Rossung and her collaborators at Exeter, conclude from those
566400	572960	two facts that they don't think were over-diagnosing autism. Instead, were catching up on people who
572960	578880	have historically been missed. And we'll come back to the catching up in older people a bit later.
582240	588400	A third change in how we think about autism is from thinking about autism as mainly affecting
588400	595520	boys and men to recognizing that autism is relevant for all genders. So in the 1980s,
595520	603600	we estimated that perhaps five or 10 times as many males as females warranted an autism diagnosis.
604480	610880	But most of that data was from clinical records or records of who was on the special educational
610880	618000	needs registers. From those records, it looked as if fewer, many fewer girls and women were
618000	622560	autistic compared to males. But when they were autistic, they were more likely to also have
622560	631120	intellectual disability. Now, fast forward to the 2020s, and it seems from good meta-analytic
631120	639280	studies that maybe the ratio is three times as many males to females. And that's taking data from
639280	644560	really good epidemiological studies that have gone out into the community and ascertained who
644560	649120	would get autism diagnosis rather than looking at the lists of the people we already know about.
649760	654720	Because if we're missing women or girls, then the lists of people we already know about are not
654720	662160	going to give us a fair estimate. So maybe three times more females than males. And in those
662160	668080	population-based databases, it doesn't seem that women are necessarily more likely to have
668080	674000	intellectual disability. The ratio of three to one seems to be true across the ability spectrum.
674720	681200	So that suggests to me that we have been missing or misdiagnosing women and girls, and particularly
681200	688480	those who are intellectually able. And when you make that comparison of five to one or 10 to one,
688480	693200	when we used to talk about Asperger's syndrome, compared to three to one, I think we're missing
693200	698720	or have historically missed a really large number of women and girls. I'm going to say a little bit
698720	705360	about that. So is there evidence that we're missing or have historically missed women and girls on
705360	711200	the autism spectrum? Well, we know that females are identified or diagnosed on average later than
711200	717200	males. We know that a male and a female individual with the same level of autistic traits, the female
717200	723600	is less likely to get diagnosed. So those are some reasons why we can think that we probably have
723600	730800	missed them. And we then need to say why are we missing them? And I think a large part of this is
730800	738080	that we all carry an unconscious bias and stereotype of autism as being male. Apart from anything else,
738080	742640	most people will have met more autistic males than females, if only because of the historical
742640	749440	underdiagnosis of women and girls. But I think we also carry a lot of unconscious stereotypes.
750000	756560	So the picture here of the lined up cars, and then lined up cuddly toys, if you look at the
756560	762640	lined up cars, you might well think, ah, yes, that's quite autistic, lining things up, enduring,
762640	768000	repetitively lining things up, that could be a sign that this child has high autistic traits
768880	773680	or warrants and autism diagnosis. But then you look at the cuddly toys lined up,
773680	779360	and your first response might be quite different. It might be, ah, how sweet. Maybe she, making an
779360	783840	assumption, maybe she's going to play school and pretend to teach them. And then that doesn't look
783840	789040	autistic at all. But in fact, they're the same behaviors. We're just bringing a sort of gendered
789120	798160	lens to them. And in the same way, we know that the kinds of obvious signs of autism that say
798160	804400	primary school teachers might on average look for don't always work to pick up girls on the spectrum.
804400	810640	So you might see a little boy who's autistic, who is quite obvious in the playground, because
810640	816880	while the other boys are playing football, he's just walking the perimeter, pacing the perimeter.
816880	822800	And a teacher will spot that. But a teacher might not spot a girl who is just on the edge of the
822800	827920	social group of girls who are all chatting, who's laughing just a little bit after they're laughing
827920	833440	or looking just a little bit out of place. So the manifestation of autism in girls may also
833440	838880	sometimes look a bit different or not fit our stereotypes. So for example, many people might
838880	847040	think that the autistic social style will be to be socially aloof. But in fact, many autistic girls
847040	853600	and many autistic boys as well, are very, very attached to one person, to one child at school.
853600	858720	In fact, I unusually clingy to them. But that doesn't always fit with our stereotype of autism.
861040	865840	Another reason that we may be missing women and girls on the autism spectrum
865840	870240	has to do with diagnostic overshadowing. And of course, this can happen also
870240	874640	with boys and men, but particularly diagnostic overshadowing from
875360	882480	pertinent diagnoses that are more gender sort of stereotyped. So eating disorders is a very good
882480	890560	example. And from my colleagues at the IOPPN, we know that around 20 to 30% of women coming to
891120	900640	services for anorexia will, if they're tested for autism, will pass the diagnostic threshold
900640	903920	for an autism diagnosis, even though they've never had that diagnosis before.
905040	910880	You have to be careful about making conclusions because we know that when you're at starvation
910880	917120	weight, that affects your cognition, particularly your social cognition. But I think the evidence is
917120	922960	amassing that when these young women reach a healthy weight, they still have the traits of
922960	929040	autism that would probably be sufficient to have an autism diagnosis. So what's happened
929040	934880	is that perhaps a clinician sees the eating disorder, but doesn't go further to ask,
934880	942320	is this anorexia in the context of autism? And that really matters. My colleagues on the
942320	949040	eating disorder ward told me about, they now have a wonderful pathway for autistic women
949040	953920	and men if they have eating disorders too. But before that, when they were still learning,
953920	959040	they told me about a woman on the ward who, unlike all the other anorexia patients who were
959920	967600	very well turned out, always clean, hair always washed, she was quite disheveled and a bit chaotic.
968560	973760	And nobody wanted to say anything because you don't make negative comments about how someone
973760	979040	looks on an anorexia ward. But somebody talking to her thought, well, maybe this is not just
979040	986720	anorexia, maybe this is autism. And they talked to her. And in fact, she wanted to be given a regime
986720	991920	to have a shower every morning, to wash her hair every three days. She wanted a routine
991920	996800	that was written down. And then she was very happy to stick to the routine. But without structure,
996800	1005040	she wasn't sure what to do to keep herself clean and well. And similarly, it turned out that her
1005040	1011200	eating disorder wasn't at all to do with body image concerns. Instead, she wanted to keep her
1011200	1017600	weight at a particular number, which happened to be a prime number. And it was about interest in
1017600	1022080	that number and a need for control, which of course is often the case with many people with
1022080	1027280	eating disorders. But she wanted to control this number. And when it was explained to her that
1027280	1031680	she could aim for a different prime number that was in a healthy range of weight, she was quite
1031680	1036480	happy with that, with some counseling around the fact that it's hard to guarantee that you will
1036480	1041920	always be absolutely on a particular number. But a very different driver for eating disorder,
1041920	1046080	so very important to know that this was autism as well as anorexia.
1046640	1054320	And another reason why we might miss not only women and girls, but also some men and boys,
1054320	1060480	has to do with what's been called camouflaging. So many autistic adults and some young people
1060480	1068080	tell us that they work incredibly hard to fit into the neurotypical world, to pass as neurotypical,
1068720	1073200	usually because they've been bullied or ostracized for their autistic behaviors.
1073200	1080720	And they will say that, for example, they selected a girl in their class at school or
1080720	1085760	a woman at work who seems to be socially successful and copy everything about her.
1085760	1091040	Copy how she dresses, how she does her hair, maybe how she does her makeup, how she talks,
1091040	1097920	what she talks about. Copy everything to put on a sort of suit of armor to go undiscovered
1097920	1103040	and not bullied and maybe even accepted and talked to until you can get to that point
1103040	1109280	to develop a friendship. So based on what autistic people have told us themselves,
1109280	1116640	Laura Hull developed a short questionnaire to measure this sort of camouflaging. And it asks
1116640	1120960	you things like, how much do you agree with the following statements? I learn how people use
1120960	1126560	their bodies and faces to interact by watching TV or films. Or when I'm interacting with somebody,
1126640	1131200	I deliberately copy their body language or facial expressions. And you can answer that you
1131200	1135600	disagree or you agree a little or you agree fully and you get a camouflaging score.
1138080	1143840	Now, camouflaging is important because we know that although it has some advantages that what
1143840	1150480	autistic people tell us about, like, for example, being able to go to a job interview or striking
1150480	1154960	up a conversation with somebody you'd like to be friends with, it also has significant costs.
1155920	1161280	So this graph just shows you some of our work where we found that how much people say they
1161280	1167840	camouflage is negatively correlated with self-reported quality of life. That's true for both males
1167840	1174560	and females in this sample. And we also know that autistic people tell us that camouflaging is
1174560	1181920	exhausting. And if you imagine trying to keep up a mask 24 hours a day or all day at school,
1181920	1187280	it's no surprise that you come home and have a meltdown. And also that it erodes the sense of self.
1187920	1193280	So an autistic 16-year-old that I was talking to was telling me about her mental health prices,
1193280	1197280	which had landed her in hospital. And she talked to me about how when she came out,
1197280	1201360	her friends had really rallied around her. And now she was talking, I was thinking,
1201360	1206000	that's lovely, that's so nice. And then she said, but of course it's not me, their friends,
1206000	1212400	were the tool. It's the mask I wear. And so all of that love and affection wasn't reaching her
1212400	1218320	because she didn't feel that she was her authentic self with her friends. She felt that they were
1218320	1225440	friends with the mask that she wore. And masking and camouflaging has really made me think very
1225440	1231600	differently about the traditional route of social skills training that for so many years was
1231680	1236160	absolutely what was assumed to be a good idea for say autistic teenagers.
1236160	1240320	Do social skills groups tell them what they should be doing and what they're doing wrong?
1240320	1243280	And if anyone wants to ask about that and do questions, I'm very happy to talk about it.
1245680	1253840	Autism has also changed from being a childhood condition and really the preserve of child
1253840	1260720	psychiatrists and pediatricians to being a lifespan condition. We know that people don't
1260720	1265520	stop being autistic. They don't grow out of autism. Autism is inherent to how they see
1265520	1270240	the world and how they process the world. And although, as for everyone, we change as we get
1270240	1278160	older, most autistic people will live most of their lives as adults. And we know from a recent
1278160	1284880	study of GP records that over the age of 50, nine out of 10 autistic adults are undiagnosed.
1285680	1291280	So we really are missing and know very little about older age with autistic people.
1294320	1298400	And it's important to know because we need to know whether the health needs, for example,
1298400	1306080	will be different. The medical records in the States suggest that all sorts of physical illnesses
1306080	1312880	are worse among those who have an autism diagnosis. Some of that may reflect
1313840	1319360	lives that are hard, lives that are stressful. And we have one study where we looked in, again,
1319360	1326320	a population-based cohort at pace of aging. And those individuals who had high autistic traits,
1326320	1331200	we didn't require a diagnosis because we know over the age of 50 most people aren't diagnosed.
1331200	1339120	But those with high autistic traits had a faster pace of biological aging as well as worse reported
1339200	1345600	physical health. But a mediation analysis suggested it wasn't the autism that was responsible for
1345600	1352800	that worse aging outcome, but instead it was the things in between. So social isolation,
1353360	1359680	poor mental health and anxiety, poor sleep, and poor health behaviors, so not being able to have
1359680	1366080	a healthy lifestyle, those were the things that led to that faster pace of aging. So there's nothing
1366080	1371600	fatalistic about, as far as we know, to tell us that autistic people will have a less healthy old
1371600	1377040	age. But we do know that autistic people, on average, have a less happy life, that's something we
1377040	1382800	can all change, and a less happy life and being bullied, for example, is for all of us related
1382800	1392960	to poorer mental and physical health. So autism has also changed from us thinking about it as
1393520	1399920	categorically different from any other diagnosis and from neurotypical development,
1400640	1406480	to having a much more dimensional approach. So in the old days it would have been, yes,
1406480	1412000	you get the autism diagnosis, or no, you don't get the autism diagnosis. But people first became
1412000	1418080	interested when it became clear from twin studies that autism was quite strongly genetic.
1418080	1424480	People became interested in measuring what they called the broader autism phenotype in the relatives
1424480	1431760	of diagnosed autistic children or adults, and looking for little signs, gray signs, of autistic
1431760	1438720	traits in not diagnosed, not autistic relatives, to try and understand the family treats, try and
1438720	1446160	understand the genetics. And once people started creating measures for autistic traits dimensionally,
1447040	1451840	you could see that actually in the general population, at least at the behavioral level,
1451840	1456800	were all somewhere on that continuum. So this is the autism spectrum quotient as perhaps the
1456800	1462320	best known autism trait measure, which is also freely available and happens to be what nice
1462320	1466880	recommend as a sort of first screener to know whether it's worth going further on a diagnostic
1466880	1471920	journey. It's not without its critics, but these are some of the questions that you would be asked
1471920	1478160	if you used it. You have to say to what extent you agree that I prefer to do things the same way
1478160	1483520	over and over again. I often notice small sounds when others do not, or you prefer to do things
1483520	1488800	with others rather than on your own. And that would be reverse scored, expecting that on average,
1488800	1492400	more autistic people would say they prefer to do things on their own. Although I would
1493440	1498720	really emphasize that and counter the myth that autistic people are not sociable. Many autistic
1498720	1505600	people are highly sociable and many autistic people are absolute extroverts. And also take the
1505600	1511040	opportunity to counter the myth that autistic people lack emotional empathy because there's
1511040	1517680	absolutely no evidence for that. Autistic people are empathic with others. They may find it difficult
1517680	1523200	to read somebody else's mind in the sense of knowing that somebody else might think something
1523200	1528320	different, but they certainly care about other people's suffering and emotions and so on.
1528960	1534160	So you can see that if you answer these sorts of trade questions, you get a distribution,
1534160	1540320	and you can see here from collected studies, the distribution for males on average and females
1540320	1542800	with the males on average scoring a bit higher.
1546800	1552640	Now when we think about a dimensional approach to autism, sometimes including some autistic
1552640	1557680	self-advocates will say, oh no, no, no, you can't be a bit autistic, just like you can't be a bit
1557680	1563680	pregnant. So I think it depends on the level of analysis. So behaviorally, we've just seen,
1563680	1568800	behaviorally, you can be a bit autistic. You can have a lot of autistic traits or very few
1568800	1574720	autistic traits or anywhere in between. Of course, sometimes those measures at the behavioral level
1574720	1579280	are not getting at qualitative differences. So if you were socially anxious, if you had
1579280	1587200	social phobia, you might say you prefer things to do on your own. If you have OCD, you wouldn't
1587200	1590480	say you prefer to repeat things over and over, but you might say you tend to repeat things over and
1590480	1596560	over. So there are other ways you could score up on those behavioral items. If we think about the
1596560	1602720	genetic level, you can certainly be a bit autistic. So what we know about the genetics of autism
1603840	1612720	from twin studies is that the genetic influences on diagnosed autism are largely overlapping with
1612720	1622240	the genetic influences on subclinical autistic traits. We also know that for most autistic people,
1623520	1630240	the genetics of their autism is just like the genetics of their and our height. It's a product
1630240	1634800	of hundreds and hundreds of common alleles, common genetic variants, which we all share,
1635520	1639520	and some people have more of them and are taller or have more autistic traits,
1639520	1642320	and some people have fewer of them or a different combination of them
1642320	1647920	and are shorter or have fewer autistic traits. It's only in a very small minority of autistic
1647920	1653520	people that a rare mutation that is qualitatively different from what all the rest of us have
1654320	1657760	seems to be playing a large part in their autism, but for most people,
1658560	1663360	genetics of autism, just like the genetics of height, and we know that from twin studies.
1663680	1672320	Another way that autism has changed is from thinking of autism as one thing to thinking of
1672320	1679440	autism as many things. So this is pictures meant to show apples and oranges and one speculation
1679440	1683840	for why we've actually made rather little progress in understanding the biology of autism
1684720	1689600	and to some extent the genetics of autism. One hypothesis is that we're mixing apples and oranges
1689600	1694320	in our studies, that we've actually got a lot of different individuals who all come under this
1694320	1700800	behavioral umbrella of autism, but have different etiological or biological underpinnings.
1703120	1708880	So I told you about the genetics, which is again shown here, the very small part of the pie
1708880	1716240	that is to do with mutations or de novo new events that are different from the general
1716240	1722160	population and the large part of the pie, where it's just a matter of how many common variants
1722160	1729760	you happen to have. People now talk sometimes not about autism, but the autisms to try to recognize
1729760	1735120	that there may be this enormous biological, at least heterogeneity within the category that we
1735120	1743520	call autism. Interestingly, despite the search for biomarkers and ways to stratify or cut up
1743520	1749200	the big autism spectrum, to date there's been very little success and the only real distinction
1749200	1755600	that carries weight in terms of prognosis, for example, is the difference between autism with
1756480	1762560	intellectual disability, language difficulties and autism without intellectual disability. Those
1762560	1768000	two seem to take rather different roads and relate rather differently to the genetic story.
1768720	1777440	Autism, we can also think of as changing from one thing to many in a different sense. So before
1777440	1782080	I was talking about taking the whole autism spectrum and saying that when you compare one
1782080	1788240	autistic person to another, they may have very different biological underpinnings or etiologies,
1788240	1794080	but now I want you to think about just one autistic person. And I want to suggest that in even one
1794320	1801120	the origins of different characteristics that make up what we call autism may be very distinct.
1802000	1807120	So traditionally we used to talk about the triad in autism, social differences, communication
1807120	1813520	differences, rigid and repetitive behaviors. And we used to think of those as three sides of one
1813520	1820640	thing that was autism. But while it's true that if you go into an autism clinic and you look at
1820640	1826160	people who have the diagnosis, you will always find that they have all three parts. If you look
1826160	1832560	in the general population, you'll find that actually those three parts pull apart in a lot of cases.
1833200	1838080	And indeed in families too, in families where there's an autistic child, you'll quite often find
1838800	1845280	that great grandfather was an engineer or a proofreader, had an amazing eye for detail,
1845280	1851120	liked to eat the same lunch every day, was socially just fine. And then there's Aunt
1851120	1857200	Sonso who was a bit of a hermit who had one or two close friends but really found social very
1857200	1863200	difficult but wasn't particularly rigid otherwise. So you can see different parts of what's come
1863200	1868080	together in the autistic child in different parts of the family tree. And in the same way,
1868080	1872240	when we look at the general population and we were able to do this in the twins early development
1872240	1879680	study, we found that while there were more than expected by chance, children who had all three
1879680	1885680	difficulties or differences, there were lots of children who had only one. So there were around
1885680	1891520	three percent of children who just had social difficulties as rated by their parents, three
1891520	1897120	percent who had only communication difficulties, four percent who were a bit rigid. And these all
1897120	1903840	defined as being in the top five percent compared to your peers. So the largest group are those who
1903840	1910000	have just one area of difference or difficulty, even though when we look at autism, we see everything
1910000	1916880	coming together. And so we've also found with twin work that these different parts of what we call
1916880	1924240	autism actually have distinct genetic influences. So most of the genetic influence on social skills
1924240	1931200	and difficulties is not overlapping with the genetic influences on how rigid or flexible you are.
1933440	1941520	And one of the reasons that's helpful to know or propose the hypothesis is that historically we've
1941520	1947920	tried to look for one explanation at the psychological level to understand all the different facets
1948480	1954960	of how an autistic person understands the world. But I don't think we need to because if the different
1954960	1960720	parts of autism have different origins genetically, then why can't the different facets of autism also
1960720	1965920	have different origins in the processes of the mind? So very briefly, these are three
1966880	1971680	different explanations for different parts of what we call autism, even in one person.
1972480	1978640	And I'll just tell you very briefly about them in cases of interest. So the social differences in
1978640	1985680	autism, which include not a lack of sociability, but a difficulty sometimes in knowing whether
1985680	1991840	somebody, for example, is joking or lying or being sarcastic, in knowing how to strike up a
1991840	1996080	friendship, how to say the right thing, how to not say the wrong thing, even if it happens to be the
1996080	2002320	true thing, those social difficulties are well explained by a difficulty putting yourself in
2002320	2007600	somebody else's shoes, a difficulty automatically tracking what somebody else is thinking and
2007600	2014400	knowing. Because we've known for a long time that many autistic children neither tell lies nor
2014400	2020400	understand that others might lie, but telling lies only makes sense if you know that something you
2020400	2027280	know I might not know, or that you can make me think something that isn't true. But if you don't
2027280	2031600	understand that minds have different thoughts, if you can't track what others are thinking,
2031600	2035840	then that's not going to make sense. And that leaves some autistic people very vulnerable
2037200	2046080	and also very honest, which of course can be a wonderful asset. Then we have on the more non-social
2046160	2052160	side, we know that autism is characterized not only by some difficulties, but also by some assets.
2052720	2059440	And one aspect of skill in autism is an amazing eye for detail, not every autistic person,
2059440	2063920	but on average most autistic people have a better eye for detail than the rest of us.
2064640	2069840	Sometimes that eye for detail makes it hard to get the big picture, to understand the gist,
2070720	2076720	but still for example in this task which is the embedded figures test, where you have to find the
2076720	2083920	simple shape hidden in the colored more complex shape. For most non-autistic people that's difficult
2083920	2089760	because we see the colored shape as a gist out, we see it as a whole. But autistic people often
2089760	2096640	describe seeing things as parts and therefore they can easily zoom in on and see where that simple
2096640	2103280	shape will be. And then another aspect of autism seems to be around difficulty with planning and
2103280	2109440	coping with change. And some of that might be about being very detailed, so even a small what is to
2109440	2114880	us a small detail change really really matters if that's what you're zoomed in on. But some of it's
2114880	2121680	also probably to do with what's called executive dysfunction or difficulty in those frontal lobe
2121680	2128240	functions of planning, monitoring, being flexible in the face of change, dealing with novelty and so
2128240	2134080	on. And that's often what holds some autistic people back. So working in a university environment,
2134720	2140240	we have many many students who are autistic and very very smart, but sometimes they struggle when
2140240	2145920	they come to university in organizing their lives. And it's the organization that really
2146480	2150320	begins to be a problem for them and the coping with change, the coping with the fact that that
2150400	2154640	lecture actually is happening somewhere different now and you weren't given any notice and that can
2154640	2162560	just throw you completely. So another way in which autism has changed is from thinking of
2162560	2169120	autism and studying autism in its pure form. So there was a fashion for saying well we must only
2169120	2174080	study autistic people who don't have language problems, don't have intellectual disability,
2174080	2179360	don't have mental health problems, because then we're studying pure autism. And recognizing now
2179360	2185360	that pure autism is vanishingly rare and Christopher Gilbert tends to say that pure autism won't come
2185360	2192880	to the clinic, because if autism is is the only issue or the only characteristic, it's not a
2192880	2198560	problem. You can find your niche and you can live very well with just autism, but unfortunately
2198560	2203680	just autism is very rare and most autistic people are battling with a lot of other things.
2204640	2209120	And it's those other things that make life hard to live, not the autism. And those other
2209120	2214960	things include epilepsy and intellectual disability, sleep problems. Sleep problems can be an absolute
2214960	2222240	killer and yet relatively easily treated for many autistic people. Sensory sensitivities can be very,
2222240	2227760	very difficult and that's one of the things in the workplace, thinking about that report today that
2227760	2235840	where reasonable accommodations are needed. But anxiety and depression, very common ADHD, OCD,
2235840	2240960	developmental coordination disorder or dyspraxia, those are all very common in autism and can make
2240960	2247440	life difficult. And even more important for us to recognize, because that lies with society to
2247440	2254320	address, stigma and bullying, being ostracized, being discriminated against, are all the things
2254320	2263200	that make life hard for autistic people, not the autism. So we know that around 70 or 80 percent
2263200	2269280	of children and adults on the autism spectrum will have a diagnosed mental health condition and many
2269280	2274800	will have more than one, with anxiety and depression being among the highest. And we've learned in
2274800	2281840	recent years tragically that suicide is elevated among autistic people, particularly among women
2281840	2284960	on the autism spectrum and women who don't have an intellectual disability.
2286640	2291120	This is from our longitudinal study in again the Twins Early Development study,
2291920	2298160	where we asked parents about different sorts of difficulties, emotional, so that might be anxiety
2298160	2306000	and depression, conduct problems, hyperactivity and we asked them at age four, seven and thirteen.
2306560	2313200	And in these diagrams, each horizontal line is one child and if they're in the green, they're okay,
2313200	2317680	they don't have problems in any of these areas and if they're in the orange, they've got at least one
2317760	2323360	clinical level difficulty. And we have a comparison group drawn from Ted's where they don't have
2323360	2328880	autism and you can see that most of those children are in the green at four, a few pick up some
2328880	2335440	difficulties at seven, some drop difficulties and again by thirteen, most do not have any parent
2335440	2342720	reported difficulties. And then you could look at the autism group and at four, about 50 percent
2342720	2347920	already have difficulties in one of these areas and as you go to age seven, more pick them up,
2347920	2353840	a few drop them but many more pick them up and again at age 13, so you can see the persistence.
2354480	2359600	And below we've got the co-twins, now autism is highly genetic so many co-twins of autistic
2359600	2364400	children are autistic themselves but some are not and when you look at the co-twins, you have a
2364400	2369760	perfect control for the family environment for SES and those other kinds of things that of course
2369760	2375920	we know affect children's well-being but here you can see that the non-autistic twins in those
2375920	2383120	families where there's an autistic twin are in generally in the green. And this is some work
2383120	2390640	by Dr Gavin Stewart who I have to also thank for co-authoring the text, the piece of writing which
2390640	2396160	will be on the Gresham College website to accompany this lecture. And Gavin's been working very hard
2396160	2405840	on aging and autism and he's worked with a long-term aging study which isn't about autism but is
2405840	2411040	just about healthy aging. If you're over the age of 50, you can sign up for protect and every year
2411040	2416240	you can do cognitive tasks and answer questions about your well-being. And because we know that
2416240	2420960	most autistic people over the age of 50 are not diagnosed, we've given an autism trait measure
2420960	2427360	and we look at those who have high autistic traits. And in this Venn diagram, the size of the
2427360	2433680	circles shows the relative percentage of people being affected by sleep problems in yellow,
2433680	2440560	by depression in blue, by anxiety in orange and the overlap between those. And you can see that
2440560	2445760	sleep problems are much more of a problem for the high autism trait group compared to well-matched
2445840	2452800	peers who aren't autistic and have low autistic traits. And the overlap of those sleep problems
2452800	2461040	with mental health problems is very significant. And I want to tell you briefly about one particular
2461040	2465600	area of mental health that we think is rather neglected for the autism spectrum and it's
2465600	2471920	important to be thinking about. So with Freya Rumble who is a clinical psychologist, we've been
2471920	2477600	speculating for some time now that autistic people might on average be more vulnerable to
2477600	2483360	developing post-traumatic stress disorder. And this is because firstly, we know that autistic
2483360	2488560	people experience more adverse life events than non-autistic people, bullying I've already mentioned,
2488560	2495760	but also assault and other kinds of negative life events. We also know that autistic people process
2495760	2501520	information differently with an eye for detail and one of the individual differences in the
2501520	2507680	general population that tends to determine whether two individuals who've experienced a traumatic
2507680	2515120	event, which one will go on to develop long-term PTSD symptoms and which one will not, one individual
2515120	2521040	difference of relevance, is how well you can weave your experiences into a coherent story,
2521040	2527280	a coherent narrative. And if you stay rather fragmented and detail focused, you're more likely
2527280	2533280	to continue to have symptoms of PTSD. So that detail focus in autism might make them more
2533280	2539760	vulnerable to develop PTSD symptoms. There are also aspects of sensory processing that are important
2539760	2547360	in PTSD and I've mentioned sensory sensitivities in autism. And lastly, how you cope with the
2548160	2553680	natural early stages of flashbacks and so on that maybe everyone would have after a traumatic event,
2553680	2559360	whether you use an avoidant coping style or a more adaptive coping style also determines your
2559360	2564480	likelihood of developing PTSD. And again, we thought that autistic people who sometimes show an
2564480	2571840	avoidant coping style might be more vulnerable for that reason. So in one study which we did
2571840	2577840	with autistic adults, we asked autistic adults to take part if they felt something had happened to
2577840	2584720	them that was negative and that still remained with them, that they felt was a trauma. And in
2584720	2593360	this particular study, we had 59 who took part and who reported to us a trauma of a traditional
2593360	2601040	sort. And by that, I mean it would qualify for PTSD diagnosis in the American system, the DSM-5,
2601040	2607200	where there's a very narrow definition of trauma and it has to involve either witnessing
2607200	2612160	or being subject to something that is either a serious assault or threat to life.
2613360	2621200	So you can see here that a large proportion of the blue slice of the pie are people reporting
2621200	2626480	a physical assault, the orange slice of the pie, people reporting a sexual assault
2627360	2634800	and other qualifying traumas. And we gave these individuals a trauma symptom checklist, a PTSD
2634800	2640640	checklist. It's not the same as a diagnosis. This was done mainly during COVID, so it's done remotely,
2640640	2647600	but it's a valid instrument to measure your symptoms of PTSD. And we found that 45% of
2647600	2654240	those autistic adults reported symptoms that were in the clinical range. Now that's a really high
2654240	2659920	percentage. In general population samples where they report having experienced a traumatic event
2659920	2667760	like a physical assault, around 10% will go on to have persistent PTSD symptoms. So much, much
2667760	2673840	higher percentage here for the autistic people. But the reason that I showed you a picture of a bus
2673840	2679040	when I started talking about PTSD and autism is that one of the reasons I got interested in this
2679040	2686400	area was an autistic man telling me about his experience of taking the bus to work every day.
2687040	2691840	And then one day the bus having to take a detour because of roadworks and him having to get off
2691840	2696400	the bus in the middle of nowhere. He didn't know whether it was a safe area of London or not. He
2696400	2703760	didn't know how he was going to get to work. And he was absolutely frightened and distraught. And
2703760	2708560	after that, not only would he not take that bus to work, he wouldn't take any bus anywhere. And
2708560	2714000	when he walked past his usual bus stop, he would start re-experiencing that fear and have flashbacks
2714000	2722400	of that event. Now a bus detour would not count in DSM-5 as a trauma, but I think it was clear that
2722400	2729680	this man was experiencing trauma related mental health problems. So we were particularly interested
2729680	2736080	in looking at whether autistic people are not only more vulnerable to PTSD, but also develop those
2736080	2743440	symptoms following unusual events that most people might not find traumatic. And so this graph,
2743440	2750880	this pie chart now shows you for the 59 autistic adults who told us about a trauma that wouldn't
2750880	2762800	fit DSM-5. So the large blue segment is bereavement. The yellow segment is bullying. And there's a
2762800	2768400	grey segment which is difficult social situations, having very negative experiences in social
2768400	2777440	situations. And the orange segment after the blue is their own mental health crises. And of these
2777440	2785280	people, again, 43% had symptoms of PTSD past threshold. So it doesn't seem to matter whether
2785280	2793360	what you've experienced is objectively life-threatening. If for you it's traumatic,
2793360	2798000	then for autistic people the rate of PTSD symptoms seems to be alarmingly high.
2800080	2806080	And one more point on autism and mental health before I go to the final change in the concept of
2806080	2816640	autism. So this is data from Miriam Martini working in Stockholm using population registers.
2816640	2824320	And this is data from young people between the ages of 16 and 25, information about psychiatric
2824320	2833760	hospitalization. And the bars are closest to me. The dark bar is autistic boys and young men,
2833760	2839040	then autistic girls and young women, and then their neurotypical peers, male and female.
2840160	2846800	And you can see the alarmingly high rates of psychiatric hospitalization. And Miriam writes
2846800	2855920	in the paper, by as young as age 25 years, 22% of autistic females and almost 11% of autistic males
2855920	2860560	compared to less than 4% of their neurotypical peers had been hospitalized for psychiatric
2860560	2869520	difficulties. So really serious level of mental health burden. So the final change from our
2869520	2875760	understanding of autism is from thinking of autism as a disorder, from very much a medical model
2875760	2881200	where we would think about, well, what's wrong with the child? Why does the child not understand
2881200	2887840	the social world? To the neurodiversity lens, to a more social model where we understand that
2887840	2893440	the difficulties in autism come about from a mismatch between the autistic way of understanding
2893440	2902720	the world and the neurotypical designed environment and expectations. And so instead of the rhetoric
2902720	2907520	of the past and still sometimes in the states or other countries, how would you save your son from
2907520	2914240	autism? Instead, we would have a much more neurodiversity lens. And like these autism
2914960	2921040	self-advocates insist that to talk about curing autism would be as inappropriate now as it was
2921040	2926640	inappropriate when psychiatrists used to talk about curing homosexuality, for example, that
2926640	2932800	autism is a different way of being in the world, is a neurodivergent condition in the sense that it
2932800	2940480	diverges from the average but is just as valuable and just as valid a way of being and encouraging
2940480	2946640	that some employers, as we were hearing about in the news today, are specifically employing
2946640	2951680	autistic people for the many strengths they have, including integrity and a sense of justice and
2951680	2960560	eye for detail, persistence in a task and so on. And this is just to highlight some work by a colleague,
2960560	2967600	Dr. Rebecca Wood, looking at what an inclusive school really means. And for her, that means
2967600	2973760	that it accepts the neurodivergence of the teachers and the other school staff. So most of us would
2973760	2979840	think is a school inclusive? Does it have a good attitude towards children, pupils who are autistic,
2979840	2984880	have ADHD, have dyslexia? But what about the teachers? If the teachers don't feel comfortable
2984880	2990080	to disclose their diagnosis, then it's not an inclusive school. And of course, there are now
2990080	2995600	similar projects for autistic police workforce, autistic doctors and so on.
2997600	3004560	So to conclude, autism has changed from narrow to wide with a rise in the diagnoses,
3004560	3009920	from rare to common, although still underdiagnosed in some groups, from childhood to lifespan,
3009920	3015600	with much more research needed on aging, from discrete to dimensional and from one thing to many,
3016240	3022080	from pure to complex, with a real emphasis now on understanding and improving mental health for
3022080	3028240	autistic people. And from disorder to a difference, the challenge now is to hear all voices. The
3028240	3033200	autistic voice is coming into research, but how do we hear the autistic voice from people who have
3033200	3038480	intellectual disability, as well as being autistic, for example. And really fascinating to think,
3038480	3043040	looking forward, what are the implications for the future of autism research and improving the
3043040	3058720	lives of autistic people? Thank you very much. Thank you very much Francesca, that was just
3058720	3065040	stunning. Unsurprisingly, we have an awful lot of questions, so I'm going to try and
3065680	3070720	group one or two of them together. There are so many questions, in fact, that we're definitely not
3070800	3075440	going to be able to cover them today, so I will probably approach you and see if we can
3075440	3079760	perhaps do what we do sometimes and have a follow-up podcast where we can discuss
3079760	3085280	the questions which we've not been able to get through. There seems to be a strong correlation
3085280	3091200	between those who identify as trans or non-binary and who are also autism.
3091200	3095520	Have you any thoughts of why that might be so? So it's certainly true that among autistic people
3095520	3102240	there are many more who identify with some gender identity other than the traditional binary,
3103360	3108800	and there seem to be more people who are trans, well, and vice versa. We don't really know why.
3108800	3113600	There's research going on in that area. There are, you could imagine, lots of theories at
3113600	3119040	different levels, so some would say it's a sort of sociological theory that autistic people are
3119040	3125040	less conformist and more able to be themselves. And then there are people like Simon Baron Cohen,
3125040	3129600	who are interested in sex hormones and might have a biological explanation, and I think at the
3129600	3134960	moment we don't know, but it's now a hot topic, yes. Okay, there are two which are slightly
3134960	3143680	overlap. One is about the way in which the media generate stereotypical perceptions of autism.
3143680	3147760	One particular question about, do you think shows like Love on the Spectrum are
3147760	3152560	indirectly fueling that stereotype, and how might we as society respond to that?
3153440	3158320	So I haven't seen that particular show, but I know that obviously autism is all over the media.
3160480	3166640	It is very difficult. I mean, one of the things that we need to be aware of is that
3168000	3173120	research is neglecting that part of the autism spectrum that has intellectual disability,
3173120	3179920	and there's a danger that we also neglect them when we have shows or documentaries
3179920	3184720	about autism, because it's easier to talk to a autistic person who can talk back,
3184720	3189520	but that doesn't capture the experiences of everybody. And I think that some parents of
3189520	3195520	children who have very high support needs and on the autism spectrum feel quite worried or upset
3195520	3202400	when maybe a celebrity has their adult diagnoses, and they want to say, well, but my child's
3202400	3208000	autism is not like your autism. Their challenge is not like your challenges. So I think it's really
3208000	3212560	about trying to get all voices heard. I mean, clearly there's some TV programs, including
3212560	3218160	about neurotypical people that are exploitative. And certainly any program I've been involved with,
3218160	3223840	it's very, very important that autistic or national autistic society, people who have
3223840	3228560	autistic people's welfare at heart are involved in making sure that that participants really
3228560	3233760	know what they're participating in, for example. So it's clearly somebody from an academic
3233840	3238720	background is saying, okay, you've now got a grant of several million pounds,
3238720	3244960	where are you going to put your money? What would be your next big area of this really large number
3244960	3249680	of overlapping Venn diagrams, where you think the biggest return on investment might be?
3249680	3254160	Yes, it's a really hard question. And sadly, I haven't had that problem of being given that
3254160	3259200	large amount of money. But I mean, I think the one really interesting area that's been
3259200	3264080	under-recognized are motor difficulties in autism. And that's not just sort of
3264080	3268640	clumsiness or developmental coordination disorder, but some autistic people will describe that when
3268640	3273760	they have a sort of shutdown, which can be something like autistic burnout from exhaustion of coping
3273760	3280560	in a neurotypical world, or can be a more short lived sort of shutdown meltdown, that they lose
3280560	3287040	volition, they can't act, they can't speak. And there's also very interesting but very little
3287040	3292800	research on catatonia sort of freezing among autistic people. And I think that's been really
3292800	3298160	under-researched. So we've woken up to sensory a bit, although there's still lots more research
3298160	3302960	needed there. But I think the motor part of the puzzle and in relation to that kind of
3302960	3307760	freedom of will and volition, I think that is a fascinating future area.
3308640	3315920	There's a growing number of people asking about an American charity like Autism Speaks,
3316720	3321840	who are pushing the concept of cure in autism still, even after all of this was.
3322560	3326880	How do you feel about that and do you think it requires challenge?
3327840	3335600	So many years ago, the founder, one of the founders of Autism Speaks, who was a grandfather of
3335600	3343360	autistic young boy with high support needs, came to London and gave a talk where he talked about
3343360	3350800	defeating autism like he had defeated cancer. And that's clearly not acceptable in our views of
3350800	3357040	autism and in our genuine acceptance of neurodivergence. Autism is not a cancer and autism isn't
3357040	3363440	something you have, autism is how you are. And that's just a valid way to be as anything else.
3363440	3368960	So we certainly don't talk about curing autism. We talk about curing anxiety, curing depression,
3369040	3373280	curing epilepsy, curing gut problems, curing sleep problems. All of these things would
3373280	3377440	transform the lives of autistic people, but we have no desire to change the autism.
3378640	3387200	Often for parents, when they are sympathetic to the idea of a cure, it's because their child has
3387200	3392000	intellectual disability, maybe self-induced behavior, maybe a lot of other things. It's not
3392000	3396080	the autism that's making their life hard, I would say. It's those other things and we should look
3396080	3401280	for ways to help with other things. Thank you so much. It was fascinating in every respect.
3402160	3408960	But given you've described so many different behaviors and a spectrum and autistic traits,
3410160	3418080	you're talking about such diversity. I wonder how easy or difficult it is to make a diagnosis
3418080	3424000	and what the procedure would be to diagnose. It's a really interesting question and it goes
3424000	3430000	in some sense to the heart of the complexity of autism. So on the one hand, autism can be
3431440	3437280	one of the diagnoses where clinicians have the greatest agreement and people will talk
3437280	3442080	slightly flippantly about the receptionist who works in the diagnostic clinic being able to
3442080	3446240	diagnose somebody as they come through the door by how they're walking and how they greet them.
3446240	3453840	Because autism in its most prototypical form is very, very recognizable. What's difficult is that
3454080	3459760	when you then have overlays of camouflaging and learned behaviors, or when you have a lot of
3459760	3463520	intellectual disabilities so that the range of behaviors you can see is not very great,
3464880	3469200	or when you have additional complexities, so you have autism and a lot of mental health
3469200	3475680	difficulties, then it can be more difficult to distinguish. Absolutely, there's a lot of heterogeneity
3475680	3480880	within the spectrum. That's definitely true. But also remember that it can be that you start
3481680	3488240	with the same four-year-old who doesn't have much language, is a bit aloof,
3488800	3494800	repetitively lining up toys, grows up to be the math professor who has a lot of language,
3494800	3500000	who has a lot of friends, but he tends to monologue about his own special interests as I'm doing now.
3500960	3504960	And the same person can transition through different parts of the spectrum.
3505520	3511200	So, in that sense, we can say, yes, they're all part of the same thing, if that makes sense.
3512880	3519680	I have a grandson who is severely autistic. He's 19 now and has no speech. He's in the
3519680	3525920	States. And one of the procedures that he's been through is something called, I think it's Applied
3525920	3533360	Behavioral Analysis, if that makes sense. Yes. But it's had, I think, relatively little effect
3534240	3542080	on his behavior. And the other thing that is perhaps interesting is that recently he had
3542080	3548480	some wisdom teeth removed under anesthetic. And because it's difficult to communicate with him
3548480	3554880	and tell him not to do things, he severely bit his lip because it was anesthetized, of course,
3554880	3561680	and nearly went into plastic surgery. Would you have any comments on this sort of thing?
3562240	3567040	Yes, so that's very difficult, isn't it? And I mean, communication is, without communication,
3567040	3573760	life is so very, very difficult. So, Applied Behavioral Analysis, ABA, for those in the
3573760	3579280	audience who might not be familiar with it, grew out of the sort of behaviorist tradition of
3580080	3588000	response and punishment to train an animal. So, it was used with the best intentions to help a
3588000	3592480	child who maybe was just running around the room to settle at a table to begin to be able to learn
3592480	3598240	something. So, the sitting at the table would be rewarded maybe with a suite. And then other
3598240	3602560	behaviors would also be rewarded. And in the old days, negative behaviors would be punished.
3603360	3609520	That doesn't happen anymore. But there is a large body of thought, particularly in this country,
3609520	3616560	and particularly among autistic self-advocates, that ABA is not respectful, that it looks too
3616560	3620640	much like the training of an animal, and it doesn't give people on the autism spectrum
3620640	3626720	a choice in a sense about their behaviors. I do know parents where their child was
3626720	3631040	just so much all around the room that they needed to find some way that they would sit
3631040	3636080	long enough to learn something. And to be fair, most parents bribe their children at some point.
3636080	3642560	But I think the level of mechanical teaching makes people feel uncomfortable. And some autistic
3642560	3649040	people have said that they felt they felt damaged by that process. But it is very hard to know how
3649040	3655680	best to try and reach a child who has very, very high support needs. I think that there are more
3656240	3661600	available alternative communication devices now with iPads and things. There are more ways that you
3661600	3668240	can let a child unlock communication of some sort. And that's so important for the reasons
3668240	3672400	that you've highlighted that we need to be able to tell people what's going to happen and them
3672400	3675520	to tell us what's going on with them. And I would just take the opportunity to say,
3676160	3681920	I'm sure it may not be relevant to your grandson, but for anybody else who has a child of whatever
3681920	3690160	age, with very little language, if their behavior changes suddenly, if they seem very distressed
3690160	3696800	or violent or self-injurious, please check that they're not in pain. Because we've only recently
3696800	3703200	begun to realize that often that's a symptom of pain. And because the autistic person can't tell us
3703200	3709600	that, for example, they have absolutely crippling constipation, they will express it in some other
3709600	3714640	way. And that might be by lashing out or it might be by crying or it might be by biting themselves.
3714640	3719920	So don't forget about pain if somebody's behavior changes when they haven't got any other way of
3719920	3724720	telling you. But thank you very much for the example. I'm going to take just two more questions so
3724720	3731520	that we can be quite your next. Hello. Firstly, thank you so, so very much. This is a wonderful,
3731520	3737840	wonderful talk. I was wondering, on one of the slides, you briefly talked about Asperger's
3737840	3742640	becoming something in the 90s. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that's
3742640	3747680	developed from perhaps where that came from and how that's seen now in, you know, you're speaking
3747680	3753200	about this wide spectrum. How is Asperger's now viewed in the wider spectrum? I personally,
3753200	3756960	that was the diagnosis that I had and I know that I've had trouble communicating that with
3756960	3761200	other people, that that's not something that's necessarily inappropriate way to do it. So I'm
3761200	3768000	wondering how maybe in studies and clinicians are able to communicate that in different ways
3768000	3772480	and maybe how that also specifically applies to women and girls and different, you know,
3772480	3776320	more female concepts of special interests and how that translates together. Sorry,
3776320	3781600	does that make sense? Yes. So I'll try and give a short answer to capture some of those things.
3781600	3789520	So, so Asperger's was introduced as a sort of experimental diagnosis because historically
3789520	3794800	autism was so much associated with language problems and language delay or even lack of language.
3794800	3799040	So when there were some children who didn't seem to have any language delay and yet had all the
3799040	3803520	other characteristics or autism, people at the time felt we've got to study this. Maybe it's a
3803520	3809440	whole different group. The research that happened after that suggested that it wasn't a whole different
3809440	3814880	group. It was part of the autism spectrum and not different from autistic people who maybe had a
3814880	3821520	bit of language delay but had good verbal intelligence later on. So, so in the latest
3821520	3826320	diagnostic system it's folded into this bigger category of autism spectrum disorder with the
3826320	3831440	expectation that anybody who had an Asperger diagnosis would simply be included in autism
3831440	3836960	spectrum disorder not have to go and get a new diagnosis. The other piece of the puzzle is that
3837040	3844800	Hans Asperger who of course was working in Nazi dominated Vienna who wasn't a member of the Nazi
3844800	3850400	party unlike all the rest of his department but has it there has been a question over whether he
3850400	3858880	was saving children or whether he was colluding with a process of eugenesis for for a handicapped
3859440	3863680	children perceived to be handicapped at the time. So that's another reason why people are not so
3863680	3868320	keen on naming a syndrome after him anymore although I think the full story of his involvement
3868320	3876320	is yet to be uncovered. I just wanted to know in your estimation to what extent do modern lifestyles
3876320	3883280	for example our largely sugar-based diets and our intent tendency to spend a lot more time online
3884080	3892720	impact on autistic people because I've definitely found the the online aspect a lot of autistic
3892720	3898320	people spend a lot of time online and this kind of exacerbates our difficulties with your
3898320	3903680	communication and socialising so just how does that how do how do these things impact in your
3903680	3908560	estimation on lives of autistic people? Thank you it's an interesting question so just I know it's
3908560	3913120	not your question but just to clarify I don't think that screen time could ever make somebody
3913120	3919920	autistic nor could diet but your question isn't that I know your question is for autistic people
3919920	3924480	is the increase in screen time and so on more problematic I think I don't think we have the
3924480	3930000	research to know the research that's being done suggests that autistic people use the
3930000	3934560	electronic media and so on in the same way for the same purposes enjoyment and so on as non-autistic
3934560	3942480	people and it was interesting talking to my autistic students under lockdown some of whom said
3942480	3947040	they much preferred meeting online it was much less stressful and they could control their environment
3947040	3953840	whether as you say when you then have to do more face-to-face time it has it become more difficult
3953840	3958480	that's something I think we still need to study but there's certainly lots and lots of benefits
3958480	3961920	to the digital world for autistic people one of the things I often think about is
3962560	3968320	autistic people often are very really good at understanding how systems work in the old days
3968880	3975600	if you were to be an engineer you had to be physically adroit then that was out of reach
3975600	3981600	but now when you can understand a system and do it all on screen wonderfully you've unlocked
3981600	3987040	a beautiful mind that was perhaps had clumsy hands so I think there are lots and lots of
3987040	3990800	advantages but you're right we should be careful about the downsides for everyone
3991920	3997680	well it's it's been a privilege being exposed to a beautiful mind I think it was an absolute
3997680	4002160	delight to hear you talk it was a wonderful lecture thank you very much please join me in thanking
4002160	4008320	Thank you
