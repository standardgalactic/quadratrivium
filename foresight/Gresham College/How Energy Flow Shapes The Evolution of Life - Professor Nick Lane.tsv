921340	926340	If you're not familiar with it, it's usually called the universal energy currency.
926340	930340	You can think of it as a kind of coin that goes in the slot machine,
930340	934340	and the slot machine does its thing, it's an enzyme, it does a particular job,
934340	937340	you put the coin in, it does its job, you put another coin in, it does its job again.
937340	946340	So this is how cells work, they're powered by machines, using effectively the currency, the ATP.
947340	954340	So this idea that it's kind of like a hydroelectric power scheme,
954340	962340	came from one of the most brilliant and eccentric Englishmen of the 20th century scientists, Peter Mitchell.
962340	967340	And he put these ideas forward initially in 1961.
967340	972340	This is somewhat before that, that's the late 1940s when he was in Cambridge,
972340	976340	with Jennifer Moyle, who was a lifelong collaborator.
976340	980340	She was, in fact, a brilliant experimentalist.
980340	986340	Mitchell was a brilliant thinker, and rather cac-handed in the lab, I'm told.
986340	989340	And so it was Jennifer Moyle who really did all the experiments,
989340	993340	and Mitchell who did a lot of the thinking, and Moyle herself was brilliant.
993340	996340	She was one of the first women to get a...
996340	999340	Actually, she was not awarded a degree in Cambridge,
999340	1002340	they didn't award degrees to women in the 1940s.
1002340	1005340	But an equivalent, I don't recall what the term is.
1005340	1012340	She had been involved in cracking codes in the war and had been head of some division,
1012340	1016340	which again was very unusual for a woman to be in that position at that time.
1016340	1021340	The Nobel Prize went to Mitchell in the end by himself.
1021340	1025340	There's always arguments about how these things should be apportioned.
1026340	1031340	I don't know enough about it, but I think if it were today, it would have gone to both of them.
1031340	1036340	And science is really about experiments as much as it is about thinking.
1036340	1038340	It's the combination of the two.
1038340	1042340	If it hadn't been for her, experiments Mitchell's ideas would have really come to nothing.
1042340	1045340	Anyway, but Mitchell was a great thinker,
1045340	1049340	and he came at these questions about how cell respiration works.
1049340	1054340	From thinking about bacteria, his real question on bacteria
1054340	1057340	was how do they keep their insides different to their outsides?
1057340	1059340	It's a very simple, basic question,
1059340	1063340	and one of those great questions that takes decades to answer.
1063340	1068340	He gave a talk in Moscow in 1957 on the origin of life.
1068340	1070340	There was a whole conference on the origin of life,
1070340	1075340	and a lot of the people who were interested in that kind of question at the time were there,
1075340	1079340	so JD Bernal and JBS Haldane, they're all communists actually,
1079340	1081340	and they all went to Moscow,
1081340	1085340	and they were interested in Moscow in a materialist explanation for the world,
1085340	1091340	which is why a lot of the people who were working on those questions shared this materialist conception.
1091340	1094340	Mitchell was there, and he was far from being a materialist.
1094340	1097340	He was quite kind of almost a spiritualist in his outlook,
1097340	1101340	but he said, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.
1101340	1105340	From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases
1105340	1110340	between which dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.
1111340	1115340	Virtually every definition of life that you will ever see is going to say,
1115340	1119340	this is what an organism is, and the environment is something different.
1119340	1123340	Mitchell really here is saying that the environment and the organism
1123340	1126340	are two equivalent phases separated by a membrane.
1126340	1129340	It's a very different perception of what life is.
1129340	1131340	If you're thinking about the origin of life,
1131340	1134340	and you're beginning to think about compartments and phases and things,
1134340	1139340	this kind of conception makes, to me, a lot more sense.
1139340	1141340	It's not a satisfying definition of life,
1141340	1143340	but it certainly gives you a different perspective
1143340	1148340	that on opposite sides of a membrane, which is a millionth of a millimetre in thickness,
1148340	1150340	you have two phases.
1150340	1152340	One is the inside of the cell, the other is the outside of the cell.
1152340	1154340	They are different, and the only way they can be different
1154340	1159340	is if you actively pumping things out or bringing things in,
1159340	1161340	and that costs energy.
1162340	1164340	How do the first cells do it?
1164340	1166340	Well, you can see it.
1166340	1172340	The clue is in methane,
1172340	1176340	so the cows produce massive amounts of methane.
1176340	1180340	They do it because they harbour particular types of archaea,
1180340	1183340	so it represents this domain of life called methanogens.
1183340	1186340	We all have methanogens as well,
1186340	1189340	especially those of you who can light your own for hot.
1189340	1193340	So these are methanogens, and what they're doing is
1193340	1196340	they're taking carbon dioxide and hydrogen
1196340	1199340	and reacting them together to make methane,
1199340	1202340	and they're getting all the energy and all the carbon
1202340	1204340	that they need to grow from that reaction alone.
1204340	1206340	So the methane is the waste product,
1206340	1209340	and it's just farted out, I suppose.
1211340	1220340	But you'll all probably be aware that if we could make hydrogen and CO2 react easily,
1220340	1223340	we could solve a lot of problems in the world.
1223340	1226340	So we already can split water.
1226340	1228340	We can effectively mimic photosynthesis,
1228340	1231340	split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen,
1231340	1234340	which is what photosynthesis does.
1234340	1236340	We can forget about the oxygen
1236340	1238340	or react it directly with the hydrogen,
1238340	1241340	but nobody's particularly interested in the hydrogen economy.
1241340	1243340	It's a difficult thing to do.
1243340	1247340	If you could react the hydrogen with CO2 and make synthetic gasoline,
1247340	1249340	that would solve a lot of problems.
1249340	1251340	You can strip the CO2 out of the atmosphere,
1251340	1253340	or at least remain a neutral state,
1253340	1257340	and you can make the entire plastics industry
1257340	1259340	and all the energy and so on
1259340	1262340	can be done from this reaction.
1262340	1267340	To my knowledge, nobody has succeeded in doing it in an economic way.
1267340	1269340	Perhaps they have, and they're not telling us.
1269340	1271340	But the cells, these methanogens,
1271340	1275340	they grow from that without any energy input at the door.
1275340	1278340	So they can make it work economically,
1278340	1280340	and it's interesting to wonder how they do it.
1280340	1282340	Well, the way they actually do it
1282340	1285340	is they need a proton gradient across a membrane.
1285340	1287340	That's to say they're doing exactly the same thing
1287340	1289340	that we do in our mitochondria.
1289340	1291340	They're pumping protons across a membrane,
1291340	1293340	so on one side they've got a high proton concentration,
1293340	1296340	the other side they don't.
1296340	1299340	And they use that, not to make ATP,
1299340	1301340	they do use it to make ATP, but more importantly,
1301340	1303340	they use it to power the reaction
1303340	1307340	between hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
1307340	1309340	And this is roughly what the issue is.
1309340	1310340	Don't worry about this.
1310340	1312340	If it's going uphill, you have to put energy in.
1312340	1314340	If it's going downhill, you're getting energy out.
1314340	1316340	That's really all you need to take home from this.
1316340	1318340	But there's two lines on there,
1318340	1322340	and right at the top you can see it says H-C-H-O.
1322340	1324340	That's formaldehyde.
1324340	1327340	So to go from carbon dioxide to methane,
1327340	1329340	you have to put energy in for the first couple of steps
1329340	1332340	to get up to formaldehyde.
1332340	1334340	And then it's energetically downhill all the way.
1334340	1336340	So that's the problem.
1336340	1338340	That uphill bit is the difficulty
1338340	1340340	with making hydrogen react with CO2.
1340340	1344340	There's a barrier to their reaction, an energetic barrier.
1344340	1346340	And what the methanogens do is they lower that barrier
1346340	1350340	and they lower it by using a proton gradient.
1350340	1353340	So how do they actually do it?
1353340	1359340	Well, to think about it is a very good way
1359340	1361340	to think about the origin of life.
1361340	1363340	Because these same conditions,
1363340	1367340	you find them in a particular type of hydrothermal vent.
1367340	1370340	We see natural proton gradients,
1370340	1373340	barriers between compartments,
1373340	1376340	lots of hydrogen gas and CO2.
1376340	1379340	And those cells live in that kind of environment even today.
1379340	1381340	And so you can begin to think,
1381340	1385340	well, how would the structure of this environment begin to help?
1385340	1388340	And it gives us an insight into how they might do it
1388340	1390340	and also how we might do it.
1390340	1392340	So this particular type of vent,
1392340	1397340	we're only discovered about 15 years ago or so.
1397340	1399340	Let me just go back to that.
1399340	1402340	They don't look much like the familiar black smokers
1402340	1404340	that most people have seen,
1404340	1407340	belching black smoke out of the top.
1407340	1409340	I suppose you could call them white nonsmokers.
1409340	1411340	There's no smoke coming out
1411340	1416340	and they carbonate limestone rocks, really, aragonite, in fact.
1416340	1419340	But they are very active.
1419340	1422340	And there's no animal life around it in particular.
1422340	1424340	There are a few fish every now and then,
1424340	1427340	but they're full of bacteria and archaea
1427340	1429340	and the kind of cells that live there.
1429340	1431340	And this kind of environment,
1431340	1434340	we're fairly sure would have existed on the early earth as well.
1434340	1436340	So the black smokers were not so certain about,
1436340	1440340	but these type of vents would certainly have been present
1440340	1443340	four billion years ago on the early earth.
1443340	1446340	And they were first pointed out by this guy, Mike Russell,
1446340	1449340	who's a kind of mad geologist.
1449340	1452340	He's a brilliant scientist,
1452340	1455340	but he enjoys winding people up, I think.
1455340	1458340	And some of his ideas...
1458340	1461340	The origin of life is a really fractured field
1461340	1465340	and people come in from the background with chemistry, for example,
1465340	1467340	or a background of geology,
1467340	1470340	or a background of biology, or a background of genetics.
1470340	1472340	People come from very different places
1472340	1476340	and converge on these questions about the origin of life.
1476340	1479340	So it's not surprising that we don't agree with each other very much.
1479340	1482340	Often we don't even speak the same language.
1482340	1486340	I think most people are trying to learn to speak the same language,
1486340	1489340	but we can't agree even then what the real question is,
1489340	1493340	because it's a long way to go from simple chemical reactions
1493340	1496340	to a replicating cell with all of this machinery.
1496340	1499340	Which bit are you going to focus on?
1499340	1504340	We're all interested in different aspects of really different problems,
1504340	1508340	all of which goes under this term, origin of life.
1508340	1511340	So Mike Russell was talking about these kind of vents
1511340	1514340	ten years before they were actually discovered.
1514340	1520340	And the language he used was the language of geochemistry.
1520340	1523340	And it was really an unfamiliar language
1523340	1527340	to most chemists working on the subject, or to the biologists.
1527340	1531340	I struggled a lot with his terms to begin with.
1531340	1535340	And then they discovered, Deb Kelly in fact,
1535340	1538340	discovered this lost city vent that I just showed you the picture of.
1538340	1541340	Ten years after he'd been talking about these vents
1541340	1544340	as the best setting for the origin of life.
1544340	1547340	And suddenly he became famous, almost overnight he became famous.
1547340	1551340	And this was a photoshop job that nature did.
1551340	1554340	So nature is one of the great science journals.
1554340	1557340	And they had a feature article on Mike's work
1557340	1561340	and dressed him up as Erasmus, as the renaissance man.
1561340	1565340	And they called him nasance man, nasance as in the birth of life.
1565340	1570340	And he built a reactor at NASA, JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
1570340	1573340	to try and study these conditions.
1573340	1576340	And here's a little bit of lost city vent in the background.
1576340	1580340	He made a number of predictions as to what the important conditions were.
1580340	1584340	And the key ones really is that they should be very rich in hydrogen gas,
1584340	1586340	which is true.
1586340	1590340	And that there should be the walls of the ancient vents,
1590340	1592340	not the modern ones, but the ancient ones should have contained
1592340	1595340	catalytic iron sulfur minerals.
1595340	1597340	That also seems to be true.
1597340	1599340	But the main point that he was talking about
1599340	1601340	is there were natural proton gradients.
1601340	1605340	Because you have alkaline fluids, which really don't have many protons.
1605340	1607340	They're deficient in protons.
1607340	1609340	And a relatively acidic early ocean.
1609340	1612340	Lots of carbon dioxide, full of protons.
1612340	1616340	And so the two were mingling inside these vents.
1616340	1621340	And you would have very steep proton gradients within the vents.
1621340	1623340	We don't really know how steep.
1623340	1626340	We don't know a great deal about these vents.
1626340	1630340	But you can at least imagine how it might work.
1630340	1635340	Essentially what the methanogens are doing and how, in essence,
1636340	1642340	the proton concentration changes the reactivity of both hydrogen and CO2.
1642340	1646340	In alkaline fluids, hydrogen is more reactive.
1646340	1649340	It wants to offload its electrons onto something else.
1649340	1654340	And in acidic conditions, CO2 is more reactive.
1654340	1657340	It's going to accept the electrons because it can accept protons
1657340	1659340	to balance the charges as well.
1659340	1663340	And so if you've got two channels next to each other,
1663340	1666340	the CO2 in acid conditions is going to be more receptive
1666340	1671340	to picking up electrons and protons and becoming an organic molecule.
1671340	1674340	And if you have hydrogen in an alkaline channel,
1674340	1677340	it really wants to be rid of its electrons.
1677340	1681340	And the protons will react with the hydroxide ions to make water,
1681340	1684340	which is thermodynamically very favoured.
1684340	1688340	But if they mix, then, of course, you've lost that.
1688340	1691340	You've lost the structure. You've lost the barrier.
1691340	1693340	You don't have a pH difference anymore.
1693340	1696340	And so you've lost everything. It's the structure that really matters.
1696340	1698340	And it's the structure that we have here.
1698340	1702340	And these minerals that we think you would have found in these ancient vents
1702340	1706340	in which you find today in methanogens are the ion-sulfur minerals.
1706340	1708340	And they're semiconducting.
1708340	1710340	So you could imagine, at least,
1710340	1713340	that the hydrogen would pass electrons onto this barrier
1713340	1715340	and across the barrier onto CO2.
1715340	1717340	And that it's equivalent to a cell membrane,
1717340	1719340	and it's the same structure as a cell membrane,
1719340	1721340	and this is how methanogens might do it.
1721340	1725340	Well, you could call that a wild bit of imagination,
1725340	1727340	or you could call it a hypothesis.
1727340	1730340	A hypothesis, I think Peter Meddewa said,
1730340	1733340	is a rash leap into the unknown,
1733340	1735340	but at least it's testable.
1735340	1737340	That's what makes it science.
1737340	1740340	And so we built a little reactor.
1740340	1743340	It's a very humble reactor, really,
1743340	1745340	and it doesn't work very well.
1745340	1748340	But we've been playing with this for a few years now,
1748340	1752340	and we've decided that we need to build a better one.
1752340	1754340	We need to make it smaller.
1754340	1757340	We're actually now building a microfluidic version of this,
1757340	1760340	but I'm only showing you this version for two reasons.
1760340	1763340	One of them, we can precipitate the right kind of minerals
1763340	1765340	inside these little vent structures here.
1765340	1768340	And the second one is we're trying to simulate the conditions
1768340	1770340	where we have hydrogen and alkaline fluids on the inside
1770340	1774340	with a semiconducting barrier and CO2 in acidic fluids on the other side,
1774340	1778340	and that should drive the formation of organic matter.
1778340	1780340	And this is formaldehyde,
1780340	1783340	which is the top of that curve that I showed you a few minutes ago.
1783340	1786340	This is the hard point, so we're not especially interested in formaldehyde,
1786340	1788340	but if you can make that, you can make anything.
1788340	1790340	And this is only two hours.
1790340	1792340	So under those conditions,
1792340	1795340	we're seeing a substantial rise in formaldehyde.
1795340	1798340	The trouble with this is trying to keep the conditions
1798340	1802340	under any form of control, and so we're trying to do it better.
1802340	1805340	We've not even published that yet.
1805340	1807340	So I'm not going to talk about that,
1807340	1811340	but I'd like to think what are the consequences,
1811340	1814340	if, big if, what I'm telling you is true,
1814340	1818340	that life started in these hydrothermal vents,
1818340	1822340	and they started there because the structure of these vents
1822340	1825340	favours the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,
1825340	1828340	the proton gradients across membranes or across barriers,
1828340	1830340	because that's still how cells work.
1830340	1835340	And cells now get their hydrogen from almost anywhere.
1835340	1837340	So in photosynthesis, it splits water,
1837340	1840340	and the hydrogen is extracted from water,
1840340	1843340	and it's cobbled onto CO2 to make organic molecules.
1843340	1847340	But the basic reaction is hydrogen reacting with CO2
1847340	1851340	in oxygenic photosynthesis, where the waste product is oxygen.
1851340	1853340	But there's other types of photosynthesis.
1853340	1855340	You can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor.
1855340	1858340	You take the hydrogen out of it, you leave the sulfur behind,
1858340	1860340	you cobble it onto CO2,
1860340	1862340	or you're growing like a methanogen in the vent.
1862340	1864340	The hydrogen is bubbling out of the ground,
1864340	1867340	you simply cobble it onto CO2.
1867340	1871340	Life all across Earth is based on the reaction
1871340	1873340	between hydrogen and CO2.
1873340	1875340	And we go round eating things,
1875340	1879340	but we're entirely dependent on the primary producers,
1879340	1881340	the plants and the bacteria,
1881340	1884340	which are basically reacting hydrogen with CO2.
1885340	1888340	Hydrogen and CO2 don't react
1888340	1892340	except under these rather careful conditions,
1892340	1894340	where you have structure,
1894340	1896340	the same kind of structure that we see in cells.
1896340	1899340	So how common are those conditions likely to be?
1899340	1902340	On the early Earth, we think that they would have been
1902340	1905340	basically all the way across the sea floor.
1905340	1908340	Because it's a reaction between rock and water.
1908340	1912340	So this is, if you imagine this is the sea floor,
1912340	1915340	and then down beneath in the crust underneath the sea floor,
1915340	1921340	these green rocks here are rich in minerals like olivine.
1921340	1924340	So olivine is iron, magnesium rich rock,
1924340	1926340	mostly found in the mantle of the Earth today,
1926340	1929340	which is why you don't see so many reactions like this anymore,
1929340	1932340	but four billion years ago there wasn't really such a difference
1932340	1934340	between the mantle and the crust.
1934340	1937340	So we think these reactions would happen almost everywhere.
1937340	1941340	The water percolates down to depths of five or six kilometres
1941340	1945340	beneath the crust, and will react with these rocks.
1945340	1947340	So if you were to take a lump of olivine
1947340	1949340	and put it in a bucket of water,
1949340	1952340	you'd probably get one bubble in about a week's time.
1952340	1954340	It's not something, you know,
1954340	1957340	it's not an experiment you want to do for the kids.
1957340	1959340	But at the higher temperatures and pressures
1959340	1961340	down at the bottom of the sea floor,
1961340	1964340	it really is bubbling with hydrogen gas.
1964340	1966340	It's a pretty vigorous reaction.
1966340	1968340	And that's really all it takes.
1968340	1971340	It's the reaction between water and rock
1971340	1974340	to produce strongly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen gas.
1974340	1976340	It's an exothermic reaction,
1976340	1978340	which means it's producing heat,
1978340	1981340	and so these are buoyant warm fluids which percolate back up.
1981340	1983340	And when they get to the sea floor,
1983340	1986340	they react with the waters of the ocean,
1986340	1989340	the minerals in the ocean to precipitate as these vents.
1989340	1992340	So the reaction between rock and water is down below the sea floor,
1992340	1995340	but the vents themselves are up at the sea floor.
1995340	1999340	So they should happen on any wet rocky planet.
1999340	2003340	And there's actually quite a lot of lovely suggestions
2003340	2007340	from across our own solar system that they do happen.
2007340	2011340	So Mars, there's traces of methane,
2011340	2013340	thought to be traces of methane on Mars.
2013340	2015340	Where does it come from?
2015340	2017340	The wishful thinkers hope it comes from life.
2017340	2019340	It's possible it does.
2019340	2022340	But it's more likely that it comes from exactly this same process
2022340	2025340	of rocks reacting with water.
2025340	2027340	There is water on Mars still,
2027340	2030340	mostly frozen and mostly beneath the surface.
2030340	2034340	But you're likely to produce hydrogen and methane
2034340	2036340	for exactly the same reasons.
2036340	2039340	And we see on Enceladus, for example, or Europa,
2039340	2043340	which are moons, icy moons, with frozen oceans.
2043340	2047340	But underneath the frozen ocean on Enceladus and on Europa,
2047340	2050340	it seems that there is a rather large ocean,
2050340	2053340	larger than the Earth's oceans.
2053340	2057340	And these plumes that you can see here
2057340	2060340	are escaping from the surface of Enceladus.
2060340	2064340	And they are very alkaline, pH 10, or thereabouts,
2064340	2067340	and rich in hydrogen, gas and methane.
2067340	2069340	And so the only thing that we know of,
2069340	2071340	the only geological process we know of
2071340	2073340	that could produce an ocean that was that alkaline
2073340	2076340	and that rich in hydrogen would be this same process.
2076340	2078340	It's called serpentinisation,
2078340	2080340	but it's the reaction between olivine and water
2080340	2082340	to produce a mineral called serpentinite,
2082340	2085340	which is why it's called serpentinisation.
2085340	2087340	So even in our own solar system,
2087340	2090340	there are at least three worlds
2090340	2093340	where this process is actively going on.
2093340	2095340	And this is really one of the places
2095340	2099340	that NASA would most like to go to, me too.
2099340	2102340	And it actually also means,
2102340	2105340	because of the politics of these situations,
2105340	2108340	I said nobody can agree about where life actually started on Earth
2108340	2109340	or what conditions.
2109340	2112340	So I'm giving you my partial view.
2112340	2114340	NASA like this partial view
2114340	2117340	because NASA want to fly rockets to Enceladus,
2117340	2120340	and they need a reason why they would want to do that,
2120340	2123340	a reason that they can give, I suppose,
2123340	2126340	rather than we just like flying rockets.
2126340	2129340	And that's their maybe life on Enceladus.
2129340	2131340	But that means that these reasons,
2131340	2133340	these ideas on the origin of life,
2133340	2135340	talking about serpentinisation and hydrogen
2135340	2137340	and these particular reactions
2137340	2139340	is appealing at the moment to NASA.
2139340	2141340	I hope that means they might fund me,
2141340	2143340	but probably not.
2143340	2147340	Anyway, so that's within our own solar system.
2147340	2151340	If we go further afield,
2151340	2155340	there's been a real drive
2155340	2157340	to discover exoplanets,
2157340	2162340	planets orbiting distant stars.
2162340	2167340	And there have been projections now
2167340	2170340	that there should be something in the order of tens of billions
2170340	2173340	of Earth-like wet rocky planets
2173340	2176340	in the Milky Way alone.
2176340	2179340	So if that's true,
2179340	2182340	all of these Earth-like wet rocky planets
2182340	2185340	should be producing the same kind of vents.
2185340	2188340	Water is basically ubiquitous.
2188340	2191340	We can detect oliveene in interstellar dust.
2191340	2193340	It's very common,
2193340	2197340	so most rocky planets would have a fair amount of oliveene in them.
2197340	2202340	And CO2, again, is common as an atmospheric gas,
2202340	2205340	certainly in our own solar system.
2205340	2207340	So you could imagine that these same conditions
2207340	2211340	would apply really on a very, very wide scale.
2211340	2213340	And so life starting elsewhere
2213340	2216340	may be constrained by the same reasons.
2216340	2219340	We also require proton gradients across membranes
2219340	2222340	to get going because the reaction between hydrogen and CO2
2222340	2224340	is difficult,
2224340	2229340	and this is a probabilistically simple way of doing it.
2229340	2235340	So if you were to find, say, a thousand life forms in the universe,
2235340	2238340	would it be carbon-based or not?
2238340	2240340	Probably it would mostly be carbon-based
2240340	2243340	because carbon is ubiquitous.
2243340	2246340	It's extremely good at the kind of complex chemistry
2246340	2248340	that needs to be done.
2248340	2251340	And it comes in a convenient LEGO brick, CO2.
2251340	2253340	So you can build large complex molecules
2253340	2255340	by adding on one brick at a time.
2255340	2257340	If you start with silicon,
2257340	2260340	you're starting with silicon oxide, sand.
2260340	2262340	Don't try and build with sand.
2262340	2264340	You want to build with LEGO.
2264340	2267340	And carbon dioxide is a LEGO brick.
2267340	2270340	And so if you were to find a thousand different life forms,
2270340	2272340	I would wader a bet that it's going to be carbon-based,
2272340	2274340	let's say, 995 times out of a thousand,
2274340	2276340	and something wild and funky,
2276340	2278340	perhaps the rest of the times.
2278340	2281340	But carbon is so common, so good at what it does,
2281340	2283340	and so convenient in the forms in which it comes,
2283340	2286340	that it would be very surprising if it wasn't carbon-based.
2286340	2288340	But then we've already run into this constraint.
2288340	2292340	How do you make carbon dioxide react with CO2?
2292340	2295340	I would say we're likely to find bacteria
2295340	2298340	many places throughout the universe.
2298340	2301340	But what about more complex things than bacteria?
2301340	2303340	I don't know how many people in this room
2303340	2306340	would get very excited if there were bacteria discovered on Mars.
2306340	2311340	Most scientists probably would get pretty excited about that.
2311340	2313340	I don't...
2313340	2315340	I really honestly...
2315340	2317340	Can we have a show of hands just out of curiosity?
2317340	2321340	How many people here would be excited to find bacteria on another planet?
2321340	2324340	Pretty much all of you. Great.
2325340	2328340	Would we find anything more complex than bacteria?
2328340	2330340	We need to look back, though,
2330340	2333340	on what I've accomplished, what I'm suggesting is a set of constraints
2333340	2338340	that cells anywhere are going to be based on reacting hydrogen with CO2,
2338340	2342340	and to do it, they're going to need proton gradients across membranes.
2343340	2346340	And bacteria have remained constrained and haven't changed
2346340	2348340	for four billion years in their morphology,
2348340	2350340	neither have archaea.
2350340	2352340	So could it be that they are constrained
2352340	2356340	by the way that they generate their energy?
2356340	2359340	Well, I think that's probably the case.
2359340	2364340	John Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,
2364340	2367340	and he was at UCL for a period where I am,
2367340	2370340	so I think a lot of...
2370340	2374340	It's a great place, UCL, at least in one sense,
2374340	2378340	in the sense that some of the greatest thinkers and biologists of the 20th century
2378340	2380340	worked there for a while.
2380340	2383340	They all left and went to Cambridge or somewhere after a bit,
2383340	2386340	but for a while they were all there at UCL,
2386340	2389340	and I think a lot of us walk around these corridors and think,
2389340	2391340	oh, JVS Haldane used to walk down here.
2391340	2393340	I better do something good today.
2394340	2398340	So Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,
2398340	2401340	and he liked calling things that shouldn't happen
2401340	2403340	and evolutionary scandal.
2403340	2405340	He was scandalised by sex.
2405340	2407340	Sex really shouldn't happen.
2407340	2410340	Why wouldn't people not just make clones of themselves instead?
2410340	2413340	And he spent a lot of his career trying to work out why sex does happen
2413340	2418340	and why most things that make clones of themselves just fall extinct after a period.
2418340	2423340	I'd like to think, he never actually said that the eukaryotes were an evolutionary scandal,
2423340	2426340	but I think he would have seen it in those terms.
2426340	2432340	The problem is that all complex life is composed of this one cell type,
2432340	2434340	this eukaryotic cell.
2434340	2439340	The fact that we all obviously share a common ancestor
2439340	2443340	because the plants and the animals, if you look at their cells under a microscope,
2443340	2447340	they're almost indistinguishable in the sense that they all have a nucleus.
2447340	2451340	They all have lots of membrane systems called the endoplasmic reticulum, for example.
2451340	2454340	All lysosomes, they all have mitochondria.
2454340	2458340	You could write page after page in a textbook of things that plants and animals have in common
2458340	2460340	at the level of cells,
2460340	2463340	but fungi have the same things in common as well,
2463340	2469340	and so does an amoeba, or single-celled algae and so on.
2469340	2474340	It's a shockingly long list, and it's quite baffling as to why that would be the case.
2474340	2480340	So traits like sex as well, lots of amoeba, in fact pretty much all of them,
2480340	2483340	are sexual, it turns out.
2483340	2487340	For a long time we assumed they weren't because you never really caught two of them together.
2488340	2491340	But now we know their genomes.
2491340	2494340	Funnily enough, it's the genomes that give insight into these things.
2494340	2497340	We can see that all the genes that are required for meiosis,
2497340	2501340	which is to say the recombination part of sex and the cell division,
2501340	2504340	we find them all in amoeba.
2504340	2507340	We find them all in very ancient looking cells.
2507340	2510340	And there's plenty of evidence, again, from the genomes
2510340	2514340	that they've been recombining genes and changing the structure of the genome continuously.
2514340	2518340	We know that they're sexual, even if we've never caught them at it.
2518340	2521340	So this is the scandal then.
2521340	2525340	All eukaryotic cells share this long list of traits.
2525340	2530340	Bacteria and archaea just don't do it.
2530340	2532340	They don't do sex, for example.
2532340	2535340	They pass genes around a bit, they do some recombination,
2535340	2538340	but they don't fuse cells together, line up whole genomes,
2538340	2543340	cross across genes and then separate up, and bacteria just don't do that.
2543340	2548340	So the scandal, if all of these traits, and there's hundreds and hundreds of them,
2548340	2551340	evolve by natural selection, step by step,
2551340	2554340	and there's no reason to imagine that that didn't happen,
2554340	2559340	and each of these small steps offered some kind of an advantage,
2559340	2562340	and again, there's no reason to assume that that's not true,
2562340	2568340	then why is it that none of them evolve in the bacteria or the archaea for the same reasons?
2568340	2570340	They really ought to, but they don't.
2570340	2573340	So you could think of eyes as a nice example.
2573340	2576340	Lots of creationists say what use is half an eye,
2576340	2581340	but evolution is full of things that most people would say was half an eye.
2581340	2584340	And it's exactly as natural selection would predict.
2584340	2592340	There are at least 60 or 70 separate origins of morphologically complex eyes.
2592340	2594340	That's not quite true, as I'm putting it,
2594340	2598340	because a lot of them in animals share a common ancestor
2598340	2601340	on some kind of a worm that had a light sensitive spot.
2601340	2606340	But it's partly true in the sense that the octopus eye, for example,
2606340	2609340	was over here somewhere, and the human eye
2609340	2614340	have arrived with a camera eye essentially independently.
2614340	2615340	It's convergent evolution.
2615340	2618340	They started from a light sensitive spot,
2618340	2622340	and independently they ended up with a camera type eye.
2622340	2625340	There are one or two regulatory genes in common,
2625340	2628340	but they independently recruited all the rest of the genes.
2628340	2631340	But then there are, I think, this is Eudlina, an algorithm.
2631340	2632340	It's got an eye spot.
2632340	2636340	It's got the same proteins, light sensitive proteins,
2636340	2641340	rhodopsins in that eye spot that we have in our own eyes.
2641340	2643340	This is even more amazing.
2643340	2646340	This is a camera type eye, which you can see the lens,
2646340	2648340	you can see the retina, you can see a cornea.
2648340	2650340	That's in a single cell.
2650340	2654340	That's a single protist, eukaryotic protist.
2654340	2657340	The retina is composed of chloroplasts,
2657340	2660340	just reused for a different purpose.
2660340	2662340	The lens, I'm not sure what the lens is made of,
2662340	2664340	but the cornea is made of mitochondria.
2664340	2666340	Again, they've just been cobbled together
2666340	2667340	and used for a different purpose,
2667340	2670340	but it's a camera eye inside a single cell.
2670340	2674340	My point is this is what natural selection will predict,
2674340	2676340	that there should be multiple different types of eye
2676340	2679340	in different environments, different ecological contexts,
2679340	2683340	different types of eye with different functioning.
2683340	2685340	We don't see the evolutionary intermediates,
2685340	2688340	but we see ecologically all the different types.
2688340	2691340	We would expect to see something similar in bacteria.
2691340	2693340	We would expect to see some bacteria that have something
2693340	2695340	that's a bit like a nucleus,
2695340	2697340	or some that do something a bit like sex,
2697340	2700340	or that can do phagocytosis,
2700340	2703340	go around and engulf cells and eat them.
2703340	2706340	These are all valuable traits for us,
2706340	2707340	so why don't the bacteria do it?
2707340	2709340	It's not like the eye.
2709340	2712340	There's a big difference there in what we see around us.
2713340	2716340	It really boils down to this question that I raised earlier on.
2716340	2718340	What was happening down this branch of the tree of life
2718340	2720340	that wasn't happening over here,
2720340	2722340	and it's not to do with information
2722340	2726340	because these guys trawl through all the information
2726340	2729340	and still didn't come out with the answer.
2729340	2732340	I want to make the point that it's not at the level
2732340	2735340	of large plants and animals.
2735340	2737340	The real difference, the real void,
2737340	2740340	is at the level of single cells.
2740340	2742340	It's a bog standard alga,
2742340	2745340	the kind of thing you'd find in any pond in London
2745340	2747340	or anywhere else, euglina.
2747340	2751340	Over here is a relatively complex bacterium.
2751340	2754340	It's actually even got a little compartment inside it,
2754340	2757340	which some people have said is a bit like a nucleus.
2757340	2759340	It's not really.
2759340	2762340	The reason you can't see it well is it's roughly to scale.
2762340	2765340	You don't need to know what most of these things are in here
2765340	2769340	to realise that this is a lot bigger and more complicated.
2769340	2771340	These are the mitochondria.
2771340	2773340	This is actually a chloroplast.
2773340	2775340	You can see the nucleus there,
2775340	2777340	but it's on a different scale.
2777340	2779340	The level of complexity in a single cell
2779340	2781340	has gone out by orders of magnitude
2781340	2784340	compared to a relatively complex bacterium.
2784340	2786340	Not in the biochemistry,
2786340	2789340	but in this morphological complexity.
2789340	2792340	It's interesting that if you were to compare
2792340	2794340	two different eukaryotic cells,
2794340	2796340	they look rather similar.
2796340	2799340	This is paramecium, which is a single cell protist,
2799340	2804340	and this is a pancreatic asinase cell, a human one.
2804340	2807340	Again, they're roughly to the same scale,
2807340	2809340	and most people would look at them and say,
2809340	2811340	well, they're kind of similar.
2811340	2815340	In terms of the amount of complexity going on in them,
2815340	2817340	they're not a world apart.
2817340	2819340	This is a single cell protist,
2819340	2821340	and this is part of a multicellular organism.
2821340	2823340	It's out of curiosity.
2823340	2826340	Has anyone got any idea how many genes by genes,
2826340	2830340	protein coding genes, paramecium has?
2830340	2832340	Any thoughts?
2832340	2834340	Twice the amount of humans.
2834340	2836340	Exactly, twice the amount of humans.
2836340	2839340	40,000 genes.
2839340	2842340	Now maybe we do lots of additional regulation,
2842340	2844340	or maybe we're just not very much more complicated
2844340	2846340	than paramecium.
2846340	2850340	By most objective measures of complexity,
2850340	2852340	there's not a great world of difference
2852340	2854340	between these two types of cell,
2854340	2856340	in terms of the number of genes,
2856340	2858340	in terms of the amount of morphological complexity,
2858340	2861340	in terms of basically the hard wiring of it.
2861340	2865340	The real difference is between bacteria and single cell eukaryotes,
2865340	2868340	rather than between single cell eukaryotes
2868340	2873340	and large multicellular organisms.
2873340	2876340	I'm going to have to, rather than exploring all the possible options,
2876340	2879340	I'm going to tell you what I think the answer is.
2879340	2882340	We could be here all the rest of the week.
2882340	2886340	Here's a group of cells that are pretty simple,
2886340	2888340	as eukaryotes go.
2888340	2890340	This is jardia.
2890340	2892340	Jardia causes explosive diarrhea,
2892340	2895340	that anybody who's been walking in the mountains in America,
2895340	2898340	may have had jardial poisoning.
2898340	2900340	I never had it,
2900340	2903340	but when I used to go walking in the mountains in places like that,
2903340	2906340	I used to be terrified that when I drank from the mountain streams,
2906340	2908340	I would get it.
2908340	2911340	But it doesn't have any mitochondria,
2911340	2914340	and people thought it didn't do sex either until quite recently,
2914340	2916340	when it turns out it is sexual,
2916340	2918340	and it turns out that it does have mitochondria too,
2918340	2920340	just not as we know them.
2920340	2924340	It has organelles which derive from mitochondria,
2924340	2927340	called mitosomes.
2927340	2929340	It's typical of science as well.
2929340	2933340	It took 25 years of probably about
2933340	2937340	at least 15 research groups around the world,
2937340	2939340	not just with jardia,
2939340	2941340	but with these others as well,
2941340	2944340	microsperidia, trichomonas, entomebo, monocircumenoides.
2944340	2947340	These are cells that don't have mitochondria.
2947340	2950340	For a long time, they were thought to be
2950340	2953340	an evolutionary intermediate, a living fossil
2953340	2956340	from very early in eukaryotic evolution,
2956340	2959340	that were given insight into how complex cells evolved.
2959340	2961340	It turns out they're not.
2961340	2963340	They're all derived.
2963340	2966340	They all had far more complex ancestors in the past,
2966340	2970340	evolved down in complexity to become more like bacteria.
2970340	2974340	They all have mitochondria,
2974340	2977340	and it took 25 years of these research groups
2977340	2979340	around the world to nail that.
2979340	2981340	The reason it was done, in part,
2981340	2983340	is because half of them are parasites,
2983340	2985340	and so they're of medical interest.
2985340	2987340	As soon as things become of medical interest,
2987340	2989340	then people are going to fund you.
2989340	2991340	If people went to the funders and said,
2991340	2993340	these are really interesting living fossils
2993340	2995340	that might give us an insight into
2995340	2997340	the evolution of complexity,
2997340	2999340	they're not going to get funded, unfortunately.
2999340	3001340	If you say it causes explosive diarrhea,
3001340	3003340	where's the checkbook?
3003340	3005340	So that's what they said.
3005340	3007340	They said it causes explosive diarrhea,
3007340	3009340	and they had 20 years of funding,
3009340	3011340	and they spent it very wisely
3011340	3014340	on the early evolution of complexity.
3014340	3017340	We now know that these are actually
3017340	3021340	not living fossils, but highly derived.
3021340	3023340	The one thing that we can take away from it
3023340	3027340	is they all had mitochondria in the past,
3027340	3029340	and that's important.
3029340	3031340	It's important, in part,
3031340	3033340	because mitochondria, as I said at the beginning,
3033340	3035340	were bacteria once,
3035340	3038340	and this was made famous by Lynn Margulis.
3038340	3040340	Margulis, I should say.
3040340	3043340	She died of a stroke a couple of years ago.
3043340	3045340	I only met her once,
3045340	3047340	and I admired her enormously,
3047340	3049340	but she had a knack of disagreeing
3049340	3052340	with everybody about everything,
3052340	3054340	including me.
3054340	3056340	Yes, well, that man is...
3056340	3059340	She was married to Carl Sagan,
3059340	3062340	and they divorced after a while.
3062340	3065340	Before she wrote her famous paper in 1967,
3065340	3067340	they'd already divorced.
3067340	3069340	I'd love to have heard their breakfast conversations
3069340	3071340	between those two, but anyway,
3071340	3074340	she was the person who really nailed the idea
3074340	3076340	that mitochondria were bacteria once.
3076340	3078340	She nailed the idea that chloroplasts
3078340	3080340	derived from bacteria as well,
3080340	3082340	and she also argued for a long time
3082340	3085340	that there were lots of other symbioses,
3085340	3087340	for example, with spirochetes bacteria,
3087340	3089340	giving rise to the cytoskeleton
3089340	3091340	and the flagella and so on.
3091340	3094340	Nobody agrees with her about that.
3094340	3097340	She was very strong-willed
3097340	3100340	and disagreed with most people about most things,
3100340	3104340	but she was bang on for these central ideas
3104340	3106340	on the origin of the eukaryotic cell,
3106340	3108340	and the amount of, I suppose you call it,
3108340	3110340	hate mail now that she got.
3110340	3114340	If you read the literature from after her paper in 1967
3114340	3116340	through into the early 70s,
3116340	3118340	people did not like these ideas at all,
3118340	3121340	and they wrote really unpleasant diatribes
3121340	3123340	in the literature.
3123340	3127340	You can understand why she became very hardened to abuse
3127340	3130340	and eventually basically believed everybody else
3130340	3132340	was wrong apart from her.
3132340	3134340	She was asked once,
3134340	3137340	why does she enjoy being so controversial,
3137340	3139340	and her answer was,
3139340	3142340	I don't think I'm controversial, I think I'm right.
3142340	3145340	I'm not even sure she used the word think.
3147340	3149340	So that's Slim Margulis,
3149340	3152340	and she nailed that mitochondria derived from bacteria,
3152340	3154340	and we still can't really agree
3154340	3157340	about exactly which kind of bacteria were they,
3157340	3161340	but probably something like Rhodobacter that we're seeing there.
3162340	3164340	So something acquired these bacteria
3164340	3166340	that went on to become the mitochondria,
3166340	3168340	and again, there's been no agreement
3168340	3171340	about what kind of a cell that was until quite recently,
3171340	3174340	and this is a place called Loki's Castle,
3174340	3177340	which is just off the coast of Norway,
3177340	3181340	and a Swedish group have been trawling around
3181340	3183340	in the muds underneath there
3183340	3186340	and sequencing everything that they found in those muds.
3186340	3189340	So we've never even now seen
3189340	3191340	what these cells actually looked like.
3191340	3193340	This is what's called metagenomic reconstruction.
3193340	3195340	So you sequence everything,
3195340	3197340	and you try and piece together genomes
3197340	3199340	by effectively matching the ends up,
3199340	3204340	and eventually you put together the genome of these cells.
3204340	3206340	There's a certain amount of debate
3206340	3208340	about whether there's contamination in there,
3208340	3210340	but it looks broadly true,
3210340	3212340	and the thing that's really surprising about it is,
3212340	3214340	you carry it to here, this is another tree,
3214340	3216340	and right next to them,
3216340	3218340	so we started out with a Loki archaeata there,
3218340	3220340	we're discovered at Loki's Castle,
3220340	3222340	and since then various others have been found,
3222340	3224340	and they've kept going with this Norse theme,
3224340	3226340	so now we've got all the Norse gods down there,
3226340	3229340	we've got the Odin archaeata and the Thor archaeata
3229340	3232340	and the Heimdal archaeata and so on.
3232340	3234340	But the thing which is really plain
3234340	3236340	is that you carry it to our branching
3236340	3238340	right in the middle of those groups.
3238340	3240340	So whatever the host cell was that acquired mitochondria
3240340	3242340	was something pretty similar to this,
3242340	3245340	and the irony is we don't know what this looks like,
3245340	3247340	we don't know what kind of a cell it was.
3247340	3249340	Some people say it was a primitive phagasite
3249340	3251340	that kind of tried to eat things.
3251340	3254340	Other people, including me, say,
3254340	3256340	oh no, it wasn't, it was an autotrofe,
3256340	3258340	it used hydrogen gas.
3258340	3261340	I don't think we can really be very sure yet
3261340	3263340	what kind of a cell it was,
3263340	3266340	but it was probably basically a fairly simple cell.
3266340	3271340	And so this is another tree,
3271340	3273340	which I think is beautiful,
3273340	3276340	this is from one of the most, I think, brilliant biologists
3276340	3279340	operating today, a guy called Bill Martin.
3279340	3283340	He also has a knack of winding people up.
3283340	3287340	And this tree goes back to 1998.
3287340	3290340	And it's remarkable for several reasons.
3290340	3293340	One of them is that it's now more right than it was then.
3293340	3295340	So in 1998 when he put this forward,
3295340	3298340	I think most people must have thought he was bonkers.
3298340	3301340	Look down here, we have two separate origins
3301340	3303340	from a hydrothermal vent.
3303340	3306340	So the bacteria on the archaea.
3306340	3309340	I haven't really gone into the details of that.
3309340	3312340	When I first heard him say that in 2002,
3312340	3314340	I thought he was completely bonkers.
3314340	3317340	I now think he was absolutely right.
3317340	3320340	I haven't really had time to go into why they would,
3320340	3322340	so they share a common ancestor,
3322340	3325340	but down inside the vents.
3325340	3327340	The other thing which is really clear on here
3327340	3331340	is he has a kind of genomic merger going on.
3331340	3334340	So genes from the archaea and genes from the bacteria
3334340	3337340	are fusing together here to form the eukaryotes.
3337340	3341340	And this is a singular endosymbiosis.
3341340	3344340	This one is the chloroplasts.
3344340	3347340	So this is not really the same as Lynn Margulis
3347340	3349340	who had lots of these things going on
3349340	3351340	in all kinds of different cell lines.
3351340	3354340	This was a singular event that gave rise to eukaryotic cells.
3354340	3357340	And later on, the acquisition of chloroplasts
3357340	3360340	gave rise to plants, but it didn't change anything really
3360340	3362340	about the big structure of eukaryotic evolution.
3362340	3365340	Plants are the same type of cells that we have,
3365340	3368340	except with chloroplasts added in and a vacuol,
3368340	3370340	but we're basically the same.
3370340	3375340	So Bill has this singular origin of complex life.
3375340	3378340	Now a lot of people really hate this idea,
3378340	3382340	and I think it's in part because we don't really like the idea
3382340	3384340	of freak accidents in science.
3384340	3387340	It kind of almost puts itself beyond science.
3387340	3391340	We can't study statistically an accident, a singularity,
3391340	3395340	but you can think about it in a very productive way.
3395340	3398340	If this was the origin of the eukaryotic cell,
3398340	3401340	and it started something like this,
3401340	3403340	this is the only example that we know of
3403340	3406340	of bacteria living inside another bacterial cell.
3406340	3408340	So there's plenty of bacteria living inside
3408340	3411340	our own type of cell, eukaryotic cells,
3411340	3416340	but it's really rare for bacteria to be inside another bacterial cell.
3416340	3418340	This is not a phagocyte.
3418340	3421340	It didn't engulf the cell to get in there.
3421340	3423340	It's got a cell wall around it.
3423340	3425340	It's actually a cyanobacterium,
3425340	3427340	and you can see the photosynthetic membranes here.
3427340	3429340	So we don't know what they're doing there.
3429340	3431340	This actually is an old discovery.
3431340	3433340	This is from 1979,
3433340	3436340	when they were still called blue-green algae in those days.
3436340	3438340	And blue-green algae really refers to eukaryotes,
3438340	3441340	so everybody ignored that paper for 20 years
3441340	3444340	until it turned out they were actually bacteria
3444340	3446340	with bacteria inside,
3446340	3452340	and so this speaks more about the whole sweep of evolution.
3452340	3454340	Why would that make a difference?
3454340	3456340	Well, the cells that are living inside,
3456340	3458340	they are bacteria.
3458340	3459340	They are cells.
3459340	3460340	They've got their own agenda.
3460340	3461340	They want to grow.
3461340	3462340	They want to divide.
3462340	3463340	They want to...
3463340	3469340	There's a lovely quote from Jack Monogh,
3469340	3473340	who said that the dream of every cell is to become two cells.
3473340	3477340	And so that's what these guys are dreaming about in here.
3477340	3481340	They're thinking, how am I going to double?
3481340	3484340	And the way that they do it,
3484340	3486340	if you imagine a population of bacteria,
3486340	3490340	and they're all growing frantically,
3490340	3492340	and the speed at which they grow
3492340	3495340	depends on the speed at which they can copy their genome
3495340	3496340	as much as anything else.
3496340	3499340	And so the smaller the genome is, the faster they can grow.
3499340	3503340	It tells that if there's something about the environment
3503340	3506340	that means they don't need this gene now,
3506340	3509340	it's not useful and they lose it, they delete it,
3509340	3511340	then they can probably grow a little bit faster
3511340	3513340	because their genome is just a little bit smaller.
3513340	3515340	And over a couple of days, bacteria,
3515340	3518340	their growth rate does depend on that kind of factor.
3518340	3520340	But then the environment changes again
3520340	3522340	and whatever it was that that gene did,
3522340	3523340	you need it again now.
3523340	3526340	And so they pick it up.
3526340	3528340	What bacteria do is they pick up genes
3528340	3529340	called lateral gene transfer.
3529340	3531340	It's like passing loose change around.
3531340	3533340	They acquire it again
3533340	3535340	and before you know it, you're back where you were.
3535340	3537340	But if you've got a same population of bacteria
3537340	3539340	living inside another cell,
3539340	3541340	they do the same thing.
3541340	3543340	They throw away genes that they don't need.
3543340	3546340	Imagine that those genes are for making a cell wall,
3546340	3549340	and you're living inside another cell,
3549340	3553340	and you don't need a cell wall for protection inside another cell
3553340	3556340	or for preventing yourself exploding
3556340	3559340	with the difference in pressure between the outside and inside.
3559340	3561340	So you lose those genes, you grow a little bit faster,
3561340	3563340	you come to dominate the population.
3563340	3566340	But so long as the cell doesn't die that you're living in,
3566340	3567340	you'll be all right.
3567340	3569340	You never need those genes again.
3569340	3573340	And so there's a tendency for bacterial parasites
3573340	3576340	to lose genes and to become simpler.
3576340	3578340	And not just bacterial parasites,
3578340	3581340	we see the same thing with Jardier and so on.
3581340	3584340	And a very nice example is Rickettsia,
3584340	3586340	which a few years ago people thought
3586340	3588340	was very closely related to mitochondria.
3588340	3591340	It's probably not so closely related.
3591340	3593340	But it's still a beautiful example.
3593340	3598340	It was the cause of time that wiped out the armies of Napoleon
3598340	3601340	on his retreat from Moscow.
3601340	3605340	And it's spread by these ticks.
3605340	3607340	And it's a bacterium.
3607340	3611340	Here it is invading a large eukaryotic cell.
3611340	3613340	I think it's actually a kidney cell.
3614340	3616340	And the one thing about it which stands out
3616340	3618340	is it's got a tiny genome.
3618340	3620340	It's around about one megabase genome.
3620340	3622340	And that's true for all of these things.
3622340	3624340	I'm not just hand-waving here.
3624340	3629340	This is the range of genome sizes of free-living bacteria.
3629340	3632340	It goes up to around about 12 megabases now.
3632340	3636340	This guy, T. Ryan Gregory, did a lot of work on genome sizes.
3636340	3639340	And down at this other end,
3639340	3643340	these are the parasites and the endosymbionts
3643340	3645340	and the obligate symbionts.
3645340	3649340	They're pretty much down at less than one megabase of DNA.
3649340	3651340	So just for comparison's sake,
3651340	3654340	we have 3,000 megabases of DNA.
3654340	3659340	The largest bacterial genome is 12 megabases of DNA.
3659340	3662340	And some large algae, like eudlina,
3662340	3666340	are up to 100,000 megabases of DNA.
3666340	3668340	So we have quite constrained genomes
3668340	3670340	in comparison with some single cell.
3670340	3673340	The largest one is a thing called Amoeba W,
3673340	3675340	which was miscountered.
3675340	3678340	It was originally 670,000 megabases.
3678340	3681340	It's come down to 150,000 last count.
3681340	3685340	But still, it's very, very substantially bigger
3685340	3688340	than our own genome.
3688340	3691340	But what happens with these bacteria that live in other cells?
3691340	3693340	They lose genes. They become simpler.
3693340	3695340	They whittle away.
3695340	3699340	And that's what ended up with the mitochondria.
3699340	3702340	All these mitochondria that we have
3702340	3705340	in millions of billions of copies,
3705340	3707340	they all have genomes of their own,
3707340	3709340	and they're passed on down the maternal line
3709340	3712340	from mother to son.
3712340	3715340	My kids don't have my mitochondria.
3715340	3717340	They have my wife's mitochondria.
3717340	3721340	It's a very strange arrangement that I won't go into now.
3721340	3724340	What it means is that if you want to be bigger,
3724340	3726340	more complex and spend more energy,
3726340	3729340	it's not just a case of having a larger surface area.
3729340	3731340	You've got a whole unit here.
3731340	3734340	That unit has some genes, which in some way control respiration.
3734340	3737340	It's got the protein building factories, the ribosomes.
3737340	3739340	It's a unit, and if you want to expand,
3739340	3741340	you just make more units.
3741340	3743340	You have more mitochondria.
3743340	3745340	But it's not just that you're increasing the surface area.
3745340	3747340	You've got genomes with each one.
3747340	3750340	And that allows you to expand up on a massive scale.
3750340	3753340	And the person who's, I think, done more on this side,
3753340	3756340	again, going back to the early 1990s,
3756340	3759340	John Allen has been arguing that they require genes
3759340	3761340	to control respiration.
3761340	3763340	And still, I would say,
3763340	3766340	the majority of the field is not persuaded that he's correct.
3766340	3768340	He is correct, I'm sure of that.
3768340	3771340	But it takes an awful long time in science
3771340	3774340	for sometimes the simplest ideas to catch on.
3774340	3777340	Most people just don't really care very much, I'm afraid.
3777340	3780340	But it's the difference.
3780340	3783340	That they can, to become a very large cell,
3783340	3786340	you just scale up mitochondria.
3786340	3790340	So this is a giant bacterium, and there are a few around.
3790340	3794340	These little white dots here are the copies of the complete genome.
3794340	3797340	So the giant bacteria that do exist,
3797340	3800340	it seems that they also need genes to control respiration.
3800340	3802340	And this is the edge of the cell,
3802340	3805340	and this is the plasma membrane where respiration is taking place.
3805340	3809340	And they have as many as 200,000 copies of the complete genome.
3809340	3812340	And each genome is a normal-sized bacterial genome
3812340	3815340	with three megabases of DNA in it.
3815340	3817340	And this is a eukaryotic cell.
3817340	3820340	The blue is the nucleus where it's the main gene depot.
3820340	3824340	And all these little, the green spots here
3824340	3827340	are the mitochondrial DNA.
3827340	3832340	So there are hundreds or thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA.
3832340	3834340	So the difference between these two cells
3834340	3837340	is not that this cell has an awful lot more DNA than that cell,
3837340	3839340	they actually have a similar amount.
3839340	3842340	It's that in that case it's got a kind of genomic symmetry.
3842340	3845340	There's thousands of copies of the same genome,
3845340	3847340	exactly the same genome.
3847340	3850340	Whereas here we've got one massive nuclear genome
3850340	3853340	which is supported energetically by this kind of end point.
3853340	3856340	Thousands of mitochondrial genomes which have whittled down
3856340	3859340	and become smaller and smaller and more and more streamlined.
3859340	3861340	So all the mitochondria, effectively,
3861340	3864340	it gives us multi-bacterial power without the bacterial overheads.
3864340	3867340	And that's what allows all those overheads
3867340	3870340	can go into supporting a massive nucleus with full of genes.
3870340	3874340	At least it's the raw material for natural selection to operate on.
3874340	3876340	And so we have a kind of genomic asymmetry.
3876340	3879340	And to me that's the real difference between bacteria
3879340	3881340	and large complex cells.
3881340	3882340	We've got two genomes.
3882340	3884340	There isn't such a thing as the human genome,
3884340	3887340	there are human genomes, the mitochondrial genome
3887340	3888340	and the nuclear genome.
3888340	3890340	This is the last slide.
3891340	3895340	Why then is complex life so rare?
3895340	3897340	Why did it only happen once on Earth?
3897340	3901340	And would it only happen rarely elsewhere in the universe?
3901340	3905340	There's a double bottleneck here.
3905340	3909340	One of them we have to get bacterium into another bacterial type cell
3909340	3914340	to break down this issue with membranes and scaling.
3914340	3919340	So you've got to have cells within cells to be able to scale up.
3919340	3921340	But those cells have their own agenda.
3921340	3926340	You have what's called conflict, levels of selection conflict
3926340	3931340	that the bacteria inside want to grow fast
3931340	3934340	and perhaps make their host cell fuse with other cells
3934340	3935340	or whatever they want to do.
3935340	3937340	The host cell itself wants to keep them under control
3937340	3938340	and bleed off the energy
3938340	3941340	but they don't want them replicating at any old speed.
3941340	3943340	Chances of it going wrong is really high.
3943340	3947340	And maybe this is why we don't see any surviving intermediates.
3947340	3950340	Maybe they all died because it was a pretty dodgy situation
3950340	3954340	for a long period of time or even a short period of time.
3954340	3957340	It's just that this is a long evolutionary distance.
3957340	3960340	Regardless of whether what I'm telling you is right or not,
3960340	3962340	this long evolutionary distance,
3962340	3965340	there are no evolutionary intermediates that have ever been found.
3965340	3968340	And so all of this complexity in this type of cell
3968340	3970340	and I would like to leave you with this thought,
3970340	3975340	we have no idea yet at least the difference between ideas
3975340	3977340	and serious scientific knowledge
3977340	3981340	where we can say that there have been experiments done and real data,
3981340	3985340	how any of this complexity of eukaryotic cells arose.
3985340	3988340	And if we want to understand medicine and what goes wrong in our own bodies
3988340	3993340	and we don't understand why these parts arose in the first place,
3993340	3997340	what were the evolutionary driving forces that made them evolve,
3997340	4001340	how can we really understand ourselves and medicine?
4001340	4006340	And if this starts out with mitochondria in a very simple cell
4006340	4008340	with none of that complexity,
4008340	4013340	the nice thing from my point of view is that perhaps all of this complexity arose
4013340	4017340	and the reason that we share such similar cells with plants and with algae
4017340	4021340	is not that we were all adapting to different external environments,
4021340	4024340	but we all were adapting to the same internal environment,
4024340	4026340	the problem of having cells living inside us.
4026340	4029340	And it's that that drove all of this complexity.
4029340	4031340	And once it became a stable system,
4031340	4035340	then eukaryotes could spread out and take over the rest of the world.
4035340	4038340	And with that, I'd like to say thank you very much.
4038340	4040340	This work has been done by many people,
4040340	4046340	and it's great fun having a lab with so many bright young people coming through it.
4046340	4048340	It's an inspiration for me. Thank you very much.
