00:00.000 --> 00:13.280
It's a great pleasure and privilege to be here with you today and to share some thoughts

00:13.280 --> 00:19.680
on the 30 years and more that I've been working in the area of autism and reflect on how our

00:19.680 --> 00:23.920
understanding of autism has changed over that time. And I really look forward to your questions

00:23.920 --> 00:26.720
where I will get to learn from you.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.560
The Gresham College lecture that you're listening to right now is giving you knowledge

00:30.560 --> 00:36.240
and insight from one of the world's leading academic experts. Making it takes a lot of time,

00:36.240 --> 00:39.680
but because we want to encourage a love of learning, we think it's well worth it.

00:40.560 --> 00:45.280
We never make you pay for lectures, although donations are needed. All we ask in return

00:45.280 --> 00:50.080
is this, send a link to this lecture to someone you think would benefit and if you haven't already,

00:50.080 --> 00:53.600
click the follow or subscribe button from wherever you're listening right now.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.320
Now, let's get back to the lecture.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.680
So autism is perhaps more present in everyone's consciousness than ever before,

01:06.480 --> 01:12.320
and you can see autism being reflected in news articles like the one today about employment

01:12.320 --> 01:16.880
and also in fiction, in books and films. Some of the coverage is very misleading,

01:16.880 --> 01:23.440
of course, and some of it perpetuates myths, but I think there's great awareness of autism

01:23.440 --> 01:28.240
than any time during the 30 or decades that I've been working in the area,

01:28.240 --> 01:34.400
and most people, when I tell them what I do, will say, oh, yes, I have a friend whose child

01:34.400 --> 01:41.200
is autistic or some sort of connection. But what is autism? Well, you can answer that question

01:41.200 --> 01:46.160
in lots of different ways. We know that autism has a strong genetic component in most cases,

01:46.800 --> 01:51.520
but we don't have a genetic or blood test for autism, and we're still defining and

01:51.520 --> 01:56.640
diagnosing autism on the basis of behavior. So we're talking about a behavioral syndrome,

01:56.640 --> 02:02.320
a pattern of behavior, characterized by social and communication differences,

02:02.320 --> 02:08.480
and sometimes difficulties, by rigid and repetitive behavior, which now includes sensory

02:08.480 --> 02:16.000
sensitivities also, and something characteristic that is present from early in life,

02:16.800 --> 02:21.440
even though the diagnosis may come much, much later, and as I'll go on to talk about later,

02:21.440 --> 02:25.200
we have some people coming for first diagnosis in their 50s or in their 70s,

02:26.000 --> 02:29.680
but the characteristics of autism were always present from very early on.

02:31.680 --> 02:37.040
So the first way that autism has changed is from being considered rather narrowly,

02:37.040 --> 02:44.160
defined rather narrowly, to a much broader definition. So in the 1980s, the diagnosis

02:44.160 --> 02:50.080
was called infantile autism, reflecting, again, a very different history where initially,

02:50.080 --> 02:56.480
autism was distinguished and talked about as childhood schizophrenia, and some of the

02:56.480 --> 03:01.840
diagnostic criteria were pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people, so being oblivious

03:01.840 --> 03:07.120
of others, gross deficits in language development, often an individual who didn't speak or only

03:07.120 --> 03:12.640
spoke a few words, and absence of delusions and hallucinations, and you can see that that is

03:12.640 --> 03:18.320
an attempt to distinguish autism from schizophrenia or from psychosis spectrum.

03:19.600 --> 03:25.120
Now, most of us, when we think about our autistic friends and relatives, they may not fit those

03:25.840 --> 03:30.800
criteria at all, certainly not pervasively unresponsive to other people, for example,

03:30.800 --> 03:36.560
and they may have very good language. Our current diagnostic criteria for what we now call autism

03:36.560 --> 03:43.520
spectrum disorder include things like persistent deficits, some people would rather say differences

03:43.520 --> 03:48.240
in social communication and social interaction, restricted repetitive patterns of behavior,

03:48.240 --> 03:52.960
interests or activities, and as I said, that now includes sensory sensitivities,

03:54.080 --> 03:59.920
and importantly, in our current conception, you can have an autism diagnosis and a diagnosis of

04:00.000 --> 04:06.720
ADHD or of anxiety or depression, and surprisingly, that was only allowed from 2013

04:07.440 --> 04:12.720
in the current diagnostic criteria. Before that, if you were anxious and autistic, your anxiety was

04:12.720 --> 04:16.880
put down to your autism, which obviously isn't helpful, and I'll talk more about mental health

04:16.880 --> 04:24.080
later on. So a great widening of those diagnostic criteria, incorporating many more people,

04:24.080 --> 04:30.800
when I started in the field, most autistic children were in special school, many almost

04:30.800 --> 04:36.960
had intellectual disability, language difficulties, and we were really fighting a lot of under

04:36.960 --> 04:43.200
diagnosis. Now, most autistic children are in mainstream school, that may not always be the

04:43.200 --> 04:48.640
best place for them if they're not well supported, but most are in mainstream, most will have pretty

04:48.720 --> 04:54.800
good intellectual functioning and serviceable or good or excellent language. So the picture,

04:54.800 --> 05:01.920
the autistic population has really changed, and as autism has changed from being narrowly defined

05:01.920 --> 05:08.480
to much more broadly defined, it's also changed from being a rare condition to a common condition.

05:09.280 --> 05:15.760
So in the 1980s, we talked about between four and six in every 10,000 individuals meeting

05:15.760 --> 05:21.040
diagnostic criteria for autism, but today we talk about one percent of people, or maybe even two

05:21.040 --> 05:28.480
percent of people, and sometimes studies in the States saying even higher numbers. What happened

05:28.480 --> 05:36.080
between 1980s and today, well, one thing that happened was that in the mid-90s, a new diagnostic

05:36.080 --> 05:42.240
label, Asperger's Syndrome, was introduced, and it was introduced to capture people who didn't

05:42.240 --> 05:47.840
have a language delay or cognitive delay, but still had those social communication difficulties

05:47.840 --> 05:52.880
and the regional repetitive traits. And I think for the first time then in the 90s,

05:53.760 --> 06:00.000
if a parent had a child diagnosed with more classic or obvious autism, they might read around the

06:00.000 --> 06:05.120
topic and they might find descriptions of Asperger's Syndrome and think, ah, that might be me, or that

06:05.120 --> 06:10.880
might be my father, the grandfather of the child who's just had a diagnosis of autism. Before that,

06:10.880 --> 06:17.120
when the picture was very much about autism with language delay, with intellectual disability, parents

06:17.120 --> 06:23.280
weren't likely to read about autism and think that's me as well. So we see a big expansion there,

06:23.920 --> 06:29.840
but I also want to point out that there probably hasn't been a real increase in the rates of

06:29.840 --> 06:35.360
autism. We can't be sure because we can't go back retrospectively and apply our current diagnostic

06:35.360 --> 06:42.960
criteria. But what I've shown you on the slide is the smooth, smooth blue curve that is often used

06:42.960 --> 06:48.720
by autism charities and campaigners, particularly in the States, to say, look at this huge rise

06:48.720 --> 06:55.120
in the rates of autism, please give more resources, please give more intervention and support.

06:55.760 --> 07:06.320
But in set, I put the rates of autism in 2002 and in 2006 in different States in America.

07:06.880 --> 07:12.880
And remember that in America, the code, the diagnostic code you have on your health insurance

07:12.880 --> 07:18.240
claim determines how much money you get and what resources and services you get. And it happens

07:18.240 --> 07:24.320
that you get more for autism, thanks to the campaigning of hard-working advocates and parents,

07:24.320 --> 07:28.560
you get more for autism than for a diagnosis, for example, of intellectual disability.

07:29.280 --> 07:36.400
So the very different rates and the very different degrees of change in that inset bar graph

07:36.400 --> 07:42.080
in different States is unlikely to be telling us that actually in Arizona,

07:42.960 --> 07:49.760
there has, in 2006, there was a change in what was in the water so that more people were autistic.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.880
It's much more likely that services have changed, awareness has changed, provision has changed.

07:55.440 --> 08:00.400
And the other thing that helps us to understand the change in the rates of autism, apart from

08:00.400 --> 08:06.240
the broadening of the diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness and understanding

08:07.040 --> 08:11.920
is diagnostic substitution. So as the rates of autism have gone up, the rates of intellectual

08:11.920 --> 08:18.880
disability as a sole diagnosis have gone down. So I don't think there's a change in the numbers

08:18.880 --> 08:23.200
of people who are autistic, although I can't prove that, but there are lots of other possible

08:23.200 --> 08:32.400
explanations. So that's data from America, and we have that proviso about medical insurance records.

08:33.520 --> 08:39.600
Here's some recent data from the UK. And what I want to highlight are two things.

08:40.160 --> 08:46.400
First, note that these graphs show the percentage increase. It's not the numbers of people with

08:46.400 --> 08:52.800
autism diagnosis. It's the percentage increase over time. So if you start off with very, very

08:52.800 --> 08:59.280
few diagnoses in a particular age group or in, say, females versus males, you will get a big

08:59.280 --> 09:04.880
percentage increase, even if there are still fewer females being diagnosed than males, for example.

09:05.440 --> 09:11.520
But it's still informative, I think, because it shows that the big increase has been in first

09:11.600 --> 09:19.280
diagnosis in adulthood, over the age of 19, and in women and girls rather than in men and boys.

09:20.080 --> 09:26.400
And the authors of that work, Ginny Rossung and her collaborators at Exeter, conclude from those

09:26.400 --> 09:32.960
two facts that they don't think were over-diagnosing autism. Instead, were catching up on people who

09:32.960 --> 09:38.880
have historically been missed. And we'll come back to the catching up in older people a bit later.

09:42.240 --> 09:48.400
A third change in how we think about autism is from thinking about autism as mainly affecting

09:48.400 --> 09:55.520
boys and men to recognizing that autism is relevant for all genders. So in the 1980s,

09:55.520 --> 10:03.600
we estimated that perhaps five or 10 times as many males as females warranted an autism diagnosis.

10:04.480 --> 10:10.880
But most of that data was from clinical records or records of who was on the special educational

10:10.880 --> 10:18.000
needs registers. From those records, it looked as if fewer, many fewer girls and women were

10:18.000 --> 10:22.560
autistic compared to males. But when they were autistic, they were more likely to also have

10:22.560 --> 10:31.120
intellectual disability. Now, fast forward to the 2020s, and it seems from good meta-analytic

10:31.120 --> 10:39.280
studies that maybe the ratio is three times as many males to females. And that's taking data from

10:39.280 --> 10:44.560
really good epidemiological studies that have gone out into the community and ascertained who

10:44.560 --> 10:49.120
would get autism diagnosis rather than looking at the lists of the people we already know about.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.720
Because if we're missing women or girls, then the lists of people we already know about are not

10:54.720 --> 11:02.160
going to give us a fair estimate. So maybe three times more females than males. And in those

11:02.160 --> 11:08.080
population-based databases, it doesn't seem that women are necessarily more likely to have

11:08.080 --> 11:14.000
intellectual disability. The ratio of three to one seems to be true across the ability spectrum.

11:14.720 --> 11:21.200
So that suggests to me that we have been missing or misdiagnosing women and girls, and particularly

11:21.200 --> 11:28.480
those who are intellectually able. And when you make that comparison of five to one or 10 to one,

11:28.480 --> 11:33.200
when we used to talk about Asperger's syndrome, compared to three to one, I think we're missing

11:33.200 --> 11:38.720
or have historically missed a really large number of women and girls. I'm going to say a little bit

11:38.720 --> 11:45.360
about that. So is there evidence that we're missing or have historically missed women and girls on

11:45.360 --> 11:51.200
the autism spectrum? Well, we know that females are identified or diagnosed on average later than

11:51.200 --> 11:57.200
males. We know that a male and a female individual with the same level of autistic traits, the female

11:57.200 --> 12:03.600
is less likely to get diagnosed. So those are some reasons why we can think that we probably have

12:03.600 --> 12:10.800
missed them. And we then need to say why are we missing them? And I think a large part of this is

12:10.800 --> 12:18.080
that we all carry an unconscious bias and stereotype of autism as being male. Apart from anything else,

12:18.080 --> 12:22.640
most people will have met more autistic males than females, if only because of the historical

12:22.640 --> 12:29.440
underdiagnosis of women and girls. But I think we also carry a lot of unconscious stereotypes.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.560
So the picture here of the lined up cars, and then lined up cuddly toys, if you look at the

12:36.560 --> 12:42.640
lined up cars, you might well think, ah, yes, that's quite autistic, lining things up, enduring,

12:42.640 --> 12:48.000
repetitively lining things up, that could be a sign that this child has high autistic traits

12:48.880 --> 12:53.680
or warrants and autism diagnosis. But then you look at the cuddly toys lined up,

12:53.680 --> 12:59.360
and your first response might be quite different. It might be, ah, how sweet. Maybe she, making an

12:59.360 --> 13:03.840
assumption, maybe she's going to play school and pretend to teach them. And then that doesn't look

13:03.840 --> 13:09.040
autistic at all. But in fact, they're the same behaviors. We're just bringing a sort of gendered

13:09.120 --> 13:18.160
lens to them. And in the same way, we know that the kinds of obvious signs of autism that say

13:18.160 --> 13:24.400
primary school teachers might on average look for don't always work to pick up girls on the spectrum.

13:24.400 --> 13:30.640
So you might see a little boy who's autistic, who is quite obvious in the playground, because

13:30.640 --> 13:36.880
while the other boys are playing football, he's just walking the perimeter, pacing the perimeter.

13:36.880 --> 13:42.800
And a teacher will spot that. But a teacher might not spot a girl who is just on the edge of the

13:42.800 --> 13:47.920
social group of girls who are all chatting, who's laughing just a little bit after they're laughing

13:47.920 --> 13:53.440
or looking just a little bit out of place. So the manifestation of autism in girls may also

13:53.440 --> 13:58.880
sometimes look a bit different or not fit our stereotypes. So for example, many people might

13:58.880 --> 14:07.040
think that the autistic social style will be to be socially aloof. But in fact, many autistic girls

14:07.040 --> 14:13.600
and many autistic boys as well, are very, very attached to one person, to one child at school.

14:13.600 --> 14:18.720
In fact, I unusually clingy to them. But that doesn't always fit with our stereotype of autism.

14:21.040 --> 14:25.840
Another reason that we may be missing women and girls on the autism spectrum

14:25.840 --> 14:30.240
has to do with diagnostic overshadowing. And of course, this can happen also

14:30.240 --> 14:34.640
with boys and men, but particularly diagnostic overshadowing from

14:35.360 --> 14:42.480
pertinent diagnoses that are more gender sort of stereotyped. So eating disorders is a very good

14:42.480 --> 14:50.560
example. And from my colleagues at the IOPPN, we know that around 20 to 30% of women coming to

14:51.120 --> 15:00.640
services for anorexia will, if they're tested for autism, will pass the diagnostic threshold

15:00.640 --> 15:03.920
for an autism diagnosis, even though they've never had that diagnosis before.

15:05.040 --> 15:10.880
You have to be careful about making conclusions because we know that when you're at starvation

15:10.880 --> 15:17.120
weight, that affects your cognition, particularly your social cognition. But I think the evidence is

15:17.120 --> 15:22.960
amassing that when these young women reach a healthy weight, they still have the traits of

15:22.960 --> 15:29.040
autism that would probably be sufficient to have an autism diagnosis. So what's happened

15:29.040 --> 15:34.880
is that perhaps a clinician sees the eating disorder, but doesn't go further to ask,

15:34.880 --> 15:42.320
is this anorexia in the context of autism? And that really matters. My colleagues on the

15:42.320 --> 15:49.040
eating disorder ward told me about, they now have a wonderful pathway for autistic women

15:49.040 --> 15:53.920
and men if they have eating disorders too. But before that, when they were still learning,

15:53.920 --> 15:59.040
they told me about a woman on the ward who, unlike all the other anorexia patients who were

15:59.920 --> 16:07.600
very well turned out, always clean, hair always washed, she was quite disheveled and a bit chaotic.

16:08.560 --> 16:13.760
And nobody wanted to say anything because you don't make negative comments about how someone

16:13.760 --> 16:19.040
looks on an anorexia ward. But somebody talking to her thought, well, maybe this is not just

16:19.040 --> 16:26.720
anorexia, maybe this is autism. And they talked to her. And in fact, she wanted to be given a regime

16:26.720 --> 16:31.920
to have a shower every morning, to wash her hair every three days. She wanted a routine

16:31.920 --> 16:36.800
that was written down. And then she was very happy to stick to the routine. But without structure,

16:36.800 --> 16:45.040
she wasn't sure what to do to keep herself clean and well. And similarly, it turned out that her

16:45.040 --> 16:51.200
eating disorder wasn't at all to do with body image concerns. Instead, she wanted to keep her

16:51.200 --> 16:57.600
weight at a particular number, which happened to be a prime number. And it was about interest in

16:57.600 --> 17:02.080
that number and a need for control, which of course is often the case with many people with

17:02.080 --> 17:07.280
eating disorders. But she wanted to control this number. And when it was explained to her that

17:07.280 --> 17:11.680
she could aim for a different prime number that was in a healthy range of weight, she was quite

17:11.680 --> 17:16.480
happy with that, with some counseling around the fact that it's hard to guarantee that you will

17:16.480 --> 17:21.920
always be absolutely on a particular number. But a very different driver for eating disorder,

17:21.920 --> 17:26.080
so very important to know that this was autism as well as anorexia.

17:26.640 --> 17:34.320
And another reason why we might miss not only women and girls, but also some men and boys,

17:34.320 --> 17:40.480
has to do with what's been called camouflaging. So many autistic adults and some young people

17:40.480 --> 17:48.080
tell us that they work incredibly hard to fit into the neurotypical world, to pass as neurotypical,

17:48.720 --> 17:53.200
usually because they've been bullied or ostracized for their autistic behaviors.

17:53.200 --> 18:00.720
And they will say that, for example, they selected a girl in their class at school or

18:00.720 --> 18:05.760
a woman at work who seems to be socially successful and copy everything about her.

18:05.760 --> 18:11.040
Copy how she dresses, how she does her hair, maybe how she does her makeup, how she talks,

18:11.040 --> 18:17.920
what she talks about. Copy everything to put on a sort of suit of armor to go undiscovered

18:17.920 --> 18:23.040
and not bullied and maybe even accepted and talked to until you can get to that point

18:23.040 --> 18:29.280
to develop a friendship. So based on what autistic people have told us themselves,

18:29.280 --> 18:36.640
Laura Hull developed a short questionnaire to measure this sort of camouflaging. And it asks

18:36.640 --> 18:40.960
you things like, how much do you agree with the following statements? I learn how people use

18:40.960 --> 18:46.560
their bodies and faces to interact by watching TV or films. Or when I'm interacting with somebody,

18:46.640 --> 18:51.200
I deliberately copy their body language or facial expressions. And you can answer that you

18:51.200 --> 18:55.600
disagree or you agree a little or you agree fully and you get a camouflaging score.

18:58.080 --> 19:03.840
Now, camouflaging is important because we know that although it has some advantages that what

19:03.840 --> 19:10.480
autistic people tell us about, like, for example, being able to go to a job interview or striking

19:10.480 --> 19:14.960
up a conversation with somebody you'd like to be friends with, it also has significant costs.

19:15.920 --> 19:21.280
So this graph just shows you some of our work where we found that how much people say they

19:21.280 --> 19:27.840
camouflage is negatively correlated with self-reported quality of life. That's true for both males

19:27.840 --> 19:34.560
and females in this sample. And we also know that autistic people tell us that camouflaging is

19:34.560 --> 19:41.920
exhausting. And if you imagine trying to keep up a mask 24 hours a day or all day at school,

19:41.920 --> 19:47.280
it's no surprise that you come home and have a meltdown. And also that it erodes the sense of self.

19:47.920 --> 19:53.280
So an autistic 16-year-old that I was talking to was telling me about her mental health prices,

19:53.280 --> 19:57.280
which had landed her in hospital. And she talked to me about how when she came out,

19:57.280 --> 20:01.360
her friends had really rallied around her. And now she was talking, I was thinking,

20:01.360 --> 20:06.000
that's lovely, that's so nice. And then she said, but of course it's not me, their friends,

20:06.000 --> 20:12.400
were the tool. It's the mask I wear. And so all of that love and affection wasn't reaching her

20:12.400 --> 20:18.320
because she didn't feel that she was her authentic self with her friends. She felt that they were

20:18.320 --> 20:25.440
friends with the mask that she wore. And masking and camouflaging has really made me think very

20:25.440 --> 20:31.600
differently about the traditional route of social skills training that for so many years was

20:31.680 --> 20:36.160
absolutely what was assumed to be a good idea for say autistic teenagers.

20:36.160 --> 20:40.320
Do social skills groups tell them what they should be doing and what they're doing wrong?

20:40.320 --> 20:43.280
And if anyone wants to ask about that and do questions, I'm very happy to talk about it.

20:45.680 --> 20:53.840
Autism has also changed from being a childhood condition and really the preserve of child

20:53.840 --> 21:00.720
psychiatrists and pediatricians to being a lifespan condition. We know that people don't

21:00.720 --> 21:05.520
stop being autistic. They don't grow out of autism. Autism is inherent to how they see

21:05.520 --> 21:10.240
the world and how they process the world. And although, as for everyone, we change as we get

21:10.240 --> 21:18.160
older, most autistic people will live most of their lives as adults. And we know from a recent

21:18.160 --> 21:24.880
study of GP records that over the age of 50, nine out of 10 autistic adults are undiagnosed.

21:25.680 --> 21:31.280
So we really are missing and know very little about older age with autistic people.

21:34.320 --> 21:38.400
And it's important to know because we need to know whether the health needs, for example,

21:38.400 --> 21:46.080
will be different. The medical records in the States suggest that all sorts of physical illnesses

21:46.080 --> 21:52.880
are worse among those who have an autism diagnosis. Some of that may reflect

21:53.840 --> 21:59.360
lives that are hard, lives that are stressful. And we have one study where we looked in, again,

21:59.360 --> 22:06.320
a population-based cohort at pace of aging. And those individuals who had high autistic traits,

22:06.320 --> 22:11.200
we didn't require a diagnosis because we know over the age of 50 most people aren't diagnosed.

22:11.200 --> 22:19.120
But those with high autistic traits had a faster pace of biological aging as well as worse reported

22:19.200 --> 22:25.600
physical health. But a mediation analysis suggested it wasn't the autism that was responsible for

22:25.600 --> 22:32.800
that worse aging outcome, but instead it was the things in between. So social isolation,

22:33.360 --> 22:39.680
poor mental health and anxiety, poor sleep, and poor health behaviors, so not being able to have

22:39.680 --> 22:46.080
a healthy lifestyle, those were the things that led to that faster pace of aging. So there's nothing

22:46.080 --> 22:51.600
fatalistic about, as far as we know, to tell us that autistic people will have a less healthy old

22:51.600 --> 22:57.040
age. But we do know that autistic people, on average, have a less happy life, that's something we

22:57.040 --> 23:02.800
can all change, and a less happy life and being bullied, for example, is for all of us related

23:02.800 --> 23:12.960
to poorer mental and physical health. So autism has also changed from us thinking about it as

23:13.520 --> 23:19.920
categorically different from any other diagnosis and from neurotypical development,

23:20.640 --> 23:26.480
to having a much more dimensional approach. So in the old days it would have been, yes,

23:26.480 --> 23:32.000
you get the autism diagnosis, or no, you don't get the autism diagnosis. But people first became

23:32.000 --> 23:38.080
interested when it became clear from twin studies that autism was quite strongly genetic.

23:38.080 --> 23:44.480
People became interested in measuring what they called the broader autism phenotype in the relatives

23:44.480 --> 23:51.760
of diagnosed autistic children or adults, and looking for little signs, gray signs, of autistic

23:51.760 --> 23:58.720
traits in not diagnosed, not autistic relatives, to try and understand the family treats, try and

23:58.720 --> 24:06.160
understand the genetics. And once people started creating measures for autistic traits dimensionally,

24:07.040 --> 24:11.840
you could see that actually in the general population, at least at the behavioral level,

24:11.840 --> 24:16.800
were all somewhere on that continuum. So this is the autism spectrum quotient as perhaps the

24:16.800 --> 24:22.320
best known autism trait measure, which is also freely available and happens to be what nice

24:22.320 --> 24:26.880
recommend as a sort of first screener to know whether it's worth going further on a diagnostic

24:26.880 --> 24:31.920
journey. It's not without its critics, but these are some of the questions that you would be asked

24:31.920 --> 24:38.160
if you used it. You have to say to what extent you agree that I prefer to do things the same way

24:38.160 --> 24:43.520
over and over again. I often notice small sounds when others do not, or you prefer to do things

24:43.520 --> 24:48.800
with others rather than on your own. And that would be reverse scored, expecting that on average,

24:48.800 --> 24:52.400
more autistic people would say they prefer to do things on their own. Although I would

24:53.440 --> 24:58.720
really emphasize that and counter the myth that autistic people are not sociable. Many autistic

24:58.720 --> 25:05.600
people are highly sociable and many autistic people are absolute extroverts. And also take the

25:05.600 --> 25:11.040
opportunity to counter the myth that autistic people lack emotional empathy because there's

25:11.040 --> 25:17.680
absolutely no evidence for that. Autistic people are empathic with others. They may find it difficult

25:17.680 --> 25:23.200
to read somebody else's mind in the sense of knowing that somebody else might think something

25:23.200 --> 25:28.320
different, but they certainly care about other people's suffering and emotions and so on.

25:28.960 --> 25:34.160
So you can see that if you answer these sorts of trade questions, you get a distribution,

25:34.160 --> 25:40.320
and you can see here from collected studies, the distribution for males on average and females

25:40.320 --> 25:42.800
with the males on average scoring a bit higher.

25:46.800 --> 25:52.640
Now when we think about a dimensional approach to autism, sometimes including some autistic

25:52.640 --> 25:57.680
self-advocates will say, oh no, no, no, you can't be a bit autistic, just like you can't be a bit

25:57.680 --> 26:03.680
pregnant. So I think it depends on the level of analysis. So behaviorally, we've just seen,

26:03.680 --> 26:08.800
behaviorally, you can be a bit autistic. You can have a lot of autistic traits or very few

26:08.800 --> 26:14.720
autistic traits or anywhere in between. Of course, sometimes those measures at the behavioral level

26:14.720 --> 26:19.280
are not getting at qualitative differences. So if you were socially anxious, if you had

26:19.280 --> 26:27.200
social phobia, you might say you prefer things to do on your own. If you have OCD, you wouldn't

26:27.200 --> 26:30.480
say you prefer to repeat things over and over, but you might say you tend to repeat things over and

26:30.480 --> 26:36.560
over. So there are other ways you could score up on those behavioral items. If we think about the

26:36.560 --> 26:42.720
genetic level, you can certainly be a bit autistic. So what we know about the genetics of autism

26:43.840 --> 26:52.720
from twin studies is that the genetic influences on diagnosed autism are largely overlapping with

26:52.720 --> 27:02.240
the genetic influences on subclinical autistic traits. We also know that for most autistic people,

27:03.520 --> 27:10.240
the genetics of their autism is just like the genetics of their and our height. It's a product

27:10.240 --> 27:14.800
of hundreds and hundreds of common alleles, common genetic variants, which we all share,

27:15.520 --> 27:19.520
and some people have more of them and are taller or have more autistic traits,

27:19.520 --> 27:22.320
and some people have fewer of them or a different combination of them

27:22.320 --> 27:27.920
and are shorter or have fewer autistic traits. It's only in a very small minority of autistic

27:27.920 --> 27:33.520
people that a rare mutation that is qualitatively different from what all the rest of us have

27:34.320 --> 27:37.760
seems to be playing a large part in their autism, but for most people,

27:38.560 --> 27:43.360
genetics of autism, just like the genetics of height, and we know that from twin studies.

27:43.680 --> 27:52.320
Another way that autism has changed is from thinking of autism as one thing to thinking of

27:52.320 --> 27:59.440
autism as many things. So this is pictures meant to show apples and oranges and one speculation

27:59.440 --> 28:03.840
for why we've actually made rather little progress in understanding the biology of autism

28:04.720 --> 28:09.600
and to some extent the genetics of autism. One hypothesis is that we're mixing apples and oranges

28:09.600 --> 28:14.320
in our studies, that we've actually got a lot of different individuals who all come under this

28:14.320 --> 28:20.800
behavioral umbrella of autism, but have different etiological or biological underpinnings.

28:23.120 --> 28:28.880
So I told you about the genetics, which is again shown here, the very small part of the pie

28:28.880 --> 28:36.240
that is to do with mutations or de novo new events that are different from the general

28:36.240 --> 28:42.160
population and the large part of the pie, where it's just a matter of how many common variants

28:42.160 --> 28:49.760
you happen to have. People now talk sometimes not about autism, but the autisms to try to recognize

28:49.760 --> 28:55.120
that there may be this enormous biological, at least heterogeneity within the category that we

28:55.120 --> 29:03.520
call autism. Interestingly, despite the search for biomarkers and ways to stratify or cut up

29:03.520 --> 29:09.200
the big autism spectrum, to date there's been very little success and the only real distinction

29:09.200 --> 29:15.600
that carries weight in terms of prognosis, for example, is the difference between autism with

29:16.480 --> 29:22.560
intellectual disability, language difficulties and autism without intellectual disability. Those

29:22.560 --> 29:28.000
two seem to take rather different roads and relate rather differently to the genetic story.

29:28.720 --> 29:37.440
Autism, we can also think of as changing from one thing to many in a different sense. So before

29:37.440 --> 29:42.080
I was talking about taking the whole autism spectrum and saying that when you compare one

29:42.080 --> 29:48.240
autistic person to another, they may have very different biological underpinnings or etiologies,

29:48.240 --> 29:54.080
but now I want you to think about just one autistic person. And I want to suggest that in even one

29:54.320 --> 30:01.120
the origins of different characteristics that make up what we call autism may be very distinct.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.120
So traditionally we used to talk about the triad in autism, social differences, communication

30:07.120 --> 30:13.520
differences, rigid and repetitive behaviors. And we used to think of those as three sides of one

30:13.520 --> 30:20.640
thing that was autism. But while it's true that if you go into an autism clinic and you look at

30:20.640 --> 30:26.160
people who have the diagnosis, you will always find that they have all three parts. If you look

30:26.160 --> 30:32.560
in the general population, you'll find that actually those three parts pull apart in a lot of cases.

30:33.200 --> 30:38.080
And indeed in families too, in families where there's an autistic child, you'll quite often find

30:38.800 --> 30:45.280
that great grandfather was an engineer or a proofreader, had an amazing eye for detail,

30:45.280 --> 30:51.120
liked to eat the same lunch every day, was socially just fine. And then there's Aunt

30:51.120 --> 30:57.200
Sonso who was a bit of a hermit who had one or two close friends but really found social very

30:57.200 --> 31:03.200
difficult but wasn't particularly rigid otherwise. So you can see different parts of what's come

31:03.200 --> 31:08.080
together in the autistic child in different parts of the family tree. And in the same way,

31:08.080 --> 31:12.240
when we look at the general population and we were able to do this in the twins early development

31:12.240 --> 31:19.680
study, we found that while there were more than expected by chance, children who had all three

31:19.680 --> 31:25.680
difficulties or differences, there were lots of children who had only one. So there were around

31:25.680 --> 31:31.520
three percent of children who just had social difficulties as rated by their parents, three

31:31.520 --> 31:37.120
percent who had only communication difficulties, four percent who were a bit rigid. And these all

31:37.120 --> 31:43.840
defined as being in the top five percent compared to your peers. So the largest group are those who

31:43.840 --> 31:50.000
have just one area of difference or difficulty, even though when we look at autism, we see everything

31:50.000 --> 31:56.880
coming together. And so we've also found with twin work that these different parts of what we call

31:56.880 --> 32:04.240
autism actually have distinct genetic influences. So most of the genetic influence on social skills

32:04.240 --> 32:11.200
and difficulties is not overlapping with the genetic influences on how rigid or flexible you are.

32:13.440 --> 32:21.520
And one of the reasons that's helpful to know or propose the hypothesis is that historically we've

32:21.520 --> 32:27.920
tried to look for one explanation at the psychological level to understand all the different facets

32:28.480 --> 32:34.960
of how an autistic person understands the world. But I don't think we need to because if the different

32:34.960 --> 32:40.720
parts of autism have different origins genetically, then why can't the different facets of autism also

32:40.720 --> 32:45.920
have different origins in the processes of the mind? So very briefly, these are three

32:46.880 --> 32:51.680
different explanations for different parts of what we call autism, even in one person.

32:52.480 --> 32:58.640
And I'll just tell you very briefly about them in cases of interest. So the social differences in

32:58.640 --> 33:05.680
autism, which include not a lack of sociability, but a difficulty sometimes in knowing whether

33:05.680 --> 33:11.840
somebody, for example, is joking or lying or being sarcastic, in knowing how to strike up a

33:11.840 --> 33:16.080
friendship, how to say the right thing, how to not say the wrong thing, even if it happens to be the

33:16.080 --> 33:22.320
true thing, those social difficulties are well explained by a difficulty putting yourself in

33:22.320 --> 33:27.600
somebody else's shoes, a difficulty automatically tracking what somebody else is thinking and

33:27.600 --> 33:34.400
knowing. Because we've known for a long time that many autistic children neither tell lies nor

33:34.400 --> 33:40.400
understand that others might lie, but telling lies only makes sense if you know that something you

33:40.400 --> 33:47.280
know I might not know, or that you can make me think something that isn't true. But if you don't

33:47.280 --> 33:51.600
understand that minds have different thoughts, if you can't track what others are thinking,

33:51.600 --> 33:55.840
then that's not going to make sense. And that leaves some autistic people very vulnerable

33:57.200 --> 34:06.080
and also very honest, which of course can be a wonderful asset. Then we have on the more non-social

34:06.160 --> 34:12.160
side, we know that autism is characterized not only by some difficulties, but also by some assets.

34:12.720 --> 34:19.440
And one aspect of skill in autism is an amazing eye for detail, not every autistic person,

34:19.440 --> 34:23.920
but on average most autistic people have a better eye for detail than the rest of us.

34:24.640 --> 34:29.840
Sometimes that eye for detail makes it hard to get the big picture, to understand the gist,

34:30.720 --> 34:36.720
but still for example in this task which is the embedded figures test, where you have to find the

34:36.720 --> 34:43.920
simple shape hidden in the colored more complex shape. For most non-autistic people that's difficult

34:43.920 --> 34:49.760
because we see the colored shape as a gist out, we see it as a whole. But autistic people often

34:49.760 --> 34:56.640
describe seeing things as parts and therefore they can easily zoom in on and see where that simple

34:56.640 --> 35:03.280
shape will be. And then another aspect of autism seems to be around difficulty with planning and

35:03.280 --> 35:09.440
coping with change. And some of that might be about being very detailed, so even a small what is to

35:09.440 --> 35:14.880
us a small detail change really really matters if that's what you're zoomed in on. But some of it's

35:14.880 --> 35:21.680
also probably to do with what's called executive dysfunction or difficulty in those frontal lobe

35:21.680 --> 35:28.240
functions of planning, monitoring, being flexible in the face of change, dealing with novelty and so

35:28.240 --> 35:34.080
on. And that's often what holds some autistic people back. So working in a university environment,

35:34.720 --> 35:40.240
we have many many students who are autistic and very very smart, but sometimes they struggle when

35:40.240 --> 35:45.920
they come to university in organizing their lives. And it's the organization that really

35:46.480 --> 35:50.320
begins to be a problem for them and the coping with change, the coping with the fact that that

35:50.400 --> 35:54.640
lecture actually is happening somewhere different now and you weren't given any notice and that can

35:54.640 --> 36:02.560
just throw you completely. So another way in which autism has changed is from thinking of

36:02.560 --> 36:09.120
autism and studying autism in its pure form. So there was a fashion for saying well we must only

36:09.120 --> 36:14.080
study autistic people who don't have language problems, don't have intellectual disability,

36:14.080 --> 36:19.360
don't have mental health problems, because then we're studying pure autism. And recognizing now

36:19.360 --> 36:25.360
that pure autism is vanishingly rare and Christopher Gilbert tends to say that pure autism won't come

36:25.360 --> 36:32.880
to the clinic, because if autism is is the only issue or the only characteristic, it's not a

36:32.880 --> 36:38.560
problem. You can find your niche and you can live very well with just autism, but unfortunately

36:38.560 --> 36:43.680
just autism is very rare and most autistic people are battling with a lot of other things.

36:44.640 --> 36:49.120
And it's those other things that make life hard to live, not the autism. And those other

36:49.120 --> 36:54.960
things include epilepsy and intellectual disability, sleep problems. Sleep problems can be an absolute

36:54.960 --> 37:02.240
killer and yet relatively easily treated for many autistic people. Sensory sensitivities can be very,

37:02.240 --> 37:07.760
very difficult and that's one of the things in the workplace, thinking about that report today that

37:07.760 --> 37:15.840
where reasonable accommodations are needed. But anxiety and depression, very common ADHD, OCD,

37:15.840 --> 37:20.960
developmental coordination disorder or dyspraxia, those are all very common in autism and can make

37:20.960 --> 37:27.440
life difficult. And even more important for us to recognize, because that lies with society to

37:27.440 --> 37:34.320
address, stigma and bullying, being ostracized, being discriminated against, are all the things

37:34.320 --> 37:43.200
that make life hard for autistic people, not the autism. So we know that around 70 or 80 percent

37:43.200 --> 37:49.280
of children and adults on the autism spectrum will have a diagnosed mental health condition and many

37:49.280 --> 37:54.800
will have more than one, with anxiety and depression being among the highest. And we've learned in

37:54.800 --> 38:01.840
recent years tragically that suicide is elevated among autistic people, particularly among women

38:01.840 --> 38:04.960
on the autism spectrum and women who don't have an intellectual disability.

38:06.640 --> 38:11.120
This is from our longitudinal study in again the Twins Early Development study,

38:11.920 --> 38:18.160
where we asked parents about different sorts of difficulties, emotional, so that might be anxiety

38:18.160 --> 38:26.000
and depression, conduct problems, hyperactivity and we asked them at age four, seven and thirteen.

38:26.560 --> 38:33.200
And in these diagrams, each horizontal line is one child and if they're in the green, they're okay,

38:33.200 --> 38:37.680
they don't have problems in any of these areas and if they're in the orange, they've got at least one

38:37.760 --> 38:43.360
clinical level difficulty. And we have a comparison group drawn from Ted's where they don't have

38:43.360 --> 38:48.880
autism and you can see that most of those children are in the green at four, a few pick up some

38:48.880 --> 38:55.440
difficulties at seven, some drop difficulties and again by thirteen, most do not have any parent

38:55.440 --> 39:02.720
reported difficulties. And then you could look at the autism group and at four, about 50 percent

39:02.720 --> 39:07.920
already have difficulties in one of these areas and as you go to age seven, more pick them up,

39:07.920 --> 39:13.840
a few drop them but many more pick them up and again at age 13, so you can see the persistence.

39:14.480 --> 39:19.600
And below we've got the co-twins, now autism is highly genetic so many co-twins of autistic

39:19.600 --> 39:24.400
children are autistic themselves but some are not and when you look at the co-twins, you have a

39:24.400 --> 39:29.760
perfect control for the family environment for SES and those other kinds of things that of course

39:29.760 --> 39:35.920
we know affect children's well-being but here you can see that the non-autistic twins in those

39:35.920 --> 39:43.120
families where there's an autistic twin are in generally in the green. And this is some work

39:43.120 --> 39:50.640
by Dr Gavin Stewart who I have to also thank for co-authoring the text, the piece of writing which

39:50.640 --> 39:56.160
will be on the Gresham College website to accompany this lecture. And Gavin's been working very hard

39:56.160 --> 40:05.840
on aging and autism and he's worked with a long-term aging study which isn't about autism but is

40:05.840 --> 40:11.040
just about healthy aging. If you're over the age of 50, you can sign up for protect and every year

40:11.040 --> 40:16.240
you can do cognitive tasks and answer questions about your well-being. And because we know that

40:16.240 --> 40:20.960
most autistic people over the age of 50 are not diagnosed, we've given an autism trait measure

40:20.960 --> 40:27.360
and we look at those who have high autistic traits. And in this Venn diagram, the size of the

40:27.360 --> 40:33.680
circles shows the relative percentage of people being affected by sleep problems in yellow,

40:33.680 --> 40:40.560
by depression in blue, by anxiety in orange and the overlap between those. And you can see that

40:40.560 --> 40:45.760
sleep problems are much more of a problem for the high autism trait group compared to well-matched

40:45.840 --> 40:52.800
peers who aren't autistic and have low autistic traits. And the overlap of those sleep problems

40:52.800 --> 41:01.040
with mental health problems is very significant. And I want to tell you briefly about one particular

41:01.040 --> 41:05.600
area of mental health that we think is rather neglected for the autism spectrum and it's

41:05.600 --> 41:11.920
important to be thinking about. So with Freya Rumble who is a clinical psychologist, we've been

41:11.920 --> 41:17.600
speculating for some time now that autistic people might on average be more vulnerable to

41:17.600 --> 41:23.360
developing post-traumatic stress disorder. And this is because firstly, we know that autistic

41:23.360 --> 41:28.560
people experience more adverse life events than non-autistic people, bullying I've already mentioned,

41:28.560 --> 41:35.760
but also assault and other kinds of negative life events. We also know that autistic people process

41:35.760 --> 41:41.520
information differently with an eye for detail and one of the individual differences in the

41:41.520 --> 41:47.680
general population that tends to determine whether two individuals who've experienced a traumatic

41:47.680 --> 41:55.120
event, which one will go on to develop long-term PTSD symptoms and which one will not, one individual

41:55.120 --> 42:01.040
difference of relevance, is how well you can weave your experiences into a coherent story,

42:01.040 --> 42:07.280
a coherent narrative. And if you stay rather fragmented and detail focused, you're more likely

42:07.280 --> 42:13.280
to continue to have symptoms of PTSD. So that detail focus in autism might make them more

42:13.280 --> 42:19.760
vulnerable to develop PTSD symptoms. There are also aspects of sensory processing that are important

42:19.760 --> 42:27.360
in PTSD and I've mentioned sensory sensitivities in autism. And lastly, how you cope with the

42:28.160 --> 42:33.680
natural early stages of flashbacks and so on that maybe everyone would have after a traumatic event,

42:33.680 --> 42:39.360
whether you use an avoidant coping style or a more adaptive coping style also determines your

42:39.360 --> 42:44.480
likelihood of developing PTSD. And again, we thought that autistic people who sometimes show an

42:44.480 --> 42:51.840
avoidant coping style might be more vulnerable for that reason. So in one study which we did

42:51.840 --> 42:57.840
with autistic adults, we asked autistic adults to take part if they felt something had happened to

42:57.840 --> 43:04.720
them that was negative and that still remained with them, that they felt was a trauma. And in

43:04.720 --> 43:13.360
this particular study, we had 59 who took part and who reported to us a trauma of a traditional

43:13.360 --> 43:21.040
sort. And by that, I mean it would qualify for PTSD diagnosis in the American system, the DSM-5,

43:21.040 --> 43:27.200
where there's a very narrow definition of trauma and it has to involve either witnessing

43:27.200 --> 43:32.160
or being subject to something that is either a serious assault or threat to life.

43:33.360 --> 43:41.200
So you can see here that a large proportion of the blue slice of the pie are people reporting

43:41.200 --> 43:46.480
a physical assault, the orange slice of the pie, people reporting a sexual assault

43:47.360 --> 43:54.800
and other qualifying traumas. And we gave these individuals a trauma symptom checklist, a PTSD

43:54.800 --> 44:00.640
checklist. It's not the same as a diagnosis. This was done mainly during COVID, so it's done remotely,

44:00.640 --> 44:07.600
but it's a valid instrument to measure your symptoms of PTSD. And we found that 45% of

44:07.600 --> 44:14.240
those autistic adults reported symptoms that were in the clinical range. Now that's a really high

44:14.240 --> 44:19.920
percentage. In general population samples where they report having experienced a traumatic event

44:19.920 --> 44:27.760
like a physical assault, around 10% will go on to have persistent PTSD symptoms. So much, much

44:27.760 --> 44:33.840
higher percentage here for the autistic people. But the reason that I showed you a picture of a bus

44:33.840 --> 44:39.040
when I started talking about PTSD and autism is that one of the reasons I got interested in this

44:39.040 --> 44:46.400
area was an autistic man telling me about his experience of taking the bus to work every day.

44:47.040 --> 44:51.840
And then one day the bus having to take a detour because of roadworks and him having to get off

44:51.840 --> 44:56.400
the bus in the middle of nowhere. He didn't know whether it was a safe area of London or not. He

44:56.400 --> 45:03.760
didn't know how he was going to get to work. And he was absolutely frightened and distraught. And

45:03.760 --> 45:08.560
after that, not only would he not take that bus to work, he wouldn't take any bus anywhere. And

45:08.560 --> 45:14.000
when he walked past his usual bus stop, he would start re-experiencing that fear and have flashbacks

45:14.000 --> 45:22.400
of that event. Now a bus detour would not count in DSM-5 as a trauma, but I think it was clear that

45:22.400 --> 45:29.680
this man was experiencing trauma related mental health problems. So we were particularly interested

45:29.680 --> 45:36.080
in looking at whether autistic people are not only more vulnerable to PTSD, but also develop those

45:36.080 --> 45:43.440
symptoms following unusual events that most people might not find traumatic. And so this graph,

45:43.440 --> 45:50.880
this pie chart now shows you for the 59 autistic adults who told us about a trauma that wouldn't

45:50.880 --> 46:02.800
fit DSM-5. So the large blue segment is bereavement. The yellow segment is bullying. And there's a

46:02.800 --> 46:08.400
grey segment which is difficult social situations, having very negative experiences in social

46:08.400 --> 46:17.440
situations. And the orange segment after the blue is their own mental health crises. And of these

46:17.440 --> 46:25.280
people, again, 43% had symptoms of PTSD past threshold. So it doesn't seem to matter whether

46:25.280 --> 46:33.360
what you've experienced is objectively life-threatening. If for you it's traumatic,

46:33.360 --> 46:38.000
then for autistic people the rate of PTSD symptoms seems to be alarmingly high.

46:40.080 --> 46:46.080
And one more point on autism and mental health before I go to the final change in the concept of

46:46.080 --> 46:56.640
autism. So this is data from Miriam Martini working in Stockholm using population registers.

46:56.640 --> 47:04.320
And this is data from young people between the ages of 16 and 25, information about psychiatric

47:04.320 --> 47:13.760
hospitalization. And the bars are closest to me. The dark bar is autistic boys and young men,

47:13.760 --> 47:19.040
then autistic girls and young women, and then their neurotypical peers, male and female.

47:20.160 --> 47:26.800
And you can see the alarmingly high rates of psychiatric hospitalization. And Miriam writes

47:26.800 --> 47:35.920
in the paper, by as young as age 25 years, 22% of autistic females and almost 11% of autistic males

47:35.920 --> 47:40.560
compared to less than 4% of their neurotypical peers had been hospitalized for psychiatric

47:40.560 --> 47:49.520
difficulties. So really serious level of mental health burden. So the final change from our

47:49.520 --> 47:55.760
understanding of autism is from thinking of autism as a disorder, from very much a medical model

47:55.760 --> 48:01.200
where we would think about, well, what's wrong with the child? Why does the child not understand

48:01.200 --> 48:07.840
the social world? To the neurodiversity lens, to a more social model where we understand that

48:07.840 --> 48:13.440
the difficulties in autism come about from a mismatch between the autistic way of understanding

48:13.440 --> 48:22.720
the world and the neurotypical designed environment and expectations. And so instead of the rhetoric

48:22.720 --> 48:27.520
of the past and still sometimes in the states or other countries, how would you save your son from

48:27.520 --> 48:34.240
autism? Instead, we would have a much more neurodiversity lens. And like these autism

48:34.960 --> 48:41.040
self-advocates insist that to talk about curing autism would be as inappropriate now as it was

48:41.040 --> 48:46.640
inappropriate when psychiatrists used to talk about curing homosexuality, for example, that

48:46.640 --> 48:52.800
autism is a different way of being in the world, is a neurodivergent condition in the sense that it

48:52.800 --> 49:00.480
diverges from the average but is just as valuable and just as valid a way of being and encouraging

49:00.480 --> 49:06.640
that some employers, as we were hearing about in the news today, are specifically employing

49:06.640 --> 49:11.680
autistic people for the many strengths they have, including integrity and a sense of justice and

49:11.680 --> 49:20.560
eye for detail, persistence in a task and so on. And this is just to highlight some work by a colleague,

49:20.560 --> 49:27.600
Dr. Rebecca Wood, looking at what an inclusive school really means. And for her, that means

49:27.600 --> 49:33.760
that it accepts the neurodivergence of the teachers and the other school staff. So most of us would

49:33.760 --> 49:39.840
think is a school inclusive? Does it have a good attitude towards children, pupils who are autistic,

49:39.840 --> 49:44.880
have ADHD, have dyslexia? But what about the teachers? If the teachers don't feel comfortable

49:44.880 --> 49:50.080
to disclose their diagnosis, then it's not an inclusive school. And of course, there are now

49:50.080 --> 49:55.600
similar projects for autistic police workforce, autistic doctors and so on.

49:57.600 --> 50:04.560
So to conclude, autism has changed from narrow to wide with a rise in the diagnoses,

50:04.560 --> 50:09.920
from rare to common, although still underdiagnosed in some groups, from childhood to lifespan,

50:09.920 --> 50:15.600
with much more research needed on aging, from discrete to dimensional and from one thing to many,

50:16.240 --> 50:22.080
from pure to complex, with a real emphasis now on understanding and improving mental health for

50:22.080 --> 50:28.240
autistic people. And from disorder to a difference, the challenge now is to hear all voices. The

50:28.240 --> 50:33.200
autistic voice is coming into research, but how do we hear the autistic voice from people who have

50:33.200 --> 50:38.480
intellectual disability, as well as being autistic, for example. And really fascinating to think,

50:38.480 --> 50:43.040
looking forward, what are the implications for the future of autism research and improving the

50:43.040 --> 50:58.720
lives of autistic people? Thank you very much. Thank you very much Francesca, that was just

50:58.720 --> 51:05.040
stunning. Unsurprisingly, we have an awful lot of questions, so I'm going to try and

51:05.680 --> 51:10.720
group one or two of them together. There are so many questions, in fact, that we're definitely not

51:10.800 --> 51:15.440
going to be able to cover them today, so I will probably approach you and see if we can

51:15.440 --> 51:19.760
perhaps do what we do sometimes and have a follow-up podcast where we can discuss

51:19.760 --> 51:25.280
the questions which we've not been able to get through. There seems to be a strong correlation

51:25.280 --> 51:31.200
between those who identify as trans or non-binary and who are also autism.

51:31.200 --> 51:35.520
Have you any thoughts of why that might be so? So it's certainly true that among autistic people

51:35.520 --> 51:42.240
there are many more who identify with some gender identity other than the traditional binary,

51:43.360 --> 51:48.800
and there seem to be more people who are trans, well, and vice versa. We don't really know why.

51:48.800 --> 51:53.600
There's research going on in that area. There are, you could imagine, lots of theories at

51:53.600 --> 51:59.040
different levels, so some would say it's a sort of sociological theory that autistic people are

51:59.040 --> 52:05.040
less conformist and more able to be themselves. And then there are people like Simon Baron Cohen,

52:05.040 --> 52:09.600
who are interested in sex hormones and might have a biological explanation, and I think at the

52:09.600 --> 52:14.960
moment we don't know, but it's now a hot topic, yes. Okay, there are two which are slightly

52:14.960 --> 52:23.680
overlap. One is about the way in which the media generate stereotypical perceptions of autism.

52:23.680 --> 52:27.760
One particular question about, do you think shows like Love on the Spectrum are

52:27.760 --> 52:32.560
indirectly fueling that stereotype, and how might we as society respond to that?

52:33.440 --> 52:38.320
So I haven't seen that particular show, but I know that obviously autism is all over the media.

52:40.480 --> 52:46.640
It is very difficult. I mean, one of the things that we need to be aware of is that

52:48.000 --> 52:53.120
research is neglecting that part of the autism spectrum that has intellectual disability,

52:53.120 --> 52:59.920
and there's a danger that we also neglect them when we have shows or documentaries

52:59.920 --> 53:04.720
about autism, because it's easier to talk to a autistic person who can talk back,

53:04.720 --> 53:09.520
but that doesn't capture the experiences of everybody. And I think that some parents of

53:09.520 --> 53:15.520
children who have very high support needs and on the autism spectrum feel quite worried or upset

53:15.520 --> 53:22.400
when maybe a celebrity has their adult diagnoses, and they want to say, well, but my child's

53:22.400 --> 53:28.000
autism is not like your autism. Their challenge is not like your challenges. So I think it's really

53:28.000 --> 53:32.560
about trying to get all voices heard. I mean, clearly there's some TV programs, including

53:32.560 --> 53:38.160
about neurotypical people that are exploitative. And certainly any program I've been involved with,

53:38.160 --> 53:43.840
it's very, very important that autistic or national autistic society, people who have

53:43.840 --> 53:48.560
autistic people's welfare at heart are involved in making sure that that participants really

53:48.560 --> 53:53.760
know what they're participating in, for example. So it's clearly somebody from an academic

53:53.840 --> 53:58.720
background is saying, okay, you've now got a grant of several million pounds,

53:58.720 --> 54:04.960
where are you going to put your money? What would be your next big area of this really large number

54:04.960 --> 54:09.680
of overlapping Venn diagrams, where you think the biggest return on investment might be?

54:09.680 --> 54:14.160
Yes, it's a really hard question. And sadly, I haven't had that problem of being given that

54:14.160 --> 54:19.200
large amount of money. But I mean, I think the one really interesting area that's been

54:19.200 --> 54:24.080
under-recognized are motor difficulties in autism. And that's not just sort of

54:24.080 --> 54:28.640
clumsiness or developmental coordination disorder, but some autistic people will describe that when

54:28.640 --> 54:33.760
they have a sort of shutdown, which can be something like autistic burnout from exhaustion of coping

54:33.760 --> 54:40.560
in a neurotypical world, or can be a more short lived sort of shutdown meltdown, that they lose

54:40.560 --> 54:47.040
volition, they can't act, they can't speak. And there's also very interesting but very little

54:47.040 --> 54:52.800
research on catatonia sort of freezing among autistic people. And I think that's been really

54:52.800 --> 54:58.160
under-researched. So we've woken up to sensory a bit, although there's still lots more research

54:58.160 --> 55:02.960
needed there. But I think the motor part of the puzzle and in relation to that kind of

55:02.960 --> 55:07.760
freedom of will and volition, I think that is a fascinating future area.

55:08.640 --> 55:15.920
There's a growing number of people asking about an American charity like Autism Speaks,

55:16.720 --> 55:21.840
who are pushing the concept of cure in autism still, even after all of this was.

55:22.560 --> 55:26.880
How do you feel about that and do you think it requires challenge?

55:27.840 --> 55:35.600
So many years ago, the founder, one of the founders of Autism Speaks, who was a grandfather of

55:35.600 --> 55:43.360
autistic young boy with high support needs, came to London and gave a talk where he talked about

55:43.360 --> 55:50.800
defeating autism like he had defeated cancer. And that's clearly not acceptable in our views of

55:50.800 --> 55:57.040
autism and in our genuine acceptance of neurodivergence. Autism is not a cancer and autism isn't

55:57.040 --> 56:03.440
something you have, autism is how you are. And that's just a valid way to be as anything else.

56:03.440 --> 56:08.960
So we certainly don't talk about curing autism. We talk about curing anxiety, curing depression,

56:09.040 --> 56:13.280
curing epilepsy, curing gut problems, curing sleep problems. All of these things would

56:13.280 --> 56:17.440
transform the lives of autistic people, but we have no desire to change the autism.

56:18.640 --> 56:27.200
Often for parents, when they are sympathetic to the idea of a cure, it's because their child has

56:27.200 --> 56:32.000
intellectual disability, maybe self-induced behavior, maybe a lot of other things. It's not

56:32.000 --> 56:36.080
the autism that's making their life hard, I would say. It's those other things and we should look

56:36.080 --> 56:41.280
for ways to help with other things. Thank you so much. It was fascinating in every respect.

56:42.160 --> 56:48.960
But given you've described so many different behaviors and a spectrum and autistic traits,

56:50.160 --> 56:58.080
you're talking about such diversity. I wonder how easy or difficult it is to make a diagnosis

56:58.080 --> 57:04.000
and what the procedure would be to diagnose. It's a really interesting question and it goes

57:04.000 --> 57:10.000
in some sense to the heart of the complexity of autism. So on the one hand, autism can be

57:11.440 --> 57:17.280
one of the diagnoses where clinicians have the greatest agreement and people will talk

57:17.280 --> 57:22.080
slightly flippantly about the receptionist who works in the diagnostic clinic being able to

57:22.080 --> 57:26.240
diagnose somebody as they come through the door by how they're walking and how they greet them.

57:26.240 --> 57:33.840
Because autism in its most prototypical form is very, very recognizable. What's difficult is that

57:34.080 --> 57:39.760
when you then have overlays of camouflaging and learned behaviors, or when you have a lot of

57:39.760 --> 57:43.520
intellectual disabilities so that the range of behaviors you can see is not very great,

57:44.880 --> 57:49.200
or when you have additional complexities, so you have autism and a lot of mental health

57:49.200 --> 57:55.680
difficulties, then it can be more difficult to distinguish. Absolutely, there's a lot of heterogeneity

57:55.680 --> 58:00.880
within the spectrum. That's definitely true. But also remember that it can be that you start

58:01.680 --> 58:08.240
with the same four-year-old who doesn't have much language, is a bit aloof,

58:08.800 --> 58:14.800
repetitively lining up toys, grows up to be the math professor who has a lot of language,

58:14.800 --> 58:20.000
who has a lot of friends, but he tends to monologue about his own special interests as I'm doing now.

58:20.960 --> 58:24.960
And the same person can transition through different parts of the spectrum.

58:25.520 --> 58:31.200
So, in that sense, we can say, yes, they're all part of the same thing, if that makes sense.

58:32.880 --> 58:39.680
I have a grandson who is severely autistic. He's 19 now and has no speech. He's in the

58:39.680 --> 58:45.920
States. And one of the procedures that he's been through is something called, I think it's Applied

58:45.920 --> 58:53.360
Behavioral Analysis, if that makes sense. Yes. But it's had, I think, relatively little effect

58:54.240 --> 59:02.080
on his behavior. And the other thing that is perhaps interesting is that recently he had

59:02.080 --> 59:08.480
some wisdom teeth removed under anesthetic. And because it's difficult to communicate with him

59:08.480 --> 59:14.880
and tell him not to do things, he severely bit his lip because it was anesthetized, of course,

59:14.880 --> 59:21.680
and nearly went into plastic surgery. Would you have any comments on this sort of thing?

59:22.240 --> 59:27.040
Yes, so that's very difficult, isn't it? And I mean, communication is, without communication,

59:27.040 --> 59:33.760
life is so very, very difficult. So, Applied Behavioral Analysis, ABA, for those in the

59:33.760 --> 59:39.280
audience who might not be familiar with it, grew out of the sort of behaviorist tradition of

59:40.080 --> 59:48.000
response and punishment to train an animal. So, it was used with the best intentions to help a

59:48.000 --> 59:52.480
child who maybe was just running around the room to settle at a table to begin to be able to learn

59:52.480 --> 59:58.240
something. So, the sitting at the table would be rewarded maybe with a suite. And then other

59:58.240 --> 01:00:02.560
behaviors would also be rewarded. And in the old days, negative behaviors would be punished.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:09.520
That doesn't happen anymore. But there is a large body of thought, particularly in this country,

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:16.560
and particularly among autistic self-advocates, that ABA is not respectful, that it looks too

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.640
much like the training of an animal, and it doesn't give people on the autism spectrum

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:26.720
a choice in a sense about their behaviors. I do know parents where their child was

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.040
just so much all around the room that they needed to find some way that they would sit

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.080
long enough to learn something. And to be fair, most parents bribe their children at some point.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:42.560
But I think the level of mechanical teaching makes people feel uncomfortable. And some autistic

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.040
people have said that they felt they felt damaged by that process. But it is very hard to know how

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:55.680
best to try and reach a child who has very, very high support needs. I think that there are more

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.600
available alternative communication devices now with iPads and things. There are more ways that you

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:08.240
can let a child unlock communication of some sort. And that's so important for the reasons

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.400
that you've highlighted that we need to be able to tell people what's going to happen and them

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.520
to tell us what's going on with them. And I would just take the opportunity to say,

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.920
I'm sure it may not be relevant to your grandson, but for anybody else who has a child of whatever

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:30.160
age, with very little language, if their behavior changes suddenly, if they seem very distressed

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.800
or violent or self-injurious, please check that they're not in pain. Because we've only recently

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:43.200
begun to realize that often that's a symptom of pain. And because the autistic person can't tell us

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:49.600
that, for example, they have absolutely crippling constipation, they will express it in some other

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.640
way. And that might be by lashing out or it might be by crying or it might be by biting themselves.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.920
So don't forget about pain if somebody's behavior changes when they haven't got any other way of

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.720
telling you. But thank you very much for the example. I'm going to take just two more questions so

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.520
that we can be quite your next. Hello. Firstly, thank you so, so very much. This is a wonderful,

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.840
wonderful talk. I was wondering, on one of the slides, you briefly talked about Asperger's

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.640
becoming something in the 90s. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that's

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.680
developed from perhaps where that came from and how that's seen now in, you know, you're speaking

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.200
about this wide spectrum. How is Asperger's now viewed in the wider spectrum? I personally,

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.960
that was the diagnosis that I had and I know that I've had trouble communicating that with

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:41.200
other people, that that's not something that's necessarily inappropriate way to do it. So I'm

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:48.000
wondering how maybe in studies and clinicians are able to communicate that in different ways

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.480
and maybe how that also specifically applies to women and girls and different, you know,

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.320
more female concepts of special interests and how that translates together. Sorry,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.600
does that make sense? Yes. So I'll try and give a short answer to capture some of those things.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:09.520
So, so Asperger's was introduced as a sort of experimental diagnosis because historically

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.800
autism was so much associated with language problems and language delay or even lack of language.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:19.040
So when there were some children who didn't seem to have any language delay and yet had all the

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:23.520
other characteristics or autism, people at the time felt we've got to study this. Maybe it's a

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.440
whole different group. The research that happened after that suggested that it wasn't a whole different

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.880
group. It was part of the autism spectrum and not different from autistic people who maybe had a

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.520
bit of language delay but had good verbal intelligence later on. So, so in the latest

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.320
diagnostic system it's folded into this bigger category of autism spectrum disorder with the

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.440
expectation that anybody who had an Asperger diagnosis would simply be included in autism

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.960
spectrum disorder not have to go and get a new diagnosis. The other piece of the puzzle is that

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:04.800
Hans Asperger who of course was working in Nazi dominated Vienna who wasn't a member of the Nazi

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:10.400
party unlike all the rest of his department but has it there has been a question over whether he

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:18.880
was saving children or whether he was colluding with a process of eugenesis for for a handicapped

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.680
children perceived to be handicapped at the time. So that's another reason why people are not so

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.320
keen on naming a syndrome after him anymore although I think the full story of his involvement

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:36.320
is yet to be uncovered. I just wanted to know in your estimation to what extent do modern lifestyles

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.280
for example our largely sugar-based diets and our intent tendency to spend a lot more time online

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:52.720
impact on autistic people because I've definitely found the the online aspect a lot of autistic

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:58.320
people spend a lot of time online and this kind of exacerbates our difficulties with your

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.680
communication and socialising so just how does that how do how do these things impact in your

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.560
estimation on lives of autistic people? Thank you it's an interesting question so just I know it's

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.120
not your question but just to clarify I don't think that screen time could ever make somebody

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:19.920
autistic nor could diet but your question isn't that I know your question is for autistic people

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.480
is the increase in screen time and so on more problematic I think I don't think we have the

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:30.000
research to know the research that's being done suggests that autistic people use the

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.560
electronic media and so on in the same way for the same purposes enjoyment and so on as non-autistic

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:42.480
people and it was interesting talking to my autistic students under lockdown some of whom said

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.040
they much preferred meeting online it was much less stressful and they could control their environment

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:53.840
whether as you say when you then have to do more face-to-face time it has it become more difficult

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.480
that's something I think we still need to study but there's certainly lots and lots of benefits

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.920
to the digital world for autistic people one of the things I often think about is

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.320
autistic people often are very really good at understanding how systems work in the old days

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:15.600
if you were to be an engineer you had to be physically adroit then that was out of reach

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:21.600
but now when you can understand a system and do it all on screen wonderfully you've unlocked

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.040
a beautiful mind that was perhaps had clumsy hands so I think there are lots and lots of

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.800
advantages but you're right we should be careful about the downsides for everyone

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.680
well it's it's been a privilege being exposed to a beautiful mind I think it was an absolute

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.160
delight to hear you talk it was a wonderful lecture thank you very much please join me in thanking

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:48.320
Thank you
