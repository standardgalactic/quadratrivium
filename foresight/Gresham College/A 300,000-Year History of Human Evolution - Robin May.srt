14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Felly, we are in ourselves a very brief moment in history and so actually 300,000 years for us feels like a long time even if in planetary terms it's the blink of an eye.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:52,920
So the question is, with that very brief slice of time, can we learn anything useful about human evolution by looking at that and what it might mean for our understanding of who we are today?

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,920
The Gresham College lecture that you're listening to right now is giving you knowledge and insight from one of the world's leading academic experts.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Making it takes a lot of time, but because we want to encourage a love of learning, we think it's well worth it.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,920
We never make you pay for lectures, although donations are needed. All we ask in return is this.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Send a link to this lecture to someone you think would benefit, and if you haven't already, click the follow or subscribe button from wherever you're listening right now.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Now, let's get back to the lecture.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,920
When we think about evolution, there's a kind of straightforward and simple rule really, which is that evolution is basically about reproduction.

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Stuff that has an impact on your reproduction and most importantly on your offspring's reproduction is really important for evolution and stuff that doesn't is completely irrelevant.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,920
So if I look around this hall, for example, there are some people here who are going to be massively shaped by evolution because they're at the start of their potential reproductive journey.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,920
They may have children, they may not have children, they may have grandchildren, but all of those things are still for play for.

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,920
If you're like me pushing the wrong end of your reproductive life, you're becoming significantly less and less important in terms of evolution.

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,920
And of course, once you've reproduced and you're post reproductive, anything or nothing that happens to you is invisible to evolution.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,920
And that's an important point. I'm laboring that point because we often ask questions about why do we have this disease?

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
Why is this problem come up now?

29
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
And quite often the answer to that question is because evolution doesn't care.

30
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
It's irrelevant because it has no direct impact on reproduction.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:41,920
So broadly speaking, evolution boils down to the question of how many offspring do you have and how many of those offspring go on to have offspring themselves.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
And so you can compare that. This is an example from the British Royal Family, for example.

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
So here is Queen Victoria surrounded by a couple of generations of her family.

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,920
She was very evolutionary successful, right?

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
There are a lot of offspring here.

36
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,920
And actually, if you're a kind of budding historian and you look at the royal families of Europe,

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,920
you can see a sort of genetic legacy of Queen Victoria right across Europe.

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
That, in evolutionary terms, is very successful.

39
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Not so great over here.

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,920
This is William and Mary from the Glorious Revolution.

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
No children of their own.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,920
And in fact, Mary's sister Anne, who didn't have no children either.

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,920
And of course, this is why the throne changed hands.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,920
So evolutionarily speaking, that lineage essentially went extinct.

45
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Why am I putting out pictures of kings and queens here?

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
The point about this is that if we're measuring evolution and measuring impacts,

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,920
the really important thing to measure are these things here, the kids,

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
and their children, and so on and so forth.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,920
And we need to think about that in terms of features, behaviours,

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,920
things that change the survival or reproduction of our children.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,920
So it all ultimately boils down to babies.

52
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,920
A slightly still cute one here.

53
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
She's not so cute anymore.

54
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,920
She probably would be very happy about this baby photo of my teenage daughter being on the screen,

55
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,920
but never mind when it gets taken down on YouTube,

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,920
even though she's filed an official complaint.

57
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,920
So it's all about the survival and reproduction of babies.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,920
And so if we think about evolution, the strongest forces in shaping all evolution,

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,920
but in particular human evolution, are those that impact on infant survival

60
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,920
and ultimately on their reproductive success.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,920
So if we look, for example, at this data from the WHO from a few years ago now,

62
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
this is a pretty grim slide.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,920
This is a slide of what means that babies don't survive, infant mortality under five,

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
the leading cause.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
And if you look at that data, first of all, foremost,

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,920
I think it's important to say this is actually a tragic indictment of where we are today

67
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,920
because many, many, many of these things are preventable

68
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,920
and should not be causing infant mortality,

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,920
wherever they are, because of inequality and poverty and all the other things that go with it.

70
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,920
That notwithstanding, in evolutionary terms, if we look at these leading causes of death,

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,920
the majority of them are infectious diseases.

72
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
So at a first approximation, your biggest risk,

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,920
if you're a newborn human infant on planet Earth,

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
is something that will infect you early on.

75
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
And if it infects you and it kills you, that's it,

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
you're removed from the gene pool, your evolution.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,920
Re-contribution has finished.

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,920
So we might expect, then, that if we're looking for evidence of what has shaped human evolution,

79
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,920
that these infectious forces will be the place where we are most likely to find that evidence.

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,920
And to a first approximation, then, infection is a big evolutionary problem,

81
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,920
and things that overcome infection are big evolutionary successes.

82
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,920
So can we learn about those processes over the last 300,000 years

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
by looking at human evolution?

84
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,920
And to quickly recap, for those of you who didn't see the previous lecture,

85
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,920
and with the caveat that these dates change all the time,

86
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
this is an incredibly fast-moving field.

87
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,920
People discover new fossils, new DNA all the time.

88
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
So with the caveat that this is probably wrong already,

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,920
and definitely will be by the time I finish this lecture,

90
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,920
this, roughly speaking, is how we think of the evolution of our own species, Homo sapiens.

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,920
So you roll the clock back, say, 600,000 years.

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,920
This hominin species Homo heidelbergensis is roaming Africa.

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,920
It spreads out from Africa to Europe, where it evolves into the species we know of as Neanderthals.

94
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,920
It migrates across to Asia and becomes this enigmatic species

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
about which we know very little other than their DNA sequence

96
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
and a few tiny fossils called the Denisavans.

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,920
And then subsequently, about 300,000 years ago,

98
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,920
that species that has remained in Africa has evolved again

99
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
into what we would call anatomically modern humans,

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,920
migrate out of Europe again and meet all these other species around the world

101
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,920
and go on to populate the entire planet as we know it today.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,920
And this graph, which I showed last time, lifted from the Natural History Museum,

103
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
shows us up here, Homo sapiens at the top corner,

104
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,920
and the fact that we now know that up until about 50,000 years ago,

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,920
we shared at least parts of the planet with these other species,

106
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
certainly the Denisavans and the Neanderthals,

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,920
and who knows possibly other species too.

108
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,920
So the key and important fact about this is that we have a species,

109
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,920
anatomically modern humans that evolved in Africa, that migrated out,

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,920
they came into Europe, and we have this delightful phrase that geneticists like to use,

111
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,920
admixture, which basically means mating with other people.

112
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,920
And so admixture occurred, mating occurred between these ancient,

113
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,920
but modern anatomically Homo sapiens and Neanderthals in Europe,

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,920
and then again with this group called the Denisavans over in Asia.

115
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,920
And so modern humans are this blend of these hybrid existences,

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,920
and you can find out much more about that from various sources online if you want.

117
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Why am I telling you about this? I'm telling you about this

118
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,920
because this gives us a powerful tool to understand much more

119
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,920
about how evolution has shaped modern humans.

120
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Because we can look at these hybridisation events,

121
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,920
or these ancient matings between Homo sapiens and other species,

122
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
and we can look at the exchange of genes,

123
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,920
and we can ask which of those genes have had an evolutionary consequence for us as a species.

124
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,920
And what does it tell us about the last 50,000 years?

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
So let me explain what I mean by that.

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,920
So here we have this ancient mating event, and this is a PG lecture,

127
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
so I'm going to show skeletons.

128
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,920
So here we have Homo sapiens skeleton,

129
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,920
and on the other side we have Neanderthal skeleton, very similar,

130
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
bit stockier, more chunky, various anatomical differences

131
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,920
that mean you can distinguish it but broadly speaking similar.

132
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,920
When any two organisms mate, and hopefully you might remember this from your school biology lessons,

133
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,920
each of us carries two copies of each of our chromosomes.

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,920
One inherited from our mum, and one from our dad.

135
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
When you produce sperm and eggs, they separate,

136
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,920
each sperm or egg getting one or the other.

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
And then when you mate with somebody else,

138
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
one of theirs comes together with one of yours,

139
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
and you get a new combination.

140
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Hopefully that's not news to anybody listening to this.

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
When this ancient Neanderthal and Homo sapiens mate,

142
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
exactly the same process happened.

143
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,920
So one Homo sapiens chromosome was in a sperm or an egg,

144
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,920
they mate it with this Neanderthal,

145
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,920
one of their chromosomes came together,

146
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,920
and you end up with this two, one from each parent, just like anybody else.

147
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,920
The offspring of any mating, that includes all of us in the room and all those listening,

148
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
so you have two chromosomes.

149
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,920
When you produce your own sperm and eggs,

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
those two chromosomes that you've got, one from mum and one from dad,

151
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
do a process called crossing over.

152
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,920
So before you produce sperm or eggs, they come together,

153
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
and they exchange bits of DNA between each other.

154
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,920
And so what you end up with when you produce, for example, an egg cell,

155
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,920
is not a cell that has just your mum's chromosome or just your dad's,

156
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
but they have a chromosome that has, for example, been inherited from your dad,

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
but with bits of your mum's or vice versa.

158
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,920
And this is one of the processes by which we get variation,

159
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
and this is why we don't all look like an exact clone of our grandmother or grandfather,

160
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,920
even though you've got part of their chromosome because there's been a genetic reshuffling.

161
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,920
That process happened also 50,000 years ago when Homo sapiens and Neanderthals mate it.

162
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
And so what you end up with in the first and second generation of this cross

163
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,920
are chromosomes that are a blend of the Homo sapiens DNA and the Neanderthal DNA.

164
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
So, in this colour scheme, they look like this.

165
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
They're not regularly striped, obviously,

166
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,920
but they have some genes from the Homo sapiens parent

167
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
and some from the Neanderthal parent.

168
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
And the important point is that to a first approximation,

169
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,920
that process of shuffling is random.

170
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,920
So what you should expect is that these offspring have a random inheritance

171
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
of genes that were either sapiens or Neanderthal.

172
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Now, that offspring is going to go away,

173
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
and they're going to have their own offspring and so on and so forth.

174
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,920
And what you should expect if all of those genes are essentially completely neutral,

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,920
they have no impact, is that over time,

176
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,920
the distribution of Neanderthal genes and Homo sapiens genes

177
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
will remain random across your chromosomes.

178
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
And that means that if I were to look today at all of you sitting here listening to this

179
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,920
and to sequence your DNA, which is, of course, possible,

180
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,920
what I should see is a totally random distribution of Neanderthal genes across your genome.

181
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,920
But that's not what we see, actually.

182
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,920
So what we generally see is something that looks a bit more like this.

183
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Broadly speaking, most of your genome is a random mixture of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens.

184
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
So if you're European, for example, I mean,

185
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
then you've got about 2% Neanderthal DNA,

186
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,920
and that is roughly speaking distributed pretty evenly across your chromosomes.

187
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,920
With the exception of occasional patches where you see either no DNA at all from a Neanderthal,

188
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,920
you have only Homo sapiens DNA, or the reverse,

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,920
you are highly enriched from Neanderthal DNA in that area.

190
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Why do we see that?

191
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,920
We see that because that is a hallmark of the fact that this is no longer a neutral bit of DNA.

192
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,920
It's no longer a neutral gene.

193
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,920
What it means, so in this example here, for example,

194
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
here you have a blue patch, which is only Homo sapiens DNA.

195
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,920
So what that means is that the equivalent Neanderthal gene has been selected against.

196
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,920
It's been a bad idea over the last 50,000 years to have Neanderthal DNA in this bit of your chromosome.

197
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Whatever the gene was you inherited there was not helpful, and it has been selected against.

198
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Conversely, if you have a patch like this, we have more Neanderthal DNA than by chance.

199
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,920
That means something that Neanderthal great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent gave you was useful,

200
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,920
and it has been retained despite this random process.

201
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,920
So we can look in modern human genames, in all of your genames,

202
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
and we can look for patches that look like this, and when we see them, we can say,

203
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,920
okay, something here has been important over the last 50,000 years.

204
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,920
What is it and what might it have done?

205
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
And that's exactly what various groups have done,

206
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
and this in particular is work of Josh Ake, Serena Tucci and others,

207
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,920
where they have looked in modern genames, and what they've done particularly well in this

208
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
is they have looked in two distinct populations.

209
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Modern Europeans, people living, for example, in London today,

210
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,920
and modern Asians living in various parts of Asia.

211
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,920
And the point about doing two populations is what if there is a gene that has been selected for

212
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,920
because it benefits modern humans broadly, it should be in both of those populations.

213
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,920
And if there's one that's particularly specific, I don't know, it helps you navigate the tube in London, for example,

214
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
then it will only be in the European population and not the Asian or vice versa.

215
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,920
So when we do that, that is exactly what you see.

216
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,920
So here on this graph at the top, what you see is a chromosome.

217
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,920
This is chromosome 7, human chromosome 7, and the little red and blue lines

218
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,920
are indications of where there are neanderthal bits of DNA still in that chromosome.

219
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
And what you see is that, roughly speaking, most of the chromosome, they're pretty random,

220
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,920
except that it's pretty clear, I think, that here is a patch where we don't have any neanderthal DNA.

221
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Why is that? That must be, the assumption is, that's because whatever was on that chromosome from the anatol

222
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,920
was not helpful, was not good, and it's actually disadvantaged people carrying it

223
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,920
in the sense that they have not reproduced as well as the rest of us

224
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
and they have been lost from the population.

225
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,920
And when we look in that region, one of the genes that's in this region,

226
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,920
turns out to be this rather delightful one called Fox P2.

227
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,920
And Fox P2, in codes of protein, which you can see here spinning around,

228
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,920
which we have known about for some years, because this protein is incredibly important for language.

229
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,920
So modern living humans, for example, who have mutations in this protein,

230
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,920
often have very severe learning defects around language and communication,

231
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,920
speech defects, and are not very successful in being able to communicate.

232
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,920
If you look ancestrally, modern humans have evolved this gene much faster than chance.

233
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,920
It suggests the gene itself is under very strong selection to do something.

234
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,920
And it's different to other primate versions of this gene, for example,

235
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,920
and it's different to the neanderthal version.

236
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,920
And so the assumption we have here, which I think is a pretty reasonable hypothesis,

237
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,920
is that the neanderthal version of this gene did not allow you to do what these people are doing here,

238
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,920
did not allow you to participate in communication in the same way that modern homo sapiens did.

239
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,920
So, for example, if you were a hybrid from this neanderthal homo sapiens cross 50,000 years ago,

240
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,920
you would probably struggle to communicate with other members of your species.

241
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
And for those of us who have had a very nervous first date,

242
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,920
we know that communication is quite important for reproduction.

243
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,920
So if you couldn't communicate, you probably didn't reproduce very well,

244
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
and so those genes have been lost from the population.

245
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
So this is one example of a neanderthal gene that we haven't got anymore,

246
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
because it wasn't advantageous.

247
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Can we find examples of genes that are the opposite,

248
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,920
where that neanderthal history has benefited us?

249
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
And of course we can.

250
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,920
And so we can look on chromosomes for the opposite pattern.

251
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
So now we're looking not for those gaps,

252
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,920
but for places where the red and the blue genes are very, very dense,

253
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
more dense than the rest of the chromosome.

254
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
And you can see here on chromosome 3, one neat example here.

255
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,920
But what's clever about this example, I hope you can see this,

256
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,920
is that there are lots of red lines there.

257
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,920
So these are the ones derived from modern Asian humans.

258
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,920
So lots of people in Asia carry this neanderthal gene,

259
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,920
but it's missing from European populations.

260
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,920
So the assumption here is that whatever this gene is,

261
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
whatever this DNA region is here,

262
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,920
it has been helpful, it's been kept,

263
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,920
but only if you have a lineage in Asia.

264
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,920
So there's something here that is in some way that we don't quite understand,

265
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,920
beneficial for survival and reproduction in that part of the world,

266
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,920
less beneficial in Europe.

267
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,920
And it turns out when you look at this region of DNA,

268
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
there are several genes in here,

269
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,920
but there's a little cluster here called HYAL,

270
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Hyaluronic Acid genes.

271
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,920
And these genes encode proteins that are incredibly important

272
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,920
for rebuilding cellular structures after DNA damage.

273
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,920
And in particular after DNA damage caused by sunshine,

274
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
because by ultraviolet irradiation.

275
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,920
So, for example, if you have a poorly functioning version of this gene,

276
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
you burn incredibly easily.

277
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,920
You get very bad sunburn quite rapidly.

278
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,920
And so the hypothesis here is that back 50,000 years ago,

279
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,920
we picked up this version of a gene from neanderthal crosses.

280
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,920
It confers better protection against ultraviolet irradiation.

281
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
If you're in a grey and misty northern Britain,

282
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
that is pretty irrelevant,

283
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,920
but if you're in a sun-baked Asian desert, for example,

284
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
it's really quite important to be able to survive sunburn.

285
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,920
And so this gene has been retained in the populations that needed it

286
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,920
and not in the pale kind of rainy populations of Europe

287
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,920
like the one we're standing in today.

288
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
So that's an example that goes the other way.

289
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,920
And then perhaps the neatest example that I really like of this study

290
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,920
is the one here, which applies equally to all modern humans.

291
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,920
So now we're looking for a region, this is on chromosome 12.

292
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,920
And there is a region here, I hope you can see it,

293
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,920
very, very densely populated with neanderthal DNA in both populations.

294
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,920
So in both European and Asian populations.

295
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,920
So here in this region is something that we inherited from neanderthals.

296
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
It's turned out to be really useful for all humans,

297
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
or at least all the ones that we've sequenced,

298
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,920
and it's been kept at very high frequency.

299
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,920
And this little gene cluster here contains three genes,

300
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,920
all very closely related, called the OAS genes.

301
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,920
And these genes are very, very important

302
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
because they drive an immune process.

303
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,920
And what they do is they detect and respond to viral infections.

304
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,920
And it's a very clever system because what this gene does is it keeps back,

305
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,920
it keeps under control the very powerful weapons that you use against a virus

306
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,920
to avoid them doing damage when you're not infected.

307
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,920
When a virus appears, these genes respond and they drive the production

308
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,920
of one of these antiviral weapons that we have, called RNAs.

309
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
And this essentially is a degrading enzyme,

310
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
something that chews up viruses.

311
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,920
And as you may know, viruses come broadly speaking in two flavours.

312
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,920
There are some that have a genome that is made of DNA, like our genome,

313
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,920
but there are many, many viruses that have a genome made of RNA,

314
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
a related but different molecule.

315
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
And so because our genome is made of DNA,

316
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
but a virus is made of RNA,

317
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
that gives you a tool to destroy a virus by targeting that RNA,

318
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,920
and that's what this tool does.

319
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,920
So when you detect a viral infection, these OAS genes turn on this weapon,

320
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
this RNA's weapon, the weapon is produced,

321
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,920
and it comes and it degrades the virus you're infected with.

322
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
So this seems like quite a good thing to have,

323
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,920
and so the hypothesis is maybe the neanderthal version of these genes

324
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
is a bit better at dealing with viruses,

325
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,920
and so that's why we have kept it so well, and that is exactly true.

326
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,920
In fact, it turns out that you can do these experiments in the lab.

327
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,920
If you have the neanderthal version of these genes,

328
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
rather than the homoesapiens version,

329
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,920
you are much better at controlling a whole variety of viruses, actually,

330
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,920
particular things like hepatitis C, tibialynecatholitis, and West Nile virus.

331
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,920
And one of the interesting things about this is the virus group

332
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,920
that you are particularly good at controlling if you have these genes

333
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,920
all belong to a group called the Flavi viruses.

334
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,920
And so, to me, at least, that is quite compelling evidence

335
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,920
that at some point between that mating with neanderthals 50,000 years ago

336
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,920
and today, we have been through quite a strong selective pressure

337
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
in which Flavi viruses were a really big problem.

338
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,920
And so what happened was people who did not have this extra protection

339
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,920
succumbed, died, didn't inherit their genes.

340
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Those people who carried this extra neanderthal gene

341
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,920
were able to survive those pandemics, if you want to call them that,

342
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,920
and give their genes on, and that's why we see those genes today.

343
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,920
The last twist in this rather neat tale, I think,

344
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,920
is that these neanderthal genes that we inherited

345
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,920
have apparently helped us survive at some point in the last 50,000 years.

346
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,920
But even more importantly, they have also helped us survive

347
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
in the last five years.

348
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Because you may know that during the COVID-19 pandemic,

349
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,920
there was intense interest in what made individual differences

350
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
in our response to the virus.

351
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,920
And we will all know people who got COVID-19 and carried on

352
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,920
as if nothing had happened, they were completely fitting well.

353
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
And unfortunately, many of us will also know people

354
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
who were very severely ill or perhaps died.

355
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,920
And the question became quite often,

356
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,920
why is it that two people who are superficially very similar

357
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,920
may respond so differently to that virus?

358
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,920
And so many groups looked at this by sequencing DNA

359
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
in those different people and asking what genes to people

360
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
who seem to brush off the virus have

361
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,920
that are missing in people who get severely ill.

362
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
And it turns out that one of those genes that you can see over here

363
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,920
is exactly this, OAS3.

364
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,920
So it turns out that if you have this neanderthal gene,

365
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
your ancestors survived some pandemic in the last 50,000 years,

366
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
and that's why you're here today.

367
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
But the fact that you're physically here today

368
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
in this hall listening to me may also be

369
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
because that same gene has helped you survive the pandemic

370
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,920
that we've all been through in the last four or five years.

371
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Quite a salient reminder, I think,

372
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
that evolution is not all about dead stuff.

373
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
It's also about what happens today

374
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,920
and understanding it is really, really important.

375
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,920
So that all feels and is ancient history.

376
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,920
We're talking about things that happened 50,000 years ago,

377
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
and albeit they may have an impact today.

378
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,920
But it's still quite difficult to get your head around

379
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,920
neanderthal matings 50,000 years ago.

380
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,920
But the question is, and I'd like to turn to you now,

381
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,920
is really, can we see anything that's even more recent than that?

382
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,920
And I said at the beginning that evolution works on very slow time scales,

383
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
usually millions of years.

384
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
So asking whether we can see anything evolutionarily

385
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,920
over thousands of years is a bit of a tall order.

386
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,920
But nonetheless, with the power in particular

387
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
of very, very advanced genetics

388
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,920
that we have received over recent years,

389
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,920
we're now in a position to start to see things that have evolved humanity

390
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
over not just a blink of an eye,

391
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
but an absolute nanosecond of evolutionary time

392
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,920
just in the last few thousand years.

393
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,920
And one of the points that I think is particularly notable

394
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,920
is that we think of evolutionary events

395
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,920
as being standalone.

396
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,920
We think of, for example, humans migrated out of Africa,

397
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,920
that was lovely, got to rest the world, end of season.

398
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,920
But actually, of course, that's not how it works.

399
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,920
When something changes, it has a knock-on impact.

400
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,920
So, you know, if we start to evolve tool use, for example,

401
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,920
that had a direct impact on humans,

402
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
because we could benefit from that tool use,

403
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,920
but it also had a direct impact on other species.

404
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
For example, trees that were now cut down

405
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,920
that would not previously have been able to be cut down.

406
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
So there are follow-on impacts.

407
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,920
In other words, evolution can spawn more evolution.

408
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,920
If you think about the evolution of flight in birds,

409
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,920
before birds could fly, there was no need for trees to have fruit

410
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
that could be kind of spread in the canopy.

411
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
As soon as they had flying birds that could spread it around,

412
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,920
it made sense to evolve fruit that might be attractive to those birds

413
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,920
high up in the canopy, and so on and so forth.

414
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
So humans have evolved, too.

415
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,920
So the question is, have we evolved in a way that has then shaped

416
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,920
our own evolution?

417
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,920
And the answer to that is definitively yes.

418
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
And the bit of human evolution I want to talk about

419
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,920
is this one, is the transition from, if you like,

420
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,920
hunter-gatherer nomadic individual humans

421
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,920
to the kind of humans we recognize today,

422
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,920
people who are urbanized, people who live with agriculture,

423
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,920
people who do all these kind of things that society today depends on.

424
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,920
And we know actually quite a bit about how this happens.

425
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,920
So what we know is that around about 10,000 or 11,000 years ago,

426
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,920
up until that point, most humans had been hunter-gatherers,

427
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,920
nomadic, spreading over large areas, no particular pattern.

428
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,920
Around 10 or 11,000 years ago, we start to see evidence

429
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,920
of people returning to the same place again and again.

430
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Maybe that's because they realized that was a good place to be,

431
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,920
it was a safe place to be, it had good food, whatever,

432
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
but they came back to the same place.

433
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,920
What we think probably happened was that in their hunting and gathering,

434
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
they would, of course, have brought food home.

435
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
They would have spilt food, particularly nuts and seeds and grains,

436
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
and some of those would have germinated.

437
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,920
And then, of course, if you were a savvy hunter-gatherer 11,000 years ago,

438
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,920
you realize that actually, if your corn is growing here,

439
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
you don't have to go out to hunt and gather it

440
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
and run the risk of being eaten, you can stay here.

441
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,920
And so bit by bit, what we now recognize as agriculture evolved.

442
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
So instead of gathering stuff from the wild,

443
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,920
you could sow stuff and you could keep it in one place.

444
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Subsequently, people then realized you could do similar things with animals,

445
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,920
we started to keep livestock, so on and so forth.

446
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,920
And that agricultural revolution has been incredibly important

447
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,920
for human society, but also incredibly important for human evolution.

448
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,920
And we can start to see, using modern genetic tools,

449
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,920
just how important that has been.

450
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
So the evolution of agriculture has been most intensely studied

451
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,920
in an area called the fertile crescent.

452
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Unfortunately, it is now a very troubled part of the world,

453
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,920
so ranging from Egypt through to Iraq in a longer swath here.

454
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,920
It's important to note that we actually know that agriculture

455
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,920
was being evolved in parallel in other places, Asia,

456
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,920
for example, the domestication of rice south America.

457
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,920
But actually, because most of the work and science,

458
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,920
if you like, has been in this area, this is the area we know the most about

459
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,920
in terms of the evolution of agriculture.

460
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,920
And what we know is that about 10,000 years ago,

461
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,920
people started to domesticate certain key crops.

462
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,920
And we can see that in those crops themselves,

463
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,920
because you can see hallmarks of very rapid evolution

464
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,920
as people started to select for crops that were, for example,

465
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,920
bigger or more edible or more durable around 10,000 years ago.

466
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,920
So at about 10,000 years ago, in this area, certainly of the fertile crescent,

467
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,920
and elsewhere in the world, humans were starting to develop agriculture,

468
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,920
and that had a really important impact on lots of things about being human.

469
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,920
And the first one, and one that's often overlooked,

470
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,920
is that it allowed us to stay put.

471
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Up until then, for the rest of human history, we'd had to migrate around,

472
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,920
because if you need to hunt and gather, you need to be where the stuff to be gathered is.

473
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,920
It's no good staying put and hoping that your kind of banana is going to come to you.

474
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
You've got to go and find the banana.

475
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,920
When you start to do agriculture, you can stay in one place,

476
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
and you can start to put down roots.

477
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,920
In other words, you can start to do what we now recognise as urbanisation,

478
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,920
and build villages and then towns and then ultimately cities.

479
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,920
And this, for example, is one of the earliest examples of a town in what is now Turkey.

480
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,920
So agriculture, the development agriculture, had multiple impacts.

481
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,920
The first one, obviously, is it changed what we ate,

482
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,920
probably not into this rather delicious-looking meal here,

483
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
but it nonetheless changed quite randomly what we ate.

484
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,920
And a common misconception is that it must have made things better.

485
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Actually, all the evidence suggests it made things worse.

486
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,920
If you look at the early nutritional profile of people at this cusp of agriculture,

487
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,920
their nutritional profile is actually worse than the hunter-gatherers that preceded them.

488
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,920
And the reason for that is that the diversity of their diet collapsed.

489
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,920
They went from eating loads and loads of different species to eating a very, very small subset.

490
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,920
So they had a much more reliable food source because they were growing it themselves,

491
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
but a much more diminished one in terms of diversity,

492
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,920
and that had quite an important impact in terms of nutrients, as we'll see in a second.

493
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,920
The second impact is that it allowed humans to start to achieve densities,

494
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,920
population sizes that we'd never seen previously.

495
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Prior to this point in human history,

496
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,920
we were very small groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers that travelled around,

497
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,920
and you couldn't get very big because you couldn't stay in one place,

498
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,920
you couldn't sustain a big population.

499
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Now, you're staying in one place, you're growing your own food,

500
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,920
you can expand agriculture, you can get to high densities.

501
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,920
High densities are very important for society.

502
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,920
They're also quite important for some bad things, most notably infectious diseases.

503
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,920
And thirdly, we started to live much more closely with other species,

504
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,920
not quite like this, but with other species.

505
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,920
By domesticating livestock, we started to share our homes,

506
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,920
literally share our homes, with all sorts of species,

507
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,920
goats, dogs, sheep, cows, so on and so forth.

508
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,920
And a whole bunch of species that we didn't intend, but they came anyway,

509
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,920
rats, mice, et cetera, et cetera.

510
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,920
And that mixing pot has had a really profound impact

511
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,920
on the subsequent evolution of humans over the last 10,000 years.

512
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,920
And let me show you a few examples of that.

513
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
So, here's the first one.

514
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,920
This, obviously, is wheat, this is a crop that we eat.

515
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,920
I said just now that one of the things that happened when we moved to agriculture

516
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,920
is that we diminished the diversity of our diet.

517
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
We had plenty more calories, so that's a good start,

518
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,920
but we missed out on things that were nutrients

519
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,920
that were not necessarily present in all our plants.

520
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
So, for example, if you eat 50 different species,

521
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,920
you're going to pick up nutrients from lots of different species.

522
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,920
If you eat three species, you may well be missing something

523
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,920
that is only produced in that four species that you'll no longer eating.

524
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
And that is true.

525
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,920
So, we know, for example, there is an amino acid called ergyffion,

526
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,920
and ergyffion is actually still a bit unclear why we need it,

527
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,920
but we do need it.

528
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
We don't make that ourselves.

529
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,920
And, in fact, many, many species do not make ergyffion,

530
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,920
including most of the major crop species.

531
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,920
So, we have to get it from things like fungi, for example.

532
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
So, when we switch, and that was not a problem,

533
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
when you were outhunter gathering and finding your own mushrooms and everything else,

534
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,920
when you switched to eating largely grain crops,

535
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,920
you suddenly missed out on this ergyffion.

536
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,920
And that has, that impact is now clear in modern human genomes,

537
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,920
because the gene you need to harvest ergyffion from your food

538
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,920
encodes a protein, OCTN1, like this,

539
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,920
which picks up ergyffion in your diet and puts it into your bloodstream.

540
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,920
And this gene we can see in modern human populations

541
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,920
comes in different flavours.

542
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Some people present in the audience probably don't produce very much of this,

543
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,920
but many of us have a version that is much more active.

544
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,920
In fact, it's 50% more effective at getting ergyffion in out of your food

545
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
than the other type of the gene.

546
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
And if you look at where that highly effective gene is found,

547
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,920
what you see is a rather wonderful map like this.

548
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Those of us in Western Europe are very, very likely to have this,

549
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,920
what's called a high affinity gene.

550
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,920
People who have a long-standing African ancestry, much less so.

551
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,920
And the explanation for this is that that's because the evolutionary history in Africa

552
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,920
was hunter-gatherer for much, much longer.

553
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Those of us in Europe have been through this agricultural bottleneck.

554
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,920
We are the survivors of people who farmed in the Middle East, essentially.

555
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,920
And so in order to survive farming in the Middle East,

556
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,920
you needed this version of the gene to help you get nutrients out of your food,

557
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
otherwise you died.

558
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,920
And so those of us who have survived that process have that high affinity gene

559
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,920
because it's able to scavenge ergyffioning from your food.

560
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,920
A very nice example, I think, of where agriculture has shaped modern genomes

561
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,920
in a way that we had not previously predicted.

562
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
And in fact, we can go one step further than this

563
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,920
because we can say, so this is testing an individual gene,

564
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
but we can turn it around and we can say,

565
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,920
what is it in modern humans that apparently has evolved very, very fast?

566
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,920
And a very neat way to do that was done by David Reichs group

567
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,920
who looks at relatively recently dead human beings.

568
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,920
And when I say relatively recently, I mean the last 6,000 years, more or less.

569
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,920
And they sequence DNA from corpses from about 6,500 years ago to about 300 years ago.

570
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
So this is quite a big swave of human evolution.

571
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,920
By doing that, you can look at genes that have essentially not changed over that period of time

572
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,920
versus those that are apparently changing very, very fast.

573
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,920
And the theory is that a gene that is important for something that is changing

574
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,920
will itself change.

575
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
So if you think about, for example, dealing with an infection,

576
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,920
your genes are changing fast as the infectious profile changes,

577
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,920
whereas the way that you pattern an embryo has not changed over the last 6,000 years.

578
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,920
So those genes are not evolving very fast.

579
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,920
So what you see in front of you is a graph of the whole human genome

580
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,920
from chromosome 1 right down here to chromosome 22.

581
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,920
Every gene, each 20,000-ish genes of the human genome has been looked at,

582
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,920
and the question is how fast are those genes changing.

583
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,920
What you see is the vast majority of genes are not changing very much at all,

584
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,920
and that makes sense, right, because most of what it means to be human

585
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
has not changed over the last 6,000 years.

586
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
But you have these occasional genes, the tall ones here,

587
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,920
that are evolving very, very fast indeed.

588
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:29,920
These are genes that do something that has changed a lot over the last 6,500 years.

589
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
And one of the very nice things about this analysis

590
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
is that one of these genes is that one I just talked about,

591
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
the ergithionine transporter.

592
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,920
So you can see that gene here, it has a terrible name,

593
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
but nonetheless you can see that gene is one of these

594
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
that is significantly evolving faster than chance.

595
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
But there are some other neat ones here,

596
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,920
and this one clearly is the one that is evolving the fastest,

597
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,920
and this one is the one that affects all of us today.

598
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,920
So if you're sitting here listening to this scoffing your late night cereal

599
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
with a bowl of milk, then you can thank this gene for that.

600
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,920
If you're sitting here listening to this saying,

601
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,920
I wish I could have that bowl of milk, but it would make me sick,

602
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,920
you can blame this gene for that, because this is the lactase persistence gene.

603
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,920
And this is a very nice example of evolution, shaping evolution.

604
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Because, as you will know, those of you in particular

605
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,920
who've got domestic pets, cats, dogs, et cetera,

606
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,920
the basic rule for all mammals is that baby mammals drink milk,

607
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,920
and big mammals don't, right?

608
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,920
If you have a puppy, a puppy drinks milk,

609
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,920
when you wean the puppy and have an adult dog,

610
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
if you give your adult dog a bowl of milk,

611
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
it will vomit it all back up again, okay?

612
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,920
And that is true for most mammals.

613
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
It is also historically true for humans.

614
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Historically, evolutionarily, humans could also not consume milk as adults.

615
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
We would drink milk as babies, we would wean,

616
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,920
and then we would become what's called lactose intolerant,

617
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,920
because you would miss the enzyme to digest it.

618
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,920
That was not a problem, until we started dairying,

619
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,920
we started keeping cattle and sheep and other things for their milk.

620
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,920
And then it became quite useful to be able to digest that milk even as an adult.

621
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,920
There is a mutation that is presumably quite rare in nature

622
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,920
that keeps that gene on into adulthood.

623
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,920
And for the last million years or so, that's been totally irrelevant.

624
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,920
But suddenly when we started to have a ready source of milk as adults,

625
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,920
having that version of the gene was very beneficial.

626
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,920
And the time it was particularly beneficial was when times got really tough.

627
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,920
So, for example, in winter when there's no food around,

628
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,920
you were essentially on the brink of starvation.

629
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,920
If you had a cow and you could drink that milk and not vomit it back up again,

630
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,920
you had a significant chance of survival.

631
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,920
If you drank it and threw it back up again and got no calories from it,

632
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,920
that was not helpful.

633
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,920
And so what we see here is the very, very strong selective pressure

634
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,920
to have this version of the gene that allows us to metabolise milk.

635
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
And for those of you who listen to this thing,

636
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,920
yeah, but I'm lactose intolerant.

637
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm sorry, you're one of these people down here who have got the older version of the gene

638
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,920
that is not conferring that ability to drink milk as an adult.

639
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,920
So this is an example where we have done something, we have evolved dairying,

640
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,920
and it has shaped our own genetic evolution quite dramatically.

641
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
And the other example you can see here is a whole cluster of genes down here,

642
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
which is all the different functions that they are all to do with the immune system.

643
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
And I said right at the beginning of this lecture

644
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,920
that one of the strongest forces in immunity is infectious disease,

645
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
because it kills people and in particular it kills young people before they have reproduced.

646
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,920
And so we should expect genes that confer resistance to disease to be evolving fast,

647
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
and they are.

648
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,920
So there are genes here that are evolving very, very fast.

649
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,920
And one of the reasons they have evolved particularly fast over the last few thousand years

650
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,920
is because we ourselves have dramatically increased the risk of infection.

651
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,920
And we've done that by living very close to each other,

652
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,920
we're all here in a fairly crowded hall for starters,

653
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
able to spread diseases quite well,

654
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,920
but also because we have brought into our lives things that spread diseases to us,

655
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,920
either deliberately or inadvertently, like this rather cute fluffy thing here for example,

656
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,920
rats, mice, the fleas they bring, the parasites they bring are often damaging to humans.

657
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,920
And so that onset of urbanisation and agriculture exposed us to new diseases.

658
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
And in particular one of the diseases of course that they brought,

659
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
that these animals brought with them,

660
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,920
that has been enormously influential in human evolution is this one here.

661
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,920
This is the bacteria that causes the bubonic plague.

662
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,920
And this as you will probably know is carried by, the bacteria is carried by fleas,

663
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
the fleas live on rodents.

664
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,920
So getting exposed to those fleas on either your pets

665
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,920
or more likely your rodents that live in your house

666
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,920
is the route by which you pick up bubonic plague.

667
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,920
It is very likely that bubonic plague has been around for a long time,

668
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,920
but it was a very minor evolutionary pressure when we were hunter-gatherers

669
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,920
because A, you didn't often come into contact with these things carrying it,

670
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,920
and B, even if you did, you were only living in a band of a few people,

671
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,920
even if it wiped out your tribe, it was not a major impact in terms of evolution.

672
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,920
When you start to live in a town or a village or a city of thousands of people,

673
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
now you have the opportunity to have proper pandemic plague

674
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,920
and a very significant evolutionary impact

675
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
because as we know only too well over the last few years,

676
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,920
disease spreads fast in crowded conditions.

677
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,920
And we know from very good historical data

678
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,920
that the magnitude of the impact of these bubonic plagues

679
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,920
has been quite astronomical.

680
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,920
So, for example, this is a picture of the plague of Ash Dodd,

681
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
which we don't actually know if that happened, but nonetheless,

682
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,920
but we do know from good contemporary historical data,

683
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,920
for example, that the plague of Justinian at the end of the Roman Empire

684
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
swept around the coastline of the Mediterranean

685
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,920
and multiple historians from that time

686
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,920
tell us that it killed about one in four people.

687
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
And bearing in mind, this is the Roman Empire,

688
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,920
this is the sort of centre of the global universe at that point.

689
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
So 25% of the people in the Mediterranean

690
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
was a big chunk of the world's population

691
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,920
who died within just a couple of years.

692
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,920
And then much closer to home, we're here in London,

693
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,920
those of us in the hall at least,

694
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,920
and we will all be very familiar with the impact of the black death in Europe,

695
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,920
the same disease, different name, same disease, same bacteria.

696
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
In particular, the black death which peaked around 1350,

697
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,920
at least in this part of the world,

698
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
is estimated to have wiped out

699
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,920
between 30% and 60% of the population of Europe.

700
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,920
So this is an enormous mortality,

701
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
a really, really strong selective force.

702
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,920
And so it stands to reason that the slightest advantage

703
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,920
would actually be a really, really big advantage in evolutionary terms.

704
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Even if your chance of survival was 1% better than the guy next door,

705
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
over that kind of level of scale

706
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,920
that's going to be visible in our evolution.

707
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,920
And it turns out that that is indeed true.

708
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,920
And so there is an absolutely fantastic study

709
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,920
done by Elias Berreiro, which I really love,

710
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,920
which uses an amazing historical resource

711
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,920
just down the road from here.

712
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,920
So down at East Smithfield, just by Tarra London here,

713
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,920
in 1348, Edward III, who was king at the time,

714
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,920
was hiding well away from the plague, very sensible,

715
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,920
but watching London be decimated by plague,

716
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,920
he was very astute bit of biology.

717
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Edward III thought this is not very good to have dead plague victims everywhere.

718
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
What I'll do is I'll buy a big lump of land,

719
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,920
I will dig a big hole, and I will tell my soldiers

720
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,920
to throw anyone who dies of the plague into that pit,

721
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
which is at East Smithfield.

722
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,920
And then by about 1350, the plague is over in London,

723
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
they cover over those dead bodies,

724
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,920
and a very astute bit of government there,

725
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,920
well, let's not waste this resource,

726
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
it's a little bit like HS2 in this country,

727
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
let's not waste this resource.

728
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
We've got a big pit.

729
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,920
I know we'll put other people in it now when they die on top.

730
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,920
So what you have in East Smithfield is a layer,

731
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,920
a layer of people who died of the plague,

732
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,920
and then above it, a layer of people who survived the plague

733
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
and died of something else a couple of years later.

734
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
And that is an amazing genetic tool

735
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,920
because you can look at the DNA of those different layers

736
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,920
and say, what are the genes that made you susceptible to the plague

737
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
when you're in the bottom layer,

738
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,920
or helps you resist the plague and you're in the top layer?

739
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
And when you do that, you find them.

740
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,920
It's fantastic.

741
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
So here we have a plot,

742
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
just like the one I showed you of all the genes,

743
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,920
and the ones up the top are the genes

744
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,920
that are significantly overrepresented in the survivors.

745
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
So if you had that version of the gene,

746
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,920
you were much more likely to make it through the plague.

747
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
You might have got run over by a horse the following year and died,

748
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,920
but you didn't get the plague and died.

749
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,920
So they were advantageous in helping you to survive.

750
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,920
For example, CTA4 or the ERAP genes there.

751
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Unsurprisingly, these genes are all to do with immunity.

752
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,920
So, for example, the ERAP genes are used to reveal to the immune system

753
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
the presence of a pathogen.

754
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,920
Having those helped, presumably, these medieval Londoners to say,

755
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,920
oh my goodness, immune system, there's a bubonic plague happening here

756
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,920
to deal with it fast and help me survive.

757
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,920
So that version of the gene helped them survive

758
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
against the plague all those years ago,

759
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,920
and we can see that evolution today.

760
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,920
But the last twist to this tale, and perhaps a slightly miserable point to end on,

761
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,920
is that this gene, having these genes, is why we're all here today,

762
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,920
especially those of you who have long-distant London ancestors.

763
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,920
The reason you're alive today is because your great-grandparents

764
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,920
had this version of the gene and survived the plague.

765
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,920
Unfortunately, you've now got this version of the gene,

766
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
and that's probably also the reason if you're sitting there rubbing your knuckles

767
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,920
that you have rheumatoid arthritis.

768
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Because it turns out that this gene is really good at triggering the immune system against plague.

769
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,920
Unfortunately, it's also a bit good at triggering it when you don't need to

770
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,920
and inducing autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

771
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,920
So what you end up with is a gene that was massively advantageous a long time ago,

772
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,920
now, unfortunately, having a bit of a negative consequence.

773
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,920
Of course, the really bad news is, as I said at the beginning,

774
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,920
evolution works on reproduction.

775
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,920
So it's really important to be resistant to plague and have your babies grow up.

776
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,920
By the time you get rheumatoid arthritis, most of us have done our reproduction.

777
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
It doesn't impact at all on our ability to reproduce,

778
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,920
and so evolution doesn't see this,

779
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,920
and so you're going to be stuck with this gene probably forever now

780
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,920
because there's no evolutionary pressure to remove it again for the population.

781
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,920
Bad luck, but that's evolution for you.

782
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,920
Thank you very much. I'm very happy to take questions.

783
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,920
APPLAUSE

784
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
OK, so for those listening online, can you hear that?

785
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
How has modern medicine changed evolution?

786
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Well, I'm going to be really mean and say, stick around,

787
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,920
because the next lecture, we're going to talk a bit about that,

788
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,920
but I'll give you a quick spoiler alert.

789
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,920
So the short answer is, it is probably too soon to see anything particularly dramatic,

790
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,920
but there are some very nice examples of where we will very soon, I think, see evolutionary impacts.

791
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,920
And probably the biggest one is around reproduction,

792
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,920
because things like IVF, of course, have just changed this beautiful model I've shown you about.

793
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
It's all about how successful you are at reproducing,

794
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,920
because now you can reproduce if you actually couldn't reproduce previously,

795
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,920
or indeed you can choose not to reproduce even though you're biologically capable,

796
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,920
which is something that has not happened for millions of years

797
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,920
and is undoubtedly going to reshape evolution in some really interesting ways.

798
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
And that's all I'm going to say.

799
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
You'll have to tune in for the next lecture to find out some more.

800
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,920
I'm going to go to question online, then I come to the audience.

801
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,920
We have a whole series of questions,

802
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,920
which I think are kind of points of clarification about genetics, yes?

803
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,920
People are asking questions about how lactose intolerance genes

804
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,920
change their expression over the life course,

805
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,920
and whether, if you're lactose intolerant,

806
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,920
it means that one of your parents is lactose intolerant.

807
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,920
So they're just some people who want some clarification on those points.

808
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Yeah, very good point.

809
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
So, and I just slightly brush over that.

810
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
So how does the lactose gene work?

811
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,920
So essentially you have a gene, lactase,

812
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920
which helps you digest milk sugars, lactose.

813
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,920
If you can't digest the sugar, it makes you sick and you vomit it back up again.

814
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,920
So having that enzyme expressed produced is critical to be able to digest milk.

815
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,920
Genes work, you have the thing that you're making, so that enzyme,

816
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,920
and what's called a promoter sequence beside it,

817
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,920
which tells the body when to put that protein into production, when to turn it off.

818
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,920
So, for instance, there are some proteins that have produced

819
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,920
at different times of the menstrual cycle if you're female,

820
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
or when you go into adolescence or so on and so forth.

821
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,920
You don't want the gene for beards being turned on when you're six months old.

822
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,920
You only want it when you're in puberty.

823
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,920
And so those promoters are if you like the timer.

824
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,920
Lactase, this enzyme, has a timer which says,

825
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,920
turn me off forever as soon as you've finished, you know,

826
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,920
as soon as you've weaned, as soon as you've finished drinking milk from your mother.

827
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,920
And that works brilliantly well in all animals, including ourselves.

828
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,920
What we have done at some point in the evolutionary time

829
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,920
is there has been a mutation that has broken that switch,

830
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,920
and it stays on forever.

831
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,920
No use at all, in fact, possibly slightly disadvantageous

832
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,920
because you're making approaches of no relevance,

833
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,920
up until the point when you start being exposed to milk as an adult,

834
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,920
then massively, massively important.

835
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
So that's how it works.

836
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,920
And the question about inheritance.

837
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
So there are two sorts actually of lactase intolerance.

838
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
I should have made that clear.

839
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
The clean genetic type is that.

840
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,920
So if you don't have the enzyme, you can't digest the sugar,

841
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,920
you're lactase intolerant.

842
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,920
There are secondary issues, for example, allergies to milk,

843
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,920
which are nothing to do with that enzyme,

844
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,920
and are to do with whether you've been stimulated by a particular antigen,

845
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,920
so on and so forth.

846
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,920
So I guess the cautionary tale here is don't be listening to this at home

847
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,920
and thinking, oh, actually, my milk allergy is all nonsense.

848
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
I don't have that gene.

849
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
I'm going to go and drink milk.

850
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,920
If you've been told your milk allergic, don't drink milk.

851
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,920
Okay, regardless of whether you have this gene or not.

852
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
So there are different systems.

853
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,920
But yes, if you are genetically lactase intolerant,

854
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,920
then whether your children are or not depends on the gene of your partner too.

855
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,920
Because if your partner is lactase tolerant and they're lucky,

856
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
they'll get that gene and not yours.

857
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,920
Then on the lactose, my cat loves a nice drop of milk,

858
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,920
or yogurt, or cheese, or whatever.

859
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,920
And the story I've always heard is they became domesticated

860
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,920
when we took up dairy and they killed the mice and the rats in the dairy.

861
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,920
So is there something about cats that enables them to drink milk as adults?

862
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,920
So the question is about cats and cats that drink milk in particular

863
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
and how they got domesticated.

864
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
And this sort of reminds me of that thing about,

865
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,920
you know, you should never work in television with children or pets, right?

866
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
You should never answer questions about cats.

867
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,920
So the domestication of cats is actually a bit enigmatic.

868
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,920
I mean, we know it's quite early on.

869
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
And as anyone who owns a cat knows,

870
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,920
it's a bit unclear whether we domesticated them or they domesticated us.

871
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Either way, they are now living with us.

872
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,920
So some cats are better at drinking milk than others.

873
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
So there's some variation there.

874
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,920
And I have to say, I don't know,

875
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,920
be interested now if anyone online listening to this can post in the chat,

876
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,920
whether they know whether that's because of the same sort of mutation or not.

877
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
Cheese, you mentioned about eating cheese.

878
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,920
So when you process milk into something, particularly hard cheeses,

879
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,920
actually the lactose is largely destroyed

880
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,920
because the fermentation process gets rid of that,

881
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,920
which is why people who are lactose intolerant usually can eat cheese,

882
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,920
but not drink raw milk.

883
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
So it depends a bit on the amount of lactose, too.

884
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,920
Okay, there's a question.

885
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,920
Again, I'm going to oscillate it.

886
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,920
Again, I'm trying to put together some questions here.

887
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,920
There are lots of people thinking about what future evolutionary pressures are likely to be.

888
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,920
They're talking about changes in diet, changes in obesity.

889
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,920
Somebody's mentioned that in Southeast Asia around Polynesia.

890
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,920
People have also said,

891
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,920
well, if you have all these pressures, modern-day pressures,

892
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,920
how does that play out now that there are fewer generations per century?

893
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,920
Because we are reproducing older,

894
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,920
and so where as we would have three or four generations a century ago,

895
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,920
now we only have two.

896
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,920
So that's very interesting.

897
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
I'm going to take the second part first.

898
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,920
So the question is about whether evolution is running at, again,

899
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,920
a different clock speed, I guess, if we reproduce more slowly, which we do now.

900
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,920
And the short answer is yes, generally it's true.

901
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,920
So evolution is measured on generational time.

902
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,920
So if you have, I don't know, 20 generations of 1,000 years or 15,

903
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
that makes a difference to the clock rate.

904
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,920
So to a first approximation, evolution is running more slowly.

905
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,920
The slight caveat to that is that it's also about the mutation rate in your DNA.

906
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,920
And as you get older, if you reproduce at older ages,

907
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,920
you carry more mutations, sorry to say, but it's true.

908
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,920
So there is a higher chance, I guess, of variability in your offspring.

909
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
That is not enough to compensate for the change.

910
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,920
So it's not that it will stay static.

911
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,920
We are still essentially evolving slightly more slowly,

912
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,920
but it's not a linear change in that kind of rate.

913
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,920
And in terms of the question about what's going to happen in the future,

914
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
I'm going to have a trailer for the next one.

915
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
I think there are lots of interesting things.

916
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,920
My teenage kids would tell me that a key skill for reproducing these days

917
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,920
would be able to use TikTok.

918
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,920
So maybe there will be a genetic selection for good use of TikTok.

919
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,920
I don't know.

920
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,920
But there are lots of things that will change.

921
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,920
For example, through most of human history,

922
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,920
being able to wield a weapon and kill your opponents

923
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,920
was quite a big selective force.

924
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,920
Happily, for most of us today, that's not a big selective force.

925
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,920
So even weegee people like me can successfully reproduce

926
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
because I haven't been attacked by someone with a sword.

927
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
Happily thus far, that's what I would.

928
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,920
I was just wondering, could you maybe argue that the most healthy diet is a paleo diet,

929
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,920
but then with a bit of milk and carbs?

930
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,920
And then the other thing was in reference to the question of the man behind me

931
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,920
about healthcare, could you maybe argue that with the onset of the industrial revolution,

932
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:46,920
the infant mortality rate has decreased from 50% to 1% less than 1%

933
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,920
and that's caused maybe quite a lot of mutation

934
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,920
and therefore we've maybe become more unhealthy as a population?

935
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,920
So there's a lot in those questions.

936
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,920
So going in reverse order,

937
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,920
so unfortunately infant mortality rate globally today is still at about 5% or 6%,

938
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,920
so that is good in the sense that it has fallen from highs of,

939
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,920
if you look historically, it was not unusual to lose half your children before the age of 5, for example.

940
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,920
So we've done quite well, I would argue,

941
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,920
this is an awfully long way to go, 5% is still a very big number.

942
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,920
So there is something about that.

943
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,920
In terms of the industrial revolution, I think that depends very much.

944
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,920
So seeing an evolutionary fingerprint of that would be difficult, I think,

945
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,920
because it was not even, right?

946
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
So there were indeed people who lived in,

947
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,920
so for example smog resistance might have been quite important, having good lungs,

948
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,920
it would have been important if you were in the middle of smoggy Manchester or London or something,

949
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,920
but actually a large part of the population was not exposed to that even during the industrial revolution

950
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,920
and so many of us will not have been through that selective pressure,

951
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
so I think that would be quite hard to see.

952
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,920
In terms of the best, I make it a point of principle,

953
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,920
never to advise people on the best possible diet,

954
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,920
but if I was to say it, so I think it's very tricky to say,

955
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,920
you know, the paleo diet is sort of attractive,

956
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,920
because I said hunter-gatherers had this better nutritional profile.

957
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,920
That is, of course, at a time when the switch was to subsistence agriculture

958
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,920
in a very different way than it is now.

959
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Most of us, even people who grow your own,

960
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,920
you know, we're actually fortunately at very low risk of starving to death

961
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,920
because you can still always get down the road to the supermarket if you need to.

962
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,920
And so I think the idea that you just kind of roll back the clock

963
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,920
and go back to kind of a stone-age paleo diet and everything will be well

964
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,920
is a bit simplistic.

965
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,920
That, notwithstanding, there are certainly things about that diet

966
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,920
that would be useful advice for people like having fresh fruit and nuts and, you know, fibre.

967
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,920
We know is infinitely sensible and so that's kind of worth considering,

968
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,920
but I would caution against someone thinking,

969
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,920
let me live as a stone-age man and everything will be perfect.

970
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,920
How could mRNA vaccines affect and present in our genome and long-term health?

971
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,920
And what negative side effects could there be that we don't commonly speak about?

972
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
Oh, that's an interesting question.

973
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,920
I said mRNA vaccines, which we're all familiar with.

974
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,920
So the clever thing about mRNA vaccines is they don't integrate into your genomes.

975
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,920
They produce a protein, but they don't get inherited.

976
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,920
So if, like me, and hopefully, like all of you, you've been vaccinated quite possibly with an mRNA vaccine,

977
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
you're not going to pass it on to your kids.

978
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,920
It's not inherited in any way.

979
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,920
It is a transient, if you like, process.

980
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,920
I think there's a sort of second part to the question there,

981
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,920
which is theoretically you could do something that is stably inherited that might be useful.

982
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,920
So, for example, you could tweak people's immune system.

983
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,920
So one thing you could do right is you could go back to those genes that we know

984
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,920
have protected against bubonic plague and you could say,

985
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,920
well, maybe we should kind of change those in the genome of people who don't have that version to make them more resistant.

986
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,920
There are very plausible reasons that you might want to do that for kind of infectious disease purposes.

987
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,920
I think the rheumatoid arthritis example is a good caution against that.

988
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,920
Of course, you might do something for all the best intentions to change in one way,

989
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,920
but you need to be very, very cautious about the unintended consequences about unleashing some secondary effect there.

990
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,920
In terms of the question itself, mRNA vaccines definitely don't affect your genome in terms of any inherited way.

991
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,920
Actually, I'm a huge fan.

992
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,920
I think they're a massively exciting technology that has been hugely beneficial for COVID-19

993
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,920
and hopefully will be for lots of other things in the future.

994
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,920
We'll talk a little bit about that in next year's series.

995
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,920
So if you're really keen to come back, see you in 2025 and we'll talk about those.

996
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,920
The map you showed at the beginning with the hybridisation events showed one in Australia.

997
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:35,920
Does that mean that earlier it formed a human reach Australia and so which ones?

998
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,920
Australia is like cats, a very contentious topic.

999
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:46,920
So in terms of interbreeding, what we know definitively is that homo sapiens interbreed

1000
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,920
with Neanderthals in Europe and with Denisovans in essentially Siberia.

1001
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,920
Everything else is not known in terms of integration.

1002
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,920
There is a little bit of evidence about some interbreeding with a mysterious species that we don't know yet.

1003
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,920
That's still far from determined.

1004
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:09,920
The arrival of ancient humans in Australia is a massively contested date, which is a wildly variable.

1005
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,920
As far as I know, although I'm happy to be corrected by those listening online or those in the room,

1006
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,920
there's no evidence for specific interbreeding in that region.

1007
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Actually, the entire question of who arrived in Australia when is strongly contested.

1008
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,920
One of the most interesting things just in the last few weeks is the whole genome data on native Australian populations.

1009
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:33,920
There is very interesting, very high levels of diversity in those Aboriginal populations,

1010
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,920
which is very interesting in terms of their dynamics.

1011
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,920
For example, it looks like different groups did not mix that radically early on in the history of Australia.

1012
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,920
I think there's an untapped interesting science question there about the human evolution within Australia.

1013
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,920
That doesn't answer your question about meeting with other groups outside of it, though.

1014
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,920
I think we have time for two questions. I want to take one question here and then I'll come to you for the last question because you've had to hand up.

1015
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:10,920
Some people are really interested in language when you've showed the Fox P2 and how language conferred potentially at sort of an advantage reproductively.

1016
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:20,920
But they've kind of extended it forward in their questions to ask how culture and human culture and art and potentially even religion

1017
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,920
may have imprinted on our genome and had selection pressures.

1018
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Another brilliant question, and again, I feel like some kind of, you know, I keep saying, you know,

1019
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,920
follow me for the next exciting one because in a future lecture, we will talk a little bit about that kind of cultural evolution,

1020
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,920
but let me talk a bit about that now. So language, absolutely.

1021
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,920
I think language is kind of one of those interesting places where it's not quite as obvious as survival advantages like fighting off infection

1022
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,920
or, you know, growing good and true or whatever.

1023
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,920
But it's probably, it's less culturally, there's something more intrinsic, right?

1024
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,920
If you can't speak, if you can't communicate, it is quite difficult to reproduce.

1025
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,920
So that's in that high of a place.

1026
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:00,920
I absolutely think that culture itself will also select, and we know anecdotally, right, about certain things.

1027
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,920
Historically, if you were the wrong religion, your chance of successful reproduction was a lot lower

1028
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,920
because you might have been burned at the stake or whatever.

1029
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,920
But usually, those periods are relatively brief, evolutionarily speaking.

1030
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:19,920
I'd be kind of surprised if you could see enough genetics, for example, around religious belief or cultural belief,

1031
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,920
because they're so short and they're so localised, but I'm always happy to be proven wrong.

1032
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:31,920
And who knows in the future we might discover, you know, some strong genetic factor for religious conformity or something.

1033
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Final question, I think.

1034
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Very interesting lecture. I really appreciate it.

1035
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:47,920
I'm not a medical qualified, I'm not a physicist, but the impression, again, is that modern medical science is causing us to defy evolution, evolutionary pressures.

1036
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Do you think we're in the long term able to keep up with evolution of viruses and bacteria

1037
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:59,920
so that we'll always have a solution to whatever falls us?

1038
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,920
That's a high-pressure question to end on, isn't it? Will we survive forever?

1039
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,920
So, rather than defy evolution, I would say we are certainly changing it so happily, right?

1040
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,920
So many of the things that killed babies 300 years ago are not a big worry to us, at least here in Western Europe.

1041
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,920
And that's a great thing. It clearly changes the evolutionary impact.

1042
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,920
I think the idea that we've somehow stepped off the evolutionary matter, though, is a mistake.

1043
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,920
There are other pressures now. There are lots of other things that influence whether we reproduce and whether our kids reproduce,

1044
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,920
for example, cultural things, and they will play a role, too.

1045
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,920
I'm pretty optimistic, generally, about the opportunity for medicine to deal with big disasters,

1046
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,920
and we've seen, happily, a very strong response to Covid-19.

1047
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,920
Am I optimistic that we'll be able to do that forever? Not so much.

1048
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,920
Historically, most species come to an end at some point.

1049
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,920
The only question is, is it going to be in 100 years or a million years?

1050
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,920
Voting, well, I guess 100, I'm still going to be gone. It doesn't really matter.

1051
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,920
But, you know, let's aim towards a million, at least. That'd be good.

1052
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:03,920
And on that positive note, I'd just like to thank Professor May again.

1053
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,920
Your next lecture is when, and that's going to be...

1054
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:10,920
That's a good question. It's about four or five weeks time, I think, and we're going to be answering some of the questions

1055
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,920
that you asked tonight, actually, about the impact of society, human impact,

1056
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,920
things like antibiotics, disease resistance, and where we might all go from here.

1057
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,920
So, come back again, find out more, have more of your questions answered.

1058
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,920
Thank you again.
