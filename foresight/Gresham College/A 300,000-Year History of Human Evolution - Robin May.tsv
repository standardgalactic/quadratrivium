28920	39920	Felly, we are in ourselves a very brief moment in history and so actually 300,000 years for us feels like a long time even if in planetary terms it's the blink of an eye.
39920	52920	So the question is, with that very brief slice of time, can we learn anything useful about human evolution by looking at that and what it might mean for our understanding of who we are today?
52920	59920	The Gresham College lecture that you're listening to right now is giving you knowledge and insight from one of the world's leading academic experts.
59920	65920	Making it takes a lot of time, but because we want to encourage a love of learning, we think it's well worth it.
65920	71920	We never make you pay for lectures, although donations are needed. All we ask in return is this.
71920	79920	Send a link to this lecture to someone you think would benefit, and if you haven't already, click the follow or subscribe button from wherever you're listening right now.
80920	82920	Now, let's get back to the lecture.
84920	92920	When we think about evolution, there's a kind of straightforward and simple rule really, which is that evolution is basically about reproduction.
92920	104920	Stuff that has an impact on your reproduction and most importantly on your offspring's reproduction is really important for evolution and stuff that doesn't is completely irrelevant.
105920	113920	So if I look around this hall, for example, there are some people here who are going to be massively shaped by evolution because they're at the start of their potential reproductive journey.
113920	119920	They may have children, they may not have children, they may have grandchildren, but all of those things are still for play for.
119920	126920	If you're like me pushing the wrong end of your reproductive life, you're becoming significantly less and less important in terms of evolution.
127920	135920	And of course, once you've reproduced and you're post reproductive, anything or nothing that happens to you is invisible to evolution.
135920	141920	And that's an important point. I'm laboring that point because we often ask questions about why do we have this disease?
141920	143920	Why is this problem come up now?
143920	147920	And quite often the answer to that question is because evolution doesn't care.
147920	151920	It's irrelevant because it has no direct impact on reproduction.
152920	161920	So broadly speaking, evolution boils down to the question of how many offspring do you have and how many of those offspring go on to have offspring themselves.
161920	165920	And so you can compare that. This is an example from the British Royal Family, for example.
165920	170920	So here is Queen Victoria surrounded by a couple of generations of her family.
170920	172920	She was very evolutionary successful, right?
172920	174920	There are a lot of offspring here.
174920	179920	And actually, if you're a kind of budding historian and you look at the royal families of Europe,
179920	184920	you can see a sort of genetic legacy of Queen Victoria right across Europe.
184920	187920	That, in evolutionary terms, is very successful.
187920	188920	Not so great over here.
188920	191920	This is William and Mary from the Glorious Revolution.
191920	192920	No children of their own.
192920	195920	And in fact, Mary's sister Anne, who didn't have no children either.
195920	198920	And of course, this is why the throne changed hands.
198920	203920	So evolutionarily speaking, that lineage essentially went extinct.
203920	205920	Why am I putting out pictures of kings and queens here?
205920	209920	The point about this is that if we're measuring evolution and measuring impacts,
209920	213920	the really important thing to measure are these things here, the kids,
213920	215920	and their children, and so on and so forth.
215920	220920	And we need to think about that in terms of features, behaviours,
220920	224920	things that change the survival or reproduction of our children.
224920	228920	So it all ultimately boils down to babies.
228920	229920	A slightly still cute one here.
229920	230920	She's not so cute anymore.
230920	234920	She probably would be very happy about this baby photo of my teenage daughter being on the screen,
234920	237920	but never mind when it gets taken down on YouTube,
237920	240920	even though she's filed an official complaint.
240920	244920	So it's all about the survival and reproduction of babies.
244920	250920	And so if we think about evolution, the strongest forces in shaping all evolution,
250920	256920	but in particular human evolution, are those that impact on infant survival
256920	260920	and ultimately on their reproductive success.
260920	265920	So if we look, for example, at this data from the WHO from a few years ago now,
265920	266920	this is a pretty grim slide.
266920	271920	This is a slide of what means that babies don't survive, infant mortality under five,
271920	273920	the leading cause.
273920	275920	And if you look at that data, first of all, foremost,
275920	279920	I think it's important to say this is actually a tragic indictment of where we are today
279920	282920	because many, many, many of these things are preventable
282920	285920	and should not be causing infant mortality,
285920	290920	wherever they are, because of inequality and poverty and all the other things that go with it.
290920	295920	That notwithstanding, in evolutionary terms, if we look at these leading causes of death,
295920	298920	the majority of them are infectious diseases.
298920	301920	So at a first approximation, your biggest risk,
301920	304920	if you're a newborn human infant on planet Earth,
304920	307920	is something that will infect you early on.
307920	309920	And if it infects you and it kills you, that's it,
309920	311920	you're removed from the gene pool, your evolution.
311920	314920	Re-contribution has finished.
314920	320920	So we might expect, then, that if we're looking for evidence of what has shaped human evolution,
320920	326920	that these infectious forces will be the place where we are most likely to find that evidence.
326920	332920	And to a first approximation, then, infection is a big evolutionary problem,
332920	337920	and things that overcome infection are big evolutionary successes.
337920	342920	So can we learn about those processes over the last 300,000 years
342920	344920	by looking at human evolution?
344920	348920	And to quickly recap, for those of you who didn't see the previous lecture,
348920	352920	and with the caveat that these dates change all the time,
352920	354920	this is an incredibly fast-moving field.
354920	357920	People discover new fossils, new DNA all the time.
357920	360920	So with the caveat that this is probably wrong already,
360920	362920	and definitely will be by the time I finish this lecture,
362920	368920	this, roughly speaking, is how we think of the evolution of our own species, Homo sapiens.
368920	371920	So you roll the clock back, say, 600,000 years.
371920	376920	This hominin species Homo heidelbergensis is roaming Africa.
376920	382920	It spreads out from Africa to Europe, where it evolves into the species we know of as Neanderthals.
382920	386920	It migrates across to Asia and becomes this enigmatic species
386920	389920	about which we know very little other than their DNA sequence
389920	393920	and a few tiny fossils called the Denisavans.
393920	397920	And then subsequently, about 300,000 years ago,
397920	401920	that species that has remained in Africa has evolved again
401920	403920	into what we would call anatomically modern humans,
403920	408920	migrate out of Europe again and meet all these other species around the world
408920	413920	and go on to populate the entire planet as we know it today.
413920	416920	And this graph, which I showed last time, lifted from the Natural History Museum,
416920	419920	shows us up here, Homo sapiens at the top corner,
419920	423920	and the fact that we now know that up until about 50,000 years ago,
423920	427920	we shared at least parts of the planet with these other species,
427920	429920	certainly the Denisavans and the Neanderthals,
429920	432920	and who knows possibly other species too.
434920	437920	So the key and important fact about this is that we have a species,
437920	441920	anatomically modern humans that evolved in Africa, that migrated out,
441920	445920	they came into Europe, and we have this delightful phrase that geneticists like to use,
445920	449920	admixture, which basically means mating with other people.
449920	454920	And so admixture occurred, mating occurred between these ancient,
454920	459920	but modern anatomically Homo sapiens and Neanderthals in Europe,
459920	464920	and then again with this group called the Denisavans over in Asia.
464920	468920	And so modern humans are this blend of these hybrid existences,
468920	473920	and you can find out much more about that from various sources online if you want.
474920	476920	Why am I telling you about this? I'm telling you about this
476920	480920	because this gives us a powerful tool to understand much more
480920	484920	about how evolution has shaped modern humans.
484920	487920	Because we can look at these hybridisation events,
487920	491920	or these ancient matings between Homo sapiens and other species,
491920	493920	and we can look at the exchange of genes,
493920	499920	and we can ask which of those genes have had an evolutionary consequence for us as a species.
499920	504920	And what does it tell us about the last 50,000 years?
504920	506920	So let me explain what I mean by that.
506920	511920	So here we have this ancient mating event, and this is a PG lecture,
511920	512920	so I'm going to show skeletons.
512920	515920	So here we have Homo sapiens skeleton,
515920	519920	and on the other side we have Neanderthal skeleton, very similar,
519920	522920	bit stockier, more chunky, various anatomical differences
522920	526920	that mean you can distinguish it but broadly speaking similar.
527920	532920	When any two organisms mate, and hopefully you might remember this from your school biology lessons,
532920	536920	each of us carries two copies of each of our chromosomes.
536920	539920	One inherited from our mum, and one from our dad.
540920	542920	When you produce sperm and eggs, they separate,
542920	545920	each sperm or egg getting one or the other.
545920	547920	And then when you mate with somebody else,
547920	549920	one of theirs comes together with one of yours,
549920	551920	and you get a new combination.
551920	554920	Hopefully that's not news to anybody listening to this.
554920	557920	When this ancient Neanderthal and Homo sapiens mate,
557920	559920	exactly the same process happened.
559920	563920	So one Homo sapiens chromosome was in a sperm or an egg,
563920	566920	they mate it with this Neanderthal,
566920	568920	one of their chromosomes came together,
568920	572920	and you end up with this two, one from each parent, just like anybody else.
573920	578920	The offspring of any mating, that includes all of us in the room and all those listening,
578920	579920	so you have two chromosomes.
579920	582920	When you produce your own sperm and eggs,
582920	585920	those two chromosomes that you've got, one from mum and one from dad,
585920	587920	do a process called crossing over.
587920	591920	So before you produce sperm or eggs, they come together,
591920	594920	and they exchange bits of DNA between each other.
594920	598920	And so what you end up with when you produce, for example, an egg cell,
598920	603920	is not a cell that has just your mum's chromosome or just your dad's,
603920	607920	but they have a chromosome that has, for example, been inherited from your dad,
607920	610920	but with bits of your mum's or vice versa.
610920	613920	And this is one of the processes by which we get variation,
613920	617920	and this is why we don't all look like an exact clone of our grandmother or grandfather,
617920	622920	even though you've got part of their chromosome because there's been a genetic reshuffling.
623920	629920	That process happened also 50,000 years ago when Homo sapiens and Neanderthals mate it.
629920	633920	And so what you end up with in the first and second generation of this cross
633920	639920	are chromosomes that are a blend of the Homo sapiens DNA and the Neanderthal DNA.
640920	642920	So, in this colour scheme, they look like this.
642920	644920	They're not regularly striped, obviously,
644920	648920	but they have some genes from the Homo sapiens parent
648920	651920	and some from the Neanderthal parent.
651920	655920	And the important point is that to a first approximation,
655920	658920	that process of shuffling is random.
658920	663920	So what you should expect is that these offspring have a random inheritance
663920	667920	of genes that were either sapiens or Neanderthal.
667920	670920	Now, that offspring is going to go away,
670920	672920	and they're going to have their own offspring and so on and so forth.
672920	677920	And what you should expect if all of those genes are essentially completely neutral,
677920	680920	they have no impact, is that over time,
680920	684920	the distribution of Neanderthal genes and Homo sapiens genes
684920	687920	will remain random across your chromosomes.
687920	691920	And that means that if I were to look today at all of you sitting here listening to this
691920	694920	and to sequence your DNA, which is, of course, possible,
694920	700920	what I should see is a totally random distribution of Neanderthal genes across your genome.
700920	702920	But that's not what we see, actually.
702920	705920	So what we generally see is something that looks a bit more like this.
705920	712920	Broadly speaking, most of your genome is a random mixture of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens.
712920	715920	So if you're European, for example, I mean,
715920	718920	then you've got about 2% Neanderthal DNA,
718920	723920	and that is roughly speaking distributed pretty evenly across your chromosomes.
723920	729920	With the exception of occasional patches where you see either no DNA at all from a Neanderthal,
729920	732920	you have only Homo sapiens DNA, or the reverse,
732920	736920	you are highly enriched from Neanderthal DNA in that area.
736920	737920	Why do we see that?
737920	743920	We see that because that is a hallmark of the fact that this is no longer a neutral bit of DNA.
743920	744920	It's no longer a neutral gene.
744920	747920	What it means, so in this example here, for example,
747920	751920	here you have a blue patch, which is only Homo sapiens DNA.
751920	758920	So what that means is that the equivalent Neanderthal gene has been selected against.
758920	764920	It's been a bad idea over the last 50,000 years to have Neanderthal DNA in this bit of your chromosome.
764920	769920	Whatever the gene was you inherited there was not helpful, and it has been selected against.
769920	774920	Conversely, if you have a patch like this, we have more Neanderthal DNA than by chance.
774920	780920	That means something that Neanderthal great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandparent gave you was useful,
780920	784920	and it has been retained despite this random process.
784920	788920	So we can look in modern human genames, in all of your genames,
788920	791920	and we can look for patches that look like this, and when we see them, we can say,
791920	795920	okay, something here has been important over the last 50,000 years.
795920	799920	What is it and what might it have done?
799920	801920	And that's exactly what various groups have done,
801920	805920	and this in particular is work of Josh Ake, Serena Tucci and others,
805920	809920	where they have looked in modern genames, and what they've done particularly well in this
809920	812920	is they have looked in two distinct populations.
812920	816920	Modern Europeans, people living, for example, in London today,
816920	820920	and modern Asians living in various parts of Asia.
820920	825920	And the point about doing two populations is what if there is a gene that has been selected for
825920	830920	because it benefits modern humans broadly, it should be in both of those populations.
830920	835920	And if there's one that's particularly specific, I don't know, it helps you navigate the tube in London, for example,
835920	839920	then it will only be in the European population and not the Asian or vice versa.
839920	842920	So when we do that, that is exactly what you see.
842920	845920	So here on this graph at the top, what you see is a chromosome.
845920	849920	This is chromosome 7, human chromosome 7, and the little red and blue lines
849920	854920	are indications of where there are neanderthal bits of DNA still in that chromosome.
854920	858920	And what you see is that, roughly speaking, most of the chromosome, they're pretty random,
858920	864920	except that it's pretty clear, I think, that here is a patch where we don't have any neanderthal DNA.
864920	869920	Why is that? That must be, the assumption is, that's because whatever was on that chromosome from the anatol
869920	874920	was not helpful, was not good, and it's actually disadvantaged people carrying it
874920	877920	in the sense that they have not reproduced as well as the rest of us
877920	880920	and they have been lost from the population.
880920	884920	And when we look in that region, one of the genes that's in this region,
884920	887920	turns out to be this rather delightful one called Fox P2.
887920	891920	And Fox P2, in codes of protein, which you can see here spinning around,
891920	896920	which we have known about for some years, because this protein is incredibly important for language.
896920	902920	So modern living humans, for example, who have mutations in this protein,
902920	907920	often have very severe learning defects around language and communication,
907920	912920	speech defects, and are not very successful in being able to communicate.
912920	917920	If you look ancestrally, modern humans have evolved this gene much faster than chance.
918920	921920	It suggests the gene itself is under very strong selection to do something.
921920	925920	And it's different to other primate versions of this gene, for example,
925920	928920	and it's different to the neanderthal version.
928920	932920	And so the assumption we have here, which I think is a pretty reasonable hypothesis,
932920	937920	is that the neanderthal version of this gene did not allow you to do what these people are doing here,
937920	942920	did not allow you to participate in communication in the same way that modern homo sapiens did.
943920	949920	So, for example, if you were a hybrid from this neanderthal homo sapiens cross 50,000 years ago,
949920	953920	you would probably struggle to communicate with other members of your species.
953920	955920	And for those of us who have had a very nervous first date,
955920	958920	we know that communication is quite important for reproduction.
958920	961920	So if you couldn't communicate, you probably didn't reproduce very well,
961920	964920	and so those genes have been lost from the population.
965920	968920	So this is one example of a neanderthal gene that we haven't got anymore,
968920	970920	because it wasn't advantageous.
970920	972920	Can we find examples of genes that are the opposite,
972920	976920	where that neanderthal history has benefited us?
976920	978920	And of course we can.
978920	981920	And so we can look on chromosomes for the opposite pattern.
981920	983920	So now we're looking not for those gaps,
983920	987920	but for places where the red and the blue genes are very, very dense,
987920	989920	more dense than the rest of the chromosome.
989920	993920	And you can see here on chromosome 3, one neat example here.
993920	996920	But what's clever about this example, I hope you can see this,
996920	999920	is that there are lots of red lines there.
999920	1003920	So these are the ones derived from modern Asian humans.
1003920	1008920	So lots of people in Asia carry this neanderthal gene,
1008920	1011920	but it's missing from European populations.
1011920	1014920	So the assumption here is that whatever this gene is,
1014920	1016920	whatever this DNA region is here,
1016920	1019920	it has been helpful, it's been kept,
1019920	1022920	but only if you have a lineage in Asia.
1022920	1026920	So there's something here that is in some way that we don't quite understand,
1026920	1030920	beneficial for survival and reproduction in that part of the world,
1030920	1033920	less beneficial in Europe.
1033920	1036920	And it turns out when you look at this region of DNA,
1036920	1038920	there are several genes in here,
1038920	1041920	but there's a little cluster here called HYAL,
1041920	1043920	Hyaluronic Acid genes.
1043920	1047920	And these genes encode proteins that are incredibly important
1047920	1051920	for rebuilding cellular structures after DNA damage.
1051920	1055920	And in particular after DNA damage caused by sunshine,
1055920	1057920	because by ultraviolet irradiation.
1057920	1060920	So, for example, if you have a poorly functioning version of this gene,
1060920	1062920	you burn incredibly easily.
1062920	1066920	You get very bad sunburn quite rapidly.
1066920	1070920	And so the hypothesis here is that back 50,000 years ago,
1070920	1074920	we picked up this version of a gene from neanderthal crosses.
1074920	1078920	It confers better protection against ultraviolet irradiation.
1078920	1081920	If you're in a grey and misty northern Britain,
1081920	1083920	that is pretty irrelevant,
1083920	1086920	but if you're in a sun-baked Asian desert, for example,
1086920	1089920	it's really quite important to be able to survive sunburn.
1089920	1092920	And so this gene has been retained in the populations that needed it
1092920	1096920	and not in the pale kind of rainy populations of Europe
1096920	1099920	like the one we're standing in today.
1099920	1101920	So that's an example that goes the other way.
1101920	1104920	And then perhaps the neatest example that I really like of this study
1104920	1108920	is the one here, which applies equally to all modern humans.
1108920	1111920	So now we're looking for a region, this is on chromosome 12.
1111920	1114920	And there is a region here, I hope you can see it,
1114920	1119920	very, very densely populated with neanderthal DNA in both populations.
1119920	1122920	So in both European and Asian populations.
1122920	1127920	So here in this region is something that we inherited from neanderthals.
1127920	1129920	It's turned out to be really useful for all humans,
1129920	1131920	or at least all the ones that we've sequenced,
1131920	1135920	and it's been kept at very high frequency.
1135920	1138920	And this little gene cluster here contains three genes,
1138920	1141920	all very closely related, called the OAS genes.
1141920	1144920	And these genes are very, very important
1144920	1146920	because they drive an immune process.
1146920	1151920	And what they do is they detect and respond to viral infections.
1151920	1155920	And it's a very clever system because what this gene does is it keeps back,
1155920	1159920	it keeps under control the very powerful weapons that you use against a virus
1159920	1162920	to avoid them doing damage when you're not infected.
1162920	1166920	When a virus appears, these genes respond and they drive the production
1166920	1172920	of one of these antiviral weapons that we have, called RNAs.
1172920	1175920	And this essentially is a degrading enzyme,
1175920	1177920	something that chews up viruses.
1177920	1180920	And as you may know, viruses come broadly speaking in two flavours.
1180920	1185920	There are some that have a genome that is made of DNA, like our genome,
1185920	1188920	but there are many, many viruses that have a genome made of RNA,
1188920	1191920	a related but different molecule.
1191920	1193920	And so because our genome is made of DNA,
1193920	1195920	but a virus is made of RNA,
1195920	1198920	that gives you a tool to destroy a virus by targeting that RNA,
1198920	1201920	and that's what this tool does.
1201920	1205920	So when you detect a viral infection, these OAS genes turn on this weapon,
1205920	1207920	this RNA's weapon, the weapon is produced,
1207920	1211920	and it comes and it degrades the virus you're infected with.
1211920	1213920	So this seems like quite a good thing to have,
1213920	1217920	and so the hypothesis is maybe the neanderthal version of these genes
1217920	1219920	is a bit better at dealing with viruses,
1219920	1222920	and so that's why we have kept it so well, and that is exactly true.
1222920	1225920	In fact, it turns out that you can do these experiments in the lab.
1225920	1228920	If you have the neanderthal version of these genes,
1228920	1230920	rather than the homoesapiens version,
1230920	1234920	you are much better at controlling a whole variety of viruses, actually,
1234920	1239920	particular things like hepatitis C, tibialynecatholitis, and West Nile virus.
1239920	1243920	And one of the interesting things about this is the virus group
1243920	1246920	that you are particularly good at controlling if you have these genes
1246920	1249920	all belong to a group called the Flavi viruses.
1249920	1252920	And so, to me, at least, that is quite compelling evidence
1252920	1256920	that at some point between that mating with neanderthals 50,000 years ago
1256920	1260920	and today, we have been through quite a strong selective pressure
1260920	1263920	in which Flavi viruses were a really big problem.
1263920	1267920	And so what happened was people who did not have this extra protection
1267920	1270920	succumbed, died, didn't inherit their genes.
1270920	1273920	Those people who carried this extra neanderthal gene
1273920	1277920	were able to survive those pandemics, if you want to call them that,
1277920	1281920	and give their genes on, and that's why we see those genes today.
1281920	1284920	The last twist in this rather neat tale, I think,
1284920	1287920	is that these neanderthal genes that we inherited
1287920	1292920	have apparently helped us survive at some point in the last 50,000 years.
1292920	1295920	But even more importantly, they have also helped us survive
1295920	1297920	in the last five years.
1297920	1300920	Because you may know that during the COVID-19 pandemic,
1300920	1305920	there was intense interest in what made individual differences
1305920	1307920	in our response to the virus.
1307920	1310920	And we will all know people who got COVID-19 and carried on
1310920	1313920	as if nothing had happened, they were completely fitting well.
1313920	1315920	And unfortunately, many of us will also know people
1315920	1317920	who were very severely ill or perhaps died.
1317920	1320920	And the question became quite often,
1320920	1323920	why is it that two people who are superficially very similar
1323920	1326920	may respond so differently to that virus?
1326920	1329920	And so many groups looked at this by sequencing DNA
1329920	1332920	in those different people and asking what genes to people
1332920	1334920	who seem to brush off the virus have
1334920	1337920	that are missing in people who get severely ill.
1337920	1340920	And it turns out that one of those genes that you can see over here
1340920	1343920	is exactly this, OAS3.
1343920	1346920	So it turns out that if you have this neanderthal gene,
1346920	1349920	your ancestors survived some pandemic in the last 50,000 years,
1349920	1351920	and that's why you're here today.
1351920	1353920	But the fact that you're physically here today
1353920	1355920	in this hall listening to me may also be
1355920	1358920	because that same gene has helped you survive the pandemic
1358920	1361920	that we've all been through in the last four or five years.
1361920	1363920	Quite a salient reminder, I think,
1363920	1365920	that evolution is not all about dead stuff.
1365920	1367920	It's also about what happens today
1367920	1370920	and understanding it is really, really important.
1373920	1376920	So that all feels and is ancient history.
1376920	1379920	We're talking about things that happened 50,000 years ago,
1379920	1381920	and albeit they may have an impact today.
1381920	1384920	But it's still quite difficult to get your head around
1384920	1387920	neanderthal matings 50,000 years ago.
1387920	1390920	But the question is, and I'd like to turn to you now,
1390920	1393920	is really, can we see anything that's even more recent than that?
1393920	1397920	And I said at the beginning that evolution works on very slow time scales,
1397920	1399920	usually millions of years.
1399920	1402920	So asking whether we can see anything evolutionarily
1402920	1405920	over thousands of years is a bit of a tall order.
1405920	1408920	But nonetheless, with the power in particular
1408920	1410920	of very, very advanced genetics
1410920	1413920	that we have received over recent years,
1413920	1417920	we're now in a position to start to see things that have evolved humanity
1417920	1419920	over not just a blink of an eye,
1419920	1422920	but an absolute nanosecond of evolutionary time
1422920	1425920	just in the last few thousand years.
1425920	1428920	And one of the points that I think is particularly notable
1428920	1431920	is that we think of evolutionary events
1431920	1433920	as being standalone.
1433920	1436920	We think of, for example, humans migrated out of Africa,
1436920	1439920	that was lovely, got to rest the world, end of season.
1439920	1441920	But actually, of course, that's not how it works.
1441920	1444920	When something changes, it has a knock-on impact.
1444920	1448920	So, you know, if we start to evolve tool use, for example,
1448920	1450920	that had a direct impact on humans,
1450920	1452920	because we could benefit from that tool use,
1452920	1455920	but it also had a direct impact on other species.
1455920	1457920	For example, trees that were now cut down
1457920	1460920	that would not previously have been able to be cut down.
1460920	1462920	So there are follow-on impacts.
1462920	1465920	In other words, evolution can spawn more evolution.
1465920	1468920	If you think about the evolution of flight in birds,
1468920	1471920	before birds could fly, there was no need for trees to have fruit
1471920	1473920	that could be kind of spread in the canopy.
1473920	1476920	As soon as they had flying birds that could spread it around,
1476920	1479920	it made sense to evolve fruit that might be attractive to those birds
1479920	1482920	high up in the canopy, and so on and so forth.
1482920	1484920	So humans have evolved, too.
1484920	1487920	So the question is, have we evolved in a way that has then shaped
1487920	1489920	our own evolution?
1489920	1491920	And the answer to that is definitively yes.
1491920	1494920	And the bit of human evolution I want to talk about
1494920	1498920	is this one, is the transition from, if you like,
1498920	1501920	hunter-gatherer nomadic individual humans
1501920	1504920	to the kind of humans we recognize today,
1504920	1507920	people who are urbanized, people who live with agriculture,
1507920	1512920	people who do all these kind of things that society today depends on.
1512920	1515920	And we know actually quite a bit about how this happens.
1515920	1520920	So what we know is that around about 10,000 or 11,000 years ago,
1520920	1524920	up until that point, most humans had been hunter-gatherers,
1524920	1528920	nomadic, spreading over large areas, no particular pattern.
1529920	1532920	Around 10 or 11,000 years ago, we start to see evidence
1532920	1535920	of people returning to the same place again and again.
1535920	1538920	Maybe that's because they realized that was a good place to be,
1538920	1540920	it was a safe place to be, it had good food, whatever,
1540920	1542920	but they came back to the same place.
1542920	1546920	What we think probably happened was that in their hunting and gathering,
1546920	1548920	they would, of course, have brought food home.
1548920	1552920	They would have spilt food, particularly nuts and seeds and grains,
1552920	1554920	and some of those would have germinated.
1554920	1557920	And then, of course, if you were a savvy hunter-gatherer 11,000 years ago,
1557920	1560920	you realize that actually, if your corn is growing here,
1560920	1562920	you don't have to go out to hunt and gather it
1562920	1564920	and run the risk of being eaten, you can stay here.
1564920	1569920	And so bit by bit, what we now recognize as agriculture evolved.
1569920	1571920	So instead of gathering stuff from the wild,
1571920	1574920	you could sow stuff and you could keep it in one place.
1574920	1577920	Subsequently, people then realized you could do similar things with animals,
1577920	1580920	we started to keep livestock, so on and so forth.
1580920	1584920	And that agricultural revolution has been incredibly important
1584920	1589920	for human society, but also incredibly important for human evolution.
1589920	1593920	And we can start to see, using modern genetic tools,
1593920	1597920	just how important that has been.
1597920	1600920	So the evolution of agriculture has been most intensely studied
1600920	1603920	in an area called the fertile crescent.
1603920	1605920	Unfortunately, it is now a very troubled part of the world,
1605920	1609920	so ranging from Egypt through to Iraq in a longer swath here.
1609920	1612920	It's important to note that we actually know that agriculture
1612920	1615920	was being evolved in parallel in other places, Asia,
1615920	1618920	for example, the domestication of rice south America.
1618920	1621920	But actually, because most of the work and science,
1621920	1624920	if you like, has been in this area, this is the area we know the most about
1624920	1626920	in terms of the evolution of agriculture.
1626920	1629920	And what we know is that about 10,000 years ago,
1629920	1632920	people started to domesticate certain key crops.
1632920	1635920	And we can see that in those crops themselves,
1635920	1638920	because you can see hallmarks of very rapid evolution
1638920	1642920	as people started to select for crops that were, for example,
1642920	1647920	bigger or more edible or more durable around 10,000 years ago.
1647920	1651920	So at about 10,000 years ago, in this area, certainly of the fertile crescent,
1651920	1654920	and elsewhere in the world, humans were starting to develop agriculture,
1654920	1659920	and that had a really important impact on lots of things about being human.
1659920	1663920	And the first one, and one that's often overlooked,
1663920	1666920	is that it allowed us to stay put.
1666920	1670920	Up until then, for the rest of human history, we'd had to migrate around,
1670920	1674920	because if you need to hunt and gather, you need to be where the stuff to be gathered is.
1674920	1677920	It's no good staying put and hoping that your kind of banana is going to come to you.
1677920	1679920	You've got to go and find the banana.
1679920	1681920	When you start to do agriculture, you can stay in one place,
1681920	1683920	and you can start to put down roots.
1683920	1687920	In other words, you can start to do what we now recognise as urbanisation,
1687920	1690920	and build villages and then towns and then ultimately cities.
1690920	1695920	And this, for example, is one of the earliest examples of a town in what is now Turkey.
1695920	1699920	So agriculture, the development agriculture, had multiple impacts.
1699920	1702920	The first one, obviously, is it changed what we ate,
1702920	1705920	probably not into this rather delicious-looking meal here,
1705920	1707920	but it nonetheless changed quite randomly what we ate.
1707920	1711920	And a common misconception is that it must have made things better.
1711920	1714920	Actually, all the evidence suggests it made things worse.
1714920	1720920	If you look at the early nutritional profile of people at this cusp of agriculture,
1720920	1724920	their nutritional profile is actually worse than the hunter-gatherers that preceded them.
1724920	1728920	And the reason for that is that the diversity of their diet collapsed.
1728920	1734920	They went from eating loads and loads of different species to eating a very, very small subset.
1734920	1738920	So they had a much more reliable food source because they were growing it themselves,
1738920	1740920	but a much more diminished one in terms of diversity,
1740920	1745920	and that had quite an important impact in terms of nutrients, as we'll see in a second.
1745920	1750920	The second impact is that it allowed humans to start to achieve densities,
1750920	1753920	population sizes that we'd never seen previously.
1753920	1755920	Prior to this point in human history,
1755920	1759920	we were very small groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers that travelled around,
1759920	1762920	and you couldn't get very big because you couldn't stay in one place,
1762920	1765920	you couldn't sustain a big population.
1765920	1768920	Now, you're staying in one place, you're growing your own food,
1768920	1771920	you can expand agriculture, you can get to high densities.
1771920	1774920	High densities are very important for society.
1774920	1779920	They're also quite important for some bad things, most notably infectious diseases.
1781920	1786920	And thirdly, we started to live much more closely with other species,
1786920	1788920	not quite like this, but with other species.
1788920	1792920	By domesticating livestock, we started to share our homes,
1792920	1795920	literally share our homes, with all sorts of species,
1795920	1799920	goats, dogs, sheep, cows, so on and so forth.
1799920	1802920	And a whole bunch of species that we didn't intend, but they came anyway,
1802920	1805920	rats, mice, et cetera, et cetera.
1806920	1810920	And that mixing pot has had a really profound impact
1810920	1814920	on the subsequent evolution of humans over the last 10,000 years.
1814920	1817920	And let me show you a few examples of that.
1817920	1819920	So, here's the first one.
1819920	1822920	This, obviously, is wheat, this is a crop that we eat.
1822920	1826920	I said just now that one of the things that happened when we moved to agriculture
1826920	1829920	is that we diminished the diversity of our diet.
1829920	1831920	We had plenty more calories, so that's a good start,
1831920	1834920	but we missed out on things that were nutrients
1834920	1837920	that were not necessarily present in all our plants.
1837920	1839920	So, for example, if you eat 50 different species,
1839920	1842920	you're going to pick up nutrients from lots of different species.
1842920	1845920	If you eat three species, you may well be missing something
1845920	1849920	that is only produced in that four species that you'll no longer eating.
1849920	1851920	And that is true.
1851920	1854920	So, we know, for example, there is an amino acid called ergyffion,
1854920	1857920	and ergyffion is actually still a bit unclear why we need it,
1857920	1858920	but we do need it.
1858920	1860920	We don't make that ourselves.
1860920	1863920	And, in fact, many, many species do not make ergyffion,
1863920	1866920	including most of the major crop species.
1866920	1870920	So, we have to get it from things like fungi, for example.
1870920	1872920	So, when we switch, and that was not a problem,
1872920	1875920	when you were outhunter gathering and finding your own mushrooms and everything else,
1875920	1878920	when you switched to eating largely grain crops,
1878920	1881920	you suddenly missed out on this ergyffion.
1881920	1886920	And that has, that impact is now clear in modern human genomes,
1886920	1890920	because the gene you need to harvest ergyffion from your food
1890920	1893920	encodes a protein, OCTN1, like this,
1893920	1897920	which picks up ergyffion in your diet and puts it into your bloodstream.
1897920	1900920	And this gene we can see in modern human populations
1900920	1902920	comes in different flavours.
1902920	1907920	Some people present in the audience probably don't produce very much of this,
1907920	1910920	but many of us have a version that is much more active.
1910920	1915920	In fact, it's 50% more effective at getting ergyffion in out of your food
1915920	1917920	than the other type of the gene.
1917920	1920920	And if you look at where that highly effective gene is found,
1920920	1922920	what you see is a rather wonderful map like this.
1922920	1926920	Those of us in Western Europe are very, very likely to have this,
1926920	1928920	what's called a high affinity gene.
1928920	1933920	People who have a long-standing African ancestry, much less so.
1933920	1938920	And the explanation for this is that that's because the evolutionary history in Africa
1938920	1941920	was hunter-gatherer for much, much longer.
1941920	1944920	Those of us in Europe have been through this agricultural bottleneck.
1944920	1948920	We are the survivors of people who farmed in the Middle East, essentially.
1948920	1951920	And so in order to survive farming in the Middle East,
1951920	1955920	you needed this version of the gene to help you get nutrients out of your food,
1955920	1956920	otherwise you died.
1956920	1960920	And so those of us who have survived that process have that high affinity gene
1960920	1964920	because it's able to scavenge ergyffioning from your food.
1964920	1968920	A very nice example, I think, of where agriculture has shaped modern genomes
1968920	1971920	in a way that we had not previously predicted.
1972920	1974920	And in fact, we can go one step further than this
1974920	1976920	because we can say, so this is testing an individual gene,
1976920	1978920	but we can turn it around and we can say,
1978920	1983920	what is it in modern humans that apparently has evolved very, very fast?
1983920	1986920	And a very neat way to do that was done by David Reichs group
1986920	1991920	who looks at relatively recently dead human beings.
1991920	1995920	And when I say relatively recently, I mean the last 6,000 years, more or less.
1995920	2002920	And they sequence DNA from corpses from about 6,500 years ago to about 300 years ago.
2002920	2005920	So this is quite a big swave of human evolution.
2005920	2011920	By doing that, you can look at genes that have essentially not changed over that period of time
2011920	2014920	versus those that are apparently changing very, very fast.
2014920	2018920	And the theory is that a gene that is important for something that is changing
2018920	2020920	will itself change.
2020920	2022920	So if you think about, for example, dealing with an infection,
2022920	2026920	your genes are changing fast as the infectious profile changes,
2026920	2031920	whereas the way that you pattern an embryo has not changed over the last 6,000 years.
2031920	2034920	So those genes are not evolving very fast.
2035920	2038920	So what you see in front of you is a graph of the whole human genome
2038920	2041920	from chromosome 1 right down here to chromosome 22.
2042920	2046920	Every gene, each 20,000-ish genes of the human genome has been looked at,
2046920	2049920	and the question is how fast are those genes changing.
2049920	2052920	What you see is the vast majority of genes are not changing very much at all,
2052920	2055920	and that makes sense, right, because most of what it means to be human
2055920	2057920	has not changed over the last 6,000 years.
2057920	2060920	But you have these occasional genes, the tall ones here,
2060920	2063920	that are evolving very, very fast indeed.
2063920	2069920	These are genes that do something that has changed a lot over the last 6,500 years.
2069920	2071920	And one of the very nice things about this analysis
2071920	2074920	is that one of these genes is that one I just talked about,
2074920	2076920	the ergithionine transporter.
2076920	2079920	So you can see that gene here, it has a terrible name,
2079920	2081920	but nonetheless you can see that gene is one of these
2081920	2084920	that is significantly evolving faster than chance.
2085920	2087920	But there are some other neat ones here,
2087920	2090920	and this one clearly is the one that is evolving the fastest,
2090920	2093920	and this one is the one that affects all of us today.
2093920	2097920	So if you're sitting here listening to this scoffing your late night cereal
2097920	2100920	with a bowl of milk, then you can thank this gene for that.
2100920	2102920	If you're sitting here listening to this saying,
2102920	2104920	I wish I could have that bowl of milk, but it would make me sick,
2104920	2109920	you can blame this gene for that, because this is the lactase persistence gene.
2109920	2114920	And this is a very nice example of evolution, shaping evolution.
2114920	2117920	Because, as you will know, those of you in particular
2117920	2120920	who've got domestic pets, cats, dogs, et cetera,
2120920	2124920	the basic rule for all mammals is that baby mammals drink milk,
2124920	2126920	and big mammals don't, right?
2126920	2128920	If you have a puppy, a puppy drinks milk,
2128920	2131920	when you wean the puppy and have an adult dog,
2131920	2133920	if you give your adult dog a bowl of milk,
2133920	2135920	it will vomit it all back up again, okay?
2135920	2137920	And that is true for most mammals.
2137920	2139920	It is also historically true for humans.
2139920	2144920	Historically, evolutionarily, humans could also not consume milk as adults.
2144920	2146920	We would drink milk as babies, we would wean,
2146920	2149920	and then we would become what's called lactose intolerant,
2149920	2152920	because you would miss the enzyme to digest it.
2153920	2156920	That was not a problem, until we started dairying,
2156920	2160920	we started keeping cattle and sheep and other things for their milk.
2160920	2165920	And then it became quite useful to be able to digest that milk even as an adult.
2165920	2169920	There is a mutation that is presumably quite rare in nature
2169920	2172920	that keeps that gene on into adulthood.
2172920	2176920	And for the last million years or so, that's been totally irrelevant.
2176920	2179920	But suddenly when we started to have a ready source of milk as adults,
2179920	2181920	having that version of the gene was very beneficial.
2181920	2185920	And the time it was particularly beneficial was when times got really tough.
2185920	2189920	So, for example, in winter when there's no food around,
2189920	2192920	you were essentially on the brink of starvation.
2192920	2197920	If you had a cow and you could drink that milk and not vomit it back up again,
2197920	2199920	you had a significant chance of survival.
2199920	2202920	If you drank it and threw it back up again and got no calories from it,
2202920	2203920	that was not helpful.
2203920	2207920	And so what we see here is the very, very strong selective pressure
2207920	2211920	to have this version of the gene that allows us to metabolise milk.
2211920	2213920	And for those of you who listen to this thing,
2213920	2214920	yeah, but I'm lactose intolerant.
2214920	2217920	I'm sorry, you're one of these people down here who have got the older version of the gene
2217920	2222920	that is not conferring that ability to drink milk as an adult.
2222920	2226920	So this is an example where we have done something, we have evolved dairying,
2226920	2231920	and it has shaped our own genetic evolution quite dramatically.
2231920	2235920	And the other example you can see here is a whole cluster of genes down here,
2235920	2239920	which is all the different functions that they are all to do with the immune system.
2239920	2241920	And I said right at the beginning of this lecture
2241920	2245920	that one of the strongest forces in immunity is infectious disease,
2245920	2249920	because it kills people and in particular it kills young people before they have reproduced.
2249920	2255920	And so we should expect genes that confer resistance to disease to be evolving fast,
2255920	2256920	and they are.
2256920	2260920	So there are genes here that are evolving very, very fast.
2260920	2264920	And one of the reasons they have evolved particularly fast over the last few thousand years
2264920	2269920	is because we ourselves have dramatically increased the risk of infection.
2269920	2272920	And we've done that by living very close to each other,
2272920	2275920	we're all here in a fairly crowded hall for starters,
2275920	2277920	able to spread diseases quite well,
2277920	2281920	but also because we have brought into our lives things that spread diseases to us,
2281920	2286920	either deliberately or inadvertently, like this rather cute fluffy thing here for example,
2286920	2292920	rats, mice, the fleas they bring, the parasites they bring are often damaging to humans.
2293920	2299920	And so that onset of urbanisation and agriculture exposed us to new diseases.
2299920	2303920	And in particular one of the diseases of course that they brought,
2303920	2305920	that these animals brought with them,
2305920	2309920	that has been enormously influential in human evolution is this one here.
2309920	2312920	This is the bacteria that causes the bubonic plague.
2312920	2317920	And this as you will probably know is carried by, the bacteria is carried by fleas,
2317920	2319920	the fleas live on rodents.
2319920	2323920	So getting exposed to those fleas on either your pets
2323920	2326920	or more likely your rodents that live in your house
2326920	2329920	is the route by which you pick up bubonic plague.
2330920	2333920	It is very likely that bubonic plague has been around for a long time,
2333920	2337920	but it was a very minor evolutionary pressure when we were hunter-gatherers
2337920	2341920	because A, you didn't often come into contact with these things carrying it,
2341920	2345920	and B, even if you did, you were only living in a band of a few people,
2345920	2349920	even if it wiped out your tribe, it was not a major impact in terms of evolution.
2349920	2353920	When you start to live in a town or a village or a city of thousands of people,
2353920	2356920	now you have the opportunity to have proper pandemic plague
2356920	2359920	and a very significant evolutionary impact
2359920	2362920	because as we know only too well over the last few years,
2362920	2365920	disease spreads fast in crowded conditions.
2366920	2369920	And we know from very good historical data
2369920	2373920	that the magnitude of the impact of these bubonic plagues
2373920	2375920	has been quite astronomical.
2376920	2378920	So, for example, this is a picture of the plague of Ash Dodd,
2378920	2380920	which we don't actually know if that happened, but nonetheless,
2380920	2385920	but we do know from good contemporary historical data,
2385920	2389920	for example, that the plague of Justinian at the end of the Roman Empire
2389920	2391920	swept around the coastline of the Mediterranean
2391920	2394920	and multiple historians from that time
2394920	2397920	tell us that it killed about one in four people.
2397920	2399920	And bearing in mind, this is the Roman Empire,
2399920	2403920	this is the sort of centre of the global universe at that point.
2403920	2405920	So 25% of the people in the Mediterranean
2405920	2407920	was a big chunk of the world's population
2407920	2410920	who died within just a couple of years.
2410920	2412920	And then much closer to home, we're here in London,
2412920	2414920	those of us in the hall at least,
2414920	2417920	and we will all be very familiar with the impact of the black death in Europe,
2417920	2421920	the same disease, different name, same disease, same bacteria.
2421920	2425920	In particular, the black death which peaked around 1350,
2425920	2427920	at least in this part of the world,
2427920	2429920	is estimated to have wiped out
2429920	2433920	between 30% and 60% of the population of Europe.
2433920	2435920	So this is an enormous mortality,
2435920	2438920	a really, really strong selective force.
2438920	2441920	And so it stands to reason that the slightest advantage
2441920	2445920	would actually be a really, really big advantage in evolutionary terms.
2445920	2449920	Even if your chance of survival was 1% better than the guy next door,
2449920	2451920	over that kind of level of scale
2451920	2455920	that's going to be visible in our evolution.
2455920	2458920	And it turns out that that is indeed true.
2458920	2461920	And so there is an absolutely fantastic study
2461920	2463920	done by Elias Berreiro, which I really love,
2463920	2466920	which uses an amazing historical resource
2466920	2468920	just down the road from here.
2468920	2473920	So down at East Smithfield, just by Tarra London here,
2473920	2477920	in 1348, Edward III, who was king at the time,
2477920	2480920	was hiding well away from the plague, very sensible,
2480920	2484920	but watching London be decimated by plague,
2484920	2486920	he was very astute bit of biology.
2486920	2489920	Edward III thought this is not very good to have dead plague victims everywhere.
2489920	2491920	What I'll do is I'll buy a big lump of land,
2491920	2494920	I will dig a big hole, and I will tell my soldiers
2494920	2498920	to throw anyone who dies of the plague into that pit,
2498920	2500920	which is at East Smithfield.
2500920	2503920	And then by about 1350, the plague is over in London,
2503920	2505920	they cover over those dead bodies,
2505920	2507920	and a very astute bit of government there,
2507920	2509920	well, let's not waste this resource,
2509920	2511920	it's a little bit like HS2 in this country,
2511920	2513920	let's not waste this resource.
2513920	2514920	We've got a big pit.
2514920	2517920	I know we'll put other people in it now when they die on top.
2517920	2520920	So what you have in East Smithfield is a layer,
2520920	2522920	a layer of people who died of the plague,
2522920	2525920	and then above it, a layer of people who survived the plague
2525920	2527920	and died of something else a couple of years later.
2527920	2529920	And that is an amazing genetic tool
2529920	2532920	because you can look at the DNA of those different layers
2532920	2536920	and say, what are the genes that made you susceptible to the plague
2536920	2537920	when you're in the bottom layer,
2537920	2541920	or helps you resist the plague and you're in the top layer?
2541920	2543920	And when you do that, you find them.
2543920	2544920	It's fantastic.
2544920	2545920	So here we have a plot,
2545920	2547920	just like the one I showed you of all the genes,
2547920	2549920	and the ones up the top are the genes
2549920	2552920	that are significantly overrepresented in the survivors.
2552920	2554920	So if you had that version of the gene,
2554920	2557920	you were much more likely to make it through the plague.
2557920	2559920	You might have got run over by a horse the following year and died,
2559920	2561920	but you didn't get the plague and died.
2561920	2564920	So they were advantageous in helping you to survive.
2564920	2567920	For example, CTA4 or the ERAP genes there.
2567920	2572920	Unsurprisingly, these genes are all to do with immunity.
2572920	2576920	So, for example, the ERAP genes are used to reveal to the immune system
2576920	2578920	the presence of a pathogen.
2578920	2582920	Having those helped, presumably, these medieval Londoners to say,
2582920	2585920	oh my goodness, immune system, there's a bubonic plague happening here
2585920	2588920	to deal with it fast and help me survive.
2588920	2591920	So that version of the gene helped them survive
2591920	2593920	against the plague all those years ago,
2593920	2596920	and we can see that evolution today.
2596920	2600920	But the last twist to this tale, and perhaps a slightly miserable point to end on,
2600920	2603920	is that this gene, having these genes, is why we're all here today,
2603920	2606920	especially those of you who have long-distant London ancestors.
2606920	2611920	The reason you're alive today is because your great-grandparents
2611920	2614920	had this version of the gene and survived the plague.
2614920	2617920	Unfortunately, you've now got this version of the gene,
2617920	2620920	and that's probably also the reason if you're sitting there rubbing your knuckles
2620920	2622920	that you have rheumatoid arthritis.
2622920	2627920	Because it turns out that this gene is really good at triggering the immune system against plague.
2627920	2630920	Unfortunately, it's also a bit good at triggering it when you don't need to
2630920	2635920	and inducing autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
2635920	2639920	So what you end up with is a gene that was massively advantageous a long time ago,
2639920	2642920	now, unfortunately, having a bit of a negative consequence.
2642920	2645920	Of course, the really bad news is, as I said at the beginning,
2645920	2648920	evolution works on reproduction.
2648920	2653920	So it's really important to be resistant to plague and have your babies grow up.
2653920	2656920	By the time you get rheumatoid arthritis, most of us have done our reproduction.
2656920	2658920	It doesn't impact at all on our ability to reproduce,
2658920	2660920	and so evolution doesn't see this,
2660920	2663920	and so you're going to be stuck with this gene probably forever now
2663920	2666920	because there's no evolutionary pressure to remove it again for the population.
2666920	2668920	Bad luck, but that's evolution for you.
2668920	2670920	Thank you very much. I'm very happy to take questions.
2670920	2675920	APPLAUSE
2675920	2677920	OK, so for those listening online, can you hear that?
2677920	2679920	How has modern medicine changed evolution?
2679920	2681920	Well, I'm going to be really mean and say, stick around,
2681920	2684920	because the next lecture, we're going to talk a bit about that,
2684920	2687920	but I'll give you a quick spoiler alert.
2687920	2692920	So the short answer is, it is probably too soon to see anything particularly dramatic,
2692920	2699920	but there are some very nice examples of where we will very soon, I think, see evolutionary impacts.
2699920	2702920	And probably the biggest one is around reproduction,
2702920	2707920	because things like IVF, of course, have just changed this beautiful model I've shown you about.
2707920	2709920	It's all about how successful you are at reproducing,
2709920	2712920	because now you can reproduce if you actually couldn't reproduce previously,
2712920	2716920	or indeed you can choose not to reproduce even though you're biologically capable,
2716920	2718920	which is something that has not happened for millions of years
2718920	2722920	and is undoubtedly going to reshape evolution in some really interesting ways.
2722920	2723920	And that's all I'm going to say.
2723920	2725920	You'll have to tune in for the next lecture to find out some more.
2725920	2728920	I'm going to go to question online, then I come to the audience.
2728920	2730920	We have a whole series of questions,
2730920	2733920	which I think are kind of points of clarification about genetics, yes?
2733920	2738920	People are asking questions about how lactose intolerance genes
2738920	2741920	change their expression over the life course,
2741920	2746920	and whether, if you're lactose intolerant,
2746920	2748920	it means that one of your parents is lactose intolerant.
2748920	2751920	So they're just some people who want some clarification on those points.
2751920	2752920	Yeah, very good point.
2752920	2754920	So, and I just slightly brush over that.
2754920	2756920	So how does the lactose gene work?
2756920	2758920	So essentially you have a gene, lactase,
2758920	2761920	which helps you digest milk sugars, lactose.
2761920	2765920	If you can't digest the sugar, it makes you sick and you vomit it back up again.
2765920	2770920	So having that enzyme expressed produced is critical to be able to digest milk.
2770920	2773920	Genes work, you have the thing that you're making, so that enzyme,
2773920	2776920	and what's called a promoter sequence beside it,
2776920	2780920	which tells the body when to put that protein into production, when to turn it off.
2780920	2783920	So, for instance, there are some proteins that have produced
2783920	2786920	at different times of the menstrual cycle if you're female,
2786920	2788920	or when you go into adolescence or so on and so forth.
2788920	2792920	You don't want the gene for beards being turned on when you're six months old.
2792920	2794920	You only want it when you're in puberty.
2794920	2798920	And so those promoters are if you like the timer.
2798920	2802920	Lactase, this enzyme, has a timer which says,
2802920	2806920	turn me off forever as soon as you've finished, you know,
2806920	2809920	as soon as you've weaned, as soon as you've finished drinking milk from your mother.
2809920	2812920	And that works brilliantly well in all animals, including ourselves.
2812920	2815920	What we have done at some point in the evolutionary time
2815920	2817920	is there has been a mutation that has broken that switch,
2817920	2820920	and it stays on forever.
2820920	2824920	No use at all, in fact, possibly slightly disadvantageous
2824920	2827920	because you're making approaches of no relevance,
2827920	2830920	up until the point when you start being exposed to milk as an adult,
2830920	2832920	then massively, massively important.
2832920	2833920	So that's how it works.
2833920	2834920	And the question about inheritance.
2834920	2836920	So there are two sorts actually of lactase intolerance.
2836920	2837920	I should have made that clear.
2837920	2839920	The clean genetic type is that.
2839920	2841920	So if you don't have the enzyme, you can't digest the sugar,
2841920	2843920	you're lactase intolerant.
2843920	2846920	There are secondary issues, for example, allergies to milk,
2846920	2848920	which are nothing to do with that enzyme,
2848920	2852920	and are to do with whether you've been stimulated by a particular antigen,
2852920	2853920	so on and so forth.
2853920	2856920	So I guess the cautionary tale here is don't be listening to this at home
2856920	2859920	and thinking, oh, actually, my milk allergy is all nonsense.
2859920	2860920	I don't have that gene.
2860920	2861920	I'm going to go and drink milk.
2861920	2863920	If you've been told your milk allergic, don't drink milk.
2863920	2865920	Okay, regardless of whether you have this gene or not.
2865920	2866920	So there are different systems.
2866920	2869920	But yes, if you are genetically lactase intolerant,
2869920	2874920	then whether your children are or not depends on the gene of your partner too.
2874920	2877920	Because if your partner is lactase tolerant and they're lucky,
2877920	2878920	they'll get that gene and not yours.
2878920	2882920	Then on the lactose, my cat loves a nice drop of milk,
2882920	2885920	or yogurt, or cheese, or whatever.
2885920	2889920	And the story I've always heard is they became domesticated
2889920	2893920	when we took up dairy and they killed the mice and the rats in the dairy.
2893920	2897920	So is there something about cats that enables them to drink milk as adults?
2897920	2900920	So the question is about cats and cats that drink milk in particular
2900920	2901920	and how they got domesticated.
2901920	2903920	And this sort of reminds me of that thing about,
2903920	2905920	you know, you should never work in television with children or pets, right?
2905920	2907920	You should never answer questions about cats.
2907920	2911920	So the domestication of cats is actually a bit enigmatic.
2911920	2913920	I mean, we know it's quite early on.
2913920	2915920	And as anyone who owns a cat knows,
2915920	2918920	it's a bit unclear whether we domesticated them or they domesticated us.
2918920	2921920	Either way, they are now living with us.
2921920	2926920	So some cats are better at drinking milk than others.
2926920	2927920	So there's some variation there.
2927920	2928920	And I have to say, I don't know,
2928920	2931920	be interested now if anyone online listening to this can post in the chat,
2931920	2935920	whether they know whether that's because of the same sort of mutation or not.
2935920	2937920	Cheese, you mentioned about eating cheese.
2937920	2941920	So when you process milk into something, particularly hard cheeses,
2941920	2944920	actually the lactose is largely destroyed
2944920	2946920	because the fermentation process gets rid of that,
2946920	2949920	which is why people who are lactose intolerant usually can eat cheese,
2949920	2951920	but not drink raw milk.
2951920	2953920	So it depends a bit on the amount of lactose, too.
2955920	2956920	Okay, there's a question.
2956920	2958920	Again, I'm going to oscillate it.
2958920	2960920	Again, I'm trying to put together some questions here.
2960920	2965920	There are lots of people thinking about what future evolutionary pressures are likely to be.
2965920	2968920	They're talking about changes in diet, changes in obesity.
2968920	2972920	Somebody's mentioned that in Southeast Asia around Polynesia.
2972920	2974920	People have also said,
2974920	2976920	well, if you have all these pressures, modern-day pressures,
2976920	2980920	how does that play out now that there are fewer generations per century?
2980920	2983920	Because we are reproducing older,
2983920	2986920	and so where as we would have three or four generations a century ago,
2986920	2988920	now we only have two.
2988920	2990920	So that's very interesting.
2990920	2991920	I'm going to take the second part first.
2991920	2994920	So the question is about whether evolution is running at, again,
2994920	2998920	a different clock speed, I guess, if we reproduce more slowly, which we do now.
2998920	3001920	And the short answer is yes, generally it's true.
3001920	3004920	So evolution is measured on generational time.
3004920	3009920	So if you have, I don't know, 20 generations of 1,000 years or 15,
3009920	3011920	that makes a difference to the clock rate.
3011920	3014920	So to a first approximation, evolution is running more slowly.
3014920	3019920	The slight caveat to that is that it's also about the mutation rate in your DNA.
3019920	3022920	And as you get older, if you reproduce at older ages,
3022920	3025920	you carry more mutations, sorry to say, but it's true.
3025920	3030920	So there is a higher chance, I guess, of variability in your offspring.
3030920	3032920	That is not enough to compensate for the change.
3032920	3034920	So it's not that it will stay static.
3034920	3036920	We are still essentially evolving slightly more slowly,
3036920	3040920	but it's not a linear change in that kind of rate.
3040920	3043920	And in terms of the question about what's going to happen in the future,
3043920	3045920	I'm going to have a trailer for the next one.
3045920	3047920	I think there are lots of interesting things.
3047920	3052920	My teenage kids would tell me that a key skill for reproducing these days
3052920	3054920	would be able to use TikTok.
3054920	3058920	So maybe there will be a genetic selection for good use of TikTok.
3058920	3059920	I don't know.
3059920	3062920	But there are lots of things that will change.
3062920	3065920	For example, through most of human history,
3065920	3068920	being able to wield a weapon and kill your opponents
3068920	3070920	was quite a big selective force.
3070920	3074920	Happily, for most of us today, that's not a big selective force.
3074920	3077920	So even weegee people like me can successfully reproduce
3077920	3079920	because I haven't been attacked by someone with a sword.
3079920	3081920	Happily thus far, that's what I would.
3081920	3086920	I was just wondering, could you maybe argue that the most healthy diet is a paleo diet,
3086920	3088920	but then with a bit of milk and carbs?
3089920	3094920	And then the other thing was in reference to the question of the man behind me
3094920	3100920	about healthcare, could you maybe argue that with the onset of the industrial revolution,
3100920	3106920	the infant mortality rate has decreased from 50% to 1% less than 1%
3106920	3109920	and that's caused maybe quite a lot of mutation
3109920	3113920	and therefore we've maybe become more unhealthy as a population?
3114920	3116920	So there's a lot in those questions.
3116920	3118920	So going in reverse order,
3118920	3123920	so unfortunately infant mortality rate globally today is still at about 5% or 6%,
3123920	3127920	so that is good in the sense that it has fallen from highs of,
3127920	3132920	if you look historically, it was not unusual to lose half your children before the age of 5, for example.
3132920	3134920	So we've done quite well, I would argue,
3134920	3137920	this is an awfully long way to go, 5% is still a very big number.
3137920	3140920	So there is something about that.
3140920	3143920	In terms of the industrial revolution, I think that depends very much.
3143920	3148920	So seeing an evolutionary fingerprint of that would be difficult, I think,
3148920	3150920	because it was not even, right?
3150920	3152920	So there were indeed people who lived in,
3152920	3156920	so for example smog resistance might have been quite important, having good lungs,
3156920	3160920	it would have been important if you were in the middle of smoggy Manchester or London or something,
3160920	3164920	but actually a large part of the population was not exposed to that even during the industrial revolution
3164920	3167920	and so many of us will not have been through that selective pressure,
3167920	3169920	so I think that would be quite hard to see.
3169920	3172920	In terms of the best, I make it a point of principle,
3172920	3175920	never to advise people on the best possible diet,
3175920	3178920	but if I was to say it, so I think it's very tricky to say,
3178920	3180920	you know, the paleo diet is sort of attractive,
3180920	3183920	because I said hunter-gatherers had this better nutritional profile.
3183920	3188920	That is, of course, at a time when the switch was to subsistence agriculture
3188920	3191920	in a very different way than it is now.
3191920	3193920	Most of us, even people who grow your own,
3193920	3196920	you know, we're actually fortunately at very low risk of starving to death
3196920	3199920	because you can still always get down the road to the supermarket if you need to.
3199920	3202920	And so I think the idea that you just kind of roll back the clock
3202920	3205920	and go back to kind of a stone-age paleo diet and everything will be well
3205920	3208920	is a bit simplistic.
3208920	3211920	That, notwithstanding, there are certainly things about that diet
3211920	3216920	that would be useful advice for people like having fresh fruit and nuts and, you know, fibre.
3216920	3220920	We know is infinitely sensible and so that's kind of worth considering,
3220920	3222920	but I would caution against someone thinking,
3222920	3226920	let me live as a stone-age man and everything will be perfect.
3226920	3232920	How could mRNA vaccines affect and present in our genome and long-term health?
3232920	3237920	And what negative side effects could there be that we don't commonly speak about?
3237920	3238920	Oh, that's an interesting question.
3238920	3241920	I said mRNA vaccines, which we're all familiar with.
3241920	3245920	So the clever thing about mRNA vaccines is they don't integrate into your genomes.
3245920	3248920	They produce a protein, but they don't get inherited.
3248920	3253920	So if, like me, and hopefully, like all of you, you've been vaccinated quite possibly with an mRNA vaccine,
3253920	3255920	you're not going to pass it on to your kids.
3255920	3257920	It's not inherited in any way.
3257920	3260920	It is a transient, if you like, process.
3260920	3262920	I think there's a sort of second part to the question there,
3262920	3268920	which is theoretically you could do something that is stably inherited that might be useful.
3268920	3270920	So, for example, you could tweak people's immune system.
3270920	3273920	So one thing you could do right is you could go back to those genes that we know
3273920	3275920	have protected against bubonic plague and you could say,
3275920	3281920	well, maybe we should kind of change those in the genome of people who don't have that version to make them more resistant.
3281920	3286920	There are very plausible reasons that you might want to do that for kind of infectious disease purposes.
3286920	3290920	I think the rheumatoid arthritis example is a good caution against that.
3290920	3295920	Of course, you might do something for all the best intentions to change in one way,
3295920	3301920	but you need to be very, very cautious about the unintended consequences about unleashing some secondary effect there.
3301920	3308920	In terms of the question itself, mRNA vaccines definitely don't affect your genome in terms of any inherited way.
3308920	3309920	Actually, I'm a huge fan.
3309920	3313920	I think they're a massively exciting technology that has been hugely beneficial for COVID-19
3313920	3316920	and hopefully will be for lots of other things in the future.
3316920	3319920	We'll talk a little bit about that in next year's series.
3319920	3324920	So if you're really keen to come back, see you in 2025 and we'll talk about those.
3324920	3329920	The map you showed at the beginning with the hybridisation events showed one in Australia.
3329920	3335920	Does that mean that earlier it formed a human reach Australia and so which ones?
3335920	3339920	Australia is like cats, a very contentious topic.
3339920	3346920	So in terms of interbreeding, what we know definitively is that homo sapiens interbreed
3346920	3351920	with Neanderthals in Europe and with Denisovans in essentially Siberia.
3351920	3354920	Everything else is not known in terms of integration.
3354920	3359920	There is a little bit of evidence about some interbreeding with a mysterious species that we don't know yet.
3359920	3361920	That's still far from determined.
3361920	3369920	The arrival of ancient humans in Australia is a massively contested date, which is a wildly variable.
3369920	3373920	As far as I know, although I'm happy to be corrected by those listening online or those in the room,
3373920	3376920	there's no evidence for specific interbreeding in that region.
3376920	3381920	Actually, the entire question of who arrived in Australia when is strongly contested.
3381920	3388920	One of the most interesting things just in the last few weeks is the whole genome data on native Australian populations.
3388920	3393920	There is very interesting, very high levels of diversity in those Aboriginal populations,
3393920	3397920	which is very interesting in terms of their dynamics.
3397920	3403920	For example, it looks like different groups did not mix that radically early on in the history of Australia.
3403920	3409920	I think there's an untapped interesting science question there about the human evolution within Australia.
3409920	3413920	That doesn't answer your question about meeting with other groups outside of it, though.
3413920	3418920	I think we have time for two questions. I want to take one question here and then I'll come to you for the last question because you've had to hand up.
3418920	3430920	Some people are really interested in language when you've showed the Fox P2 and how language conferred potentially at sort of an advantage reproductively.
3430920	3440920	But they've kind of extended it forward in their questions to ask how culture and human culture and art and potentially even religion
3440920	3444920	may have imprinted on our genome and had selection pressures.
3444920	3448920	Another brilliant question, and again, I feel like some kind of, you know, I keep saying, you know,
3448920	3453920	follow me for the next exciting one because in a future lecture, we will talk a little bit about that kind of cultural evolution,
3453920	3456920	but let me talk a bit about that now. So language, absolutely.
3456920	3462920	I think language is kind of one of those interesting places where it's not quite as obvious as survival advantages like fighting off infection
3462920	3465920	or, you know, growing good and true or whatever.
3465920	3468920	But it's probably, it's less culturally, there's something more intrinsic, right?
3468920	3472920	If you can't speak, if you can't communicate, it is quite difficult to reproduce.
3472920	3474920	So that's in that high of a place.
3474920	3480920	I absolutely think that culture itself will also select, and we know anecdotally, right, about certain things.
3480920	3485920	Historically, if you were the wrong religion, your chance of successful reproduction was a lot lower
3485920	3487920	because you might have been burned at the stake or whatever.
3487920	3492920	But usually, those periods are relatively brief, evolutionarily speaking.
3492920	3499920	I'd be kind of surprised if you could see enough genetics, for example, around religious belief or cultural belief,
3499920	3503920	because they're so short and they're so localised, but I'm always happy to be proven wrong.
3503920	3511920	And who knows in the future we might discover, you know, some strong genetic factor for religious conformity or something.
3511920	3513920	Final question, I think.
3513920	3516920	Very interesting lecture. I really appreciate it.
3516920	3527920	I'm not a medical qualified, I'm not a physicist, but the impression, again, is that modern medical science is causing us to defy evolution, evolutionary pressures.
3527920	3534920	Do you think we're in the long term able to keep up with evolution of viruses and bacteria
3534920	3539920	so that we'll always have a solution to whatever falls us?
3539920	3543920	That's a high-pressure question to end on, isn't it? Will we survive forever?
3543920	3549920	So, rather than defy evolution, I would say we are certainly changing it so happily, right?
3549920	3554920	So many of the things that killed babies 300 years ago are not a big worry to us, at least here in Western Europe.
3554920	3558920	And that's a great thing. It clearly changes the evolutionary impact.
3558920	3561920	I think the idea that we've somehow stepped off the evolutionary matter, though, is a mistake.
3561920	3566920	There are other pressures now. There are lots of other things that influence whether we reproduce and whether our kids reproduce,
3566920	3569920	for example, cultural things, and they will play a role, too.
3569920	3575920	I'm pretty optimistic, generally, about the opportunity for medicine to deal with big disasters,
3575920	3579920	and we've seen, happily, a very strong response to Covid-19.
3579920	3583920	Am I optimistic that we'll be able to do that forever? Not so much.
3583920	3588920	Historically, most species come to an end at some point.
3588920	3591920	The only question is, is it going to be in 100 years or a million years?
3591920	3594920	Voting, well, I guess 100, I'm still going to be gone. It doesn't really matter.
3594920	3598920	But, you know, let's aim towards a million, at least. That'd be good.
3598920	3603920	And on that positive note, I'd just like to thank Professor May again.
3603920	3606920	Your next lecture is when, and that's going to be...
3606920	3610920	That's a good question. It's about four or five weeks time, I think, and we're going to be answering some of the questions
3610920	3614920	that you asked tonight, actually, about the impact of society, human impact,
3614920	3618920	things like antibiotics, disease resistance, and where we might all go from here.
3618920	3622920	So, come back again, find out more, have more of your questions answered.
3622920	3624920	Thank you again.
