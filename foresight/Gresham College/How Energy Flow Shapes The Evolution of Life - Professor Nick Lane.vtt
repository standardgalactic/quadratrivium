And so you're beginning to get a different sense of the structure of life when you look at this.

03:46.300 --> 03:52.460
And it's a cold one because it pushes us into a corner where we don't really like to be very much,

05:02.700 --> 05:05.700
I gave rise to all large complex organisms.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.740
And nobody can agree about what that was,

05:08.740 --> 05:12.220
which I enjoy telling my students because it's a problem for them.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.220
I can highlight where the answer might lie,

05:15.220 --> 05:21.520
but I like to try to get this across to the public as much as possible as well.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.600
Because we live in a managerial age,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.820
where we try and say what the solution is going to be,

05:25.820 --> 05:27.540
and then we do the research to get to the solution.

05:27.540 --> 05:28.960
That's not how science works.

05:29.240 --> 05:36.280
Y ffact is, we really don't know a great deal about why life evolved the way it actually did.

05:37.080 --> 05:44.840
And I also find it encouraging that some of the greatest biologists and the greatest thinkers of the 20th century can't agree on them, themselves either.

05:45.080 --> 05:50.000
So, Jacques Moner wrote a famous book called Chance and Necessity in 1971.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.920
It's a wonderful book. Really, at the dawn of molecular biology when people just understood what the genetic code was

05:56.920 --> 06:01.320

09:51.460 --> 09:54.320
I think we probably can.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.400
So, really, I think perhaps the intellectual godfather

09:57.400 --> 09:59.740
of any questions about what life is,

09:59.740 --> 10:02.000
is Erwin Schrodinger, the great physicist,

who wrote a famous book 75 years ago this year, in fact,

10:05.840 --> 10:07.520

And his book was a direct inspiration to Watson and Crick and Rosalind Franklin and the discovery of the DNA double helix.

10:51.720 --> 11:01.360
The other thing he talked about though was energy or specifically entropy or what he called negative entropy or neg entropy,

11:01.360 --> 11:03.960
which is really a measure of disorder.

If you're not familiar with it, it's usually called the universal energy currency.

15:26.340 --> 15:30.340
You can think of it as a kind of coin that goes in the slot machine,

15:30.340 --> 15:34.340
and the slot machine does its thing, it's an enzyme, it does a particular job,

15:34.340 --> 15:37.340
you put the coin in, it does its job, you put another coin in, it does its job again.

15:37.340 --> 15:46.340
So this is how cells work, they're powered by machines, using effectively the currency, the ATP.

15:47.340 --> 15:54.340
So this idea that it's kind of like a hydroelectric power scheme,

15:54.340 --> 16:02.340
came from one of the most brilliant and eccentric Englishmen of the 20th century scientists, Peter Mitchell.

16:02.340 --> 16:07.340
And he put these ideas forward initially in 1961.

16:07.340 --> 16:12.340
This is somewhat before that, that's the late 1940s when he was in Cambridge,

16:12.340 --> 16:16.340
with Jennifer Moyle, who was a lifelong collaborator.

16:16.340 --> 16:20.340
She was, in fact, a brilliant experimentalist.

16:20.340 --> 16:26.340
Mitchell was a brilliant thinker, and rather cac-handed in the lab, I'm told.

16:26.340 --> 16:29.340
And so it was Jennifer Moyle who really did all the experiments,

16:29.340 --> 16:33.340
and Mitchell who did a lot of the thinking, and Moyle herself was brilliant.

16:33.340 --> 16:36.340
She was one of the first women to get a...

16:36.340 --> 16:39.340
Actually, she was not awarded a degree in Cambridge,

16:39.340 --> 16:42.340
they didn't award degrees to women in the 1940s.

16:42.340 --> 16:45.340
But an equivalent, I don't recall what the term is.

16:45.340 --> 16:52.340
She had been involved in cracking codes in the war and had been head of some division,

16:52.340 --> 16:56.340
which again was very unusual for a woman to be in that position at that time.

16:56.340 --> 17:01.340
The Nobel Prize went to Mitchell in the end by himself.

17:01.340 --> 17:05.340
There's always arguments about how these things should be apportioned.

17:06.340 --> 17:11.340
I don't know enough about it, but I think if it were today, it would have gone to both of them.

17:11.340 --> 17:16.340
And science is really about experiments as much as it is about thinking.

17:16.340 --> 17:18.340
It's the combination of the two.

17:18.340 --> 17:22.340
If it hadn't been for her, experiments Mitchell's ideas would have really come to nothing.

17:22.340 --> 17:25.340
Anyway, but Mitchell was a great thinker,

17:25.340 --> 17:29.340
and he came at these questions about how cell respiration works.

17:29.340 --> 17:34.340
From thinking about bacteria, his real question on bacteria

17:34.340 --> 17:37.340
was how do they keep their insides different to their outsides?

17:37.340 --> 17:39.340
It's a very simple, basic question,

17:39.340 --> 17:43.340
and one of those great questions that takes decades to answer.

17:43.340 --> 17:48.340
He gave a talk in Moscow in 1957 on the origin of life.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.340
There was a whole conference on the origin of life,

17:50.340 --> 17:55.340
and a lot of the people who were interested in that kind of question at the time were there,

17:55.340 --> 17:59.340
so JD Bernal and JBS Haldane, they're all communists actually,

17:59.340 --> 18:01.340
and they all went to Moscow,

18:01.340 --> 18:05.340
and they were interested in Moscow in a materialist explanation for the world,

18:05.340 --> 18:11.340
which is why a lot of the people who were working on those questions shared this materialist conception.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.340
Mitchell was there, and he was far from being a materialist.

18:14.340 --> 18:17.340
He was quite kind of almost a spiritualist in his outlook,

18:17.340 --> 18:21.340
but he said, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.

18:21.340 --> 18:25.340
From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases

18:25.340 --> 18:30.340
between which dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.340
Virtually every definition of life that you will ever see is going to say,

18:35.340 --> 18:39.340
this is what an organism is, and the environment is something different.

18:39.340 --> 18:43.340
Mitchell really here is saying that the environment and the organism

18:43.340 --> 18:46.340
are two equivalent phases separated by a membrane.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.340
It's a very different perception of what life is.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.340
If you're thinking about the origin of life,

18:51.340 --> 18:54.340
and you're beginning to think about compartments and phases and things,

18:54.340 --> 18:59.340
this kind of conception makes, to me, a lot more sense.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.340
It's not a satisfying definition of life,

19:01.340 --> 19:03.340
but it certainly gives you a different perspective

19:03.340 --> 19:08.340
that on opposite sides of a membrane, which is a millionth of a millimetre in thickness,

19:08.340 --> 19:10.340
you have two phases.

19:10.340 --> 19:12.340
One is the inside of the cell, the other is the outside of the cell.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.340
They are different, and the only way they can be different

19:14.340 --> 19:19.340
is if you actively pumping things out or bringing things in,

19:19.340 --> 19:21.340
and that costs energy.

19:22.340 --> 19:24.340
How do the first cells do it?

19:24.340 --> 19:26.340
Well, you can see it.

19:26.340 --> 19:32.340
The clue is in methane,

19:32.340 --> 19:36.340
so the cows produce massive amounts of methane.

19:36.340 --> 19:40.340
They do it because they harbour particular types of archaea,

19:40.340 --> 19:43.340
so it represents this domain of life called methanogens.

19:43.340 --> 19:46.340
We all have methanogens as well,

19:46.340 --> 19:49.340
especially those of you who can light your own for hot.

19:49.340 --> 19:53.340
So these are methanogens, and what they're doing is

19:53.340 --> 19:56.340
they're taking carbon dioxide and hydrogen

19:56.340 --> 19:59.340
and reacting them together to make methane,

19:59.340 --> 20:02.340
and they're getting all the energy and all the carbon

20:02.340 --> 20:04.340
that they need to grow from that reaction alone.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.340
So the methane is the waste product,

20:06.340 --> 20:09.340
and it's just farted out, I suppose.

20:11.340 --> 20:20.340
But you'll all probably be aware that if we could make hydrogen and CO2 react easily,

20:20.340 --> 20:23.340
we could solve a lot of problems in the world.

20:23.340 --> 20:26.340
So we already can split water.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.340
We can effectively mimic photosynthesis,

20:28.340 --> 20:31.340
split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen,

20:31.340 --> 20:34.340
which is what photosynthesis does.

20:34.340 --> 20:36.340
We can forget about the oxygen

20:36.340 --> 20:38.340
or react it directly with the hydrogen,

20:38.340 --> 20:41.340
but nobody's particularly interested in the hydrogen economy.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.340
It's a difficult thing to do.

20:43.340 --> 20:47.340
If you could react the hydrogen with CO2 and make synthetic gasoline,

20:47.340 --> 20:49.340
that would solve a lot of problems.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.340
You can strip the CO2 out of the atmosphere,

20:51.340 --> 20:53.340
or at least remain a neutral state,

20:53.340 --> 20:57.340
and you can make the entire plastics industry

20:57.340 --> 20:59.340
and all the energy and so on

20:59.340 --> 21:02.340
can be done from this reaction.

21:02.340 --> 21:07.340
To my knowledge, nobody has succeeded in doing it in an economic way.

21:07.340 --> 21:09.340
Perhaps they have, and they're not telling us.

21:09.340 --> 21:11.340
But the cells, these methanogens,

21:11.340 --> 21:15.340
they grow from that without any energy input at the door.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.340
So they can make it work economically,

21:18.340 --> 21:20.340
and it's interesting to wonder how they do it.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.340
Well, the way they actually do it

21:22.340 --> 21:25.340
is they need a proton gradient across a membrane.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.340
That's to say they're doing exactly the same thing

21:27.340 --> 21:29.340
that we do in our mitochondria.

21:29.340 --> 21:31.340
They're pumping protons across a membrane,

21:31.340 --> 21:33.340
so on one side they've got a high proton concentration,

21:33.340 --> 21:36.340
the other side they don't.

21:36.340 --> 21:39.340
And they use that, not to make ATP,

21:39.340 --> 21:41.340
they do use it to make ATP, but more importantly,

21:41.340 --> 21:43.340
they use it to power the reaction

21:43.340 --> 21:47.340
between hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.340
And this is roughly what the issue is.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.340
Don't worry about this.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.340
If it's going uphill, you have to put energy in.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.340
If it's going downhill, you're getting energy out.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.340
That's really all you need to take home from this.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.340
But there's two lines on there,

21:58.340 --> 22:02.340
and right at the top you can see it says H-C-H-O.

22:02.340 --> 22:04.340
That's formaldehyde.

22:04.340 --> 22:07.340
So to go from carbon dioxide to methane,

22:07.340 --> 22:09.340
you have to put energy in for the first couple of steps

22:09.340 --> 22:12.340
to get up to formaldehyde.

22:12.340 --> 22:14.340
And then it's energetically downhill all the way.

22:14.340 --> 22:16.340
So that's the problem.

22:16.340 --> 22:18.340
That uphill bit is the difficulty

22:18.340 --> 22:20.340
with making hydrogen react with CO2.

22:20.340 --> 22:24.340
There's a barrier to their reaction, an energetic barrier.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.340
And what the methanogens do is they lower that barrier

22:26.340 --> 22:30.340
and they lower it by using a proton gradient.

22:30.340 --> 22:33.340
So how do they actually do it?

22:33.340 --> 22:39.340
Well, to think about it is a very good way

22:39.340 --> 22:41.340
to think about the origin of life.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.340
Because these same conditions,

22:43.340 --> 22:47.340
you find them in a particular type of hydrothermal vent.

22:47.340 --> 22:50.340
We see natural proton gradients,

22:50.340 --> 22:53.340
barriers between compartments,

22:53.340 --> 22:56.340
lots of hydrogen gas and CO2.

22:56.340 --> 22:59.340
And those cells live in that kind of environment even today.

22:59.340 --> 23:01.340
And so you can begin to think,

23:01.340 --> 23:05.340
well, how would the structure of this environment begin to help?

23:05.340 --> 23:08.340
And it gives us an insight into how they might do it

23:08.340 --> 23:10.340
and also how we might do it.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.340
So this particular type of vent,

23:12.340 --> 23:17.340
we're only discovered about 15 years ago or so.

23:17.340 --> 23:19.340
Let me just go back to that.

23:19.340 --> 23:22.340
They don't look much like the familiar black smokers

23:22.340 --> 23:24.340
that most people have seen,

23:24.340 --> 23:27.340
belching black smoke out of the top.

23:27.340 --> 23:29.340
I suppose you could call them white nonsmokers.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.340
There's no smoke coming out

23:31.340 --> 23:36.340
and they carbonate limestone rocks, really, aragonite, in fact.

23:36.340 --> 23:39.340
But they are very active.

23:39.340 --> 23:42.340
And there's no animal life around it in particular.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.340
There are a few fish every now and then,

23:44.340 --> 23:47.340
but they're full of bacteria and archaea

23:47.340 --> 23:49.340
and the kind of cells that live there.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.340
And this kind of environment,

23:51.340 --> 23:54.340
we're fairly sure would have existed on the early earth as well.

23:54.340 --> 23:56.340
So the black smokers were not so certain about,

23:56.340 --> 24:00.340
but these type of vents would certainly have been present

24:00.340 --> 24:03.340
four billion years ago on the early earth.

24:03.340 --> 24:06.340
And they were first pointed out by this guy, Mike Russell,

24:06.340 --> 24:09.340
who's a kind of mad geologist.

24:09.340 --> 24:12.340
He's a brilliant scientist,

24:12.340 --> 24:15.340
but he enjoys winding people up, I think.

24:15.340 --> 24:18.340
And some of his ideas...

24:18.340 --> 24:21.340
The origin of life is a really fractured field

24:21.340 --> 24:25.340
and people come in from the background with chemistry, for example,

24:25.340 --> 24:27.340
or a background of geology,

24:27.340 --> 24:30.340
or a background of biology, or a background of genetics.

24:30.340 --> 24:32.340
People come from very different places

24:32.340 --> 24:36.340
and converge on these questions about the origin of life.

24:36.340 --> 24:39.340
So it's not surprising that we don't agree with each other very much.

24:39.340 --> 24:42.340
Often we don't even speak the same language.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.340
I think most people are trying to learn to speak the same language,

24:46.340 --> 24:49.340
but we can't agree even then what the real question is,

24:49.340 --> 24:53.340
because it's a long way to go from simple chemical reactions

24:53.340 --> 24:56.340
to a replicating cell with all of this machinery.

24:56.340 --> 24:59.340
Which bit are you going to focus on?

24:59.340 --> 25:04.340
We're all interested in different aspects of really different problems,

25:04.340 --> 25:08.340
all of which goes under this term, origin of life.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.340
So Mike Russell was talking about these kind of vents

25:11.340 --> 25:14.340
ten years before they were actually discovered.

25:14.340 --> 25:20.340
And the language he used was the language of geochemistry.

25:20.340 --> 25:23.340
And it was really an unfamiliar language

25:23.340 --> 25:27.340
to most chemists working on the subject, or to the biologists.

25:27.340 --> 25:31.340
I struggled a lot with his terms to begin with.

25:31.340 --> 25:35.340
And then they discovered, Deb Kelly in fact,

25:35.340 --> 25:38.340
discovered this lost city vent that I just showed you the picture of.

25:38.340 --> 25:41.340
Ten years after he'd been talking about these vents

25:41.340 --> 25:44.340
as the best setting for the origin of life.

25:44.340 --> 25:47.340
And suddenly he became famous, almost overnight he became famous.

25:47.340 --> 25:51.340
And this was a photoshop job that nature did.

25:51.340 --> 25:54.340
So nature is one of the great science journals.

25:54.340 --> 25:57.340
And they had a feature article on Mike's work

25:57.340 --> 26:01.340
and dressed him up as Erasmus, as the renaissance man.

26:01.340 --> 26:05.340
And they called him nasance man, nasance as in the birth of life.

26:05.340 --> 26:10.340
And he built a reactor at NASA, JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

26:10.340 --> 26:13.340
to try and study these conditions.

26:13.340 --> 26:16.340
And here's a little bit of lost city vent in the background.

26:16.340 --> 26:20.340
He made a number of predictions as to what the important conditions were.

26:20.340 --> 26:24.340
And the key ones really is that they should be very rich in hydrogen gas,

26:24.340 --> 26:26.340
which is true.

26:26.340 --> 26:30.340
And that there should be the walls of the ancient vents,

26:30.340 --> 26:32.340
not the modern ones, but the ancient ones should have contained

26:32.340 --> 26:35.340
catalytic iron sulfur minerals.

26:35.340 --> 26:37.340
That also seems to be true.

26:37.340 --> 26:39.340
But the main point that he was talking about

26:39.340 --> 26:41.340
is there were natural proton gradients.

26:41.340 --> 26:45.340
Because you have alkaline fluids, which really don't have many protons.

26:45.340 --> 26:47.340
They're deficient in protons.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.340
And a relatively acidic early ocean.

26:49.340 --> 26:52.340
Lots of carbon dioxide, full of protons.

26:52.340 --> 26:56.340
And so the two were mingling inside these vents.

26:56.340 --> 27:01.340
And you would have very steep proton gradients within the vents.

27:01.340 --> 27:03.340
We don't really know how steep.

27:03.340 --> 27:06.340
We don't know a great deal about these vents.

27:06.340 --> 27:10.340
But you can at least imagine how it might work.

27:10.340 --> 27:15.340
Essentially what the methanogens are doing and how, in essence,

27:16.340 --> 27:22.340
the proton concentration changes the reactivity of both hydrogen and CO2.

27:22.340 --> 27:26.340
In alkaline fluids, hydrogen is more reactive.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.340
It wants to offload its electrons onto something else.

27:29.340 --> 27:34.340
And in acidic conditions, CO2 is more reactive.

27:34.340 --> 27:37.340
It's going to accept the electrons because it can accept protons

27:37.340 --> 27:39.340
to balance the charges as well.

27:39.340 --> 27:43.340
And so if you've got two channels next to each other,

27:43.340 --> 27:46.340
the CO2 in acid conditions is going to be more receptive

27:46.340 --> 27:51.340
to picking up electrons and protons and becoming an organic molecule.

27:51.340 --> 27:54.340
And if you have hydrogen in an alkaline channel,

27:54.340 --> 27:57.340
it really wants to be rid of its electrons.

27:57.340 --> 28:01.340
And the protons will react with the hydroxide ions to make water,

28:01.340 --> 28:04.340
which is thermodynamically very favoured.

28:04.340 --> 28:08.340
But if they mix, then, of course, you've lost that.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.340
You've lost the structure. You've lost the barrier.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.340
You don't have a pH difference anymore.

28:13.340 --> 28:16.340
And so you've lost everything. It's the structure that really matters.

28:16.340 --> 28:18.340
And it's the structure that we have here.

28:18.340 --> 28:22.340
And these minerals that we think you would have found in these ancient vents

28:22.340 --> 28:26.340
in which you find today in methanogens are the ion-sulfur minerals.

28:26.340 --> 28:28.340
And they're semiconducting.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.340
So you could imagine, at least,

28:30.340 --> 28:33.340
that the hydrogen would pass electrons onto this barrier

28:33.340 --> 28:35.340
and across the barrier onto CO2.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.340
And that it's equivalent to a cell membrane,

28:37.340 --> 28:39.340
and it's the same structure as a cell membrane,

28:39.340 --> 28:41.340
and this is how methanogens might do it.

28:41.340 --> 28:45.340
Well, you could call that a wild bit of imagination,

28:45.340 --> 28:47.340
or you could call it a hypothesis.

28:47.340 --> 28:50.340
A hypothesis, I think Peter Meddewa said,

28:50.340 --> 28:53.340
is a rash leap into the unknown,

28:53.340 --> 28:55.340
but at least it's testable.

28:55.340 --> 28:57.340
That's what makes it science.

28:57.340 --> 29:00.340
And so we built a little reactor.

29:00.340 --> 29:03.340
It's a very humble reactor, really,

29:03.340 --> 29:05.340
and it doesn't work very well.

29:05.340 --> 29:08.340
But we've been playing with this for a few years now,

29:08.340 --> 29:12.340
and we've decided that we need to build a better one.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.340
We need to make it smaller.

29:14.340 --> 29:17.340
We're actually now building a microfluidic version of this,

29:17.340 --> 29:20.340
but I'm only showing you this version for two reasons.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.340
One of them, we can precipitate the right kind of minerals

29:23.340 --> 29:25.340
inside these little vent structures here.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.340
And the second one is we're trying to simulate the conditions

29:28.340 --> 29:30.340
where we have hydrogen and alkaline fluids on the inside

29:30.340 --> 29:34.340
with a semiconducting barrier and CO2 in acidic fluids on the other side,

29:34.340 --> 29:38.340
and that should drive the formation of organic matter.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.340
And this is formaldehyde,

29:40.340 --> 29:43.340
which is the top of that curve that I showed you a few minutes ago.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.340
This is the hard point, so we're not especially interested in formaldehyde,

29:46.340 --> 29:48.340
but if you can make that, you can make anything.

29:48.340 --> 29:50.340
And this is only two hours.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.340
So under those conditions,

29:52.340 --> 29:55.340
we're seeing a substantial rise in formaldehyde.

29:55.340 --> 29:58.340
The trouble with this is trying to keep the conditions

29:58.340 --> 30:02.340
under any form of control, and so we're trying to do it better.

30:02.340 --> 30:05.340
We've not even published that yet.

30:05.340 --> 30:07.340
So I'm not going to talk about that,

30:07.340 --> 30:11.340
but I'd like to think what are the consequences,

30:11.340 --> 30:14.340
if, big if, what I'm telling you is true,

30:14.340 --> 30:18.340
that life started in these hydrothermal vents,

30:18.340 --> 30:22.340
and they started there because the structure of these vents

30:22.340 --> 30:25.340
favours the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,

30:25.340 --> 30:28.340
the proton gradients across membranes or across barriers,

30:28.340 --> 30:30.340
because that's still how cells work.

30:30.340 --> 30:35.340
And cells now get their hydrogen from almost anywhere.

30:35.340 --> 30:37.340
So in photosynthesis, it splits water,

30:37.340 --> 30:40.340
and the hydrogen is extracted from water,

30:40.340 --> 30:43.340
and it's cobbled onto CO2 to make organic molecules.

30:43.340 --> 30:47.340
But the basic reaction is hydrogen reacting with CO2

30:47.340 --> 30:51.340
in oxygenic photosynthesis, where the waste product is oxygen.

30:51.340 --> 30:53.340
But there's other types of photosynthesis.

30:53.340 --> 30:55.340
You can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor.

30:55.340 --> 30:58.340
You take the hydrogen out of it, you leave the sulfur behind,

30:58.340 --> 31:00.340
you cobble it onto CO2,

31:00.340 --> 31:02.340
or you're growing like a methanogen in the vent.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.340
The hydrogen is bubbling out of the ground,

31:04.340 --> 31:07.340
you simply cobble it onto CO2.

31:07.340 --> 31:11.340
Life all across Earth is based on the reaction

31:11.340 --> 31:13.340
between hydrogen and CO2.

31:13.340 --> 31:15.340
And we go round eating things,

31:15.340 --> 31:19.340
but we're entirely dependent on the primary producers,

31:19.340 --> 31:21.340
the plants and the bacteria,

31:21.340 --> 31:24.340
which are basically reacting hydrogen with CO2.

31:25.340 --> 31:28.340
Hydrogen and CO2 don't react

31:28.340 --> 31:32.340
except under these rather careful conditions,

31:32.340 --> 31:34.340
where you have structure,

31:34.340 --> 31:36.340
the same kind of structure that we see in cells.

31:36.340 --> 31:39.340
So how common are those conditions likely to be?

31:39.340 --> 31:42.340
On the early Earth, we think that they would have been

31:42.340 --> 31:45.340
basically all the way across the sea floor.

31:45.340 --> 31:48.340
Because it's a reaction between rock and water.

31:48.340 --> 31:52.340
So this is, if you imagine this is the sea floor,

31:52.340 --> 31:55.340
and then down beneath in the crust underneath the sea floor,

31:55.340 --> 32:01.340
these green rocks here are rich in minerals like olivine.

32:01.340 --> 32:04.340
So olivine is iron, magnesium rich rock,

32:04.340 --> 32:06.340
mostly found in the mantle of the Earth today,

32:06.340 --> 32:09.340
which is why you don't see so many reactions like this anymore,

32:09.340 --> 32:12.340
but four billion years ago there wasn't really such a difference

32:12.340 --> 32:14.340
between the mantle and the crust.

32:14.340 --> 32:17.340
So we think these reactions would happen almost everywhere.

32:17.340 --> 32:21.340
The water percolates down to depths of five or six kilometres

32:21.340 --> 32:25.340
beneath the crust, and will react with these rocks.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.340
So if you were to take a lump of olivine

32:27.340 --> 32:29.340
and put it in a bucket of water,

32:29.340 --> 32:32.340
you'd probably get one bubble in about a week's time.

32:32.340 --> 32:34.340
It's not something, you know,

32:34.340 --> 32:37.340
it's not an experiment you want to do for the kids.

32:37.340 --> 32:39.340
But at the higher temperatures and pressures

32:39.340 --> 32:41.340
down at the bottom of the sea floor,

32:41.340 --> 32:44.340
it really is bubbling with hydrogen gas.

32:44.340 --> 32:46.340
It's a pretty vigorous reaction.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.340
And that's really all it takes.

32:48.340 --> 32:51.340
It's the reaction between water and rock

32:51.340 --> 32:54.340
to produce strongly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen gas.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.340
It's an exothermic reaction,

32:56.340 --> 32:58.340
which means it's producing heat,

32:58.340 --> 33:01.340
and so these are buoyant warm fluids which percolate back up.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.340
And when they get to the sea floor,

33:03.340 --> 33:06.340
they react with the waters of the ocean,

33:06.340 --> 33:09.340
the minerals in the ocean to precipitate as these vents.

33:09.340 --> 33:12.340
So the reaction between rock and water is down below the sea floor,

33:12.340 --> 33:15.340
but the vents themselves are up at the sea floor.

33:15.340 --> 33:19.340
So they should happen on any wet rocky planet.

33:19.340 --> 33:23.340
And there's actually quite a lot of lovely suggestions

33:23.340 --> 33:27.340
from across our own solar system that they do happen.

33:27.340 --> 33:31.340
So Mars, there's traces of methane,

33:31.340 --> 33:33.340
thought to be traces of methane on Mars.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.340
Where does it come from?

33:35.340 --> 33:37.340
The wishful thinkers hope it comes from life.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.340
It's possible it does.

33:39.340 --> 33:42.340
But it's more likely that it comes from exactly this same process

33:42.340 --> 33:45.340
of rocks reacting with water.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.340
There is water on Mars still,

33:47.340 --> 33:50.340
mostly frozen and mostly beneath the surface.

33:50.340 --> 33:54.340
But you're likely to produce hydrogen and methane

33:54.340 --> 33:56.340
for exactly the same reasons.

33:56.340 --> 33:59.340
And we see on Enceladus, for example, or Europa,

33:59.340 --> 34:03.340
which are moons, icy moons, with frozen oceans.

34:03.340 --> 34:07.340
But underneath the frozen ocean on Enceladus and on Europa,

34:07.340 --> 34:10.340
it seems that there is a rather large ocean,

34:10.340 --> 34:13.340
larger than the Earth's oceans.

34:13.340 --> 34:17.340
And these plumes that you can see here

34:17.340 --> 34:20.340
are escaping from the surface of Enceladus.

34:20.340 --> 34:24.340
And they are very alkaline, pH 10, or thereabouts,

34:24.340 --> 34:27.340
and rich in hydrogen, gas and methane.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.340
And so the only thing that we know of,

34:29.340 --> 34:31.340
the only geological process we know of

34:31.340 --> 34:33.340
that could produce an ocean that was that alkaline

34:33.340 --> 34:36.340
and that rich in hydrogen would be this same process.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.340
It's called serpentinisation,

34:38.340 --> 34:40.340
but it's the reaction between olivine and water

34:40.340 --> 34:42.340
to produce a mineral called serpentinite,

34:42.340 --> 34:45.340
which is why it's called serpentinisation.

34:45.340 --> 34:47.340
So even in our own solar system,

34:47.340 --> 34:50.340
there are at least three worlds

34:50.340 --> 34:53.340
where this process is actively going on.

34:53.340 --> 34:55.340
And this is really one of the places

34:55.340 --> 34:59.340
that NASA would most like to go to, me too.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.340
And it actually also means,

35:02.340 --> 35:05.340
because of the politics of these situations,

35:05.340 --> 35:08.340
I said nobody can agree about where life actually started on Earth

35:08.340 --> 35:09.340
or what conditions.

35:09.340 --> 35:12.340
So I'm giving you my partial view.

35:12.340 --> 35:14.340
NASA like this partial view

35:14.340 --> 35:17.340
because NASA want to fly rockets to Enceladus,

35:17.340 --> 35:20.340
and they need a reason why they would want to do that,

35:20.340 --> 35:23.340
a reason that they can give, I suppose,

35:23.340 --> 35:26.340
rather than we just like flying rockets.

35:26.340 --> 35:29.340
And that's their maybe life on Enceladus.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.340
But that means that these reasons,

35:31.340 --> 35:33.340
these ideas on the origin of life,

35:33.340 --> 35:35.340
talking about serpentinisation and hydrogen

35:35.340 --> 35:37.340
and these particular reactions

35:37.340 --> 35:39.340
is appealing at the moment to NASA.

35:39.340 --> 35:41.340
I hope that means they might fund me,

35:41.340 --> 35:43.340
but probably not.

35:43.340 --> 35:47.340
Anyway, so that's within our own solar system.

35:47.340 --> 35:51.340
If we go further afield,

35:51.340 --> 35:55.340
there's been a real drive

35:55.340 --> 35:57.340
to discover exoplanets,

35:57.340 --> 36:02.340
planets orbiting distant stars.

36:02.340 --> 36:07.340
And there have been projections now

36:07.340 --> 36:10.340
that there should be something in the order of tens of billions

36:10.340 --> 36:13.340
of Earth-like wet rocky planets

36:13.340 --> 36:16.340
in the Milky Way alone.

36:16.340 --> 36:19.340
So if that's true,

36:19.340 --> 36:22.340
all of these Earth-like wet rocky planets

36:22.340 --> 36:25.340
should be producing the same kind of vents.

36:25.340 --> 36:28.340
Water is basically ubiquitous.

36:28.340 --> 36:31.340
We can detect oliveene in interstellar dust.

36:31.340 --> 36:33.340
It's very common,

36:33.340 --> 36:37.340
so most rocky planets would have a fair amount of oliveene in them.

36:37.340 --> 36:42.340
And CO2, again, is common as an atmospheric gas,

36:42.340 --> 36:45.340
certainly in our own solar system.

36:45.340 --> 36:47.340
So you could imagine that these same conditions

36:47.340 --> 36:51.340
would apply really on a very, very wide scale.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.340
And so life starting elsewhere

36:53.340 --> 36:56.340
may be constrained by the same reasons.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.340
We also require proton gradients across membranes

36:59.340 --> 37:02.340
to get going because the reaction between hydrogen and CO2

37:02.340 --> 37:04.340
is difficult,

37:04.340 --> 37:09.340
and this is a probabilistically simple way of doing it.

37:09.340 --> 37:15.340
So if you were to find, say, a thousand life forms in the universe,

37:15.340 --> 37:18.340
would it be carbon-based or not?

37:18.340 --> 37:20.340
Probably it would mostly be carbon-based

37:20.340 --> 37:23.340
because carbon is ubiquitous.

37:23.340 --> 37:26.340
It's extremely good at the kind of complex chemistry

37:26.340 --> 37:28.340
that needs to be done.

37:28.340 --> 37:31.340
And it comes in a convenient LEGO brick, CO2.

37:31.340 --> 37:33.340
So you can build large complex molecules

37:33.340 --> 37:35.340
by adding on one brick at a time.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.340
If you start with silicon,

37:37.340 --> 37:40.340
you're starting with silicon oxide, sand.

37:40.340 --> 37:42.340
Don't try and build with sand.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.340
You want to build with LEGO.

37:44.340 --> 37:47.340
And carbon dioxide is a LEGO brick.

37:47.340 --> 37:50.340
And so if you were to find a thousand different life forms,

37:50.340 --> 37:52.340
I would wader a bet that it's going to be carbon-based,

37:52.340 --> 37:54.340
let's say, 995 times out of a thousand,

37:54.340 --> 37:56.340
and something wild and funky,

37:56.340 --> 37:58.340
perhaps the rest of the times.

37:58.340 --> 38:01.340
But carbon is so common, so good at what it does,

38:01.340 --> 38:03.340
and so convenient in the forms in which it comes,

38:03.340 --> 38:06.340
that it would be very surprising if it wasn't carbon-based.

38:06.340 --> 38:08.340
But then we've already run into this constraint.

38:08.340 --> 38:12.340
How do you make carbon dioxide react with CO2?

38:12.340 --> 38:15.340
I would say we're likely to find bacteria

38:15.340 --> 38:18.340
many places throughout the universe.

38:18.340 --> 38:21.340
But what about more complex things than bacteria?

38:21.340 --> 38:23.340
I don't know how many people in this room

38:23.340 --> 38:26.340
would get very excited if there were bacteria discovered on Mars.

38:26.340 --> 38:31.340
Most scientists probably would get pretty excited about that.

38:31.340 --> 38:33.340
I don't...

38:33.340 --> 38:35.340
I really honestly...

38:35.340 --> 38:37.340
Can we have a show of hands just out of curiosity?

38:37.340 --> 38:41.340
How many people here would be excited to find bacteria on another planet?

38:41.340 --> 38:44.340
Pretty much all of you. Great.

38:45.340 --> 38:48.340
Would we find anything more complex than bacteria?

38:48.340 --> 38:50.340
We need to look back, though,

38:50.340 --> 38:53.340
on what I've accomplished, what I'm suggesting is a set of constraints

38:53.340 --> 38:58.340
that cells anywhere are going to be based on reacting hydrogen with CO2,

38:58.340 --> 39:02.340
and to do it, they're going to need proton gradients across membranes.

39:03.340 --> 39:06.340
And bacteria have remained constrained and haven't changed

39:06.340 --> 39:08.340
for four billion years in their morphology,

39:08.340 --> 39:10.340
neither have archaea.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.340
So could it be that they are constrained

39:12.340 --> 39:16.340
by the way that they generate their energy?

39:16.340 --> 39:19.340
Well, I think that's probably the case.

39:19.340 --> 39:24.340
John Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,

39:24.340 --> 39:27.340
and he was at UCL for a period where I am,

39:27.340 --> 39:30.340
so I think a lot of...

39:30.340 --> 39:34.340
It's a great place, UCL, at least in one sense,

39:34.340 --> 39:38.340
in the sense that some of the greatest thinkers and biologists of the 20th century

39:38.340 --> 39:40.340
worked there for a while.

39:40.340 --> 39:43.340
They all left and went to Cambridge or somewhere after a bit,

39:43.340 --> 39:46.340
but for a while they were all there at UCL,

39:46.340 --> 39:49.340
and I think a lot of us walk around these corridors and think,

39:49.340 --> 39:51.340
oh, JVS Haldane used to walk down here.

39:51.340 --> 39:53.340
I better do something good today.

39:54.340 --> 39:58.340
So Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,

39:58.340 --> 40:01.340
and he liked calling things that shouldn't happen

40:01.340 --> 40:03.340
and evolutionary scandal.

40:03.340 --> 40:05.340
He was scandalised by sex.

40:05.340 --> 40:07.340
Sex really shouldn't happen.

40:07.340 --> 40:10.340
Why wouldn't people not just make clones of themselves instead?

40:10.340 --> 40:13.340
And he spent a lot of his career trying to work out why sex does happen

40:13.340 --> 40:18.340
and why most things that make clones of themselves just fall extinct after a period.

40:18.340 --> 40:23.340
I'd like to think, he never actually said that the eukaryotes were an evolutionary scandal,

40:23.340 --> 40:26.340
but I think he would have seen it in those terms.

40:26.340 --> 40:32.340
The problem is that all complex life is composed of this one cell type,

40:32.340 --> 40:34.340
this eukaryotic cell.

40:34.340 --> 40:39.340
The fact that we all obviously share a common ancestor

40:39.340 --> 40:43.340
because the plants and the animals, if you look at their cells under a microscope,

40:43.340 --> 40:47.340
they're almost indistinguishable in the sense that they all have a nucleus.

40:47.340 --> 40:51.340
They all have lots of membrane systems called the endoplasmic reticulum, for example.

40:51.340 --> 40:54.340
All lysosomes, they all have mitochondria.

40:54.340 --> 40:58.340
You could write page after page in a textbook of things that plants and animals have in common

40:58.340 --> 41:00.340
at the level of cells,

41:00.340 --> 41:03.340
but fungi have the same things in common as well,

41:03.340 --> 41:09.340
and so does an amoeba, or single-celled algae and so on.

41:09.340 --> 41:14.340
It's a shockingly long list, and it's quite baffling as to why that would be the case.

41:14.340 --> 41:20.340
So traits like sex as well, lots of amoeba, in fact pretty much all of them,

41:20.340 --> 41:23.340
are sexual, it turns out.

41:23.340 --> 41:27.340
For a long time we assumed they weren't because you never really caught two of them together.

41:28.340 --> 41:31.340
But now we know their genomes.

41:31.340 --> 41:34.340
Funnily enough, it's the genomes that give insight into these things.

41:34.340 --> 41:37.340
We can see that all the genes that are required for meiosis,

41:37.340 --> 41:41.340
which is to say the recombination part of sex and the cell division,

41:41.340 --> 41:44.340
we find them all in amoeba.

41:44.340 --> 41:47.340
We find them all in very ancient looking cells.

41:47.340 --> 41:50.340
And there's plenty of evidence, again, from the genomes

41:50.340 --> 41:54.340
that they've been recombining genes and changing the structure of the genome continuously.

41:54.340 --> 41:58.340
We know that they're sexual, even if we've never caught them at it.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.340
So this is the scandal then.

42:01.340 --> 42:05.340
All eukaryotic cells share this long list of traits.

42:05.340 --> 42:10.340
Bacteria and archaea just don't do it.

42:10.340 --> 42:12.340
They don't do sex, for example.

42:12.340 --> 42:15.340
They pass genes around a bit, they do some recombination,

42:15.340 --> 42:18.340
but they don't fuse cells together, line up whole genomes,

42:18.340 --> 42:23.340
cross across genes and then separate up, and bacteria just don't do that.

42:23.340 --> 42:28.340
So the scandal, if all of these traits, and there's hundreds and hundreds of them,

42:28.340 --> 42:31.340
evolve by natural selection, step by step,

42:31.340 --> 42:34.340
and there's no reason to imagine that that didn't happen,

42:34.340 --> 42:39.340
and each of these small steps offered some kind of an advantage,

42:39.340 --> 42:42.340
and again, there's no reason to assume that that's not true,

42:42.340 --> 42:48.340
then why is it that none of them evolve in the bacteria or the archaea for the same reasons?

42:48.340 --> 42:50.340
They really ought to, but they don't.

42:50.340 --> 42:53.340
So you could think of eyes as a nice example.

42:53.340 --> 42:56.340
Lots of creationists say what use is half an eye,

42:56.340 --> 43:01.340
but evolution is full of things that most people would say was half an eye.

43:01.340 --> 43:04.340
And it's exactly as natural selection would predict.

43:04.340 --> 43:12.340
There are at least 60 or 70 separate origins of morphologically complex eyes.

43:12.340 --> 43:14.340
That's not quite true, as I'm putting it,

43:14.340 --> 43:18.340
because a lot of them in animals share a common ancestor

43:18.340 --> 43:21.340
on some kind of a worm that had a light sensitive spot.

43:21.340 --> 43:26.340
But it's partly true in the sense that the octopus eye, for example,

43:26.340 --> 43:29.340
was over here somewhere, and the human eye

43:29.340 --> 43:34.340
have arrived with a camera eye essentially independently.

43:34.340 --> 43:35.340
It's convergent evolution.

43:35.340 --> 43:38.340
They started from a light sensitive spot,

43:38.340 --> 43:42.340
and independently they ended up with a camera type eye.

43:42.340 --> 43:45.340
There are one or two regulatory genes in common,

43:45.340 --> 43:48.340
but they independently recruited all the rest of the genes.

43:48.340 --> 43:51.340
But then there are, I think, this is Eudlina, an algorithm.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.340
It's got an eye spot.

43:52.340 --> 43:56.340
It's got the same proteins, light sensitive proteins,

43:56.340 --> 44:01.340
rhodopsins in that eye spot that we have in our own eyes.

44:01.340 --> 44:03.340
This is even more amazing.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.340
This is a camera type eye, which you can see the lens,

44:06.340 --> 44:08.340
you can see the retina, you can see a cornea.

44:08.340 --> 44:10.340
That's in a single cell.

44:10.340 --> 44:14.340
That's a single protist, eukaryotic protist.

44:14.340 --> 44:17.340
The retina is composed of chloroplasts,

44:17.340 --> 44:20.340
just reused for a different purpose.

44:20.340 --> 44:22.340
The lens, I'm not sure what the lens is made of,

44:22.340 --> 44:24.340
but the cornea is made of mitochondria.

44:24.340 --> 44:26.340
Again, they've just been cobbled together

44:26.340 --> 44:27.340
and used for a different purpose,

44:27.340 --> 44:30.340
but it's a camera eye inside a single cell.

44:30.340 --> 44:34.340
My point is this is what natural selection will predict,

44:34.340 --> 44:36.340
that there should be multiple different types of eye

44:36.340 --> 44:39.340
in different environments, different ecological contexts,

44:39.340 --> 44:43.340
different types of eye with different functioning.

44:43.340 --> 44:45.340
We don't see the evolutionary intermediates,

44:45.340 --> 44:48.340
but we see ecologically all the different types.

44:48.340 --> 44:51.340
We would expect to see something similar in bacteria.

44:51.340 --> 44:53.340
We would expect to see some bacteria that have something

44:53.340 --> 44:55.340
that's a bit like a nucleus,

44:55.340 --> 44:57.340
or some that do something a bit like sex,

44:57.340 --> 45:00.340
or that can do phagocytosis,

45:00.340 --> 45:03.340
go around and engulf cells and eat them.

45:03.340 --> 45:06.340
These are all valuable traits for us,

45:06.340 --> 45:07.340
so why don't the bacteria do it?

45:07.340 --> 45:09.340
It's not like the eye.

45:09.340 --> 45:12.340
There's a big difference there in what we see around us.

45:13.340 --> 45:16.340
It really boils down to this question that I raised earlier on.

45:16.340 --> 45:18.340
What was happening down this branch of the tree of life

45:18.340 --> 45:20.340
that wasn't happening over here,

45:20.340 --> 45:22.340
and it's not to do with information

45:22.340 --> 45:26.340
because these guys trawl through all the information

45:26.340 --> 45:29.340
and still didn't come out with the answer.

45:29.340 --> 45:32.340
I want to make the point that it's not at the level

45:32.340 --> 45:35.340
of large plants and animals.

45:35.340 --> 45:37.340
The real difference, the real void,

45:37.340 --> 45:40.340
is at the level of single cells.

45:40.340 --> 45:42.340
It's a bog standard alga,

45:42.340 --> 45:45.340
the kind of thing you'd find in any pond in London

45:45.340 --> 45:47.340
or anywhere else, euglina.

45:47.340 --> 45:51.340
Over here is a relatively complex bacterium.

45:51.340 --> 45:54.340
It's actually even got a little compartment inside it,

45:54.340 --> 45:57.340
which some people have said is a bit like a nucleus.

45:57.340 --> 45:59.340
It's not really.

45:59.340 --> 46:02.340
The reason you can't see it well is it's roughly to scale.

46:02.340 --> 46:05.340
You don't need to know what most of these things are in here

46:05.340 --> 46:09.340
to realise that this is a lot bigger and more complicated.

46:09.340 --> 46:11.340
These are the mitochondria.

46:11.340 --> 46:13.340
This is actually a chloroplast.

46:13.340 --> 46:15.340
You can see the nucleus there,

46:15.340 --> 46:17.340
but it's on a different scale.

46:17.340 --> 46:19.340
The level of complexity in a single cell

46:19.340 --> 46:21.340
has gone out by orders of magnitude

46:21.340 --> 46:24.340
compared to a relatively complex bacterium.

46:24.340 --> 46:26.340
Not in the biochemistry,

46:26.340 --> 46:29.340
but in this morphological complexity.

46:29.340 --> 46:32.340
It's interesting that if you were to compare

46:32.340 --> 46:34.340
two different eukaryotic cells,

46:34.340 --> 46:36.340
they look rather similar.

46:36.340 --> 46:39.340
This is paramecium, which is a single cell protist,

46:39.340 --> 46:44.340
and this is a pancreatic asinase cell, a human one.

46:44.340 --> 46:47.340
Again, they're roughly to the same scale,

46:47.340 --> 46:49.340
and most people would look at them and say,

46:49.340 --> 46:51.340
well, they're kind of similar.

46:51.340 --> 46:55.340
In terms of the amount of complexity going on in them,

46:55.340 --> 46:57.340
they're not a world apart.

46:57.340 --> 46:59.340
This is a single cell protist,

46:59.340 --> 47:01.340
and this is part of a multicellular organism.

47:01.340 --> 47:03.340
It's out of curiosity.

47:03.340 --> 47:06.340
Has anyone got any idea how many genes by genes,

47:06.340 --> 47:10.340
protein coding genes, paramecium has?

47:10.340 --> 47:12.340
Any thoughts?

47:12.340 --> 47:14.340
Twice the amount of humans.

47:14.340 --> 47:16.340
Exactly, twice the amount of humans.

47:16.340 --> 47:19.340
40,000 genes.

47:19.340 --> 47:22.340
Now maybe we do lots of additional regulation,

47:22.340 --> 47:24.340
or maybe we're just not very much more complicated

47:24.340 --> 47:26.340
than paramecium.

47:26.340 --> 47:30.340
By most objective measures of complexity,

47:30.340 --> 47:32.340
there's not a great world of difference

47:32.340 --> 47:34.340
between these two types of cell,

47:34.340 --> 47:36.340
in terms of the number of genes,

47:36.340 --> 47:38.340
in terms of the amount of morphological complexity,

47:38.340 --> 47:41.340
in terms of basically the hard wiring of it.

47:41.340 --> 47:45.340
The real difference is between bacteria and single cell eukaryotes,

47:45.340 --> 47:48.340
rather than between single cell eukaryotes

47:48.340 --> 47:53.340
and large multicellular organisms.

47:53.340 --> 47:56.340
I'm going to have to, rather than exploring all the possible options,

47:56.340 --> 47:59.340
I'm going to tell you what I think the answer is.

47:59.340 --> 48:02.340
We could be here all the rest of the week.

48:02.340 --> 48:06.340
Here's a group of cells that are pretty simple,

48:06.340 --> 48:08.340
as eukaryotes go.

48:08.340 --> 48:10.340
This is jardia.

48:10.340 --> 48:12.340
Jardia causes explosive diarrhea,

48:12.340 --> 48:15.340
that anybody who's been walking in the mountains in America,

48:15.340 --> 48:18.340
may have had jardial poisoning.

48:18.340 --> 48:20.340
I never had it,

48:20.340 --> 48:23.340
but when I used to go walking in the mountains in places like that,

48:23.340 --> 48:26.340
I used to be terrified that when I drank from the mountain streams,

48:26.340 --> 48:28.340
I would get it.

48:28.340 --> 48:31.340
But it doesn't have any mitochondria,

48:31.340 --> 48:34.340
and people thought it didn't do sex either until quite recently,

48:34.340 --> 48:36.340
when it turns out it is sexual,

48:36.340 --> 48:38.340
and it turns out that it does have mitochondria too,

48:38.340 --> 48:40.340
just not as we know them.

48:40.340 --> 48:44.340
It has organelles which derive from mitochondria,

48:44.340 --> 48:47.340
called mitosomes.

48:47.340 --> 48:49.340
It's typical of science as well.

48:49.340 --> 48:53.340
It took 25 years of probably about

48:53.340 --> 48:57.340
at least 15 research groups around the world,

48:57.340 --> 48:59.340
not just with jardia,

48:59.340 --> 49:01.340
but with these others as well,

49:01.340 --> 49:04.340
microsperidia, trichomonas, entomebo, monocircumenoides.

49:04.340 --> 49:07.340
These are cells that don't have mitochondria.

49:07.340 --> 49:10.340
For a long time, they were thought to be

49:10.340 --> 49:13.340
an evolutionary intermediate, a living fossil

49:13.340 --> 49:16.340
from very early in eukaryotic evolution,

49:16.340 --> 49:19.340
that were given insight into how complex cells evolved.

49:19.340 --> 49:21.340
It turns out they're not.

49:21.340 --> 49:23.340
They're all derived.

49:23.340 --> 49:26.340
They all had far more complex ancestors in the past,

49:26.340 --> 49:30.340
evolved down in complexity to become more like bacteria.

49:30.340 --> 49:34.340
They all have mitochondria,

49:34.340 --> 49:37.340
and it took 25 years of these research groups

49:37.340 --> 49:39.340
around the world to nail that.

49:39.340 --> 49:41.340
The reason it was done, in part,

49:41.340 --> 49:43.340
is because half of them are parasites,

49:43.340 --> 49:45.340
and so they're of medical interest.

49:45.340 --> 49:47.340
As soon as things become of medical interest,

49:47.340 --> 49:49.340
then people are going to fund you.

49:49.340 --> 49:51.340
If people went to the funders and said,

49:51.340 --> 49:53.340
these are really interesting living fossils

49:53.340 --> 49:55.340
that might give us an insight into

49:55.340 --> 49:57.340
the evolution of complexity,

49:57.340 --> 49:59.340
they're not going to get funded, unfortunately.

49:59.340 --> 50:01.340
If you say it causes explosive diarrhea,

50:01.340 --> 50:03.340
where's the checkbook?

50:03.340 --> 50:05.340
So that's what they said.

50:05.340 --> 50:07.340
They said it causes explosive diarrhea,

50:07.340 --> 50:09.340
and they had 20 years of funding,

50:09.340 --> 50:11.340
and they spent it very wisely

50:11.340 --> 50:14.340
on the early evolution of complexity.

50:14.340 --> 50:17.340
We now know that these are actually

50:17.340 --> 50:21.340
not living fossils, but highly derived.

50:21.340 --> 50:23.340
The one thing that we can take away from it

50:23.340 --> 50:27.340
is they all had mitochondria in the past,

50:27.340 --> 50:29.340
and that's important.

50:29.340 --> 50:31.340
It's important, in part,

50:31.340 --> 50:33.340
because mitochondria, as I said at the beginning,

50:33.340 --> 50:35.340
were bacteria once,

50:35.340 --> 50:38.340
and this was made famous by Lynn Margulis.

50:38.340 --> 50:40.340
Margulis, I should say.

50:40.340 --> 50:43.340
She died of a stroke a couple of years ago.

50:43.340 --> 50:45.340
I only met her once,

50:45.340 --> 50:47.340
and I admired her enormously,

50:47.340 --> 50:49.340
but she had a knack of disagreeing

50:49.340 --> 50:52.340
with everybody about everything,

50:52.340 --> 50:54.340
including me.

50:54.340 --> 50:56.340
Yes, well, that man is...

50:56.340 --> 50:59.340
She was married to Carl Sagan,

50:59.340 --> 51:02.340
and they divorced after a while.

51:02.340 --> 51:05.340
Before she wrote her famous paper in 1967,

51:05.340 --> 51:07.340
they'd already divorced.

51:07.340 --> 51:09.340
I'd love to have heard their breakfast conversations

51:09.340 --> 51:11.340
between those two, but anyway,

51:11.340 --> 51:14.340
she was the person who really nailed the idea

51:14.340 --> 51:16.340
that mitochondria were bacteria once.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.340
She nailed the idea that chloroplasts

51:18.340 --> 51:20.340
derived from bacteria as well,

51:20.340 --> 51:22.340
and she also argued for a long time

51:22.340 --> 51:25.340
that there were lots of other symbioses,

51:25.340 --> 51:27.340
for example, with spirochetes bacteria,

51:27.340 --> 51:29.340
giving rise to the cytoskeleton

51:29.340 --> 51:31.340
and the flagella and so on.

51:31.340 --> 51:34.340
Nobody agrees with her about that.

51:34.340 --> 51:37.340
She was very strong-willed

51:37.340 --> 51:40.340
and disagreed with most people about most things,

51:40.340 --> 51:44.340
but she was bang on for these central ideas

51:44.340 --> 51:46.340
on the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

51:46.340 --> 51:48.340
and the amount of, I suppose you call it,

51:48.340 --> 51:50.340
hate mail now that she got.

51:50.340 --> 51:54.340
If you read the literature from after her paper in 1967

51:54.340 --> 51:56.340
through into the early 70s,

51:56.340 --> 51:58.340
people did not like these ideas at all,

51:58.340 --> 52:01.340
and they wrote really unpleasant diatribes

52:01.340 --> 52:03.340
in the literature.

52:03.340 --> 52:07.340
You can understand why she became very hardened to abuse

52:07.340 --> 52:10.340
and eventually basically believed everybody else

52:10.340 --> 52:12.340
was wrong apart from her.

52:12.340 --> 52:14.340
She was asked once,

52:14.340 --> 52:17.340
why does she enjoy being so controversial,

52:17.340 --> 52:19.340
and her answer was,

52:19.340 --> 52:22.340
I don't think I'm controversial, I think I'm right.

52:22.340 --> 52:25.340
I'm not even sure she used the word think.

52:27.340 --> 52:29.340
So that's Slim Margulis,

52:29.340 --> 52:32.340
and she nailed that mitochondria derived from bacteria,

52:32.340 --> 52:34.340
and we still can't really agree

52:34.340 --> 52:37.340
about exactly which kind of bacteria were they,

52:37.340 --> 52:41.340
but probably something like Rhodobacter that we're seeing there.

52:42.340 --> 52:44.340
So something acquired these bacteria

52:44.340 --> 52:46.340
that went on to become the mitochondria,

52:46.340 --> 52:48.340
and again, there's been no agreement

52:48.340 --> 52:51.340
about what kind of a cell that was until quite recently,

52:51.340 --> 52:54.340
and this is a place called Loki's Castle,

52:54.340 --> 52:57.340
which is just off the coast of Norway,

52:57.340 --> 53:01.340
and a Swedish group have been trawling around

53:01.340 --> 53:03.340
in the muds underneath there

53:03.340 --> 53:06.340
and sequencing everything that they found in those muds.

53:06.340 --> 53:09.340
So we've never even now seen

53:09.340 --> 53:11.340
what these cells actually looked like.

53:11.340 --> 53:13.340
This is what's called metagenomic reconstruction.

53:13.340 --> 53:15.340
So you sequence everything,

53:15.340 --> 53:17.340
and you try and piece together genomes

53:17.340 --> 53:19.340
by effectively matching the ends up,

53:19.340 --> 53:24.340
and eventually you put together the genome of these cells.

53:24.340 --> 53:26.340
There's a certain amount of debate

53:26.340 --> 53:28.340
about whether there's contamination in there,

53:28.340 --> 53:30.340
but it looks broadly true,

53:30.340 --> 53:32.340
and the thing that's really surprising about it is,

53:32.340 --> 53:34.340
you carry it to here, this is another tree,

53:34.340 --> 53:36.340
and right next to them,

53:36.340 --> 53:38.340
so we started out with a Loki archaeata there,

53:38.340 --> 53:40.340
we're discovered at Loki's Castle,

53:40.340 --> 53:42.340
and since then various others have been found,

53:42.340 --> 53:44.340
and they've kept going with this Norse theme,

53:44.340 --> 53:46.340
so now we've got all the Norse gods down there,

53:46.340 --> 53:49.340
we've got the Odin archaeata and the Thor archaeata

53:49.340 --> 53:52.340
and the Heimdal archaeata and so on.

53:52.340 --> 53:54.340
But the thing which is really plain

53:54.340 --> 53:56.340
is that you carry it to our branching

53:56.340 --> 53:58.340
right in the middle of those groups.

53:58.340 --> 54:00.340
So whatever the host cell was that acquired mitochondria

54:00.340 --> 54:02.340
was something pretty similar to this,

54:02.340 --> 54:05.340
and the irony is we don't know what this looks like,

54:05.340 --> 54:07.340
we don't know what kind of a cell it was.

54:07.340 --> 54:09.340
Some people say it was a primitive phagasite

54:09.340 --> 54:11.340
that kind of tried to eat things.

54:11.340 --> 54:14.340
Other people, including me, say,

54:14.340 --> 54:16.340
oh no, it wasn't, it was an autotrofe,

54:16.340 --> 54:18.340
it used hydrogen gas.

54:18.340 --> 54:21.340
I don't think we can really be very sure yet

54:21.340 --> 54:23.340
what kind of a cell it was,

54:23.340 --> 54:26.340
but it was probably basically a fairly simple cell.

54:26.340 --> 54:31.340
And so this is another tree,

54:31.340 --> 54:33.340
which I think is beautiful,

54:33.340 --> 54:36.340
this is from one of the most, I think, brilliant biologists

54:36.340 --> 54:39.340
operating today, a guy called Bill Martin.

54:39.340 --> 54:43.340
He also has a knack of winding people up.

54:43.340 --> 54:47.340
And this tree goes back to 1998.

54:47.340 --> 54:50.340
And it's remarkable for several reasons.

54:50.340 --> 54:53.340
One of them is that it's now more right than it was then.

54:53.340 --> 54:55.340
So in 1998 when he put this forward,

54:55.340 --> 54:58.340
I think most people must have thought he was bonkers.

54:58.340 --> 55:01.340
Look down here, we have two separate origins

55:01.340 --> 55:03.340
from a hydrothermal vent.

55:03.340 --> 55:06.340
So the bacteria on the archaea.

55:06.340 --> 55:09.340
I haven't really gone into the details of that.

55:09.340 --> 55:12.340
When I first heard him say that in 2002,

55:12.340 --> 55:14.340
I thought he was completely bonkers.

55:14.340 --> 55:17.340
I now think he was absolutely right.

55:17.340 --> 55:20.340
I haven't really had time to go into why they would,

55:20.340 --> 55:22.340
so they share a common ancestor,

55:22.340 --> 55:25.340
but down inside the vents.

55:25.340 --> 55:27.340
The other thing which is really clear on here

55:27.340 --> 55:31.340
is he has a kind of genomic merger going on.

55:31.340 --> 55:34.340
So genes from the archaea and genes from the bacteria

55:34.340 --> 55:37.340
are fusing together here to form the eukaryotes.

55:37.340 --> 55:41.340
And this is a singular endosymbiosis.

55:41.340 --> 55:44.340
This one is the chloroplasts.

55:44.340 --> 55:47.340
So this is not really the same as Lynn Margulis

55:47.340 --> 55:49.340
who had lots of these things going on

55:49.340 --> 55:51.340
in all kinds of different cell lines.

55:51.340 --> 55:54.340
This was a singular event that gave rise to eukaryotic cells.

55:54.340 --> 55:57.340
And later on, the acquisition of chloroplasts

55:57.340 --> 56:00.340
gave rise to plants, but it didn't change anything really

56:00.340 --> 56:02.340
about the big structure of eukaryotic evolution.

56:02.340 --> 56:05.340
Plants are the same type of cells that we have,

56:05.340 --> 56:08.340
except with chloroplasts added in and a vacuol,

56:08.340 --> 56:10.340
but we're basically the same.

56:10.340 --> 56:15.340
So Bill has this singular origin of complex life.

56:15.340 --> 56:18.340
Now a lot of people really hate this idea,

56:18.340 --> 56:22.340
and I think it's in part because we don't really like the idea

56:22.340 --> 56:24.340
of freak accidents in science.

56:24.340 --> 56:27.340
It kind of almost puts itself beyond science.

56:27.340 --> 56:31.340
We can't study statistically an accident, a singularity,

56:31.340 --> 56:35.340
but you can think about it in a very productive way.

56:35.340 --> 56:38.340
If this was the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

56:38.340 --> 56:41.340
and it started something like this,

56:41.340 --> 56:43.340
this is the only example that we know of

56:43.340 --> 56:46.340
of bacteria living inside another bacterial cell.

56:46.340 --> 56:48.340
So there's plenty of bacteria living inside

56:48.340 --> 56:51.340
our own type of cell, eukaryotic cells,

56:51.340 --> 56:56.340
but it's really rare for bacteria to be inside another bacterial cell.

56:56.340 --> 56:58.340
This is not a phagocyte.

56:58.340 --> 57:01.340
It didn't engulf the cell to get in there.

57:01.340 --> 57:03.340
It's got a cell wall around it.

57:03.340 --> 57:05.340
It's actually a cyanobacterium,

57:05.340 --> 57:07.340
and you can see the photosynthetic membranes here.

57:07.340 --> 57:09.340
So we don't know what they're doing there.

57:09.340 --> 57:11.340
This actually is an old discovery.

57:11.340 --> 57:13.340
This is from 1979,

57:13.340 --> 57:16.340
when they were still called blue-green algae in those days.

57:16.340 --> 57:18.340
And blue-green algae really refers to eukaryotes,

57:18.340 --> 57:21.340
so everybody ignored that paper for 20 years

57:21.340 --> 57:24.340
until it turned out they were actually bacteria

57:24.340 --> 57:26.340
with bacteria inside,

57:26.340 --> 57:32.340
and so this speaks more about the whole sweep of evolution.

57:32.340 --> 57:34.340
Why would that make a difference?

57:34.340 --> 57:36.340
Well, the cells that are living inside,

57:36.340 --> 57:38.340
they are bacteria.

57:38.340 --> 57:39.340
They are cells.

57:39.340 --> 57:40.340
They've got their own agenda.

57:40.340 --> 57:41.340
They want to grow.

57:41.340 --> 57:42.340
They want to divide.

57:42.340 --> 57:43.340
They want to...

57:43.340 --> 57:49.340
There's a lovely quote from Jack Monogh,

57:49.340 --> 57:53.340
who said that the dream of every cell is to become two cells.

57:53.340 --> 57:57.340
And so that's what these guys are dreaming about in here.

57:57.340 --> 58:01.340
They're thinking, how am I going to double?

58:01.340 --> 58:04.340
And the way that they do it,

58:04.340 --> 58:06.340
if you imagine a population of bacteria,

58:06.340 --> 58:10.340
and they're all growing frantically,

58:10.340 --> 58:12.340
and the speed at which they grow

58:12.340 --> 58:15.340
depends on the speed at which they can copy their genome

58:15.340 --> 58:16.340
as much as anything else.

58:16.340 --> 58:19.340
And so the smaller the genome is, the faster they can grow.

58:19.340 --> 58:23.340
It tells that if there's something about the environment

58:23.340 --> 58:26.340
that means they don't need this gene now,

58:26.340 --> 58:29.340
it's not useful and they lose it, they delete it,

58:29.340 --> 58:31.340
then they can probably grow a little bit faster

58:31.340 --> 58:33.340
because their genome is just a little bit smaller.

58:33.340 --> 58:35.340
And over a couple of days, bacteria,

58:35.340 --> 58:38.340
their growth rate does depend on that kind of factor.

58:38.340 --> 58:40.340
But then the environment changes again

58:40.340 --> 58:42.340
and whatever it was that that gene did,

58:42.340 --> 58:43.340
you need it again now.

58:43.340 --> 58:46.340
And so they pick it up.

58:46.340 --> 58:48.340
What bacteria do is they pick up genes

58:48.340 --> 58:49.340
called lateral gene transfer.

58:49.340 --> 58:51.340
It's like passing loose change around.

58:51.340 --> 58:53.340
They acquire it again

58:53.340 --> 58:55.340
and before you know it, you're back where you were.

58:55.340 --> 58:57.340
But if you've got a same population of bacteria

58:57.340 --> 58:59.340
living inside another cell,

58:59.340 --> 59:01.340
they do the same thing.

59:01.340 --> 59:03.340
They throw away genes that they don't need.

59:03.340 --> 59:06.340
Imagine that those genes are for making a cell wall,

59:06.340 --> 59:09.340
and you're living inside another cell,

59:09.340 --> 59:13.340
and you don't need a cell wall for protection inside another cell

59:13.340 --> 59:16.340
or for preventing yourself exploding

59:16.340 --> 59:19.340
with the difference in pressure between the outside and inside.

59:19.340 --> 59:21.340
So you lose those genes, you grow a little bit faster,

59:21.340 --> 59:23.340
you come to dominate the population.

59:23.340 --> 59:26.340
But so long as the cell doesn't die that you're living in,

59:26.340 --> 59:27.340
you'll be all right.

59:27.340 --> 59:29.340
You never need those genes again.

59:29.340 --> 59:33.340
And so there's a tendency for bacterial parasites

59:33.340 --> 59:36.340
to lose genes and to become simpler.

59:36.340 --> 59:38.340
And not just bacterial parasites,

59:38.340 --> 59:41.340
we see the same thing with Jardier and so on.

59:41.340 --> 59:44.340
And a very nice example is Rickettsia,

59:44.340 --> 59:46.340
which a few years ago people thought

59:46.340 --> 59:48.340
was very closely related to mitochondria.

59:48.340 --> 59:51.340
It's probably not so closely related.

59:51.340 --> 59:53.340
But it's still a beautiful example.

59:53.340 --> 59:58.340
It was the cause of time that wiped out the armies of Napoleon

59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.340
on his retreat from Moscow.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:05.340
And it's spread by these ticks.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.340
And it's a bacterium.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.340
Here it is invading a large eukaryotic cell.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.340
I think it's actually a kidney cell.

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.340
And the one thing about it which stands out

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.340
is it's got a tiny genome.

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.340
It's around about one megabase genome.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.340
And that's true for all of these things.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.340
I'm not just hand-waving here.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:29.340
This is the range of genome sizes of free-living bacteria.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.340
It goes up to around about 12 megabases now.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:36.340
This guy, T. Ryan Gregory, did a lot of work on genome sizes.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:39.340
And down at this other end,

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.340
these are the parasites and the endosymbionts

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.340
and the obligate symbionts.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.340
They're pretty much down at less than one megabase of DNA.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:51.340
So just for comparison's sake,

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:54.340
we have 3,000 megabases of DNA.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:59.340
The largest bacterial genome is 12 megabases of DNA.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.340
And some large algae, like eudlina,

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:06.340
are up to 100,000 megabases of DNA.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.340
So we have quite constrained genomes

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.340
in comparison with some single cell.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.340
The largest one is a thing called Amoeba W,

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:15.340
which was miscountered.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.340
It was originally 670,000 megabases.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.340
It's come down to 150,000 last count.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:25.340
But still, it's very, very substantially bigger

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.340
than our own genome.

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.340
But what happens with these bacteria that live in other cells?

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.340
They lose genes. They become simpler.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.340
They whittle away.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.340
And that's what ended up with the mitochondria.

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.340
All these mitochondria that we have

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.340
in millions of billions of copies,

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.340
they all have genomes of their own,

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.340
and they're passed on down the maternal line

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.340
from mother to son.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:55.340
My kids don't have my mitochondria.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.340
They have my wife's mitochondria.

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:01.340
It's a very strange arrangement that I won't go into now.

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.340
What it means is that if you want to be bigger,

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.340
more complex and spend more energy,

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.340
it's not just a case of having a larger surface area.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.340
You've got a whole unit here.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.340
That unit has some genes, which in some way control respiration.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.340
It's got the protein building factories, the ribosomes.

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.340
It's a unit, and if you want to expand,

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.340
you just make more units.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.340
You have more mitochondria.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.340
But it's not just that you're increasing the surface area.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.340
You've got genomes with each one.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.340
And that allows you to expand up on a massive scale.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.340
And the person who's, I think, done more on this side,

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.340
again, going back to the early 1990s,

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.340
John Allen has been arguing that they require genes

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:41.340
to control respiration.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.340
And still, I would say,

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.340
the majority of the field is not persuaded that he's correct.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.340
He is correct, I'm sure of that.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.340
But it takes an awful long time in science

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:54.340
for sometimes the simplest ideas to catch on.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.340
Most people just don't really care very much, I'm afraid.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:00.340
But it's the difference.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.340
That they can, to become a very large cell,

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.340
you just scale up mitochondria.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:10.340
So this is a giant bacterium, and there are a few around.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:14.340
These little white dots here are the copies of the complete genome.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.340
So the giant bacteria that do exist,

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.340
it seems that they also need genes to control respiration.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.340
And this is the edge of the cell,

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:25.340
and this is the plasma membrane where respiration is taking place.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.340
And they have as many as 200,000 copies of the complete genome.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.340
And each genome is a normal-sized bacterial genome

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:35.340
with three megabases of DNA in it.

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.340
And this is a eukaryotic cell.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.340
The blue is the nucleus where it's the main gene depot.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.340
And all these little, the green spots here

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:47.340
are the mitochondrial DNA.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:52.340
So there are hundreds or thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.340
So the difference between these two cells

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:57.340
is not that this cell has an awful lot more DNA than that cell,

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.340
they actually have a similar amount.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:02.340
It's that in that case it's got a kind of genomic symmetry.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.340
There's thousands of copies of the same genome,

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.340
exactly the same genome.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.340
Whereas here we've got one massive nuclear genome

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.340
which is supported energetically by this kind of end point.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:16.340
Thousands of mitochondrial genomes which have whittled down

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:19.340
and become smaller and smaller and more and more streamlined.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.340
So all the mitochondria, effectively,

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.340
it gives us multi-bacterial power without the bacterial overheads.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.340
And that's what allows all those overheads

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.340
can go into supporting a massive nucleus with full of genes.

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:34.340
At least it's the raw material for natural selection to operate on.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.340
And so we have a kind of genomic asymmetry.

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.340
And to me that's the real difference between bacteria

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:41.340
and large complex cells.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.340
We've got two genomes.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.340
There isn't such a thing as the human genome,

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.340
there are human genomes, the mitochondrial genome

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.340
and the nuclear genome.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:50.340
This is the last slide.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:55.340
Why then is complex life so rare?

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:57.340
Why did it only happen once on Earth?

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:01.340
And would it only happen rarely elsewhere in the universe?

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:05.340
There's a double bottleneck here.

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:09.340
One of them we have to get bacterium into another bacterial type cell

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:14.340
to break down this issue with membranes and scaling.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:19.340
So you've got to have cells within cells to be able to scale up.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.340
But those cells have their own agenda.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:26.340
You have what's called conflict, levels of selection conflict

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:31.340
that the bacteria inside want to grow fast

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.340
and perhaps make their host cell fuse with other cells

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:35.340
or whatever they want to do.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.340
The host cell itself wants to keep them under control

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:38.340
and bleed off the energy

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.340
but they don't want them replicating at any old speed.

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:43.340
Chances of it going wrong is really high.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.340
And maybe this is why we don't see any surviving intermediates.

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:50.340
Maybe they all died because it was a pretty dodgy situation

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:54.340
for a long period of time or even a short period of time.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:57.340
It's just that this is a long evolutionary distance.

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:00.340
Regardless of whether what I'm telling you is right or not,

01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.340
this long evolutionary distance,

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.340
there are no evolutionary intermediates that have ever been found.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.340
And so all of this complexity in this type of cell

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.340
and I would like to leave you with this thought,

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:15.340
we have no idea yet at least the difference between ideas

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.340
and serious scientific knowledge

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:21.340
where we can say that there have been experiments done and real data,

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.340
how any of this complexity of eukaryotic cells arose.

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:28.340
And if we want to understand medicine and what goes wrong in our own bodies

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:33.340
and we don't understand why these parts arose in the first place,

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.340
what were the evolutionary driving forces that made them evolve,

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.340
how can we really understand ourselves and medicine?

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:46.340
And if this starts out with mitochondria in a very simple cell

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.340
with none of that complexity,

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:53.340
the nice thing from my point of view is that perhaps all of this complexity arose

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.340
and the reason that we share such similar cells with plants and with algae

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:01.340
is not that we were all adapting to different external environments,

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:04.340
but we all were adapting to the same internal environment,

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:06.340
the problem of having cells living inside us.

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.340
And it's that that drove all of this complexity.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.340
And once it became a stable system,

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:15.340
then eukaryotes could spread out and take over the rest of the world.

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:18.340
And with that, I'd like to say thank you very much.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.340
This work has been done by many people,

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:26.340
and it's great fun having a lab with so many bright young people coming through it.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.340
It's an inspiration for me. Thank you very much.
