00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,280
It's a great pleasure and privilege to be here with you today and to share some thoughts

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,680
on the 30 years and more that I've been working in the area of autism and reflect on how our

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,920
understanding of autism has changed over that time. And I really look forward to your questions

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,720
where I will get to learn from you.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,560
The Gresham College lecture that you're listening to right now is giving you knowledge

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,240
and insight from one of the world's leading academic experts. Making it takes a lot of time,

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,680
but because we want to encourage a love of learning, we think it's well worth it.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,280
We never make you pay for lectures, although donations are needed. All we ask in return

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,080
is this, send a link to this lecture to someone you think would benefit and if you haven't already,

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,600
click the follow or subscribe button from wherever you're listening right now.

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,320
Now, let's get back to the lecture.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
So autism is perhaps more present in everyone's consciousness than ever before,

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,320
and you can see autism being reflected in news articles like the one today about employment

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,880
and also in fiction, in books and films. Some of the coverage is very misleading,

15
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,440
of course, and some of it perpetuates myths, but I think there's great awareness of autism

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,240
than any time during the 30 or decades that I've been working in the area,

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,400
and most people, when I tell them what I do, will say, oh, yes, I have a friend whose child

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,200
is autistic or some sort of connection. But what is autism? Well, you can answer that question

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,160
in lots of different ways. We know that autism has a strong genetic component in most cases,

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,520
but we don't have a genetic or blood test for autism, and we're still defining and

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,640
diagnosing autism on the basis of behavior. So we're talking about a behavioral syndrome,

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,320
a pattern of behavior, characterized by social and communication differences,

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,480
and sometimes difficulties, by rigid and repetitive behavior, which now includes sensory

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,000
sensitivities also, and something characteristic that is present from early in life,

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,440
even though the diagnosis may come much, much later, and as I'll go on to talk about later,

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,200
we have some people coming for first diagnosis in their 50s or in their 70s,

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,680
but the characteristics of autism were always present from very early on.

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,040
So the first way that autism has changed is from being considered rather narrowly,

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,160
defined rather narrowly, to a much broader definition. So in the 1980s, the diagnosis

30
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,080
was called infantile autism, reflecting, again, a very different history where initially,

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,480
autism was distinguished and talked about as childhood schizophrenia, and some of the

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,840
diagnostic criteria were pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people, so being oblivious

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,120
of others, gross deficits in language development, often an individual who didn't speak or only

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,640
spoke a few words, and absence of delusions and hallucinations, and you can see that that is

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,320
an attempt to distinguish autism from schizophrenia or from psychosis spectrum.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,120
Now, most of us, when we think about our autistic friends and relatives, they may not fit those

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,800
criteria at all, certainly not pervasively unresponsive to other people, for example,

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,560
and they may have very good language. Our current diagnostic criteria for what we now call autism

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,520
spectrum disorder include things like persistent deficits, some people would rather say differences

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,240
in social communication and social interaction, restricted repetitive patterns of behavior,

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,960
interests or activities, and as I said, that now includes sensory sensitivities,

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,920
and importantly, in our current conception, you can have an autism diagnosis and a diagnosis of

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,720
ADHD or of anxiety or depression, and surprisingly, that was only allowed from 2013

44
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,720
in the current diagnostic criteria. Before that, if you were anxious and autistic, your anxiety was

45
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
put down to your autism, which obviously isn't helpful, and I'll talk more about mental health

46
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,080
later on. So a great widening of those diagnostic criteria, incorporating many more people,

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,800
when I started in the field, most autistic children were in special school, many almost

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,960
had intellectual disability, language difficulties, and we were really fighting a lot of under

49
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,200
diagnosis. Now, most autistic children are in mainstream school, that may not always be the

50
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,640
best place for them if they're not well supported, but most are in mainstream, most will have pretty

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,800
good intellectual functioning and serviceable or good or excellent language. So the picture,

52
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,920
the autistic population has really changed, and as autism has changed from being narrowly defined

53
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,480
to much more broadly defined, it's also changed from being a rare condition to a common condition.

54
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,760
So in the 1980s, we talked about between four and six in every 10,000 individuals meeting

55
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,040
diagnostic criteria for autism, but today we talk about one percent of people, or maybe even two

56
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,480
percent of people, and sometimes studies in the States saying even higher numbers. What happened

57
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:36,080
between 1980s and today, well, one thing that happened was that in the mid-90s, a new diagnostic

58
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,240
label, Asperger's Syndrome, was introduced, and it was introduced to capture people who didn't

59
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,840
have a language delay or cognitive delay, but still had those social communication difficulties

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
and the regional repetitive traits. And I think for the first time then in the 90s,

61
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,000
if a parent had a child diagnosed with more classic or obvious autism, they might read around the

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
topic and they might find descriptions of Asperger's Syndrome and think, ah, that might be me, or that

63
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
might be my father, the grandfather of the child who's just had a diagnosis of autism. Before that,

64
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,120
when the picture was very much about autism with language delay, with intellectual disability, parents

65
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,280
weren't likely to read about autism and think that's me as well. So we see a big expansion there,

66
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,840
but I also want to point out that there probably hasn't been a real increase in the rates of

67
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,360
autism. We can't be sure because we can't go back retrospectively and apply our current diagnostic

68
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,960
criteria. But what I've shown you on the slide is the smooth, smooth blue curve that is often used

69
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,720
by autism charities and campaigners, particularly in the States, to say, look at this huge rise

70
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,120
in the rates of autism, please give more resources, please give more intervention and support.

71
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:06,320
But in set, I put the rates of autism in 2002 and in 2006 in different States in America.

72
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,880
And remember that in America, the code, the diagnostic code you have on your health insurance

73
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,240
claim determines how much money you get and what resources and services you get. And it happens

74
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,320
that you get more for autism, thanks to the campaigning of hard-working advocates and parents,

75
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,560
you get more for autism than for a diagnosis, for example, of intellectual disability.

76
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,400
So the very different rates and the very different degrees of change in that inset bar graph

77
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,080
in different States is unlikely to be telling us that actually in Arizona,

78
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,760
there has, in 2006, there was a change in what was in the water so that more people were autistic.

79
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,880
It's much more likely that services have changed, awareness has changed, provision has changed.

80
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,400
And the other thing that helps us to understand the change in the rates of autism, apart from

81
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,240
the broadening of the diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness and understanding

82
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,920
is diagnostic substitution. So as the rates of autism have gone up, the rates of intellectual

83
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:18,880
disability as a sole diagnosis have gone down. So I don't think there's a change in the numbers

84
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,200
of people who are autistic, although I can't prove that, but there are lots of other possible

85
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:32,400
explanations. So that's data from America, and we have that proviso about medical insurance records.

86
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,600
Here's some recent data from the UK. And what I want to highlight are two things.

87
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,400
First, note that these graphs show the percentage increase. It's not the numbers of people with

88
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,800
autism diagnosis. It's the percentage increase over time. So if you start off with very, very

89
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,280
few diagnoses in a particular age group or in, say, females versus males, you will get a big

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,880
percentage increase, even if there are still fewer females being diagnosed than males, for example.

91
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,520
But it's still informative, I think, because it shows that the big increase has been in first

92
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,280
diagnosis in adulthood, over the age of 19, and in women and girls rather than in men and boys.

93
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,400
And the authors of that work, Ginny Rossung and her collaborators at Exeter, conclude from those

94
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:32,960
two facts that they don't think were over-diagnosing autism. Instead, were catching up on people who

95
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,880
have historically been missed. And we'll come back to the catching up in older people a bit later.

96
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,400
A third change in how we think about autism is from thinking about autism as mainly affecting

97
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,520
boys and men to recognizing that autism is relevant for all genders. So in the 1980s,

98
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:03,600
we estimated that perhaps five or 10 times as many males as females warranted an autism diagnosis.

99
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,880
But most of that data was from clinical records or records of who was on the special educational

100
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,000
needs registers. From those records, it looked as if fewer, many fewer girls and women were

101
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,560
autistic compared to males. But when they were autistic, they were more likely to also have

102
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:31,120
intellectual disability. Now, fast forward to the 2020s, and it seems from good meta-analytic

103
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,280
studies that maybe the ratio is three times as many males to females. And that's taking data from

104
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,560
really good epidemiological studies that have gone out into the community and ascertained who

105
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,120
would get autism diagnosis rather than looking at the lists of the people we already know about.

106
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,720
Because if we're missing women or girls, then the lists of people we already know about are not

107
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,160
going to give us a fair estimate. So maybe three times more females than males. And in those

108
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,080
population-based databases, it doesn't seem that women are necessarily more likely to have

109
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,000
intellectual disability. The ratio of three to one seems to be true across the ability spectrum.

110
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,200
So that suggests to me that we have been missing or misdiagnosing women and girls, and particularly

111
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,480
those who are intellectually able. And when you make that comparison of five to one or 10 to one,

112
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,200
when we used to talk about Asperger's syndrome, compared to three to one, I think we're missing

113
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,720
or have historically missed a really large number of women and girls. I'm going to say a little bit

114
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,360
about that. So is there evidence that we're missing or have historically missed women and girls on

115
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,200
the autism spectrum? Well, we know that females are identified or diagnosed on average later than

116
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,200
males. We know that a male and a female individual with the same level of autistic traits, the female

117
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,600
is less likely to get diagnosed. So those are some reasons why we can think that we probably have

118
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,800
missed them. And we then need to say why are we missing them? And I think a large part of this is

119
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,080
that we all carry an unconscious bias and stereotype of autism as being male. Apart from anything else,

120
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,640
most people will have met more autistic males than females, if only because of the historical

121
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,440
underdiagnosis of women and girls. But I think we also carry a lot of unconscious stereotypes.

122
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,560
So the picture here of the lined up cars, and then lined up cuddly toys, if you look at the

123
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,640
lined up cars, you might well think, ah, yes, that's quite autistic, lining things up, enduring,

124
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,000
repetitively lining things up, that could be a sign that this child has high autistic traits

125
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,680
or warrants and autism diagnosis. But then you look at the cuddly toys lined up,

126
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,360
and your first response might be quite different. It might be, ah, how sweet. Maybe she, making an

127
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,840
assumption, maybe she's going to play school and pretend to teach them. And then that doesn't look

128
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,040
autistic at all. But in fact, they're the same behaviors. We're just bringing a sort of gendered

129
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:18,160
lens to them. And in the same way, we know that the kinds of obvious signs of autism that say

130
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,400
primary school teachers might on average look for don't always work to pick up girls on the spectrum.

131
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,640
So you might see a little boy who's autistic, who is quite obvious in the playground, because

132
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,880
while the other boys are playing football, he's just walking the perimeter, pacing the perimeter.

133
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,800
And a teacher will spot that. But a teacher might not spot a girl who is just on the edge of the

134
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,920
social group of girls who are all chatting, who's laughing just a little bit after they're laughing

135
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,440
or looking just a little bit out of place. So the manifestation of autism in girls may also

136
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,880
sometimes look a bit different or not fit our stereotypes. So for example, many people might

137
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:07,040
think that the autistic social style will be to be socially aloof. But in fact, many autistic girls

138
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,600
and many autistic boys as well, are very, very attached to one person, to one child at school.

139
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,720
In fact, I unusually clingy to them. But that doesn't always fit with our stereotype of autism.

140
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,840
Another reason that we may be missing women and girls on the autism spectrum

141
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,240
has to do with diagnostic overshadowing. And of course, this can happen also

142
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,640
with boys and men, but particularly diagnostic overshadowing from

143
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,480
pertinent diagnoses that are more gender sort of stereotyped. So eating disorders is a very good

144
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:50,560
example. And from my colleagues at the IOPPN, we know that around 20 to 30% of women coming to

145
00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:00,640
services for anorexia will, if they're tested for autism, will pass the diagnostic threshold

146
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,920
for an autism diagnosis, even though they've never had that diagnosis before.

147
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,880
You have to be careful about making conclusions because we know that when you're at starvation

148
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,120
weight, that affects your cognition, particularly your social cognition. But I think the evidence is

149
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,960
amassing that when these young women reach a healthy weight, they still have the traits of

150
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,040
autism that would probably be sufficient to have an autism diagnosis. So what's happened

151
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,880
is that perhaps a clinician sees the eating disorder, but doesn't go further to ask,

152
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,320
is this anorexia in the context of autism? And that really matters. My colleagues on the

153
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,040
eating disorder ward told me about, they now have a wonderful pathway for autistic women

154
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,920
and men if they have eating disorders too. But before that, when they were still learning,

155
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,040
they told me about a woman on the ward who, unlike all the other anorexia patients who were

156
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,600
very well turned out, always clean, hair always washed, she was quite disheveled and a bit chaotic.

157
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,760
And nobody wanted to say anything because you don't make negative comments about how someone

158
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,040
looks on an anorexia ward. But somebody talking to her thought, well, maybe this is not just

159
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,720
anorexia, maybe this is autism. And they talked to her. And in fact, she wanted to be given a regime

160
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,920
to have a shower every morning, to wash her hair every three days. She wanted a routine

161
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,800
that was written down. And then she was very happy to stick to the routine. But without structure,

162
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:45,040
she wasn't sure what to do to keep herself clean and well. And similarly, it turned out that her

163
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,200
eating disorder wasn't at all to do with body image concerns. Instead, she wanted to keep her

164
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,600
weight at a particular number, which happened to be a prime number. And it was about interest in

165
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,080
that number and a need for control, which of course is often the case with many people with

166
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,280
eating disorders. But she wanted to control this number. And when it was explained to her that

167
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,680
she could aim for a different prime number that was in a healthy range of weight, she was quite

168
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,480
happy with that, with some counseling around the fact that it's hard to guarantee that you will

169
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,920
always be absolutely on a particular number. But a very different driver for eating disorder,

170
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,080
so very important to know that this was autism as well as anorexia.

171
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:34,320
And another reason why we might miss not only women and girls, but also some men and boys,

172
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,480
has to do with what's been called camouflaging. So many autistic adults and some young people

173
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:48,080
tell us that they work incredibly hard to fit into the neurotypical world, to pass as neurotypical,

174
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,200
usually because they've been bullied or ostracized for their autistic behaviors.

175
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,720
And they will say that, for example, they selected a girl in their class at school or

176
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,760
a woman at work who seems to be socially successful and copy everything about her.

177
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,040
Copy how she dresses, how she does her hair, maybe how she does her makeup, how she talks,

178
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,920
what she talks about. Copy everything to put on a sort of suit of armor to go undiscovered

179
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,040
and not bullied and maybe even accepted and talked to until you can get to that point

180
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:29,280
to develop a friendship. So based on what autistic people have told us themselves,

181
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,640
Laura Hull developed a short questionnaire to measure this sort of camouflaging. And it asks

182
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,960
you things like, how much do you agree with the following statements? I learn how people use

183
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,560
their bodies and faces to interact by watching TV or films. Or when I'm interacting with somebody,

184
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,200
I deliberately copy their body language or facial expressions. And you can answer that you

185
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
disagree or you agree a little or you agree fully and you get a camouflaging score.

186
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,840
Now, camouflaging is important because we know that although it has some advantages that what

187
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,480
autistic people tell us about, like, for example, being able to go to a job interview or striking

188
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,960
up a conversation with somebody you'd like to be friends with, it also has significant costs.

189
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,280
So this graph just shows you some of our work where we found that how much people say they

190
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,840
camouflage is negatively correlated with self-reported quality of life. That's true for both males

191
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,560
and females in this sample. And we also know that autistic people tell us that camouflaging is

192
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:41,920
exhausting. And if you imagine trying to keep up a mask 24 hours a day or all day at school,

193
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,280
it's no surprise that you come home and have a meltdown. And also that it erodes the sense of self.

194
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,280
So an autistic 16-year-old that I was talking to was telling me about her mental health prices,

195
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,280
which had landed her in hospital. And she talked to me about how when she came out,

196
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,360
her friends had really rallied around her. And now she was talking, I was thinking,

197
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,000
that's lovely, that's so nice. And then she said, but of course it's not me, their friends,

198
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,400
were the tool. It's the mask I wear. And so all of that love and affection wasn't reaching her

199
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,320
because she didn't feel that she was her authentic self with her friends. She felt that they were

200
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:25,440
friends with the mask that she wore. And masking and camouflaging has really made me think very

201
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,600
differently about the traditional route of social skills training that for so many years was

202
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,160
absolutely what was assumed to be a good idea for say autistic teenagers.

203
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,320
Do social skills groups tell them what they should be doing and what they're doing wrong?

204
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,280
And if anyone wants to ask about that and do questions, I'm very happy to talk about it.

205
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,840
Autism has also changed from being a childhood condition and really the preserve of child

206
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,720
psychiatrists and pediatricians to being a lifespan condition. We know that people don't

207
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,520
stop being autistic. They don't grow out of autism. Autism is inherent to how they see

208
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,240
the world and how they process the world. And although, as for everyone, we change as we get

209
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,160
older, most autistic people will live most of their lives as adults. And we know from a recent

210
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,880
study of GP records that over the age of 50, nine out of 10 autistic adults are undiagnosed.

211
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,280
So we really are missing and know very little about older age with autistic people.

212
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,400
And it's important to know because we need to know whether the health needs, for example,

213
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:46,080
will be different. The medical records in the States suggest that all sorts of physical illnesses

214
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,880
are worse among those who have an autism diagnosis. Some of that may reflect

215
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,360
lives that are hard, lives that are stressful. And we have one study where we looked in, again,

216
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,320
a population-based cohort at pace of aging. And those individuals who had high autistic traits,

217
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,200
we didn't require a diagnosis because we know over the age of 50 most people aren't diagnosed.

218
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:19,120
But those with high autistic traits had a faster pace of biological aging as well as worse reported

219
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,600
physical health. But a mediation analysis suggested it wasn't the autism that was responsible for

220
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,800
that worse aging outcome, but instead it was the things in between. So social isolation,

221
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,680
poor mental health and anxiety, poor sleep, and poor health behaviors, so not being able to have

222
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,080
a healthy lifestyle, those were the things that led to that faster pace of aging. So there's nothing

223
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,600
fatalistic about, as far as we know, to tell us that autistic people will have a less healthy old

224
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,040
age. But we do know that autistic people, on average, have a less happy life, that's something we

225
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,800
can all change, and a less happy life and being bullied, for example, is for all of us related

226
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:12,960
to poorer mental and physical health. So autism has also changed from us thinking about it as

227
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,920
categorically different from any other diagnosis and from neurotypical development,

228
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,480
to having a much more dimensional approach. So in the old days it would have been, yes,

229
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,000
you get the autism diagnosis, or no, you don't get the autism diagnosis. But people first became

230
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,080
interested when it became clear from twin studies that autism was quite strongly genetic.

231
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,480
People became interested in measuring what they called the broader autism phenotype in the relatives

232
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,760
of diagnosed autistic children or adults, and looking for little signs, gray signs, of autistic

233
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,720
traits in not diagnosed, not autistic relatives, to try and understand the family treats, try and

234
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,160
understand the genetics. And once people started creating measures for autistic traits dimensionally,

235
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,840
you could see that actually in the general population, at least at the behavioral level,

236
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,800
were all somewhere on that continuum. So this is the autism spectrum quotient as perhaps the

237
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,320
best known autism trait measure, which is also freely available and happens to be what nice

238
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,880
recommend as a sort of first screener to know whether it's worth going further on a diagnostic

239
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,920
journey. It's not without its critics, but these are some of the questions that you would be asked

240
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,160
if you used it. You have to say to what extent you agree that I prefer to do things the same way

241
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,520
over and over again. I often notice small sounds when others do not, or you prefer to do things

242
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,800
with others rather than on your own. And that would be reverse scored, expecting that on average,

243
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,400
more autistic people would say they prefer to do things on their own. Although I would

244
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
really emphasize that and counter the myth that autistic people are not sociable. Many autistic

245
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,600
people are highly sociable and many autistic people are absolute extroverts. And also take the

246
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,040
opportunity to counter the myth that autistic people lack emotional empathy because there's

247
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,680
absolutely no evidence for that. Autistic people are empathic with others. They may find it difficult

248
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,200
to read somebody else's mind in the sense of knowing that somebody else might think something

249
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,320
different, but they certainly care about other people's suffering and emotions and so on.

250
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,160
So you can see that if you answer these sorts of trade questions, you get a distribution,

251
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,320
and you can see here from collected studies, the distribution for males on average and females

252
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,800
with the males on average scoring a bit higher.

253
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,640
Now when we think about a dimensional approach to autism, sometimes including some autistic

254
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,680
self-advocates will say, oh no, no, no, you can't be a bit autistic, just like you can't be a bit

255
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:03,680
pregnant. So I think it depends on the level of analysis. So behaviorally, we've just seen,

256
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,800
behaviorally, you can be a bit autistic. You can have a lot of autistic traits or very few

257
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,720
autistic traits or anywhere in between. Of course, sometimes those measures at the behavioral level

258
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,280
are not getting at qualitative differences. So if you were socially anxious, if you had

259
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:27,200
social phobia, you might say you prefer things to do on your own. If you have OCD, you wouldn't

260
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
say you prefer to repeat things over and over, but you might say you tend to repeat things over and

261
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,560
over. So there are other ways you could score up on those behavioral items. If we think about the

262
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,720
genetic level, you can certainly be a bit autistic. So what we know about the genetics of autism

263
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:52,720
from twin studies is that the genetic influences on diagnosed autism are largely overlapping with

264
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:02,240
the genetic influences on subclinical autistic traits. We also know that for most autistic people,

265
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,240
the genetics of their autism is just like the genetics of their and our height. It's a product

266
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,800
of hundreds and hundreds of common alleles, common genetic variants, which we all share,

267
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,520
and some people have more of them and are taller or have more autistic traits,

268
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,320
and some people have fewer of them or a different combination of them

269
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,920
and are shorter or have fewer autistic traits. It's only in a very small minority of autistic

270
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,520
people that a rare mutation that is qualitatively different from what all the rest of us have

271
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,760
seems to be playing a large part in their autism, but for most people,

272
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,360
genetics of autism, just like the genetics of height, and we know that from twin studies.

273
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:52,320
Another way that autism has changed is from thinking of autism as one thing to thinking of

274
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,440
autism as many things. So this is pictures meant to show apples and oranges and one speculation

275
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,840
for why we've actually made rather little progress in understanding the biology of autism

276
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,600
and to some extent the genetics of autism. One hypothesis is that we're mixing apples and oranges

277
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,320
in our studies, that we've actually got a lot of different individuals who all come under this

278
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,800
behavioral umbrella of autism, but have different etiological or biological underpinnings.

279
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,880
So I told you about the genetics, which is again shown here, the very small part of the pie

280
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,240
that is to do with mutations or de novo new events that are different from the general

281
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,160
population and the large part of the pie, where it's just a matter of how many common variants

282
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:49,760
you happen to have. People now talk sometimes not about autism, but the autisms to try to recognize

283
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,120
that there may be this enormous biological, at least heterogeneity within the category that we

284
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:03,520
call autism. Interestingly, despite the search for biomarkers and ways to stratify or cut up

285
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,200
the big autism spectrum, to date there's been very little success and the only real distinction

286
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,600
that carries weight in terms of prognosis, for example, is the difference between autism with

287
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,560
intellectual disability, language difficulties and autism without intellectual disability. Those

288
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,000
two seem to take rather different roads and relate rather differently to the genetic story.

289
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:37,440
Autism, we can also think of as changing from one thing to many in a different sense. So before

290
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,080
I was talking about taking the whole autism spectrum and saying that when you compare one

291
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,240
autistic person to another, they may have very different biological underpinnings or etiologies,

292
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,080
but now I want you to think about just one autistic person. And I want to suggest that in even one

293
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,120
the origins of different characteristics that make up what we call autism may be very distinct.

294
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,120
So traditionally we used to talk about the triad in autism, social differences, communication

295
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,520
differences, rigid and repetitive behaviors. And we used to think of those as three sides of one

296
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,640
thing that was autism. But while it's true that if you go into an autism clinic and you look at

297
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,160
people who have the diagnosis, you will always find that they have all three parts. If you look

298
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,560
in the general population, you'll find that actually those three parts pull apart in a lot of cases.

299
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,080
And indeed in families too, in families where there's an autistic child, you'll quite often find

300
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,280
that great grandfather was an engineer or a proofreader, had an amazing eye for detail,

301
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,120
liked to eat the same lunch every day, was socially just fine. And then there's Aunt

302
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,200
Sonso who was a bit of a hermit who had one or two close friends but really found social very

303
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,200
difficult but wasn't particularly rigid otherwise. So you can see different parts of what's come

304
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,080
together in the autistic child in different parts of the family tree. And in the same way,

305
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,240
when we look at the general population and we were able to do this in the twins early development

306
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,680
study, we found that while there were more than expected by chance, children who had all three

307
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,680
difficulties or differences, there were lots of children who had only one. So there were around

308
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,520
three percent of children who just had social difficulties as rated by their parents, three

309
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,120
percent who had only communication difficulties, four percent who were a bit rigid. And these all

310
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,840
defined as being in the top five percent compared to your peers. So the largest group are those who

311
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,000
have just one area of difference or difficulty, even though when we look at autism, we see everything

312
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,880
coming together. And so we've also found with twin work that these different parts of what we call

313
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:04,240
autism actually have distinct genetic influences. So most of the genetic influence on social skills

314
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,200
and difficulties is not overlapping with the genetic influences on how rigid or flexible you are.

315
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:21,520
And one of the reasons that's helpful to know or propose the hypothesis is that historically we've

316
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,920
tried to look for one explanation at the psychological level to understand all the different facets

317
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,960
of how an autistic person understands the world. But I don't think we need to because if the different

318
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,720
parts of autism have different origins genetically, then why can't the different facets of autism also

319
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,920
have different origins in the processes of the mind? So very briefly, these are three

320
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,680
different explanations for different parts of what we call autism, even in one person.

321
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,640
And I'll just tell you very briefly about them in cases of interest. So the social differences in

322
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,680
autism, which include not a lack of sociability, but a difficulty sometimes in knowing whether

323
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,840
somebody, for example, is joking or lying or being sarcastic, in knowing how to strike up a

324
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,080
friendship, how to say the right thing, how to not say the wrong thing, even if it happens to be the

325
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,320
true thing, those social difficulties are well explained by a difficulty putting yourself in

326
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,600
somebody else's shoes, a difficulty automatically tracking what somebody else is thinking and

327
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,400
knowing. Because we've known for a long time that many autistic children neither tell lies nor

328
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:40,400
understand that others might lie, but telling lies only makes sense if you know that something you

329
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,280
know I might not know, or that you can make me think something that isn't true. But if you don't

330
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,600
understand that minds have different thoughts, if you can't track what others are thinking,

331
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,840
then that's not going to make sense. And that leaves some autistic people very vulnerable

332
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:06,080
and also very honest, which of course can be a wonderful asset. Then we have on the more non-social

333
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,160
side, we know that autism is characterized not only by some difficulties, but also by some assets.

334
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,440
And one aspect of skill in autism is an amazing eye for detail, not every autistic person,

335
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,920
but on average most autistic people have a better eye for detail than the rest of us.

336
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,840
Sometimes that eye for detail makes it hard to get the big picture, to understand the gist,

337
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,720
but still for example in this task which is the embedded figures test, where you have to find the

338
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:43,920
simple shape hidden in the colored more complex shape. For most non-autistic people that's difficult

339
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:49,760
because we see the colored shape as a gist out, we see it as a whole. But autistic people often

340
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,640
describe seeing things as parts and therefore they can easily zoom in on and see where that simple

341
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:03,280
shape will be. And then another aspect of autism seems to be around difficulty with planning and

342
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,440
coping with change. And some of that might be about being very detailed, so even a small what is to

343
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,880
us a small detail change really really matters if that's what you're zoomed in on. But some of it's

344
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,680
also probably to do with what's called executive dysfunction or difficulty in those frontal lobe

345
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,240
functions of planning, monitoring, being flexible in the face of change, dealing with novelty and so

346
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,080
on. And that's often what holds some autistic people back. So working in a university environment,

347
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,240
we have many many students who are autistic and very very smart, but sometimes they struggle when

348
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,920
they come to university in organizing their lives. And it's the organization that really

349
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,320
begins to be a problem for them and the coping with change, the coping with the fact that that

350
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,640
lecture actually is happening somewhere different now and you weren't given any notice and that can

351
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,560
just throw you completely. So another way in which autism has changed is from thinking of

352
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,120
autism and studying autism in its pure form. So there was a fashion for saying well we must only

353
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,080
study autistic people who don't have language problems, don't have intellectual disability,

354
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,360
don't have mental health problems, because then we're studying pure autism. And recognizing now

355
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,360
that pure autism is vanishingly rare and Christopher Gilbert tends to say that pure autism won't come

356
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,880
to the clinic, because if autism is is the only issue or the only characteristic, it's not a

357
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,560
problem. You can find your niche and you can live very well with just autism, but unfortunately

358
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,680
just autism is very rare and most autistic people are battling with a lot of other things.

359
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,120
And it's those other things that make life hard to live, not the autism. And those other

360
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,960
things include epilepsy and intellectual disability, sleep problems. Sleep problems can be an absolute

361
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,240
killer and yet relatively easily treated for many autistic people. Sensory sensitivities can be very,

362
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,760
very difficult and that's one of the things in the workplace, thinking about that report today that

363
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:15,840
where reasonable accommodations are needed. But anxiety and depression, very common ADHD, OCD,

364
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,960
developmental coordination disorder or dyspraxia, those are all very common in autism and can make

365
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,440
life difficult. And even more important for us to recognize, because that lies with society to

366
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,320
address, stigma and bullying, being ostracized, being discriminated against, are all the things

367
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:43,200
that make life hard for autistic people, not the autism. So we know that around 70 or 80 percent

368
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,280
of children and adults on the autism spectrum will have a diagnosed mental health condition and many

369
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,800
will have more than one, with anxiety and depression being among the highest. And we've learned in

370
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,840
recent years tragically that suicide is elevated among autistic people, particularly among women

371
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,960
on the autism spectrum and women who don't have an intellectual disability.

372
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,120
This is from our longitudinal study in again the Twins Early Development study,

373
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,160
where we asked parents about different sorts of difficulties, emotional, so that might be anxiety

374
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:26,000
and depression, conduct problems, hyperactivity and we asked them at age four, seven and thirteen.

375
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,200
And in these diagrams, each horizontal line is one child and if they're in the green, they're okay,

376
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,680
they don't have problems in any of these areas and if they're in the orange, they've got at least one

377
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,360
clinical level difficulty. And we have a comparison group drawn from Ted's where they don't have

378
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,880
autism and you can see that most of those children are in the green at four, a few pick up some

379
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,440
difficulties at seven, some drop difficulties and again by thirteen, most do not have any parent

380
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,720
reported difficulties. And then you could look at the autism group and at four, about 50 percent

381
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,920
already have difficulties in one of these areas and as you go to age seven, more pick them up,

382
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,840
a few drop them but many more pick them up and again at age 13, so you can see the persistence.

383
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,600
And below we've got the co-twins, now autism is highly genetic so many co-twins of autistic

384
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,400
children are autistic themselves but some are not and when you look at the co-twins, you have a

385
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,760
perfect control for the family environment for SES and those other kinds of things that of course

386
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,920
we know affect children's well-being but here you can see that the non-autistic twins in those

387
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:43,120
families where there's an autistic twin are in generally in the green. And this is some work

388
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,640
by Dr Gavin Stewart who I have to also thank for co-authoring the text, the piece of writing which

389
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,160
will be on the Gresham College website to accompany this lecture. And Gavin's been working very hard

390
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:05,840
on aging and autism and he's worked with a long-term aging study which isn't about autism but is

391
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,040
just about healthy aging. If you're over the age of 50, you can sign up for protect and every year

392
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,240
you can do cognitive tasks and answer questions about your well-being. And because we know that

393
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,960
most autistic people over the age of 50 are not diagnosed, we've given an autism trait measure

394
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,360
and we look at those who have high autistic traits. And in this Venn diagram, the size of the

395
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,680
circles shows the relative percentage of people being affected by sleep problems in yellow,

396
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,560
by depression in blue, by anxiety in orange and the overlap between those. And you can see that

397
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,760
sleep problems are much more of a problem for the high autism trait group compared to well-matched

398
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:52,800
peers who aren't autistic and have low autistic traits. And the overlap of those sleep problems

399
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:01,040
with mental health problems is very significant. And I want to tell you briefly about one particular

400
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,600
area of mental health that we think is rather neglected for the autism spectrum and it's

401
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,920
important to be thinking about. So with Freya Rumble who is a clinical psychologist, we've been

402
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,600
speculating for some time now that autistic people might on average be more vulnerable to

403
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:23,360
developing post-traumatic stress disorder. And this is because firstly, we know that autistic

404
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,560
people experience more adverse life events than non-autistic people, bullying I've already mentioned,

405
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,760
but also assault and other kinds of negative life events. We also know that autistic people process

406
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,520
information differently with an eye for detail and one of the individual differences in the

407
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,680
general population that tends to determine whether two individuals who've experienced a traumatic

408
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:55,120
event, which one will go on to develop long-term PTSD symptoms and which one will not, one individual

409
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:01,040
difference of relevance, is how well you can weave your experiences into a coherent story,

410
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,280
a coherent narrative. And if you stay rather fragmented and detail focused, you're more likely

411
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,280
to continue to have symptoms of PTSD. So that detail focus in autism might make them more

412
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,760
vulnerable to develop PTSD symptoms. There are also aspects of sensory processing that are important

413
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:27,360
in PTSD and I've mentioned sensory sensitivities in autism. And lastly, how you cope with the

414
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,680
natural early stages of flashbacks and so on that maybe everyone would have after a traumatic event,

415
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,360
whether you use an avoidant coping style or a more adaptive coping style also determines your

416
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,480
likelihood of developing PTSD. And again, we thought that autistic people who sometimes show an

417
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:51,840
avoidant coping style might be more vulnerable for that reason. So in one study which we did

418
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,840
with autistic adults, we asked autistic adults to take part if they felt something had happened to

419
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:04,720
them that was negative and that still remained with them, that they felt was a trauma. And in

420
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:13,360
this particular study, we had 59 who took part and who reported to us a trauma of a traditional

421
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:21,040
sort. And by that, I mean it would qualify for PTSD diagnosis in the American system, the DSM-5,

422
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,200
where there's a very narrow definition of trauma and it has to involve either witnessing

423
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,160
or being subject to something that is either a serious assault or threat to life.

424
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:41,200
So you can see here that a large proportion of the blue slice of the pie are people reporting

425
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,480
a physical assault, the orange slice of the pie, people reporting a sexual assault

426
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,800
and other qualifying traumas. And we gave these individuals a trauma symptom checklist, a PTSD

427
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,640
checklist. It's not the same as a diagnosis. This was done mainly during COVID, so it's done remotely,

428
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,600
but it's a valid instrument to measure your symptoms of PTSD. And we found that 45% of

429
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:14,240
those autistic adults reported symptoms that were in the clinical range. Now that's a really high

430
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,920
percentage. In general population samples where they report having experienced a traumatic event

431
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:27,760
like a physical assault, around 10% will go on to have persistent PTSD symptoms. So much, much

432
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,840
higher percentage here for the autistic people. But the reason that I showed you a picture of a bus

433
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,040
when I started talking about PTSD and autism is that one of the reasons I got interested in this

434
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:46,400
area was an autistic man telling me about his experience of taking the bus to work every day.

435
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,840
And then one day the bus having to take a detour because of roadworks and him having to get off

436
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,400
the bus in the middle of nowhere. He didn't know whether it was a safe area of London or not. He

437
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,760
didn't know how he was going to get to work. And he was absolutely frightened and distraught. And

438
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,560
after that, not only would he not take that bus to work, he wouldn't take any bus anywhere. And

439
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,000
when he walked past his usual bus stop, he would start re-experiencing that fear and have flashbacks

440
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:22,400
of that event. Now a bus detour would not count in DSM-5 as a trauma, but I think it was clear that

441
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,680
this man was experiencing trauma related mental health problems. So we were particularly interested

442
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,080
in looking at whether autistic people are not only more vulnerable to PTSD, but also develop those

443
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:43,440
symptoms following unusual events that most people might not find traumatic. And so this graph,

444
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,880
this pie chart now shows you for the 59 autistic adults who told us about a trauma that wouldn't

445
00:45:50,880 --> 00:46:02,800
fit DSM-5. So the large blue segment is bereavement. The yellow segment is bullying. And there's a

446
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,400
grey segment which is difficult social situations, having very negative experiences in social

447
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:17,440
situations. And the orange segment after the blue is their own mental health crises. And of these

448
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:25,280
people, again, 43% had symptoms of PTSD past threshold. So it doesn't seem to matter whether

449
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:33,360
what you've experienced is objectively life-threatening. If for you it's traumatic,

450
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:38,000
then for autistic people the rate of PTSD symptoms seems to be alarmingly high.

451
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:46,080
And one more point on autism and mental health before I go to the final change in the concept of

452
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:56,640
autism. So this is data from Miriam Martini working in Stockholm using population registers.

453
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:04,320
And this is data from young people between the ages of 16 and 25, information about psychiatric

454
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:13,760
hospitalization. And the bars are closest to me. The dark bar is autistic boys and young men,

455
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:19,040
then autistic girls and young women, and then their neurotypical peers, male and female.

456
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,800
And you can see the alarmingly high rates of psychiatric hospitalization. And Miriam writes

457
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:35,920
in the paper, by as young as age 25 years, 22% of autistic females and almost 11% of autistic males

458
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,560
compared to less than 4% of their neurotypical peers had been hospitalized for psychiatric

459
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:49,520
difficulties. So really serious level of mental health burden. So the final change from our

460
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,760
understanding of autism is from thinking of autism as a disorder, from very much a medical model

461
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,200
where we would think about, well, what's wrong with the child? Why does the child not understand

462
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,840
the social world? To the neurodiversity lens, to a more social model where we understand that

463
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,440
the difficulties in autism come about from a mismatch between the autistic way of understanding

464
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:22,720
the world and the neurotypical designed environment and expectations. And so instead of the rhetoric

465
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,520
of the past and still sometimes in the states or other countries, how would you save your son from

466
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:34,240
autism? Instead, we would have a much more neurodiversity lens. And like these autism

467
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,040
self-advocates insist that to talk about curing autism would be as inappropriate now as it was

468
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,640
inappropriate when psychiatrists used to talk about curing homosexuality, for example, that

469
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,800
autism is a different way of being in the world, is a neurodivergent condition in the sense that it

470
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:00,480
diverges from the average but is just as valuable and just as valid a way of being and encouraging

471
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,640
that some employers, as we were hearing about in the news today, are specifically employing

472
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,680
autistic people for the many strengths they have, including integrity and a sense of justice and

473
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:20,560
eye for detail, persistence in a task and so on. And this is just to highlight some work by a colleague,

474
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:27,600
Dr. Rebecca Wood, looking at what an inclusive school really means. And for her, that means

475
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,760
that it accepts the neurodivergence of the teachers and the other school staff. So most of us would

476
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,840
think is a school inclusive? Does it have a good attitude towards children, pupils who are autistic,

477
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,880
have ADHD, have dyslexia? But what about the teachers? If the teachers don't feel comfortable

478
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,080
to disclose their diagnosis, then it's not an inclusive school. And of course, there are now

479
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,600
similar projects for autistic police workforce, autistic doctors and so on.

480
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:04,560
So to conclude, autism has changed from narrow to wide with a rise in the diagnoses,

481
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,920
from rare to common, although still underdiagnosed in some groups, from childhood to lifespan,

482
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,600
with much more research needed on aging, from discrete to dimensional and from one thing to many,

483
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,080
from pure to complex, with a real emphasis now on understanding and improving mental health for

484
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:28,240
autistic people. And from disorder to a difference, the challenge now is to hear all voices. The

485
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,200
autistic voice is coming into research, but how do we hear the autistic voice from people who have

486
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,480
intellectual disability, as well as being autistic, for example. And really fascinating to think,

487
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,040
looking forward, what are the implications for the future of autism research and improving the

488
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:58,720
lives of autistic people? Thank you very much. Thank you very much Francesca, that was just

489
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,040
stunning. Unsurprisingly, we have an awful lot of questions, so I'm going to try and

490
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,720
group one or two of them together. There are so many questions, in fact, that we're definitely not

491
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,440
going to be able to cover them today, so I will probably approach you and see if we can

492
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,760
perhaps do what we do sometimes and have a follow-up podcast where we can discuss

493
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,280
the questions which we've not been able to get through. There seems to be a strong correlation

494
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,200
between those who identify as trans or non-binary and who are also autism.

495
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,520
Have you any thoughts of why that might be so? So it's certainly true that among autistic people

496
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:42,240
there are many more who identify with some gender identity other than the traditional binary,

497
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,800
and there seem to be more people who are trans, well, and vice versa. We don't really know why.

498
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,600
There's research going on in that area. There are, you could imagine, lots of theories at

499
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:59,040
different levels, so some would say it's a sort of sociological theory that autistic people are

500
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,040
less conformist and more able to be themselves. And then there are people like Simon Baron Cohen,

501
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,600
who are interested in sex hormones and might have a biological explanation, and I think at the

502
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,960
moment we don't know, but it's now a hot topic, yes. Okay, there are two which are slightly

503
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:23,680
overlap. One is about the way in which the media generate stereotypical perceptions of autism.

504
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,760
One particular question about, do you think shows like Love on the Spectrum are

505
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,560
indirectly fueling that stereotype, and how might we as society respond to that?

506
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,320
So I haven't seen that particular show, but I know that obviously autism is all over the media.

507
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,640
It is very difficult. I mean, one of the things that we need to be aware of is that

508
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,120
research is neglecting that part of the autism spectrum that has intellectual disability,

509
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:59,920
and there's a danger that we also neglect them when we have shows or documentaries

510
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,720
about autism, because it's easier to talk to a autistic person who can talk back,

511
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,520
but that doesn't capture the experiences of everybody. And I think that some parents of

512
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,520
children who have very high support needs and on the autism spectrum feel quite worried or upset

513
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,400
when maybe a celebrity has their adult diagnoses, and they want to say, well, but my child's

514
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:28,000
autism is not like your autism. Their challenge is not like your challenges. So I think it's really

515
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,560
about trying to get all voices heard. I mean, clearly there's some TV programs, including

516
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:38,160
about neurotypical people that are exploitative. And certainly any program I've been involved with,

517
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,840
it's very, very important that autistic or national autistic society, people who have

518
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,560
autistic people's welfare at heart are involved in making sure that that participants really

519
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,760
know what they're participating in, for example. So it's clearly somebody from an academic

520
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,720
background is saying, okay, you've now got a grant of several million pounds,

521
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,960
where are you going to put your money? What would be your next big area of this really large number

522
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,680
of overlapping Venn diagrams, where you think the biggest return on investment might be?

523
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,160
Yes, it's a really hard question. And sadly, I haven't had that problem of being given that

524
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,200
large amount of money. But I mean, I think the one really interesting area that's been

525
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,080
under-recognized are motor difficulties in autism. And that's not just sort of

526
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,640
clumsiness or developmental coordination disorder, but some autistic people will describe that when

527
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,760
they have a sort of shutdown, which can be something like autistic burnout from exhaustion of coping

528
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:40,560
in a neurotypical world, or can be a more short lived sort of shutdown meltdown, that they lose

529
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:47,040
volition, they can't act, they can't speak. And there's also very interesting but very little

530
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,800
research on catatonia sort of freezing among autistic people. And I think that's been really

531
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,160
under-researched. So we've woken up to sensory a bit, although there's still lots more research

532
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,960
needed there. But I think the motor part of the puzzle and in relation to that kind of

533
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,760
freedom of will and volition, I think that is a fascinating future area.

534
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:15,920
There's a growing number of people asking about an American charity like Autism Speaks,

535
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,840
who are pushing the concept of cure in autism still, even after all of this was.

536
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,880
How do you feel about that and do you think it requires challenge?

537
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:35,600
So many years ago, the founder, one of the founders of Autism Speaks, who was a grandfather of

538
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:43,360
autistic young boy with high support needs, came to London and gave a talk where he talked about

539
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:50,800
defeating autism like he had defeated cancer. And that's clearly not acceptable in our views of

540
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,040
autism and in our genuine acceptance of neurodivergence. Autism is not a cancer and autism isn't

541
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,440
something you have, autism is how you are. And that's just a valid way to be as anything else.

542
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,960
So we certainly don't talk about curing autism. We talk about curing anxiety, curing depression,

543
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,280
curing epilepsy, curing gut problems, curing sleep problems. All of these things would

544
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,440
transform the lives of autistic people, but we have no desire to change the autism.

545
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:27,200
Often for parents, when they are sympathetic to the idea of a cure, it's because their child has

546
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,000
intellectual disability, maybe self-induced behavior, maybe a lot of other things. It's not

547
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,080
the autism that's making their life hard, I would say. It's those other things and we should look

548
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,280
for ways to help with other things. Thank you so much. It was fascinating in every respect.

549
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,960
But given you've described so many different behaviors and a spectrum and autistic traits,

550
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:58,080
you're talking about such diversity. I wonder how easy or difficult it is to make a diagnosis

551
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:04,000
and what the procedure would be to diagnose. It's a really interesting question and it goes

552
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
in some sense to the heart of the complexity of autism. So on the one hand, autism can be

553
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,280
one of the diagnoses where clinicians have the greatest agreement and people will talk

554
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,080
slightly flippantly about the receptionist who works in the diagnostic clinic being able to

555
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,240
diagnose somebody as they come through the door by how they're walking and how they greet them.

556
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:33,840
Because autism in its most prototypical form is very, very recognizable. What's difficult is that

557
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,760
when you then have overlays of camouflaging and learned behaviors, or when you have a lot of

558
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,520
intellectual disabilities so that the range of behaviors you can see is not very great,

559
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,200
or when you have additional complexities, so you have autism and a lot of mental health

560
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:55,680
difficulties, then it can be more difficult to distinguish. Absolutely, there's a lot of heterogeneity

561
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,880
within the spectrum. That's definitely true. But also remember that it can be that you start

562
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:08,240
with the same four-year-old who doesn't have much language, is a bit aloof,

563
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:14,800
repetitively lining up toys, grows up to be the math professor who has a lot of language,

564
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:20,000
who has a lot of friends, but he tends to monologue about his own special interests as I'm doing now.

565
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,960
And the same person can transition through different parts of the spectrum.

566
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:31,200
So, in that sense, we can say, yes, they're all part of the same thing, if that makes sense.

567
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,680
I have a grandson who is severely autistic. He's 19 now and has no speech. He's in the

568
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:45,920
States. And one of the procedures that he's been through is something called, I think it's Applied

569
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,360
Behavioral Analysis, if that makes sense. Yes. But it's had, I think, relatively little effect

570
00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:02,080
on his behavior. And the other thing that is perhaps interesting is that recently he had

571
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:08,480
some wisdom teeth removed under anesthetic. And because it's difficult to communicate with him

572
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,880
and tell him not to do things, he severely bit his lip because it was anesthetized, of course,

573
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,680
and nearly went into plastic surgery. Would you have any comments on this sort of thing?

574
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,040
Yes, so that's very difficult, isn't it? And I mean, communication is, without communication,

575
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:33,760
life is so very, very difficult. So, Applied Behavioral Analysis, ABA, for those in the

576
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,280
audience who might not be familiar with it, grew out of the sort of behaviorist tradition of

577
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:48,000
response and punishment to train an animal. So, it was used with the best intentions to help a

578
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,480
child who maybe was just running around the room to settle at a table to begin to be able to learn

579
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,240
something. So, the sitting at the table would be rewarded maybe with a suite. And then other

580
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,560
behaviors would also be rewarded. And in the old days, negative behaviors would be punished.

581
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:09,520
That doesn't happen anymore. But there is a large body of thought, particularly in this country,

582
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:16,560
and particularly among autistic self-advocates, that ABA is not respectful, that it looks too

583
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,640
much like the training of an animal, and it doesn't give people on the autism spectrum

584
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:26,720
a choice in a sense about their behaviors. I do know parents where their child was

585
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,040
just so much all around the room that they needed to find some way that they would sit

586
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,080
long enough to learn something. And to be fair, most parents bribe their children at some point.

587
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:42,560
But I think the level of mechanical teaching makes people feel uncomfortable. And some autistic

588
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:49,040
people have said that they felt they felt damaged by that process. But it is very hard to know how

589
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:55,680
best to try and reach a child who has very, very high support needs. I think that there are more

590
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,600
available alternative communication devices now with iPads and things. There are more ways that you

591
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:08,240
can let a child unlock communication of some sort. And that's so important for the reasons

592
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,400
that you've highlighted that we need to be able to tell people what's going to happen and them

593
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,520
to tell us what's going on with them. And I would just take the opportunity to say,

594
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,920
I'm sure it may not be relevant to your grandson, but for anybody else who has a child of whatever

595
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:30,160
age, with very little language, if their behavior changes suddenly, if they seem very distressed

596
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,800
or violent or self-injurious, please check that they're not in pain. Because we've only recently

597
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:43,200
begun to realize that often that's a symptom of pain. And because the autistic person can't tell us

598
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:49,600
that, for example, they have absolutely crippling constipation, they will express it in some other

599
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,640
way. And that might be by lashing out or it might be by crying or it might be by biting themselves.

600
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,920
So don't forget about pain if somebody's behavior changes when they haven't got any other way of

601
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,720
telling you. But thank you very much for the example. I'm going to take just two more questions so

602
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:11,520
that we can be quite your next. Hello. Firstly, thank you so, so very much. This is a wonderful,

603
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,840
wonderful talk. I was wondering, on one of the slides, you briefly talked about Asperger's

604
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,640
becoming something in the 90s. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that's

605
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,680
developed from perhaps where that came from and how that's seen now in, you know, you're speaking

606
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:33,200
about this wide spectrum. How is Asperger's now viewed in the wider spectrum? I personally,

607
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,960
that was the diagnosis that I had and I know that I've had trouble communicating that with

608
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,200
other people, that that's not something that's necessarily inappropriate way to do it. So I'm

609
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:48,000
wondering how maybe in studies and clinicians are able to communicate that in different ways

610
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,480
and maybe how that also specifically applies to women and girls and different, you know,

611
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,320
more female concepts of special interests and how that translates together. Sorry,

612
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,600
does that make sense? Yes. So I'll try and give a short answer to capture some of those things.

613
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:09,520
So, so Asperger's was introduced as a sort of experimental diagnosis because historically

614
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,800
autism was so much associated with language problems and language delay or even lack of language.

615
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:19,040
So when there were some children who didn't seem to have any language delay and yet had all the

616
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:23,520
other characteristics or autism, people at the time felt we've got to study this. Maybe it's a

617
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:29,440
whole different group. The research that happened after that suggested that it wasn't a whole different

618
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,880
group. It was part of the autism spectrum and not different from autistic people who maybe had a

619
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,520
bit of language delay but had good verbal intelligence later on. So, so in the latest

620
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,320
diagnostic system it's folded into this bigger category of autism spectrum disorder with the

621
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:51,440
expectation that anybody who had an Asperger diagnosis would simply be included in autism

622
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,960
spectrum disorder not have to go and get a new diagnosis. The other piece of the puzzle is that

623
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:04,800
Hans Asperger who of course was working in Nazi dominated Vienna who wasn't a member of the Nazi

624
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:10,400
party unlike all the rest of his department but has it there has been a question over whether he

625
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:18,880
was saving children or whether he was colluding with a process of eugenesis for for a handicapped

626
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,680
children perceived to be handicapped at the time. So that's another reason why people are not so

627
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,320
keen on naming a syndrome after him anymore although I think the full story of his involvement

628
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:36,320
is yet to be uncovered. I just wanted to know in your estimation to what extent do modern lifestyles

629
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:43,280
for example our largely sugar-based diets and our intent tendency to spend a lot more time online

630
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:52,720
impact on autistic people because I've definitely found the the online aspect a lot of autistic

631
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:58,320
people spend a lot of time online and this kind of exacerbates our difficulties with your

632
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:03,680
communication and socialising so just how does that how do how do these things impact in your

633
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:08,560
estimation on lives of autistic people? Thank you it's an interesting question so just I know it's

634
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,120
not your question but just to clarify I don't think that screen time could ever make somebody

635
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:19,920
autistic nor could diet but your question isn't that I know your question is for autistic people

636
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,480
is the increase in screen time and so on more problematic I think I don't think we have the

637
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,000
research to know the research that's being done suggests that autistic people use the

638
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,560
electronic media and so on in the same way for the same purposes enjoyment and so on as non-autistic

639
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:42,480
people and it was interesting talking to my autistic students under lockdown some of whom said

640
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,040
they much preferred meeting online it was much less stressful and they could control their environment

641
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:53,840
whether as you say when you then have to do more face-to-face time it has it become more difficult

642
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,480
that's something I think we still need to study but there's certainly lots and lots of benefits

643
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,920
to the digital world for autistic people one of the things I often think about is

644
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,320
autistic people often are very really good at understanding how systems work in the old days

645
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:15,600
if you were to be an engineer you had to be physically adroit then that was out of reach

646
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:21,600
but now when you can understand a system and do it all on screen wonderfully you've unlocked

647
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:27,040
a beautiful mind that was perhaps had clumsy hands so I think there are lots and lots of

648
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,800
advantages but you're right we should be careful about the downsides for everyone

649
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,680
well it's it's been a privilege being exposed to a beautiful mind I think it was an absolute

650
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,160
delight to hear you talk it was a wonderful lecture thank you very much please join me in thanking

651
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:48,320
Thank you
