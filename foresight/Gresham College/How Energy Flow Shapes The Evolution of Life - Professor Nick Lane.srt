I gave rise to all large complex organisms.

84
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,740
And nobody can agree about what that was,

85
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,220
which I enjoy telling my students because it's a problem for them.

86
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,220
I can highlight where the answer might lie,

87
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,520
but I like to try to get this across to the public as much as possible as well.

88
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
Because we live in a managerial age,

89
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,820
where we try and say what the solution is going to be,

90
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,540
and then we do the research to get to the solution.

91
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,960
That's not how science works.

92
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,280
Y ffact is, we really don't know a great deal about why life evolved the way it actually did.

93
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,840
And I also find it encouraging that some of the greatest biologists and the greatest thinkers of the 20th century can't agree on them, themselves either.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,000
So, Jacques Moner wrote a famous book called Chance and Necessity in 1971.

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,320
I think we probably can.

of any questions about what life is,

164
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,000
is Erwin Schrodinger, the great physicist,

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,840
who wrote a famous book 75 years ago this year, in fact,

And his book was a direct inspiration to Watson and Crick and Rosalind Franklin and the discovery of the DNA double helix.

178
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:01,360
The other thing he talked about though was energy or specifically entropy or what he called negative entropy or neg entropy,

179
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,960

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,340
If you're not familiar with it, it's usually called the universal energy currency.

259
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:30,340
You can think of it as a kind of coin that goes in the slot machine,

260
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,340
and the slot machine does its thing, it's an enzyme, it does a particular job,

261
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,340
you put the coin in, it does its job, you put another coin in, it does its job again.

262
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:46,340
So this is how cells work, they're powered by machines, using effectively the currency, the ATP.

263
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,340
So this idea that it's kind of like a hydroelectric power scheme,

264
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:02,340
came from one of the most brilliant and eccentric Englishmen of the 20th century scientists, Peter Mitchell.

265
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,340
And he put these ideas forward initially in 1961.

266
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,340
This is somewhat before that, that's the late 1940s when he was in Cambridge,

267
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,340
with Jennifer Moyle, who was a lifelong collaborator.

268
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,340
She was, in fact, a brilliant experimentalist.

269
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Mitchell was a brilliant thinker, and rather cac-handed in the lab, I'm told.

270
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,340
And so it was Jennifer Moyle who really did all the experiments,

271
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,340
and Mitchell who did a lot of the thinking, and Moyle herself was brilliant.

272
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,340
She was one of the first women to get a...

273
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,340
Actually, she was not awarded a degree in Cambridge,

274
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,340
they didn't award degrees to women in the 1940s.

275
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,340
But an equivalent, I don't recall what the term is.

276
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:52,340
She had been involved in cracking codes in the war and had been head of some division,

277
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,340
which again was very unusual for a woman to be in that position at that time.

278
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,340
The Nobel Prize went to Mitchell in the end by himself.

279
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,340
There's always arguments about how these things should be apportioned.

280
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,340
I don't know enough about it, but I think if it were today, it would have gone to both of them.

281
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:16,340
And science is really about experiments as much as it is about thinking.

282
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,340
It's the combination of the two.

283
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,340
If it hadn't been for her, experiments Mitchell's ideas would have really come to nothing.

284
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,340
Anyway, but Mitchell was a great thinker,

285
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,340
and he came at these questions about how cell respiration works.

286
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,340
From thinking about bacteria, his real question on bacteria

287
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,340
was how do they keep their insides different to their outsides?

288
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,340
It's a very simple, basic question,

289
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,340
and one of those great questions that takes decades to answer.

290
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,340
He gave a talk in Moscow in 1957 on the origin of life.

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,340
There was a whole conference on the origin of life,

292
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,340
and a lot of the people who were interested in that kind of question at the time were there,

293
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,340
so JD Bernal and JBS Haldane, they're all communists actually,

294
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,340
and they all went to Moscow,

295
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,340
and they were interested in Moscow in a materialist explanation for the world,

296
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,340
which is why a lot of the people who were working on those questions shared this materialist conception.

297
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,340
Mitchell was there, and he was far from being a materialist.

298
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,340
He was quite kind of almost a spiritualist in his outlook,

299
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,340
but he said, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.

300
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,340
From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases

301
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,340
between which dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them.

302
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,340
Virtually every definition of life that you will ever see is going to say,

303
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,340
this is what an organism is, and the environment is something different.

304
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,340
Mitchell really here is saying that the environment and the organism

305
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,340
are two equivalent phases separated by a membrane.

306
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,340
It's a very different perception of what life is.

307
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
If you're thinking about the origin of life,

308
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,340
and you're beginning to think about compartments and phases and things,

309
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,340
this kind of conception makes, to me, a lot more sense.

310
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
It's not a satisfying definition of life,

311
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
but it certainly gives you a different perspective

312
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,340
that on opposite sides of a membrane, which is a millionth of a millimetre in thickness,

313
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,340
you have two phases.

314
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
One is the inside of the cell, the other is the outside of the cell.

315
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
They are different, and the only way they can be different

316
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,340
is if you actively pumping things out or bringing things in,

317
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
and that costs energy.

318
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,340
How do the first cells do it?

319
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
Well, you can see it.

320
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:32,340
The clue is in methane,

321
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,340
so the cows produce massive amounts of methane.

322
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,340
They do it because they harbour particular types of archaea,

323
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,340
so it represents this domain of life called methanogens.

324
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,340
We all have methanogens as well,

325
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,340
especially those of you who can light your own for hot.

326
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,340
So these are methanogens, and what they're doing is

327
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,340
they're taking carbon dioxide and hydrogen

328
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,340
and reacting them together to make methane,

329
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,340
and they're getting all the energy and all the carbon

330
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,340
that they need to grow from that reaction alone.

331
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,340
So the methane is the waste product,

332
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,340
and it's just farted out, I suppose.

333
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:20,340
But you'll all probably be aware that if we could make hydrogen and CO2 react easily,

334
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,340
we could solve a lot of problems in the world.

335
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,340
So we already can split water.

336
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
We can effectively mimic photosynthesis,

337
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,340
split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen,

338
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,340
which is what photosynthesis does.

339
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
We can forget about the oxygen

340
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
or react it directly with the hydrogen,

341
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,340
but nobody's particularly interested in the hydrogen economy.

342
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
It's a difficult thing to do.

343
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,340
If you could react the hydrogen with CO2 and make synthetic gasoline,

344
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
that would solve a lot of problems.

345
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,340
You can strip the CO2 out of the atmosphere,

346
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,340
or at least remain a neutral state,

347
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,340
and you can make the entire plastics industry

348
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,340
and all the energy and so on

349
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,340
can be done from this reaction.

350
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,340
To my knowledge, nobody has succeeded in doing it in an economic way.

351
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Perhaps they have, and they're not telling us.

352
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
But the cells, these methanogens,

353
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,340
they grow from that without any energy input at the door.

354
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,340
So they can make it work economically,

355
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
and it's interesting to wonder how they do it.

356
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
Well, the way they actually do it

357
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,340
is they need a proton gradient across a membrane.

358
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,340
That's to say they're doing exactly the same thing

359
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,340
that we do in our mitochondria.

360
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
They're pumping protons across a membrane,

361
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,340
so on one side they've got a high proton concentration,

362
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,340
the other side they don't.

363
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,340
And they use that, not to make ATP,

364
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,340
they do use it to make ATP, but more importantly,

365
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,340
they use it to power the reaction

366
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,340
between hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

367
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
And this is roughly what the issue is.

368
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Don't worry about this.

369
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,340
If it's going uphill, you have to put energy in.

370
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,340
If it's going downhill, you're getting energy out.

371
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,340
That's really all you need to take home from this.

372
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
But there's two lines on there,

373
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,340
and right at the top you can see it says H-C-H-O.

374
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,340
That's formaldehyde.

375
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,340
So to go from carbon dioxide to methane,

376
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
you have to put energy in for the first couple of steps

377
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,340
to get up to formaldehyde.

378
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
And then it's energetically downhill all the way.

379
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
So that's the problem.

380
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,340
That uphill bit is the difficulty

381
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
with making hydrogen react with CO2.

382
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,340
There's a barrier to their reaction, an energetic barrier.

383
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,340
And what the methanogens do is they lower that barrier

384
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,340
and they lower it by using a proton gradient.

385
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,340
So how do they actually do it?

386
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Well, to think about it is a very good way

387
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,340
to think about the origin of life.

388
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
Because these same conditions,

389
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,340
you find them in a particular type of hydrothermal vent.

390
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
We see natural proton gradients,

391
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,340
barriers between compartments,

392
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,340
lots of hydrogen gas and CO2.

393
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,340
And those cells live in that kind of environment even today.

394
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,340
And so you can begin to think,

395
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,340
well, how would the structure of this environment begin to help?

396
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,340
And it gives us an insight into how they might do it

397
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,340
and also how we might do it.

398
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
So this particular type of vent,

399
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,340
we're only discovered about 15 years ago or so.

400
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,340
Let me just go back to that.

401
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,340
They don't look much like the familiar black smokers

402
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,340
that most people have seen,

403
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,340
belching black smoke out of the top.

404
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
I suppose you could call them white nonsmokers.

405
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,340
There's no smoke coming out

406
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,340
and they carbonate limestone rocks, really, aragonite, in fact.

407
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,340
But they are very active.

408
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,340
And there's no animal life around it in particular.

409
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,340
There are a few fish every now and then,

410
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,340
but they're full of bacteria and archaea

411
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,340
and the kind of cells that live there.

412
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
And this kind of environment,

413
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,340
we're fairly sure would have existed on the early earth as well.

414
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
So the black smokers were not so certain about,

415
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,340
but these type of vents would certainly have been present

416
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,340
four billion years ago on the early earth.

417
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,340
And they were first pointed out by this guy, Mike Russell,

418
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,340
who's a kind of mad geologist.

419
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,340
He's a brilliant scientist,

420
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,340
but he enjoys winding people up, I think.

421
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,340
And some of his ideas...

422
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,340
The origin of life is a really fractured field

423
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,340
and people come in from the background with chemistry, for example,

424
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,340
or a background of geology,

425
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,340
or a background of biology, or a background of genetics.

426
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,340
People come from very different places

427
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,340
and converge on these questions about the origin of life.

428
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,340
So it's not surprising that we don't agree with each other very much.

429
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Often we don't even speak the same language.

430
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,340
I think most people are trying to learn to speak the same language,

431
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,340
but we can't agree even then what the real question is,

432
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,340
because it's a long way to go from simple chemical reactions

433
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,340
to a replicating cell with all of this machinery.

434
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Which bit are you going to focus on?

435
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,340
We're all interested in different aspects of really different problems,

436
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,340
all of which goes under this term, origin of life.

437
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,340
So Mike Russell was talking about these kind of vents

438
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,340
ten years before they were actually discovered.

439
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,340
And the language he used was the language of geochemistry.

440
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,340
And it was really an unfamiliar language

441
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,340
to most chemists working on the subject, or to the biologists.

442
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,340
I struggled a lot with his terms to begin with.

443
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,340
And then they discovered, Deb Kelly in fact,

444
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,340
discovered this lost city vent that I just showed you the picture of.

445
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,340
Ten years after he'd been talking about these vents

446
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,340
as the best setting for the origin of life.

447
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,340
And suddenly he became famous, almost overnight he became famous.

448
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,340
And this was a photoshop job that nature did.

449
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,340
So nature is one of the great science journals.

450
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,340
And they had a feature article on Mike's work

451
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,340
and dressed him up as Erasmus, as the renaissance man.

452
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,340
And they called him nasance man, nasance as in the birth of life.

453
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,340
And he built a reactor at NASA, JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

454
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,340
to try and study these conditions.

455
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,340
And here's a little bit of lost city vent in the background.

456
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,340
He made a number of predictions as to what the important conditions were.

457
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,340
And the key ones really is that they should be very rich in hydrogen gas,

458
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,340
which is true.

459
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,340
And that there should be the walls of the ancient vents,

460
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,340
not the modern ones, but the ancient ones should have contained

461
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,340
catalytic iron sulfur minerals.

462
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
That also seems to be true.

463
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
But the main point that he was talking about

464
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,340
is there were natural proton gradients.

465
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Because you have alkaline fluids, which really don't have many protons.

466
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
They're deficient in protons.

467
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,340
And a relatively acidic early ocean.

468
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Lots of carbon dioxide, full of protons.

469
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,340
And so the two were mingling inside these vents.

470
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,340
And you would have very steep proton gradients within the vents.

471
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
We don't really know how steep.

472
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,340
We don't know a great deal about these vents.

473
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,340
But you can at least imagine how it might work.

474
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Essentially what the methanogens are doing and how, in essence,

475
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:22,340
the proton concentration changes the reactivity of both hydrogen and CO2.

476
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,340
In alkaline fluids, hydrogen is more reactive.

477
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,340
It wants to offload its electrons onto something else.

478
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,340
And in acidic conditions, CO2 is more reactive.

479
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,340
It's going to accept the electrons because it can accept protons

480
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,340
to balance the charges as well.

481
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,340
And so if you've got two channels next to each other,

482
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,340
the CO2 in acid conditions is going to be more receptive

483
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,340
to picking up electrons and protons and becoming an organic molecule.

484
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,340
And if you have hydrogen in an alkaline channel,

485
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,340
it really wants to be rid of its electrons.

486
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,340
And the protons will react with the hydroxide ions to make water,

487
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,340
which is thermodynamically very favoured.

488
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,340
But if they mix, then, of course, you've lost that.

489
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,340
You've lost the structure. You've lost the barrier.

490
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
You don't have a pH difference anymore.

491
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,340
And so you've lost everything. It's the structure that really matters.

492
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
And it's the structure that we have here.

493
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,340
And these minerals that we think you would have found in these ancient vents

494
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,340
in which you find today in methanogens are the ion-sulfur minerals.

495
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,340
And they're semiconducting.

496
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,340
So you could imagine, at least,

497
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,340
that the hydrogen would pass electrons onto this barrier

498
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
and across the barrier onto CO2.

499
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
And that it's equivalent to a cell membrane,

500
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
and it's the same structure as a cell membrane,

501
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
and this is how methanogens might do it.

502
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,340
Well, you could call that a wild bit of imagination,

503
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
or you could call it a hypothesis.

504
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,340
A hypothesis, I think Peter Meddewa said,

505
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,340
is a rash leap into the unknown,

506
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,340
but at least it's testable.

507
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
That's what makes it science.

508
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,340
And so we built a little reactor.

509
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,340
It's a very humble reactor, really,

510
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,340
and it doesn't work very well.

511
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,340
But we've been playing with this for a few years now,

512
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,340
and we've decided that we need to build a better one.

513
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
We need to make it smaller.

514
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,340
We're actually now building a microfluidic version of this,

515
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,340
but I'm only showing you this version for two reasons.

516
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,340
One of them, we can precipitate the right kind of minerals

517
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
inside these little vent structures here.

518
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,340
And the second one is we're trying to simulate the conditions

519
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
where we have hydrogen and alkaline fluids on the inside

520
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,340
with a semiconducting barrier and CO2 in acidic fluids on the other side,

521
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,340
and that should drive the formation of organic matter.

522
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
And this is formaldehyde,

523
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,340
which is the top of that curve that I showed you a few minutes ago.

524
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,340
This is the hard point, so we're not especially interested in formaldehyde,

525
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,340
but if you can make that, you can make anything.

526
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,340
And this is only two hours.

527
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
So under those conditions,

528
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,340
we're seeing a substantial rise in formaldehyde.

529
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,340
The trouble with this is trying to keep the conditions

530
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,340
under any form of control, and so we're trying to do it better.

531
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,340
We've not even published that yet.

532
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
So I'm not going to talk about that,

533
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,340
but I'd like to think what are the consequences,

534
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,340
if, big if, what I'm telling you is true,

535
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,340
that life started in these hydrothermal vents,

536
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,340
and they started there because the structure of these vents

537
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,340
favours the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,

538
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,340
the proton gradients across membranes or across barriers,

539
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,340
because that's still how cells work.

540
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,340
And cells now get their hydrogen from almost anywhere.

541
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,340
So in photosynthesis, it splits water,

542
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,340
and the hydrogen is extracted from water,

543
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,340
and it's cobbled onto CO2 to make organic molecules.

544
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,340
But the basic reaction is hydrogen reacting with CO2

545
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,340
in oxygenic photosynthesis, where the waste product is oxygen.

546
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
But there's other types of photosynthesis.

547
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,340
You can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor.

548
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,340
You take the hydrogen out of it, you leave the sulfur behind,

549
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,340
you cobble it onto CO2,

550
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
or you're growing like a methanogen in the vent.

551
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
The hydrogen is bubbling out of the ground,

552
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,340
you simply cobble it onto CO2.

553
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Life all across Earth is based on the reaction

554
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
between hydrogen and CO2.

555
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
And we go round eating things,

556
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,340
but we're entirely dependent on the primary producers,

557
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,340
the plants and the bacteria,

558
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,340
which are basically reacting hydrogen with CO2.

559
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Hydrogen and CO2 don't react

560
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,340
except under these rather careful conditions,

561
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
where you have structure,

562
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
the same kind of structure that we see in cells.

563
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,340
So how common are those conditions likely to be?

564
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,340
On the early Earth, we think that they would have been

565
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
basically all the way across the sea floor.

566
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Because it's a reaction between rock and water.

567
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,340
So this is, if you imagine this is the sea floor,

568
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,340
and then down beneath in the crust underneath the sea floor,

569
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,340
these green rocks here are rich in minerals like olivine.

570
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,340
So olivine is iron, magnesium rich rock,

571
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
mostly found in the mantle of the Earth today,

572
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:09,340
which is why you don't see so many reactions like this anymore,

573
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,340
but four billion years ago there wasn't really such a difference

574
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
between the mantle and the crust.

575
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,340
So we think these reactions would happen almost everywhere.

576
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,340
The water percolates down to depths of five or six kilometres

577
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,340
beneath the crust, and will react with these rocks.

578
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,340
So if you were to take a lump of olivine

579
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
and put it in a bucket of water,

580
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,340
you'd probably get one bubble in about a week's time.

581
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,340
It's not something, you know,

582
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,340
it's not an experiment you want to do for the kids.

583
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,340
But at the higher temperatures and pressures

584
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,340
down at the bottom of the sea floor,

585
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,340
it really is bubbling with hydrogen gas.

586
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,340
It's a pretty vigorous reaction.

587
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,340
And that's really all it takes.

588
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,340
It's the reaction between water and rock

589
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,340
to produce strongly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen gas.

590
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
It's an exothermic reaction,

591
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,340
which means it's producing heat,

592
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,340
and so these are buoyant warm fluids which percolate back up.

593
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,340
And when they get to the sea floor,

594
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,340
they react with the waters of the ocean,

595
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,340
the minerals in the ocean to precipitate as these vents.

596
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
So the reaction between rock and water is down below the sea floor,

597
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,340
but the vents themselves are up at the sea floor.

598
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,340
So they should happen on any wet rocky planet.

599
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,340
And there's actually quite a lot of lovely suggestions

600
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,340
from across our own solar system that they do happen.

601
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,340
So Mars, there's traces of methane,

602
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,340
thought to be traces of methane on Mars.

603
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,340
Where does it come from?

604
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,340
The wishful thinkers hope it comes from life.

605
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,340
It's possible it does.

606
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,340
But it's more likely that it comes from exactly this same process

607
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,340
of rocks reacting with water.

608
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,340
There is water on Mars still,

609
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,340
mostly frozen and mostly beneath the surface.

610
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,340
But you're likely to produce hydrogen and methane

611
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,340
for exactly the same reasons.

612
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,340
And we see on Enceladus, for example, or Europa,

613
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,340
which are moons, icy moons, with frozen oceans.

614
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,340
But underneath the frozen ocean on Enceladus and on Europa,

615
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,340
it seems that there is a rather large ocean,

616
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,340
larger than the Earth's oceans.

617
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,340
And these plumes that you can see here

618
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,340
are escaping from the surface of Enceladus.

619
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,340
And they are very alkaline, pH 10, or thereabouts,

620
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,340
and rich in hydrogen, gas and methane.

621
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
And so the only thing that we know of,

622
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,340
the only geological process we know of

623
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
that could produce an ocean that was that alkaline

624
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,340
and that rich in hydrogen would be this same process.

625
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,340
It's called serpentinisation,

626
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,340
but it's the reaction between olivine and water

627
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,340
to produce a mineral called serpentinite,

628
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,340
which is why it's called serpentinisation.

629
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
So even in our own solar system,

630
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,340
there are at least three worlds

631
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,340
where this process is actively going on.

632
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,340
And this is really one of the places

633
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,340
that NASA would most like to go to, me too.

634
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,340
And it actually also means,

635
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,340
because of the politics of these situations,

636
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,340
I said nobody can agree about where life actually started on Earth

637
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
or what conditions.

638
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,340
So I'm giving you my partial view.

639
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,340
NASA like this partial view

640
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,340
because NASA want to fly rockets to Enceladus,

641
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,340
and they need a reason why they would want to do that,

642
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,340
a reason that they can give, I suppose,

643
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,340
rather than we just like flying rockets.

644
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,340
And that's their maybe life on Enceladus.

645
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
But that means that these reasons,

646
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,340
these ideas on the origin of life,

647
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,340
talking about serpentinisation and hydrogen

648
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,340
and these particular reactions

649
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
is appealing at the moment to NASA.

650
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
I hope that means they might fund me,

651
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
but probably not.

652
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:47,340
Anyway, so that's within our own solar system.

653
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,340
If we go further afield,

654
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,340
there's been a real drive

655
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
to discover exoplanets,

656
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,340
planets orbiting distant stars.

657
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,340
And there have been projections now

658
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,340
that there should be something in the order of tens of billions

659
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:13,340
of Earth-like wet rocky planets

660
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,340
in the Milky Way alone.

661
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,340
So if that's true,

662
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,340
all of these Earth-like wet rocky planets

663
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,340
should be producing the same kind of vents.

664
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,340
Water is basically ubiquitous.

665
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,340
We can detect oliveene in interstellar dust.

666
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
It's very common,

667
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,340
so most rocky planets would have a fair amount of oliveene in them.

668
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,340
And CO2, again, is common as an atmospheric gas,

669
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,340
certainly in our own solar system.

670
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
So you could imagine that these same conditions

671
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,340
would apply really on a very, very wide scale.

672
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,340
And so life starting elsewhere

673
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,340
may be constrained by the same reasons.

674
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,340
We also require proton gradients across membranes

675
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,340
to get going because the reaction between hydrogen and CO2

676
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
is difficult,

677
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:09,340
and this is a probabilistically simple way of doing it.

678
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:15,340
So if you were to find, say, a thousand life forms in the universe,

679
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,340
would it be carbon-based or not?

680
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,340
Probably it would mostly be carbon-based

681
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,340
because carbon is ubiquitous.

682
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,340
It's extremely good at the kind of complex chemistry

683
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
that needs to be done.

684
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,340
And it comes in a convenient LEGO brick, CO2.

685
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
So you can build large complex molecules

686
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,340
by adding on one brick at a time.

687
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
If you start with silicon,

688
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,340
you're starting with silicon oxide, sand.

689
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,340
Don't try and build with sand.

690
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
You want to build with LEGO.

691
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,340
And carbon dioxide is a LEGO brick.

692
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,340
And so if you were to find a thousand different life forms,

693
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
I would wader a bet that it's going to be carbon-based,

694
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
let's say, 995 times out of a thousand,

695
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,340
and something wild and funky,

696
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
perhaps the rest of the times.

697
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,340
But carbon is so common, so good at what it does,

698
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,340
and so convenient in the forms in which it comes,

699
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:06,340
that it would be very surprising if it wasn't carbon-based.

700
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
But then we've already run into this constraint.

701
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,340
How do you make carbon dioxide react with CO2?

702
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,340
I would say we're likely to find bacteria

703
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,340
many places throughout the universe.

704
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,340
But what about more complex things than bacteria?

705
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,340
I don't know how many people in this room

706
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,340
would get very excited if there were bacteria discovered on Mars.

707
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,340
Most scientists probably would get pretty excited about that.

708
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,340
I don't...

709
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
I really honestly...

710
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Can we have a show of hands just out of curiosity?

711
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,340
How many people here would be excited to find bacteria on another planet?

712
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,340
Pretty much all of you. Great.

713
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,340
Would we find anything more complex than bacteria?

714
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
We need to look back, though,

715
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,340
on what I've accomplished, what I'm suggesting is a set of constraints

716
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,340
that cells anywhere are going to be based on reacting hydrogen with CO2,

717
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,340
and to do it, they're going to need proton gradients across membranes.

718
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,340
And bacteria have remained constrained and haven't changed

719
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
for four billion years in their morphology,

720
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
neither have archaea.

721
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,340
So could it be that they are constrained

722
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,340
by the way that they generate their energy?

723
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Well, I think that's probably the case.

724
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,340
John Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,

725
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,340
and he was at UCL for a period where I am,

726
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,340
so I think a lot of...

727
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,340
It's a great place, UCL, at least in one sense,

728
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,340
in the sense that some of the greatest thinkers and biologists of the 20th century

729
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,340
worked there for a while.

730
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,340
They all left and went to Cambridge or somewhere after a bit,

731
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,340
but for a while they were all there at UCL,

732
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,340
and I think a lot of us walk around these corridors and think,

733
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
oh, JVS Haldane used to walk down here.

734
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I better do something good today.

735
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,340
So Maynard Smith was one of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century,

736
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,340
and he liked calling things that shouldn't happen

737
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
and evolutionary scandal.

738
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
He was scandalised by sex.

739
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,340
Sex really shouldn't happen.

740
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,340
Why wouldn't people not just make clones of themselves instead?

741
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,340
And he spent a lot of his career trying to work out why sex does happen

742
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:18,340
and why most things that make clones of themselves just fall extinct after a period.

743
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,340
I'd like to think, he never actually said that the eukaryotes were an evolutionary scandal,

744
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,340
but I think he would have seen it in those terms.

745
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:32,340
The problem is that all complex life is composed of this one cell type,

746
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,340
this eukaryotic cell.

747
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:39,340
The fact that we all obviously share a common ancestor

748
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,340
because the plants and the animals, if you look at their cells under a microscope,

749
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,340
they're almost indistinguishable in the sense that they all have a nucleus.

750
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,340
They all have lots of membrane systems called the endoplasmic reticulum, for example.

751
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,340
All lysosomes, they all have mitochondria.

752
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,340
You could write page after page in a textbook of things that plants and animals have in common

753
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
at the level of cells,

754
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,340
but fungi have the same things in common as well,

755
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:09,340
and so does an amoeba, or single-celled algae and so on.

756
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:14,340
It's a shockingly long list, and it's quite baffling as to why that would be the case.

757
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:20,340
So traits like sex as well, lots of amoeba, in fact pretty much all of them,

758
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,340
are sexual, it turns out.

759
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,340
For a long time we assumed they weren't because you never really caught two of them together.

760
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,340
But now we know their genomes.

761
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Funnily enough, it's the genomes that give insight into these things.

762
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,340
We can see that all the genes that are required for meiosis,

763
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,340
which is to say the recombination part of sex and the cell division,

764
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,340
we find them all in amoeba.

765
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,340
We find them all in very ancient looking cells.

766
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,340
And there's plenty of evidence, again, from the genomes

767
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:54,340
that they've been recombining genes and changing the structure of the genome continuously.

768
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,340
We know that they're sexual, even if we've never caught them at it.

769
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,340
So this is the scandal then.

770
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,340
All eukaryotic cells share this long list of traits.

771
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Bacteria and archaea just don't do it.

772
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,340
They don't do sex, for example.

773
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:15,340
They pass genes around a bit, they do some recombination,

774
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,340
but they don't fuse cells together, line up whole genomes,

775
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:23,340
cross across genes and then separate up, and bacteria just don't do that.

776
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,340
So the scandal, if all of these traits, and there's hundreds and hundreds of them,

777
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,340
evolve by natural selection, step by step,

778
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,340
and there's no reason to imagine that that didn't happen,

779
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,340
and each of these small steps offered some kind of an advantage,

780
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,340
and again, there's no reason to assume that that's not true,

781
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:48,340
then why is it that none of them evolve in the bacteria or the archaea for the same reasons?

782
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
They really ought to, but they don't.

783
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,340
So you could think of eyes as a nice example.

784
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Lots of creationists say what use is half an eye,

785
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,340
but evolution is full of things that most people would say was half an eye.

786
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,340
And it's exactly as natural selection would predict.

787
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:12,340
There are at least 60 or 70 separate origins of morphologically complex eyes.

788
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
That's not quite true, as I'm putting it,

789
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,340
because a lot of them in animals share a common ancestor

790
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,340
on some kind of a worm that had a light sensitive spot.

791
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,340
But it's partly true in the sense that the octopus eye, for example,

792
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,340
was over here somewhere, and the human eye

793
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,340
have arrived with a camera eye essentially independently.

794
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
It's convergent evolution.

795
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,340
They started from a light sensitive spot,

796
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,340
and independently they ended up with a camera type eye.

797
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,340
There are one or two regulatory genes in common,

798
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,340
but they independently recruited all the rest of the genes.

799
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,340
But then there are, I think, this is Eudlina, an algorithm.

800
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,340
It's got an eye spot.

801
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,340
It's got the same proteins, light sensitive proteins,

802
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,340
rhodopsins in that eye spot that we have in our own eyes.

803
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,340
This is even more amazing.

804
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,340
This is a camera type eye, which you can see the lens,

805
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,340
you can see the retina, you can see a cornea.

806
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,340
That's in a single cell.

807
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,340
That's a single protist, eukaryotic protist.

808
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
The retina is composed of chloroplasts,

809
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,340
just reused for a different purpose.

810
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,340
The lens, I'm not sure what the lens is made of,

811
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,340
but the cornea is made of mitochondria.

812
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Again, they've just been cobbled together

813
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,340
and used for a different purpose,

814
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,340
but it's a camera eye inside a single cell.

815
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,340
My point is this is what natural selection will predict,

816
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,340
that there should be multiple different types of eye

817
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,340
in different environments, different ecological contexts,

818
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,340
different types of eye with different functioning.

819
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,340
We don't see the evolutionary intermediates,

820
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:48,340
but we see ecologically all the different types.

821
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,340
We would expect to see something similar in bacteria.

822
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
We would expect to see some bacteria that have something

823
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,340
that's a bit like a nucleus,

824
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,340
or some that do something a bit like sex,

825
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:00,340
or that can do phagocytosis,

826
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,340
go around and engulf cells and eat them.

827
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:06,340
These are all valuable traits for us,

828
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
so why don't the bacteria do it?

829
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,340
It's not like the eye.

830
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,340
There's a big difference there in what we see around us.

831
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,340
It really boils down to this question that I raised earlier on.

832
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,340
What was happening down this branch of the tree of life

833
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,340
that wasn't happening over here,

834
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,340
and it's not to do with information

835
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,340
because these guys trawl through all the information

836
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,340
and still didn't come out with the answer.

837
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,340
I want to make the point that it's not at the level

838
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,340
of large plants and animals.

839
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,340
The real difference, the real void,

840
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,340
is at the level of single cells.

841
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,340
It's a bog standard alga,

842
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,340
the kind of thing you'd find in any pond in London

843
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,340
or anywhere else, euglina.

844
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,340
Over here is a relatively complex bacterium.

845
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,340
It's actually even got a little compartment inside it,

846
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,340
which some people have said is a bit like a nucleus.

847
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,340
It's not really.

848
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,340
The reason you can't see it well is it's roughly to scale.

849
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,340
You don't need to know what most of these things are in here

850
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,340
to realise that this is a lot bigger and more complicated.

851
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
These are the mitochondria.

852
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,340
This is actually a chloroplast.

853
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,340
You can see the nucleus there,

854
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,340
but it's on a different scale.

855
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,340
The level of complexity in a single cell

856
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,340
has gone out by orders of magnitude

857
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,340
compared to a relatively complex bacterium.

858
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
Not in the biochemistry,

859
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,340
but in this morphological complexity.

860
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,340
It's interesting that if you were to compare

861
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,340
two different eukaryotic cells,

862
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,340
they look rather similar.

863
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,340
This is paramecium, which is a single cell protist,

864
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,340
and this is a pancreatic asinase cell, a human one.

865
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Again, they're roughly to the same scale,

866
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
and most people would look at them and say,

867
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,340
well, they're kind of similar.

868
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,340
In terms of the amount of complexity going on in them,

869
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,340
they're not a world apart.

870
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,340
This is a single cell protist,

871
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,340
and this is part of a multicellular organism.

872
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,340
It's out of curiosity.

873
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,340
Has anyone got any idea how many genes by genes,

874
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,340
protein coding genes, paramecium has?

875
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,340
Any thoughts?

876
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,340
Twice the amount of humans.

877
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Exactly, twice the amount of humans.

878
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,340
40,000 genes.

879
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,340
Now maybe we do lots of additional regulation,

880
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,340
or maybe we're just not very much more complicated

881
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,340
than paramecium.

882
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,340
By most objective measures of complexity,

883
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,340
there's not a great world of difference

884
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,340
between these two types of cell,

885
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,340
in terms of the number of genes,

886
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,340
in terms of the amount of morphological complexity,

887
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,340
in terms of basically the hard wiring of it.

888
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,340
The real difference is between bacteria and single cell eukaryotes,

889
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,340
rather than between single cell eukaryotes

890
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,340
and large multicellular organisms.

891
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,340
I'm going to have to, rather than exploring all the possible options,

892
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,340
I'm going to tell you what I think the answer is.

893
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,340
We could be here all the rest of the week.

894
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,340
Here's a group of cells that are pretty simple,

895
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,340
as eukaryotes go.

896
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,340
This is jardia.

897
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,340
Jardia causes explosive diarrhea,

898
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,340
that anybody who's been walking in the mountains in America,

899
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,340
may have had jardial poisoning.

900
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,340
I never had it,

901
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,340
but when I used to go walking in the mountains in places like that,

902
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,340
I used to be terrified that when I drank from the mountain streams,

903
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
I would get it.

904
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,340
But it doesn't have any mitochondria,

905
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,340
and people thought it didn't do sex either until quite recently,

906
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,340
when it turns out it is sexual,

907
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,340
and it turns out that it does have mitochondria too,

908
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,340
just not as we know them.

909
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,340
It has organelles which derive from mitochondria,

910
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,340
called mitosomes.

911
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,340
It's typical of science as well.

912
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,340
It took 25 years of probably about

913
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,340
at least 15 research groups around the world,

914
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,340
not just with jardia,

915
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,340
but with these others as well,

916
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,340
microsperidia, trichomonas, entomebo, monocircumenoides.

917
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:07,340
These are cells that don't have mitochondria.

918
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:10,340
For a long time, they were thought to be

919
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,340
an evolutionary intermediate, a living fossil

920
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,340
from very early in eukaryotic evolution,

921
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,340
that were given insight into how complex cells evolved.

922
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,340
It turns out they're not.

923
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,340
They're all derived.

924
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,340
They all had far more complex ancestors in the past,

925
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,340
evolved down in complexity to become more like bacteria.

926
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,340
They all have mitochondria,

927
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,340
and it took 25 years of these research groups

928
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,340
around the world to nail that.

929
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,340
The reason it was done, in part,

930
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,340
is because half of them are parasites,

931
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,340
and so they're of medical interest.

932
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,340
As soon as things become of medical interest,

933
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
then people are going to fund you.

934
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,340
If people went to the funders and said,

935
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,340
these are really interesting living fossils

936
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,340
that might give us an insight into

937
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,340
the evolution of complexity,

938
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,340
they're not going to get funded, unfortunately.

939
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:01,340
If you say it causes explosive diarrhea,

940
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,340
where's the checkbook?

941
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,340
So that's what they said.

942
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,340
They said it causes explosive diarrhea,

943
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,340
and they had 20 years of funding,

944
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,340
and they spent it very wisely

945
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,340
on the early evolution of complexity.

946
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,340
We now know that these are actually

947
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,340
not living fossils, but highly derived.

948
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,340
The one thing that we can take away from it

949
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,340
is they all had mitochondria in the past,

950
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,340
and that's important.

951
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,340
It's important, in part,

952
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,340
because mitochondria, as I said at the beginning,

953
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,340
were bacteria once,

954
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,340
and this was made famous by Lynn Margulis.

955
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,340
Margulis, I should say.

956
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,340
She died of a stroke a couple of years ago.

957
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,340
I only met her once,

958
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,340
and I admired her enormously,

959
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,340
but she had a knack of disagreeing

960
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:52,340
with everybody about everything,

961
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,340
including me.

962
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,340
Yes, well, that man is...

963
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,340
She was married to Carl Sagan,

964
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,340
and they divorced after a while.

965
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,340
Before she wrote her famous paper in 1967,

966
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,340
they'd already divorced.

967
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,340
I'd love to have heard their breakfast conversations

968
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,340
between those two, but anyway,

969
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,340
she was the person who really nailed the idea

970
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,340
that mitochondria were bacteria once.

971
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,340
She nailed the idea that chloroplasts

972
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,340
derived from bacteria as well,

973
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,340
and she also argued for a long time

974
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,340
that there were lots of other symbioses,

975
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,340
for example, with spirochetes bacteria,

976
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,340
giving rise to the cytoskeleton

977
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,340
and the flagella and so on.

978
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:34,340
Nobody agrees with her about that.

979
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,340
She was very strong-willed

980
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,340
and disagreed with most people about most things,

981
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,340
but she was bang on for these central ideas

982
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
on the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

983
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,340
and the amount of, I suppose you call it,

984
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,340
hate mail now that she got.

985
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,340
If you read the literature from after her paper in 1967

986
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,340
through into the early 70s,

987
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,340
people did not like these ideas at all,

988
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,340
and they wrote really unpleasant diatribes

989
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,340
in the literature.

990
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,340
You can understand why she became very hardened to abuse

991
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,340
and eventually basically believed everybody else

992
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,340
was wrong apart from her.

993
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,340
She was asked once,

994
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,340
why does she enjoy being so controversial,

995
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,340
and her answer was,

996
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,340
I don't think I'm controversial, I think I'm right.

997
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,340
I'm not even sure she used the word think.

998
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,340
So that's Slim Margulis,

999
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,340
and she nailed that mitochondria derived from bacteria,

1000
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,340
and we still can't really agree

1001
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,340
about exactly which kind of bacteria were they,

1002
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:41,340
but probably something like Rhodobacter that we're seeing there.

1003
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:44,340
So something acquired these bacteria

1004
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,340
that went on to become the mitochondria,

1005
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,340
and again, there's been no agreement

1006
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,340
about what kind of a cell that was until quite recently,

1007
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,340
and this is a place called Loki's Castle,

1008
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,340
which is just off the coast of Norway,

1009
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,340
and a Swedish group have been trawling around

1010
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,340
in the muds underneath there

1011
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,340
and sequencing everything that they found in those muds.

1012
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,340
So we've never even now seen

1013
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,340
what these cells actually looked like.

1014
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,340
This is what's called metagenomic reconstruction.

1015
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,340
So you sequence everything,

1016
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,340
and you try and piece together genomes

1017
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,340
by effectively matching the ends up,

1018
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:24,340
and eventually you put together the genome of these cells.

1019
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,340
There's a certain amount of debate

1020
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,340
about whether there's contamination in there,

1021
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,340
but it looks broadly true,

1022
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,340
and the thing that's really surprising about it is,

1023
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,340
you carry it to here, this is another tree,

1024
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,340
and right next to them,

1025
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,340
so we started out with a Loki archaeata there,

1026
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,340
we're discovered at Loki's Castle,

1027
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:42,340
and since then various others have been found,

1028
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,340
and they've kept going with this Norse theme,

1029
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:46,340
so now we've got all the Norse gods down there,

1030
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,340
we've got the Odin archaeata and the Thor archaeata

1031
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:52,340
and the Heimdal archaeata and so on.

1032
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,340
But the thing which is really plain

1033
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,340
is that you carry it to our branching

1034
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,340
right in the middle of those groups.

1035
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,340
So whatever the host cell was that acquired mitochondria

1036
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,340
was something pretty similar to this,

1037
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,340
and the irony is we don't know what this looks like,

1038
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:07,340
we don't know what kind of a cell it was.

1039
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,340
Some people say it was a primitive phagasite

1040
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,340
that kind of tried to eat things.

1041
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,340
Other people, including me, say,

1042
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,340
oh no, it wasn't, it was an autotrofe,

1043
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,340
it used hydrogen gas.

1044
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,340
I don't think we can really be very sure yet

1045
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,340
what kind of a cell it was,

1046
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,340
but it was probably basically a fairly simple cell.

1047
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:31,340
And so this is another tree,

1048
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,340
which I think is beautiful,

1049
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,340
this is from one of the most, I think, brilliant biologists

1050
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,340
operating today, a guy called Bill Martin.

1051
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:43,340
He also has a knack of winding people up.

1052
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:47,340
And this tree goes back to 1998.

1053
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,340
And it's remarkable for several reasons.

1054
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:53,340
One of them is that it's now more right than it was then.

1055
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,340
So in 1998 when he put this forward,

1056
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:58,340
I think most people must have thought he was bonkers.

1057
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,340
Look down here, we have two separate origins

1058
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,340
from a hydrothermal vent.

1059
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,340
So the bacteria on the archaea.

1060
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,340
I haven't really gone into the details of that.

1061
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,340
When I first heard him say that in 2002,

1062
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,340
I thought he was completely bonkers.

1063
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,340
I now think he was absolutely right.

1064
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,340
I haven't really had time to go into why they would,

1065
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,340
so they share a common ancestor,

1066
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,340
but down inside the vents.

1067
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,340
The other thing which is really clear on here

1068
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,340
is he has a kind of genomic merger going on.

1069
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,340
So genes from the archaea and genes from the bacteria

1070
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,340
are fusing together here to form the eukaryotes.

1071
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,340
And this is a singular endosymbiosis.

1072
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,340
This one is the chloroplasts.

1073
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,340
So this is not really the same as Lynn Margulis

1074
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,340
who had lots of these things going on

1075
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,340
in all kinds of different cell lines.

1076
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,340
This was a singular event that gave rise to eukaryotic cells.

1077
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,340
And later on, the acquisition of chloroplasts

1078
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,340
gave rise to plants, but it didn't change anything really

1079
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,340
about the big structure of eukaryotic evolution.

1080
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Plants are the same type of cells that we have,

1081
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,340
except with chloroplasts added in and a vacuol,

1082
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,340
but we're basically the same.

1083
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:15,340
So Bill has this singular origin of complex life.

1084
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:18,340
Now a lot of people really hate this idea,

1085
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,340
and I think it's in part because we don't really like the idea

1086
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
of freak accidents in science.

1087
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,340
It kind of almost puts itself beyond science.

1088
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,340
We can't study statistically an accident, a singularity,

1089
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:35,340
but you can think about it in a very productive way.

1090
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,340
If this was the origin of the eukaryotic cell,

1091
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,340
and it started something like this,

1092
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,340
this is the only example that we know of

1093
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,340
of bacteria living inside another bacterial cell.

1094
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,340
So there's plenty of bacteria living inside

1095
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,340
our own type of cell, eukaryotic cells,

1096
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:56,340
but it's really rare for bacteria to be inside another bacterial cell.

1097
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,340
This is not a phagocyte.

1098
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,340
It didn't engulf the cell to get in there.

1099
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,340
It's got a cell wall around it.

1100
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,340
It's actually a cyanobacterium,

1101
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,340
and you can see the photosynthetic membranes here.

1102
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,340
So we don't know what they're doing there.

1103
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,340
This actually is an old discovery.

1104
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,340
This is from 1979,

1105
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,340
when they were still called blue-green algae in those days.

1106
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,340
And blue-green algae really refers to eukaryotes,

1107
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,340
so everybody ignored that paper for 20 years

1108
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,340
until it turned out they were actually bacteria

1109
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,340
with bacteria inside,

1110
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:32,340
and so this speaks more about the whole sweep of evolution.

1111
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,340
Why would that make a difference?

1112
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,340
Well, the cells that are living inside,

1113
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,340
they are bacteria.

1114
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,340
They are cells.

1115
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,340
They've got their own agenda.

1116
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,340
They want to grow.

1117
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,340
They want to divide.

1118
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,340
They want to...

1119
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:49,340
There's a lovely quote from Jack Monogh,

1120
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,340
who said that the dream of every cell is to become two cells.

1121
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,340
And so that's what these guys are dreaming about in here.

1122
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,340
They're thinking, how am I going to double?

1123
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,340
And the way that they do it,

1124
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,340
if you imagine a population of bacteria,

1125
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,340
and they're all growing frantically,

1126
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,340
and the speed at which they grow

1127
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,340
depends on the speed at which they can copy their genome

1128
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,340
as much as anything else.

1129
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,340
And so the smaller the genome is, the faster they can grow.

1130
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,340
It tells that if there's something about the environment

1131
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,340
that means they don't need this gene now,

1132
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,340
it's not useful and they lose it, they delete it,

1133
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,340
then they can probably grow a little bit faster

1134
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:33,340
because their genome is just a little bit smaller.

1135
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,340
And over a couple of days, bacteria,

1136
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,340
their growth rate does depend on that kind of factor.

1137
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,340
But then the environment changes again

1138
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,340
and whatever it was that that gene did,

1139
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,340
you need it again now.

1140
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,340
And so they pick it up.

1141
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,340
What bacteria do is they pick up genes

1142
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,340
called lateral gene transfer.

1143
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,340
It's like passing loose change around.

1144
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,340
They acquire it again

1145
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,340
and before you know it, you're back where you were.

1146
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,340
But if you've got a same population of bacteria

1147
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,340
living inside another cell,

1148
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,340
they do the same thing.

1149
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,340
They throw away genes that they don't need.

1150
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,340
Imagine that those genes are for making a cell wall,

1151
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,340
and you're living inside another cell,

1152
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,340
and you don't need a cell wall for protection inside another cell

1153
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,340
or for preventing yourself exploding

1154
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,340
with the difference in pressure between the outside and inside.

1155
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,340
So you lose those genes, you grow a little bit faster,

1156
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,340
you come to dominate the population.

1157
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,340
But so long as the cell doesn't die that you're living in,

1158
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,340
you'll be all right.

1159
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,340
You never need those genes again.

1160
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:33,340
And so there's a tendency for bacterial parasites

1161
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,340
to lose genes and to become simpler.

1162
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,340
And not just bacterial parasites,

1163
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,340
we see the same thing with Jardier and so on.

1164
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,340
And a very nice example is Rickettsia,

1165
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,340
which a few years ago people thought

1166
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,340
was very closely related to mitochondria.

1167
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:51,340
It's probably not so closely related.

1168
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,340
But it's still a beautiful example.

1169
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:58,340
It was the cause of time that wiped out the armies of Napoleon

1170
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,340
on his retreat from Moscow.

1171
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:05,340
And it's spread by these ticks.

1172
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,340
And it's a bacterium.

1173
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,340
Here it is invading a large eukaryotic cell.

1174
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,340
I think it's actually a kidney cell.

1175
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,340
And the one thing about it which stands out

1176
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,340
is it's got a tiny genome.

1177
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,340
It's around about one megabase genome.

1178
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,340
And that's true for all of these things.

1179
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,340
I'm not just hand-waving here.

1180
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:29,340
This is the range of genome sizes of free-living bacteria.

1181
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,340
It goes up to around about 12 megabases now.

1182
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,340
This guy, T. Ryan Gregory, did a lot of work on genome sizes.

1183
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:39,340
And down at this other end,

1184
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:43,340
these are the parasites and the endosymbionts

1185
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,340
and the obligate symbionts.

1186
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:49,340
They're pretty much down at less than one megabase of DNA.

1187
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:51,340
So just for comparison's sake,

1188
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,340
we have 3,000 megabases of DNA.

1189
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:59,340
The largest bacterial genome is 12 megabases of DNA.

1190
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,340
And some large algae, like eudlina,

1191
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:06,340
are up to 100,000 megabases of DNA.

1192
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,340
So we have quite constrained genomes

1193
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:10,340
in comparison with some single cell.

1194
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,340
The largest one is a thing called Amoeba W,

1195
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,340
which was miscountered.

1196
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,340
It was originally 670,000 megabases.

1197
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:21,340
It's come down to 150,000 last count.

1198
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,340
But still, it's very, very substantially bigger

1199
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,340
than our own genome.

1200
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,340
But what happens with these bacteria that live in other cells?

1201
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,340
They lose genes. They become simpler.

1202
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,340
They whittle away.

1203
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,340
And that's what ended up with the mitochondria.

1204
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,340
All these mitochondria that we have

1205
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,340
in millions of billions of copies,

1206
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,340
they all have genomes of their own,

1207
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:49,340
and they're passed on down the maternal line

1208
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,340
from mother to son.

1209
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,340
My kids don't have my mitochondria.

1210
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,340
They have my wife's mitochondria.

1211
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:01,340
It's a very strange arrangement that I won't go into now.

1212
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,340
What it means is that if you want to be bigger,

1213
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,340
more complex and spend more energy,

1214
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,340
it's not just a case of having a larger surface area.

1215
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,340
You've got a whole unit here.

1216
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,340
That unit has some genes, which in some way control respiration.

1217
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,340
It's got the protein building factories, the ribosomes.

1218
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,340
It's a unit, and if you want to expand,

1219
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:21,340
you just make more units.

1220
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,340
You have more mitochondria.

1221
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,340
But it's not just that you're increasing the surface area.

1222
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,340
You've got genomes with each one.

1223
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,340
And that allows you to expand up on a massive scale.

1224
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:33,340
And the person who's, I think, done more on this side,

1225
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,340
again, going back to the early 1990s,

1226
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,340
John Allen has been arguing that they require genes

1227
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,340
to control respiration.

1228
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,340
And still, I would say,

1229
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,340
the majority of the field is not persuaded that he's correct.

1230
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,340
He is correct, I'm sure of that.

1231
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,340
But it takes an awful long time in science

1232
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,340
for sometimes the simplest ideas to catch on.

1233
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,340
Most people just don't really care very much, I'm afraid.

1234
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:00,340
But it's the difference.

1235
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,340
That they can, to become a very large cell,

1236
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,340
you just scale up mitochondria.

1237
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:10,340
So this is a giant bacterium, and there are a few around.

1238
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,340
These little white dots here are the copies of the complete genome.

1239
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,340
So the giant bacteria that do exist,

1240
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,340
it seems that they also need genes to control respiration.

1241
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,340
And this is the edge of the cell,

1242
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,340
and this is the plasma membrane where respiration is taking place.

1243
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:29,340
And they have as many as 200,000 copies of the complete genome.

1244
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:32,340
And each genome is a normal-sized bacterial genome

1245
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,340
with three megabases of DNA in it.

1246
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,340
And this is a eukaryotic cell.

1247
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,340
The blue is the nucleus where it's the main gene depot.

1248
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,340
And all these little, the green spots here

1249
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:47,340
are the mitochondrial DNA.

1250
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:52,340
So there are hundreds or thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA.

1251
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:54,340
So the difference between these two cells

1252
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,340
is not that this cell has an awful lot more DNA than that cell,

1253
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,340
they actually have a similar amount.

1254
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,340
It's that in that case it's got a kind of genomic symmetry.

1255
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,340
There's thousands of copies of the same genome,

1256
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,340
exactly the same genome.

1257
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,340
Whereas here we've got one massive nuclear genome

1258
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:13,340
which is supported energetically by this kind of end point.

1259
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:16,340
Thousands of mitochondrial genomes which have whittled down

1260
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,340
and become smaller and smaller and more and more streamlined.

1261
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,340
So all the mitochondria, effectively,

1262
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,340
it gives us multi-bacterial power without the bacterial overheads.

1263
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,340
And that's what allows all those overheads

1264
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,340
can go into supporting a massive nucleus with full of genes.

1265
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:34,340
At least it's the raw material for natural selection to operate on.

1266
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:36,340
And so we have a kind of genomic asymmetry.

1267
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,340
And to me that's the real difference between bacteria

1268
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,340
and large complex cells.

1269
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
We've got two genomes.

1270
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,340
There isn't such a thing as the human genome,

1271
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,340
there are human genomes, the mitochondrial genome

1272
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,340
and the nuclear genome.

1273
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,340
This is the last slide.

1274
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,340
Why then is complex life so rare?

1275
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,340
Why did it only happen once on Earth?

1276
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:01,340
And would it only happen rarely elsewhere in the universe?

1277
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:05,340
There's a double bottleneck here.

1278
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,340
One of them we have to get bacterium into another bacterial type cell

1279
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:14,340
to break down this issue with membranes and scaling.

1280
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:19,340
So you've got to have cells within cells to be able to scale up.

1281
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,340
But those cells have their own agenda.

1282
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:26,340
You have what's called conflict, levels of selection conflict

1283
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:31,340
that the bacteria inside want to grow fast

1284
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:34,340
and perhaps make their host cell fuse with other cells

1285
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,340
or whatever they want to do.

1286
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,340
The host cell itself wants to keep them under control

1287
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,340
and bleed off the energy

1288
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:41,340
but they don't want them replicating at any old speed.

1289
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,340
Chances of it going wrong is really high.

1290
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,340
And maybe this is why we don't see any surviving intermediates.

1291
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,340
Maybe they all died because it was a pretty dodgy situation

1292
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:54,340
for a long period of time or even a short period of time.

1293
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,340
It's just that this is a long evolutionary distance.

1294
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,340
Regardless of whether what I'm telling you is right or not,

1295
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,340
this long evolutionary distance,

1296
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,340
there are no evolutionary intermediates that have ever been found.

1297
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,340
And so all of this complexity in this type of cell

1298
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,340
and I would like to leave you with this thought,

1299
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:15,340
we have no idea yet at least the difference between ideas

1300
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:17,340
and serious scientific knowledge

1301
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,340
where we can say that there have been experiments done and real data,

1302
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:25,340
how any of this complexity of eukaryotic cells arose.

1303
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,340
And if we want to understand medicine and what goes wrong in our own bodies

1304
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:33,340
and we don't understand why these parts arose in the first place,

1305
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:37,340
what were the evolutionary driving forces that made them evolve,

1306
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:41,340
how can we really understand ourselves and medicine?

1307
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:46,340
And if this starts out with mitochondria in a very simple cell

1308
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,340
with none of that complexity,

1309
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:53,340
the nice thing from my point of view is that perhaps all of this complexity arose

1310
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,340
and the reason that we share such similar cells with plants and with algae

1311
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:01,340
is not that we were all adapting to different external environments,

1312
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:04,340
but we all were adapting to the same internal environment,

1313
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,340
the problem of having cells living inside us.

1314
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:09,340
And it's that that drove all of this complexity.

1315
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,340
And once it became a stable system,

1316
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:15,340
then eukaryotes could spread out and take over the rest of the world.

1317
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,340
And with that, I'd like to say thank you very much.

1318
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,340
This work has been done by many people,

1319
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:26,340
and it's great fun having a lab with so many bright young people coming through it.

1320
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,340
It's an inspiration for me. Thank you very much.
